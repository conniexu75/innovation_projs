https://openalex.org/W1972590376,"Serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) inhibits insulin signal transduction in a variety of cell backgrounds, which might contribute to peripheral insulin resistance. However, because of the large number of potential phosphorylation sites, the mechanism of inhibition has been difficult to determine. One serine residue located near the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain in IRS-1 (Ser307in rat IRS-1 or Ser312 in human IRS-1) is phosphorylated via several mechanisms, including insulin-stimulated kinases or stress-activated kinases like JNK1. During a yeast tri-hybrid assay, phosphorylation of Ser307 by JNK1 disrupted the interaction between the catalytic domain of the insulin receptor and the PTB domain of IRS-1. In 32D myeloid progenitor cells, phosphorylation of Ser307 inhibited insulin stimulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and MAPK cascades. These results suggest that inhibition of PTB domain function in IRS-1 by phosphorylation of Ser307 (Ser312 in human IRS-1) might be a general mechanism to regulate insulin signaling.

Myers M.G. DeGroot L.J. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology, Vol. 1., The Molecular Basis of Insulin Action. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). Acute insulin resistance is mediated, at least in part, by the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are produced during infection, physical trauma, or cancer (2Loddick S.A. Rothwell N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9449-9451Google Scholar, 3Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budvari A. Ellis R.W. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar, 4Yoshikawa T. Noguchi Y. Satoh S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 676-681Google Scholar). Chronic insulin resistance is an inevitable consequence of genetic variation that is exacerbated by aging and obesity and contributes to multiple disorders, including glucose intolerance, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular mortality, infertility and polycystic ovarian syndrome, and type II diabetes (5Maezono K. Osman A. Patti M.E. Cusi K. Pendergrass M. DeFronzo R.A. Mandarino L. Diabetes. 1998; 47 (abstr.): 333AGoogle Scholar,6Kahn B.B. Flier J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 473-481Google Scholar). Insulin resistance alone might not cause diabetes if pancreatic β-cells secrete enough insulin to compensate for reduced sensitivity; however, type II diabetes eventually develops, possibly because hyperinsulinemia itself exacerbates the pre-existing resistance until β-cells eventually fail to compensate (7Kahn B.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 593-596Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular basis of insulin resistance will provide a rational basis for treatment of many related disorders. The insulin signaling system is complex, and a common mechanism to explain the occurrence of acute and chronic insulin resistance is difficult to identify. Mutations in the insulin receptor are an obvious source of lifelong insulin resistance, but they occur rarely and are not the common cause of type II diabetes (8Hani E.H. Suaud L. Boutin P. Chevre J.C. Durand E. Philippi A. Demenais F. Vionnet N. Furuta H. Velho G. Bell G.I. Laine B. Froguel P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 521-526Google Scholar, 9Carboni J.M. Yan N. Cox A.D. Bustelo X.

Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 807-827Google Scholar). Generally, insulin resistance is a consequence of dysregulated insulin signaling that arises from various sources. Nonspecific or regulated degradation of elements in the insulin signaling pathway might cause insulin resistance (12Sun X.J. Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Google Scholar); elevated activity or expression of protein or lipid phosphatases, including PTP1B, SHIP2, and pTen, directly inhibits insulin signals (13Ishihara H.

Covalent modification of the IRS1 proteins by serine phosphorylation is implicated in insulin resistance associated with obesity and trauma. Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is known to be promoted by elevated circulating levels of several metabolites, including free fatty acids, diacylglycerol, fatty acyl-CoAs, ceramides, and glucose (15Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Google Scholar). Moreover, adipose-derived cytokines like TNF-α also stimulate serine/threonine phosphorylation of IRS-1, which inhibits signaling (16Peraldi P. Hotamisligil G.S. Buurman W.A. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13018-13022Google Scholar). One of the branches of the TNF-α signaling pathway involves activation of JNK (17Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Google Scholar, 18Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D.

Med. 1998; 188: 1817-1830Google Scholar). JNK phosphorylates numerous cellular proteins, including IRS-1, IRS-2, Shc, and Gab-1 (20Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar). Previous work has revealed that the major JNK phosphorylation site in rat IRS-1 is located at Ser307 (Ser312 in human IRS-1), which is located on the C-terminal side of the phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain (20Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar). In this report, a yeast tri-hybrid assay revealed that JNK1 phosphorylation of Ser307 inhibits the interaction between IRS-1 and the insulin receptor, providing a rational mechanism to explain, at least in part, the insulin resistance that occurs during trauma and obesity. Phospho-specific MAPK, control MAPK, and phosphoro-specific Akt antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. Control anti-Akt and anti-JNK1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Antibodies against IRS-1, IRS-2, and p85 have been described (21Sun X.J. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E.M. Lane W.S. Pierce J.H. White M.F.

Insulin was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. IGF-1 was a gift from Lilly. TNF was purchased from R&D Systems. IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation site mutants have been previously described (23Myers Jr., M.G. Zhang Y. Aldaz G.A.I. Grammer T.C. Glasheen E.M. Yenush L. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H.

Point mutants for Ser307 and in the JNK-binding domain of IRS-1 were generated using appropriate oligonucleotides with the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method. JNK1 and GST-JIP JNK-binding domain constructs have been described (25Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar, 26Dickens M.

Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Google Scholar). 32D cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% WEHI conditioned medium (as a source of interleukin-3), and 5 mm histidinol and made quiescent by serum starvation for 4 h. 32D transfectants were generated by electroporation and selected in histidinol as previously described (27Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and made quiescent by serum starvation for 12 h. 32D cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm NaVO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by collection on protein A-Sepharose. Lysates and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting and either 125I-labeled protein A or enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham-Pharmacia) and analysis by autoradiography or on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. HEK293 cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 137 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol. GST fusion proteins containing portions of IRS-1 were made by subcloning the indicated residues into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), expressed inEscherichia coli (BL21), and purified using glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). GST fusion proteins (111 pmol) were incubated with 293 cell lysates for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins bound to the GST fusion proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against JNK1. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3-FLAG-JNK1 or pcDNA3 using Fugene-6. Transient transfectants were made quiescent by serum starvation for 12 h and assayed at 36 h. Following stimulation with 10 μg/ml anisomycin and lysis, FLAG-JNK1 was immunoprecipitated with M2 antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C, and immune complexes were collected on anti-mouse agarose (Sigma). FLAG-JNK1 was eluted with FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml) in kinase buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mmdithiothreitol) overnight at 4 °C. Kinase assays were initiated by addition of kinase and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP to baculovirus-expressed insulin receptor in a final volume of 50 μl of kinase buffer. Reactions were terminated after 30 min at 22 °C with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and addition of SDS sample buffer. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, 32P phosphorylation of substrate proteins was examined by autoradiography and Cerenkov counting. PI3K activity assays were performed on IRS-1 immunoprecipitates as previously described (28Uchida T. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 126-138Google Scholar). The yeast MATCHMAKER LexA two-hybrid system reagents were purchased fromCLONTECH. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (Matα,trp1, his3, ura3,6LexAop-LEU2, LYS2) and the pLexA-IR and pB42AD-IRS-1/2 constructs were a generous gift from Thomas A. Gustafson. EGY48 was sequentially transformed with plasmid constructs by the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate method according to theCLONTECH protocol. Transformants were grown on the appropriate SD/glucose-agar plates for 3 days at 30 °C. Four independent colonies were streaked onto SD/glucose agar plates, grown overnight, replica-plated onto SD/galactose/raffinose agar plates, and re-grown for 5 days at 30 °C to induce expression of B42 fusion proteins and to determine interacting partners. EGY48 was sequentially transformed as described above with pLexA-IR, various pB42AD-IRS-1 constructs, and a third plasmid (pDIS) containing various cDNAs. Transformants were grown on the appropriate SD/glucose agar plates for 3 days at 30 °C. Four independent colonies were streaked onto SD/glucose agar plates, incubated overnight, and then replica-plated onto SD/galactose/raffinose agar plates. The plates were immediately replica-cleaned, incubated overnight, replica-cleaned, and incubated at 30 °C for 5 days to promote growth and to induce expression of B42 fusion proteins. IRS-1 of rat or human origin contains many potential serine phosphorylation sites that are thought to play regulatory roles during insulin signaling. One of these sites, Ser307 in rat IRS-1, was originally found to be phosphorylated specifically by JNK. Ser307 was later found to be phosphorylated in IRS-1 isolated from cells and tissues stimulated with TNF-α, insulin/IGF-1, or anisomycin (20Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar, 29Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser307 is interesting because it inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of rat IRS-1. To study the role of Ser307 in insulin signaling, full-length rat IRS-1 or a mutant IRS-1 molecule containing a Ser307→ Ala substitution (A307IRS-1) was stably expressed in 32DIR cells. 32D cells are interleukin-3-dependent murine myeloid progenitor cells that express few insulin receptors and no IRS proteins; overexpression of IRS-1 and the insulin receptor reconstitutes many aspects of the insulin signaling pathway in 32D cells (28Uchida T. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 126-138Google Scholar, 30Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M.F. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates of IRS-1 from 32DIR cells stimulated with insulin or anisomycin were analyzed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies against Ser307(αpS307) and, for comparison, Ser612(αpS612). Before stimulation, both antibodies reacted weakly with IRS-1, indicating that these phosphorylation sites were slightly phosphorylated under the basal conditions (Fig.1A). Anisomycin or insulin strongly stimulated phosphorylation of Ser307 and Ser612, whereas Ser612 was phosphorylated only during anisomycin stimulation (Fig. 1A). As previously shown (20Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar), TNF-α stimulated Ser307phosphorylation more slowly than either insulin or anisomycin (Fig.1B). Thus, Ser307 is a common phosphorylation site for several signaling pathways that was detected specifically by immunoblotting with αpS307. Insulin rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of Ser307 in 32DIR cells (Fig.2A). Ser307phosphorylation was more sensitive to insulin than to IGF-1, owing presumably to the higher expression of recombinant insulin receptor in these cells. Previous results showed that PI3K inhibitors block insulin-stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation (29Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Google Scholar). To determine whether insulin-stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation requires tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1F18 was examined in 32DIR cells. IRS-1F18 lacks 18 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites and fails to bind various SH2 proteins, including p85, Grb2, and SHP2 (23Myers Jr., M.G. Zhang Y. Aldaz G.A.I. Grammer T.C. Glasheen E.M. Yenush L. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4147-4155Google Scholar). Interestingly, IRS-1F18was not phosphorylated at Ser307 during insulin stimulation, whereas it was phosphorylated normally during anisomycin and TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 2B). Insulin-stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation was restored by site-directed mutagenesis that replaced three PI3K-binding sites in IRS-1F18, including Tyr608, Tyr628, and Tyr658. By contrast, restoring the SHP2-binding sites in IRS-1F18 did not promote Ser307phosphorylation. Moreover, deletion of the Grb2-binding motif in IRS-1 did not inhibit insulin-stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Thus, several distinct signaling pathways, including insulin stimulation of the PI3K cascade, converge at Ser307 to mediate negative feedback or heterologous inhibition of IRS-1 signaling to inhibit the insulin response. During experiments in mammalian cells and yeast, the PTB domain of IRS-1 binds to the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor (32Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Google Scholar, 33O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Google Scholar, 34Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Google Scholar, 35Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, this interaction promotes efficient phosphorylation of IRS-1 during insulin stimulation. Since Ser307 is near the PTB domain of IRS-1, phosphorylation of this residue during insulin or TNF-α stimulation might disrupt the interaction between the insulin receptor and IRS-1. To determine whether JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ser307 inhibits binding between the insulin receptor and IRS-1, a yeast tri-hybrid assay was developed to test the effect of JNK1 on the interaction between the insulin receptor (bait) and various IRS-1 constructs (prey). Prior work revealed that the PTB domain couples the IR to IRS-1 in yeast (33O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Google Scholar); however, to validate the tri-hybrid assay, the specific interaction between JNK1 and IRS-1 in yeast was established. Human IRS-1 contains two putative JIP homology motifs between residues 785 and 791 and residues 857 and 863 (residues 780 and 786 and residues 852 and 858 in the rat orthologs) that might specifically bind JNK1 (Fig.3A) (20Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar, 36Yasuda J. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sharma M. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7245-7254Google Scholar). The LXL sequence of this motif in JIP-1 is required for JNK interaction (26Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Google Scholar). To establish which motif interacts with JNK1, various deletion constructs of IRS-1 (prey) were expressed with JNK1 (bait) in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Full-length IRS-1 interacted with JNK1 as revealed by β-galactosidase activity in yeast growing on selective medium, whereas an IRS-1 construct lacking both JIP homology regions did not promote yeast growth (Fig. 3B). IRS-1 constructs retaining residues 516–865 or 822–888, which contain the JIP homology region in the overlapping sequence, promoted growth and β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the JIP homology motif in human IRS-1 between residues 857 and 863 binds to JNK1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. In vitro binding experiments confirmed that the orthologous JIP homology region (RPTRLSL858 motif) in rat IRS-1 binds JNK1. GST fusion proteins containing a portion of rat IRS-1 with intact or mutant JIP homology domains were incubated with 293 cell lysates containing JNK1. JNK1 associated with the immobilized fragments of wild-type IRS-1 (Fig. 3C). However, a Leu852/858→ Gly substitution, but not a Leu784/786 → Gly substitution, abolished the ability of rat IRS-1 to pull-down JNK1 (Fig. 3C). Yeast cells expressing the human insulin receptor (bait) and human IRS-1 constructs (prey) grew efficiently on selective medium, and growth was not inhibited when inactive JNK1 (JNK1APF) or an empty vector was expressed in these yeast cells (Fig. 3D). By contrast, coexpression of active JNK1 prevented growth, suggesting that the IR/IRS-1 interaction was inhibited (Fig. 3D). Substitution of Ser312 for alanine in human IRS-1 (orthologous to Ser307 in rat IRS-1) blocked JNK1-mediated growth inhibition, suggesting that JNK1-mediated phosphorylation of Ser307 is required for the JNK1-mediated disruption of the IR/IRS-1 interaction. Moreover, truncated human IRS-1 composed of residues 45–516, including Ser312 but lacking the JIP homology region, was insensitive to JNK1-mediated disruption of the IR/IRS-1 interaction (Fig. 3D). The insulin receptor did not interact with JNK1 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (data not shown) and was not phosphorylated by JNK1 during in vitro kinase assays using purified insulin receptor and JNK1 (Fig. 3E). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the interaction between the insulin receptor and IRS-1 is inhibited by phosphorylation of Ser307 during association of JNK1 with the JIP homology region of IRS-1. Anisomycin was used to promote phosphorylation of Ser307 in rat IRS-1 and A307IRS-1 to establish the effect on insulin-stimulated PI3K and MAPK cascades. Anisomycin rapidly stimulated Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1, with a half-maximal effect below 100 ng/ml (Fig.4, A and B). By contrast, αpS307 weakly immunoblotted A307IRS-1 before and after anisomycin treatment, confirming that Ser307 was removed from the mutant molecule (Fig. 4,A and B). The residual immunoblotting of A307IRS-1 by αpS307 might reflect cross-reactivity with other phosphorylation sites in IRS-1, such as Ser612. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies as previously described (37Myers Jr., M.G. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Glasheen E.M. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Blenis J. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Diabetes. 1995; 44 (abstr.): 49AGoogle Scholar). Treatment of 32DIR/IRS-1 cells for 30 min with 0.01 or 0.1 μg/ml anisomycin inhibited insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation by 35%, and inhibition reached 45% with 1.0 μg/ml anisomycin (Fig.5A). Low concentrations of anisomycin had no inhibitory effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of A307IRS-1, and inhibition barely reached 15% at 1.0 μg/ml anisomycin (Fig. 5A). The inhibitory effect of anisomycin did not occur through degradation of IRS-1 or inhibition of insulin receptor autophosphorylation (data not shown). However, anisomycin-mediated inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation required a functional JIP homology domain. Mutation of the LXL sequence of the JNK-binding domain of JIP-1 to GXG abrogates JNK interaction (26Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Google Scholar). 2R. J. Davis, personal communication. Inactivation of the JIP homology region by point mutations of the L856SL motif to a G856SG motif completely eliminated the inhibitory effect of anisomycin (Fig. 6). These results confirm that the intact JIP homology region mediates inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, most likely through phosphorylation of Ser307.Figure 6Proteins in whole cell lysates from 32DIR/IRS-1 and 32DIR/GSGIRS-1cells treated with the indicated doses of anisomycin (Aniso) for 30 min prior to stimulation with 10 nm insulin for 5 min were analyzed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (αPY).

White M.F. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 491-500Google Scholar). Consistent with the inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, anisomycin inhibited the binding of p85 to IRS-1 in 32DIR cells; however, the binding of A307IRS-1 to p85 during insulin stimulation was not inhibited by anisomycin (Fig. 5B). In the same dose-dependent manner, anisomycin inhibited insulin-stimulated PI3K activity associated with IRS-1, but had no effect on PI3K activity associated with A307IRS-1 during insulin stimulation (Fig. 5C). Insulin promotes the association of Grb2 with IRS-1 or Shc, which stimulates the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2, as detected by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies (1White M.F. Myers M.G. DeGroot L.J. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology, Vol. 1., The Molecular Basis of Insulin Action. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia2001Google Scholar). In 32DIR cells, analysis of the inhibitory effect of anisomycin on ERK1 phosphorylation was confounded by stimulation of ERK1 phosphorylation by anisomycin and insulin through the Shc pathway in the absence of IRS-1 or A307IRS-1 expression (Fig. 7A). By contrast, ERK2 was phosphorylated only during insulin stimulation of 32DIRcells expressing either IRS-1 or A307IRS-1 (Fig. 7,A and B). Anisomycin completely inhibited insulin stimulation of ERK2 phosphorylation (60% inhibition at 0.1 μg/ml) in 32DIR/IRS-1 cells. By contrast, ERK2 phosphorylation was barely inhibited (20%) at the highest anisomycin concentration in 32D/A307IRS-1 cells (Fig. 7B). These data reveal that phosphorylation of Ser307 inhibits IRS-1-mediated ERK2 phosphorylation. Our results reveal a general mechanism for the negative feedback and heterologous regulation of the IRS-1 branch of the insulin signaling pathway through inhibition of PTB domain function by phosphorylation of Ser307. Previous work established that the interaction in yeast between the insulin receptor catalytic domain and IRS-1 is mediated entirely through the binding of the phosphorylated NPEY motif in the insulin receptor to the PTB domain in IRS-1 (32Craparo A. O'Neill T.J. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15639-15643Google Scholar, 33O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Google Scholar, 39Gustafson T.A. He W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Google Scholar). Based on this prior information, we conclude that disruption of the binding between the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in yeast expressing JNK1 occurs because phosphorylation of Ser307 disrupts PTB domain function (34Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Google Scholar, 35Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Google Scholar). All of the control experiments confirmed this conclusion, including association of the insulin receptor and IRS-1 in yeast expressing a kinase-dead JNK1 construct, association of the insulin receptor and a human IRS-1 mutant (Ser312 → Ala) in yeast expressing a functional JNK1 construct, and association of the insulin receptor and an IRS-1 construct lacking the JIP homology region in yeast expressing JNK1. Although the yeast tri-hybrid assay reveals that Ser307phosphorylation completely abrogates insulin receptor/IRS-1 interaction, the 32DIR cell-based experiments suggest that it inhibits IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by only 50% at best. Previous work revealed that efficient phosphorylation of IRS-1 depends on two N-terminal domains, the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and the adjacent PTB domain (35Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Google Scholar, 40Burks D.J. Pons S. Towery H. Smith-Hall J. Myers Jr., M.G. Yenush L. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27716-27721Google Scholar). Deletion of both the PH and PTB domains completely inhibits phosphorylation during insulin stimulation of 32DIR cells, whereas deletion of either the PH or PTB domain partially reduces tyrosine phosphorylation. Since Ser307 phosphorylation inhibits PTB domain function, persistent coupling mediated through the PH domain might be responsible for incomplete inhibition of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Efficient coupling of IRS-1 to low levels of insulin receptors requires both domains, whereas either the PH or PTB domain is sufficient in cells expressing high levels of insulin receptor. Therefore, in cells with a low number of receptors, Ser307 phosphorylation might play a major regulatory role, whereas Ser307 phosphorylation might be inefficient in cells with a high number of receptors (35Yenush L. Makati K.J. Smith-Hall J. Ishibashi O. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24300-24306Google Scholar). Under the latter condition, more drastic regulatory mechanisms might be required, including degradation of IRS-1. Considerable evidence is largely consistent with the hypothesis that serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor or the IRS proteins inhibits signal transduction. Despite the potential importance of this regulatory pathway, the sites of phosphorylation and the inhibitory mechanisms involved have been difficult to identify. Increased serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is a common finding in insulin resistance and type II diabetes (41Virkamaki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Google Scholar). Serine-phosphorylated IRS-1 inhibits insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor, PI3K activation, glucose uptake, and other insulin-stimulated biological responses (3Hotamisligil G.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Google Scholar). Besides the JNK phosphorylation site at Ser307, IRS-1 contains serine/threonine residues in consensus sequences for many other protein kinases, including casein kinase II, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, Cdc2 kinase, MAPK, and protein kinase B/Akt (21Sun X.J.

Recent reports suggest that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 inhibits its ability to associate with the insulin receptor and to serve as a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation (3Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budvari A. Ellis R.W. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar, 42De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Google Scholar, 45Mothe I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of serine/threonine phosphorylation-based mechanisms of signal inhibition might reveal a molecular basis for insulin resistance that promotes the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. Ser307 phosphorylation promotes general inhibition of IRS-1 signaling, as revealed by reduced activation of both the PI3K and MAPK cascades. This effect does not occur through inhibition of insulin receptor autophosphorylation, but is consistent with reduced coupling between the insulin receptor and IRS-1. Association of p85 or Grb2 with IRS-1 depends on distinct sets of tyrosine phosphorylation motifs that are separated by up to 300 amino acids in the primary sequence. These results are consistent with the general inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation expected during inhibition of PTB domain function by Ser307 phosphorylation. This general inhibition is in contrast to the specific inhibition of p85 association at tyrosine phosphorylation motifs directly adjacent to previously identified inhibitory serine residues (31Delahaye L. Mothe-Satney I. Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4911-4919Google Scholar, 45Mothe I. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11222-11227Google Scholar, 53De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Google Scholar). At least three kinases apparently mediate phosphorylation of Ser307, including a TNF-α/anisomycin-stimulated kinase other than JNK and an insulin/IGF-1-stimulated kinase that is inhibited by wortmannin/LY294002 and requires PI3K activity. We originally thought that JNK might be the common final step that mediates Ser307 phosphorylation downstream of various cytokines, an especially attractive hypothesis since JNK1 binds to IRS-1 (20Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar) and since the JNK-binding region of IRS-1 is required for the inhibition of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by anisomycin. However, some experiments with potential physiological mediators of insulin resistance do not support this hypothesis. Whereas anisomycin and TNF-α stimulate JNK and Ser307 phosphorylation, the MEK kinase inhibitor PD98059 completely inhibits Ser307phosphorylation, with no effect on JNK activity (29Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Google Scholar). Although insulin activates JNK in certain cells, this pathway is not inhibited by wortmannin/LY294002, suggesting that a distinct cascade is involved. Therefore, in addition to JNK, at least two other kinases apparently mediate phosphorylation of Ser307. These kinases might possess the common ability to bind to the JNK-binding domain in IRS-1, although other mechanisms could be involved. In summary, potential mediators of chronic insulin resistance, such as TNF-α and hyperinsulinemia, lead to progressive accumulation of IRS-1 molecules that are phosphorylated at Ser307 and that couple less efficiently to the insulin receptor. Chronic Ser307phosphorylation might also target IRS-1 for degradation or to subcellular compartments inaccessible to the activated insulin receptor. Other IRS proteins, especially IRS-2, might be similarly sensitive to serine phosphorylation. IRS-2 contains a JIP homology region, although a residue analogous to Ser307 does not exist in IRS-2 (20Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar). Nevertheless, IRS-2 is serine-phosphorylated during TNF-α or anisomycin stimulation, which inhibits insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation. Since IRS-1 is essential to sustain compensatory insulin secretion in mice, serine phosphorylation-mediated inhibition might promote both peripheral insulin resistance and β-cell failure. Identification of the phosphorylation sites in IRS-2 that inhibit insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and the kinase specific to those sites is an important target for future mechanism-based drug discovery.

By binding to IAPs, these proteins displace active caspases or prevent IAPs from binding active caspases and thus promote death of the cell. For example, when DIABLO binds to XIAP, it prevents XIAP from binding processed caspase 9 and thus promotes cell death following UV irradiation (7Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P.

HtrA2 is a mammalian homologue of the bacterial heat-inducible serine protease known as HtrA or DegP (21Pallen M.J. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In bacteria, HtrA primarily acts as a molecular chaperone at low temperatures and as a protease that degrades misfolded proteins at high temperatures (22Spiess C. Beil A. Ehrmann M. Cell. 1999; 97: 339-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli HtrA bears two PDZ domains at its C terminus that are involved in substrate recognition. Bacteria lacking HtrA have reduced viability when cultured at 42 °C (23Skorkoglonek J. Wawrzynow A. Krzewski K. Kurpierz K. Lipinska B. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 163: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because of its activities as a chaperone or as a protease, it is thought that HtrA may determine whether misfolded proteins are refolded or alternatively targeted for destruction. Mammalian HtrA2 interacts with XIAP through its processed N terminus, is able to antagonize IAP inhibition of active caspase 3 in vitro, and can overcome XIAP protection of mammalian NT2 cells against UV-induced cell death through both its serine protease activity and IAP binding activity. Expression constructs (pEF BOS) encoding C- and N-terminally FLAG epitope-tagged XIAP (FLAG-XIAP) and N-terminally FLAG-tagged CrmADQMD variant (FLAG-DQMD) have been previously described (3Uren A.G.

A muHtrA2 cDNA fragment with a Kozak initiation site was amplified by PCR from IMAGE consortium clone AA171302 and subcloned into pcDNA3.HA1 vector (kindly provided by Dr. David Huang). The muHtrA2HA fragment from this construct was then subcloned into pEF BOS. Overlap PCR technology was used to generate pEF HtrA2-A144G-HA and pEF HtrA2-A147I-HA mutant constructs. pEF vector encoding C-terminally HA epitope-tagged DIABLO/HtrA2 chimeric constructs and mutants were generated using overlap PCR technology. The DIABLO/HtrA2 chimera comprises the mitochondrial import sequence of DIABLO (amino acids 1–53) fused to the N-terminal Alanine of mature HtrA2 (amino acid 144). The C terminus of HtrA2 is HA epitope-tagged. Where indicated, the N-terminal alanine of HtrA2 has been mutated to glycine (A144G), and/or the catalytic serine residue has been changed to alanine (S306A). A Kozak initiation sequence directs the translation of all constructs. The pEFDIABLOA54G construct was similarly generated using overlap PCR technology. pEF constructs encoding FLAG-tagged XIAP mutants were generated using overlap PCR technology. The D148A construct has already been described (25Silke J. Ekert P.G. Day C.L. Hawkins C.J. Baca M. Chew J. Pakusch M. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L.

The HtrA2 bacterial expression constructs were cloned with PCR using 925 (5′-gctctagattctgtgacctcgggggtcacata-3′), 927 (5′-cagctccgtgagccaagtttccctgatgttcagca-3′), and 924 (5′-cgccagatctaccatggctgttcctgctccgccaccca-3′) and put into a pET 15b derivative. All constructs were verified by digest and sequencing. The human embryonic kidney carcinoma cell line 293T was grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% glutamine and was transiently transfected with different mammalian expression constructs using polyethyleneimine as described (26Boussif O. Lezoualch F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar) or EffecteneTM (Qiagen, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was visualized by co-transfection with pEGFP (CLONTECH). Where indicated, cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf serum 24 h prior to harvest. Mammalian NT2 cells were transfected as previously described (8Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). In brief, six-well plates were seeded 24 h prior to transfection with 1 × 105 NT2 cells/well. They were transiently transfected with 0.25 μg pEF expression constructs plus 0.025 μg of pEGFP/well using Effectene (Qiagen). Cells were lysed in a Triton X-100-based lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h, and the nuclear and cellular debris was cleared by centrifugation. Immunoprecipitations were performed using FLAG-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) M2 covalently coupled agarose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3, and then neutralized with 110 volume of 1 m Tris, pH 8. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE or two-dimensional immobilized pH gradient (IPG)/SDS-PAGE (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described (27Ji H. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Burgess A.W. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were examined by Western blot analysis or autoradiography following transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C-Extra; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). mAbs used for Western blots were anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), anti-HA High Affinity 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), HtrA2-specific polyclonal antiserum (a kind gift of Dr. Emad Alnemri), cytochromec-specific mAb (7H8.2C12; Pharmingen), and anti-mouse DIABLO mAb 9H10 (Alexis). Proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences) following incubation of membranes with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. For large scale preparation of XIAP-interacting proteins, FLAG-tagged XIAP was immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected 293 T cells by passing the lysate through a column of anti-FLAG antibody covalently coupled to agarose beads. Following extensive washing, FLAG-XIAP and co-immunoprecipitating proteins were eluted from the column using acid glycine (100 mm, pH 3) and then neutralized with a final concentration of 100 mm Tris, pH 8. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional IPG/SDS-PAGE as described (27Ji H. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Burgess A.W. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 605-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and detected by staining of the gel with Coomassie Phast-gel Blue R (Amersham Biosciences). Protein spots of interest were excised and digested in situ with 0.5 μg of trypsin (28Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 599: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar,29Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (model LCQ; Finnigan, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with a capillary HPLC, Hewlett-Packard model 1090A modified for capillary chromatography (28Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 599: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), was used for peptide sequencing. The 150 × 0.20-mm inner diameter capillary column used in this study (Brownlee RP-300; 7-μm C8) was fabricated using a polyvinylidene difluoride end (28Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 599: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Moritz R.L. Eddes J.S. Reid G.E. Simpson R.J. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 907-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A linear 60-min gradient (flow rate, 1.4 μl/min) from 0 to 100% B was used, where solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid in 60% (v/v) acetonitrile. The electrospray ionization parameters were as follows: spray voltage, 4.5 kV; sheath and auxiliary gas flow rates, 5 and 30 (arbitrary values), respectively; capillary temperature, 150 °C; capillary voltage, 20 V; tube lens offset, 16 V. The sheath liquid used was 2-methoxyethanol (99.9% HPLC grade) delivered at a flow rate of 3 μl/min. The electron multiplier was set to −860 V. The ion trap automatic gain control parameter was turned on for all experiments, and this, coupled with a maximum injection time of 200 ms, ensured that the number of ions in the trap was automatically maintained at a constant preset value. All data were collected in centroid mode using a “double play” experiment. After the acquisition of a full mass spectrometry (MS) scan (350–2000 Da) in the first scan event, the most intense ion present above a preset threshold of 1 × 105 counts was isolated. In the second scan event, collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) of the selected ion was performed. The collision energy for the MS/MS scan events was preset at a value of 55%. The sequences of uninterpreted collision-induced dissociation spectra were identified by either 1) de novo sequencing (i.e. manual interpretation of amino acid sequences via the elucidation of β- and y-type ion series (30Roepstorff P. Fohlman J. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1984; 11: 601-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar)) or 2) the correlation with the peptide sequences present in the nonredundant protein sequence data base (OWL version 29.0) using the SEQUEST algorithm (version C1) incorporated into the Finnigan BIOWORKS™ software (version 1.0). The SEQUEST search results were assessed by examination of the Xcorr (cross-correlation) and δCn (δ normalized correlation) scores. The Xcorr function measures the similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the data base and the fragment ions observed in the MS/MS spectrum. The δCn score is obtained by normalizing the Xcorr values to 1.0 and observing the difference between the first- and second-ranked amino acid sequences. As a general rule, an Xcorr value of greater than 2.0 and a δCn greater than 0.1 was accepted as a positive identification. Manual inspection of each spectrum was performed to confirm the SEQUEST result. Recombinant XIAP was produced as previously described (25Silke J. Ekert P.G. Day C.L. Hawkins C.J. Baca M. Chew J. Pakusch M. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3114-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, GST-XIAP protein was produced in E. coli transformed with a vector encoding GST-XIAP (pGEX-6P-3 XIAP) and was affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose. XIAP was released by incubation of the resin with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) in release buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, pH 7) overnight at 4 °C. Recombinant mature DIABLO and mature HtrA2ΔPDZ were similarly generated in bacteria but with a C-terminal Hex-His tag. The proteins were purified on Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) and released using imidazole release buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, 300 mmNaCl, 250 mm imidazole). Recombinant mature HtrA2-FLAG was bacterially expressed and purified using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel. HtrA2-FLAG was released using 100 mm glycine (pH 3) and immediately neutralized with 100 mm Tris, pH 8. The purity of all proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining of the gel with Coomassie Blue, and protein concentrations were estimated by comparison with proteins of known concentration. Active caspase 3 was detected by cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AMC (Bachem). Caspase 3 (17 ng) was incubated in 1 × caspase cleavage buffer (0.05m HEPES, pH 7.5, 5% PEG4000, 0.05% CHAPS) in the presence or absence of XIAP (600 ng), mature recombinant DIABLO (500 ng), mature HtrA2ΔPDZ (200, 500, or 2000 ng), or BSA (500 ng) in a final volume of 45 μl. All sample mixes were equalized with imidazole release buffer, with these buffers contributing 10 μl of the final volume, respectively. Caspase 3 was added last to the mix after XIAP had been allowed to preincubate with IAP antagonists on ice for 15 min. The mixes were incubated for a further 15 min on ice after the addition of the caspase. The substrate DEVD-AMC was then added to a final concentration of 25 μm, and fluorescent emission, indicating substrate cleavage, was determined at 37 °C with 1-min intervals on a fluorimeter (Tecan) using excitation and emission filters of 360 and 465 nm, respectively. The proteolytic activity of purified bacterial mature HtrA2-FLAG and HtrA2ΔPDZ was detected by incubating different amounts of the HtrA2 proteins with 1.2 μg of β-casein (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris pH 8. Where indicated, HtrA2 was preincubated with an excess of XIAP for 15 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of β-casein. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp.), and β-casein was visualized using an anti-milk antibody (Accurate). The teratocarcinoma cell line NT2 was grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2% glutamine. Stable NT2 lines expressing FLAG-XIAP, Bcl-2, or LacZ have been previously described (8Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J.

Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were left untreated or UV-irradiated (50 J/m2) and then returned to the incubator for 6 h before cell viability was assessed. Harvested cells were incubated with biotinylated annexin V (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) followed by incubation with Streptavidin-Tricolor (Caltag). GFP-positive cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for annexin V positivity as a measure of dead cells. Stable NT2 lines expressing FLAG-XIAP, Bcl-2, or LacZ have been previously described (8Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J.

Cells were left untreated or UV-irradiated (50 J/m2), and membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared 3 or 6 h post-UV using digitonin (8Ekert P.G. Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 12Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L.

Briefly, NT2 cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 cells/10-cm plate and were UV-irradiated (50 J/m2) 0, 3, or 6 h prior to harvest as indicated. The cells were scraped off the plate and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. They were then suspended in 200 μl of digitonin lysis buffer (0.025% digitonin in 250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 10 min, a brief centrifugation (2 min, maximum speed Eppendorf centrifuge) was performed, and the supernatant was removed (cytosolic fraction). The remaining pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), lysis was allowed to proceed for a further 30 min, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The supernatant comprising the membrane fraction was retained. The presence of HtrA2 and cytochromec in the different fractions was established by Western blot analysis with HtrA2-specific polyclonal antiserum (a kind gift of Dr. Emad Alnemri) or cytochrome c-specific mAb (7H8.2C12; Pharmingen). NT2 cells were transiently transfected with pEFHtrA2-FLAG. 24 h post-transfection, the cells were initially incubated with MitoTracker Red (Molecular Probes) for 15 min before fixing and staining of the cells with anti-FLAG and a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody. Confocal microscopy images were obtained in the green and red channels, and the images were overlaid to demonstrate the level of localization of HtrA2 in the mitochondria. 293 T cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding murine XIAP with a carboxyl-terminal FLAG epitope tag (FLAG-XIAP). FLAG-XIAP immunoprecipitates prepared from35S-labeled cell lysates were examined by two-dimensional IPG/SDS-PAGE. As previously observed (12Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M.

We previously detected an interaction of XIAP with DIABLO (protein spot 4) in mammalian NT2 cells stably expressing low levels of N-terminally FLAG-tagged XIAP. In immunoprecipitates of XIAP from a newly generated NT2 cell line stably expressing higher levels of FLAG-XIAP, protein spot 2 could also be detected (Fig.1B). To identify protein 2, cellular lysates prepared from 40 × 15-cm Petri dishes of 293T cells transiently transfected with FLAG-XIAP were passed through a column of anti-FLAG antibody-coupled agarose beads. After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with acidic glycine and separated by two-dimensional IPG/SDS-PAGE (Fig.1C). A Coomassie-stained spot corresponding to protein 2 was extracted from the gel and subjected to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (Fig. 1D). The peptide sequences recovered were used to search DNA data bases using TFASTA and TBLAST. Highly significant matches were found with human and mouse sequences, identifying spot 2 as human HtrA2/Omi (AF020760), a recently described mammalian homologue of the E. coli heat shock-inducible serine protease HtrA (19Faccio L.

Human HtrA2, a 458-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 49 kDa and a pI of 9.5, possesses a putative transmembrane domain, a conserved serine protease domain, and a single C-terminal PDZ domain. Two overlapping murine IMAGE consortium expressed sequence tag clones (accession numbers AA171302 and AA498607) were obtained from Research Genetics that together encompass a 1630-bp cDNA encoding a 458-amino acid protein with a predicted mass of 49.4 kDa and pI of 9.7 (Fig. 1E). The peptide regions identified by mass spectrometric analysis of protein 2 correspond to sequences encoded by this cDNA. An apparent allelic variation in the mouse protein occurs at position 449 that can be either threonine (AA171302) or leucine (AA498607). Mouse HtrA has 85"

In the splice isoforms lacking exon 10, this process is facilitated by the formation of β-structure around the hexapeptide motif PHF6 (306VQIVYK311) encoded by exon 11. We have investigated the structural requirements for PHF polymerization in the context of adult tau isoforms containing four repeats (including exon 10). In addition to the PHF6 motif there exists a related PHF6* motif (275VQIINK280) in the repeat encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 10. We show that this PHF6* motif also promotes aggregation by the formation of β-structure and that there is a cross-talk between the two hexapeptide motifs during PHF aggregation. We also show that two of the tau mutations found in hereditary frontotemporal dementias, ΔK280 and P301L, have a much stronger tendency for PHF aggregation which correlates with their high propensity for β-structure around the hexapeptide motifs.

This applies to inappropriately processed amyloid protein or hyperphosphorylated tau protein in Alzheimer’s disease, huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine tracts in Huntington’s disease, prion protein with altered conformations in Creutzfeld-Jacob’s disease, or accumulated α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, or mutated tau-protein in certain frontotemporal dementias, among others (1Lansbury Jr., P.T.

There is a debate on whether the aggregates per se are detrimental to the cells because the extent of aggregation, visible by postmortem autopsy, does not always correlate with the severity of the disease. In the case of transgenic mouse models, removal of aggregates by vaccination or gene regulation has been shown to reverse the pathological effects of protein aggregation (6Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W. Gordon G. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hu K. Huang J. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee M. Liao Z. Lieberburg I. Motter R. Mutter L. Soriano F. Shopp G. Vasquez N. Vandevert C. Walker S.

It is therefore of major interest to understand the pathway of abnormal protein aggregation in the brain and to find methods to prevent it or at least to slow it down.Despite the diversity of proteins involved in the diseases, the process of aggregation appears to rest on a remarkably uniform principle, the formation of intermolecular β-sheets by locally unfolded segments of the polypeptide chain (for review see Ref. 8Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). The proteins tend to aggregate into fibers such that the β-strands run roughly perpendicular to the fiber axis. This “cross-β” structure can be recognized by fiber x-ray diffraction (9Harada M.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, the fibers can be stained with dyes that interact preferentially with β-sheets, such as Congo Red, thioflavine S, and others, a fact that can be exploited for neuropathological diagnosis.In the case of tau aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease, the recognition of the principles of aggregation was complex. First, tau is an unusually hydrophilic protein, containing many polar and charged residues, and remains in solution even after heat and acid treatment (12Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 13Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12241-12245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This slowed down the attempts to find conditions for aggregation in vitro and for studying the nature of the fibers. Certain buffers, certain domains of tau, and certain cofactors were necessary to make the aggregation process experimentally accessible. Thus, the repeat domain aggregates more readily than full-length tau (14Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); this domain also forms the core of Alzheimer PHFs1 (15Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thogersen H.C. Edwards P.C. Runswick M.J.

A second problem was to monitor tau aggregation in real time and in solution, rather than just by electron microscopy; this has been overcome by fluorescence or light scattering assays (22Friedhoff P.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). But perhaps the biggest conceptual obstacle was the realization that tau had very little if any tendency to form ordered secondary structure, as seen by spectroscopic or x-ray scattering methods (12Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 24Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with its hydrophilic nature. The CD spectra of both soluble and aggregated tau were dominated by a random coil pattern. X-ray fiber patterns of aggregates isolated from Alzheimer brain showed some component with cross-β-structure (10Kirschner D.A. Abraham C. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), but this could have been caused by minor contributions from amyloid fibers, and later studies with Alzheimer fibers or recombinant aggregated tau did not reproduce the result (24Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Giannetti A.M. Lindwall G. Chau M.F. Radeke M.J. Feinstein S.C. Kohlstaedt L.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2427-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). It was therefore unclear whether the aggregation of tau was based on β-sheet formation or some other structural principle.The puzzle was partially answered recently when it was realized that a small fraction of tau, the hexapeptide motif PHF6 (306VQIVYK311), is capable of inducing tau aggregation via formation of a β-sheet interaction (26von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5129-5134Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). For intact tau, the increase in β-structure during aggregation is minor, which explains why the structures of PHFs made from whole tau are still dominated by the random coil conformation. However, the shift toward β-structure becomes visible with smaller constructs, such as the repeat domain or shorter peptides, because here the β-structure occupies a larger fraction of the protein. These results, however, left open the issue of the different tau isoforms. Alzheimer PHFs contain a mixture of all six isoforms of tau in the central nervous system (27Delacourte A. Defossez A. J. Neurol. Sci. 1986; 76: 173-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,28Jakes R. Novak M. Davison M. Wischik C.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2725-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The repeat domain is involved in binding to microtubules (together with the flanking domains, Fig. 1); the repeats also form the core of PHFs that may contain either all four repeats (R1, R2, R3, and R4; Fig.1) or only three (R1, R3, and R4 (29Lee G. Cowan N. Kirschner M. Science. 1988; 239: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 30Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Potier M.C. Ulrich J. Crowther R.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 393-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar)). The assembly-promoting hexapeptide motif PHF6 lies in repeat R3, and the earlier results had been obtained with tau domains and peptides lacking R2. The open question was, therefore, whether 4-repeat tau would obey similar principles of aggregation. In addition, because the extra repeat R2 can modify the rate of aggregation in different ways, depending on aggregation conditions (16Schweers O. Mandelkow E.M. Biernat J. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8463-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21King M.E. Gamblin T.C. Kuret J. Binder L.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we asked how the two hexapeptide motifs would interact with each other. In the present study we show that 4-repeat tau isoforms contain another hexapeptide motif, similar to PHF6, which promotes β-structure formation and aggregation.A second open question was the role of tau mutations of frontotemporal dementias (FTDP-17). Most of the known mutations affect the C-terminal domain around the repeats, either because they change the splicing pattern (affecting the relative amount of 3-repeat versus 4-repeat tau) or because they introduce point mutations (for review see Ref. 31Hutton M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 920: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because the repeat domain participates both in microtubule binding and in PHF aggregation, one can argue that the disease-causing effect of the mutations could be a change in either of these functions (for review see Ref. 32Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 110-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Previous experiments had shown that point mutations tended to accelerate PHF aggregation in vitro, and two mutations had a particularly pronounced effect, P301L and ΔK280 (23Gamblin T.C. King M.E. Dawson H. Vitek M.P. Kuret J. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6136-6144Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Barghorn S. Zheng-Fischhofer Q. Ackmann M.

Because these two mutations were near or in the assembly-promoting hexapeptide motifs, we suspected that the mutations could increase the propensity for β-sheet formation and aggregation. We show that this is indeed the case. In fact, the tendency of the ΔK280 for β-sheet formation is so strong that one can achieve aggregation of the repeat domain within minutes, and the mutant ΔK280 is able to polymerize even in the absence of the polyanionic cofactors commonly used to promote aggregation. These features might explain the toxic effect of these mutants in frontotemporal neurodegeneration. Pathological protein aggregation is increasingly recognized as a common denominator underlying a variety of diseases, especially in diseases of the brain where the disposal of non-functional components and the regeneration of cells is slow or absent. This applies to inappropriately processed amyloid protein or hyperphosphorylated tau protein in Alzheimer’s disease, huntingtin with expanded polyglutamine tracts in Huntington’s disease, prion protein with altered conformations in Creutzfeld-Jacob’s disease, or accumulated α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, or mutated tau-protein in certain frontotemporal dementias, among others (1Lansbury Jr., P.T. Kosik K.S. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R9-R12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 2Wanker E.E. Biol.

There is a debate on whether the aggregates per se are detrimental to the cells because the extent of aggregation, visible by postmortem autopsy, does not always correlate with the severity of the disease. In the case of transgenic mouse models, removal of aggregates by vaccination or gene regulation has been shown to reverse the pathological effects of protein aggregation (6Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W. Gordon G. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hu K. Huang J. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee M. Liao Z. Lieberburg I. Motter R. Mutter L. Soriano F. Shopp G. Vasquez N. Vandevert C. Walker S.

It is therefore of major interest to understand the pathway of abnormal protein aggregation in the brain and to find methods to prevent it or at least to slow it down. Despite the diversity of proteins involved in the diseases, the process of aggregation appears to rest on a remarkably uniform principle, the formation of intermolecular β-sheets by locally unfolded segments of the polypeptide chain (for review see Ref. 8Dobson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 329-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1691) Google Scholar). The proteins tend to aggregate into fibers such that the β-strands run roughly perpendicular to the fiber axis. This “cross-β” structure can be recognized by fiber x-ray diffraction (9Harada M. Isersky C. Cuatrecasas P. Page D. Bladen H.A. Eanes E.D. Keiser H.R. Glenner G.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1971; 19: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 10Kirschner D.A. Abraham C.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 309: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In addition, the fibers can be stained with dyes that interact preferentially with β-sheets, such as Congo Red, thioflavine S, and others, a fact that can be exploited for neuropathological diagnosis. In the case of tau aggregation in Alzheimer’s disease, the recognition of the principles of aggregation was complex. First, tau is an unusually hydrophilic protein, containing many polar and charged residues, and remains in solution even after heat and acid treatment (12Cleveland D.W. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 227-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 13Lindwall G. Cole R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12241-12245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This slowed down the attempts to find conditions for aggregation in vitro and for studying the nature of the fibers. Certain buffers, certain domains of tau, and certain cofactors were necessary to make the aggregation process experimentally accessible. Thus, the repeat domain aggregates more readily than full-length tau (14Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar); this domain also forms the core of Alzheimer PHFs1 (15Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thogersen H.C. Edwards P.C. Runswick M.J.

Aggregation can be enhanced when tau is dimerized by oxidation (14Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J.

https://openalex.org/W2132197535,"White adipose tissue and liver are important angiotensinogen (AGT) production sites. Until now, plasma AGT was considered to be a reflection of hepatic production. Because plasma AGT concentration has been reported to correlate with blood pressure, and to be associated with body mass index, we investigated whether adipose AGT is released locally and into the blood stream. For this purpose, we have generated transgenic mice either in which adipose AGT is overexpressed or in which AGT expression is restricted to adipose tissue. This was achieved by the use of the aP2 adipocyte-specific promoter driving the expression of rat agt cDNA in both wild-type and hypotensive AGT-deficient mice. Our results show that in both genotypes, targeted expression of AGT in adipose tissue increases fat mass. Mice whose AGT expression is restricted to adipose tissue have AGT circulating in the blood stream, are normotensive, and exhibit restored renal function compared with AGT-deficient mice. Moreover, mice that overexpress adipose AGT have increased levels of circulating AGT, compared with wild-type mice, and are hypertensive. These animal models demonstrate that AGT produced by adipose tissue plays a role in both local adipose tissue development and in the endocrine system, which supports a role of adipose AGT in hypertensive obese patients."

To examine the physiological role of the AE1/CAII interaction, anion exchange activity of transfected HEK293 cells was monitored by following the changes in intracellular pH associated with AE1-mediated bicarbonate transport. AE1-mediated chloride/bicarbonate exchange was reduced 50–60% by inhibition of endogenous carbonic anhydrase with acetazolamide, which indicates that CAII activity is required for full anion transport activity. AE1 mutants, unable to bind CAII, had significantly lower transport activity than wild-type AE1 (10% of wild-type activity), suggesting that a direct interaction was required. To determine the effect of displacement of endogenous wild-type CAII from its binding site on AE1, AE1-transfected HEK293 cells were co-transfected with cDNA for a functionally inactive CAII mutant, V143Y. AE1 activity was maximally inhibited 61 ± 4% in the presence of V143Y CAII. A similar effect of V143Y CAII was found for AE2 and AE3cardiac anion exchanger isoforms.

CO2 diffuses out of cells into the blood stream and into erythrocytes, where it is hydrated by cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (CA).1 The resulting membrane-impermeant HCO3− is exported into the plasma by the plasma membrane Cl−/HCO3− anion exchanger (AE1), thus increasing the blood capacity for carrying CO2. Upon returning to the lungs the process is reversed; HCO3− is transported into the erythrocyte in exchange for Cl− by AE1 and dehydrated by CA, and the resulting CO2 diffuses across the erythrocyte and alveolar membranes to be expired from the body.

Rev. 1967; 47: 595-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). However, CAII accounts for the majority of carbonic anhydrase activity in human erythrocytes since it has a higher turnover rate (106 s−1) (20Maren T.H. Physiol. Rev. 1967; 47: 595-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar) and CAI-facilitated hydration of CO2 is inhibited by 92% in physiological concentrations of Cl− (80 mm) (21Maren T.H. Rayburn C.S. Liddell N.E. Science. 1976; 191: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the erythrocyte contains ∼106 of the CAII isoform (22Tashian R.E. Carter N.D. Adv. Hum. Genet. 1976; 7: 1-56PubMed Google Scholar), which is stoichiometric with AE1 copies (1.2 × 106/erythrocyte) (2Steck T.L. Fairbanks G. Wallach D.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2617-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 23Ship S. Shami Y. Breuer W. Rothstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1977; 33: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Effective Cl−/HCO3− anion exchange in erythrocytes is dependent on the activity of cytosolic carbonic anhydrase (24Maren T.H. Wiley C.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1970; 6: 430-440PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cousin J.L. Motais R. Sola F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 253: 385-399Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Jacobs M.H. Stewart D.R. J. Gen.

Several lines of evidence show an interaction between CAII and AE1. Binding of erythrocyte membranes to CAII has been show to increase its enzymatic activity (28Parkes J.L. Coleman P.S. Arch/ Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 459-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This interaction is weak, however, because the bulk of carbonic anhydrase can be readily removed from isolated erythrocyte membranes (29Randall R.F. Maren T.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 30Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Reaction of an anion transport inhibitor (DIDS) with AE1 altered the binding of a fluorescent inhibitor to carbonic anhydrase, suggesting a physical link between these two proteins (31Kifor G. Toon M.R. Janoshazi A. Solomon A.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 134: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Extracellular lectin caused agglutination of AE1 and a similar redistribution of CAII on the cytosolic surface of the erythrocyte membrane (30Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggesting a physical interaction of AE1 with CAII. CAII can be co-immunoprecipitated with solubilized AE1, and finally, a sensitive microtiter assay showed that CAII but not CAI interacts with the carboxyl terminus of AE1 (30Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Truncation and point mutation of the AE1 carboxyl terminus led to the identification of the binding site of CAII in human AE1 as LDADD (amino acids 886–890) (32Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Binding assays also showed that CAII interacts with the carboxyl-terminal region of AE2 (32Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but interaction between AE3 and CAII has not yet been examined. The interaction between AE1 and CAII is pH-dependent (30Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which suggested binding of the acidic LDADD motif of AE1 with a basic region of CAII. Truncation and mutagenesis of the basic amino-terminal region of CAII showed that it forms the AE1 binding site (33Vince J.W. Carlsson U. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13344-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Replacement of basic residues in the amino terminus of CAII with the equivalent residues in CAI resulted in a loss of AE1 binding (33Vince J.W. Carlsson U. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13344-13349Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Truncation of the CAII amino-terminal region also resulted in loss of binding ability but did not impair enzymatic activity, implying that the function of the basic amino-terminal domain is to bind CAII to AE1 or other proteins with similar acidic binding motifs. In this study we tested the functional consequences of the AE1/CAII interaction. Our hypothesis was that this interaction facilitates the coupling of CAII enzymatic activity and anion exchange activity, resulting in more efficient bicarbonate transport. Using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with AE1 cDNA, we determined that inhibition of endogenous CAII activity with acetazolamide resulted in a decrease of AE1 transport activity. Mutation of the AE1 LDADD acidic binding motif to LAAAA or LNANN caused a loss of CAII binding and also a decrease of AE1 transport activity. Binding of functionally inactive V143Y CAII mutant (34Fierke C.A. Calderone T.L. Krebs J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11054-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) had a dominant negative effect on anion transport. Overexpression of V143Y CAII also caused a reduction of AE2 and AE3 cardiac transport activity. This first demonstration of a functional interaction between CAII and AE3cardiac leads us to conclude that binding of CAII to the carboxyl terminus of AE proteins is required for maximal transport activity. The requirement of a physical interaction between CAII and AE1 for maximal bicarbonate transport activity suggests that the AE1·CAII complex forms a functional transport metabolon, a physically associated complex of proteins in a sequential metabolic pathway (35Srere P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 109-110Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 36Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). ECL chemiluminescent reagent, donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and Hyperfilm were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Poly-L-lysine and nigericin were from Sigma-Aldrich. Molecular Probes BCECF-AM was from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Ontario, Canada). Glass coverslips were from Fisher. Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin and streptavidin-agarose were from Pierce. Sheep anti-human carbonic anhydrase II antibody was from Serotec (Raleigh, NC). Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Donkey anti-sheep conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from BioCan Scientific (Mississauga, Canada). Human AE1 cDNA (a generous gift of Drs. A. M. Garcia and H. Lodish) was inserted into theHin dIII and Bam HI sites of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). AE1 was mutated in the CAII binding site (886LDADD to LNANN and LDADD) using theCLONTECH transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit and oligonucleotide primers from ACGT Corp. (Toronto, Canada). The mutations were confirmed using an Amersham Biosciences T7 sequencing kit. A construct for expression of wild-type human CAII was prepared by digestion of pACA containing the CAII cDNA with Xba I at the 5′ end and Eco RI at the 3′ end. TheXba I-Eco RI fragment was then cloned intoXba I/Eco RI-digested pRBG4 vector to yield pJRC36 (37Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). An expression construct for the V143Y CAII mutant called pDS14 was constructed by the same strategy using V143Y cDNA supplied by Dr. Carol Fierke (34Fierke C.A. Calderone T.L. Krebs J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11054-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The construct was verified by DNA sequencing performed by the Core Facility in the Department of Biochemistry, University of Alberta with an Applied Biosystems 373A DNA sequencer. Plasmid DNA for transfections was prepared using Qiagen columns (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Canada). AE proteins were expressed by transient transfection of HEK293 cells (38Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 52: 59-72Crossref Scopus (3512) Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate method (39Ruetz S. Lindsey A.E. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C in an air/CO2 (19:1) environment in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 5% (v/v) calf serum. HEK293 cells, grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes, were transiently transfected with wild-type, LAAAA, or LNANN mutant constructs to induce expression of AE1 anion exchange protein as described above. Cells were also co-transfected with either pJRC36 or pDS14 to induce expression of human CAII. Plasmids pBSL103 (40Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pJRC31 (37Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) encoded mouse AE2 and rat AE3cardiac, respectively. Two days post-transfection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4), and lysates of the whole tissue culture cells were prepared by the addition of 100 μl of 0.2% (w/v) SDS. Protein concentrations were assessed (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 150 mm Tris, pH 6.8) containing 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine, 0.1 mm N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 2 mm EDTA was added to each sample. Before analysis, samples were heated to 65 °C for 5 min and sheared through a 26-gauge needle (Becton Dickinson). Insoluble material was then sedimented by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 8 or 12.5% acrylamide gels (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electrophoresis for 1 h at 100 V at room temperature in buffer composed of 20% (v/v) methanol, 25 mm Tris, and 192 mm glycine (43Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked by incubation for 1 h in TBST-M buffer (TBST buffer (0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk) and then incubated overnight in 10 ml of TBST-M containing either 3 μl of 1658 rabbit anti-AE1 polyclonal antibody (44Tang X.B. Fujinaga J. Kopito R. Casey J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22545-22553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or 3 μl of sheep anti-human CAII antibody (Serotec). After washing with TBST buffer, blots were incubated for 1 h with 10 ml of TBST-M containing 1:3000 diluted donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Anti-CAII immunoblots were incubated with 1:3000 diluted donkey anti-sheep IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. After washing with TBST buffer, blots were visualized using ECL reagent and Hyperfilm as previously described (37Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Human erythrocyte membranes were isolated by hypoosmotic lysis of erythrocytes (45Casey J.R. Lieberman D.M. Reithmeier R.A.F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 173: 494-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A sample of the membranes was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The fraction of AE1 protein in the sample was assessed by densitometry. Combined with the concentration of protein in the sample (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), this provided a measure of the concentration of AE1 in the sample. The stoichiometry of AE1 protein to CAII protein was determined by immunoblotting. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with either cDNA encoding for AE1 or with empty vector as described previously, the density of cells in each sample was determined by cell counting, and cells were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples of the transfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE together with a range of amounts of erythrocyte membranes and known amounts of purified CAII protein standard (30Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were probed with anti-AE1 antibody 1658 and anti-CAII antibody (Serotec) and developed as described above using a Kodak Image Station 440CF. The amount of AE1 and CAII in each cell sample was determined by densitometry of the immunoblots (Kodak 1D3.5 software) and comparison to the protein standards. Anion exchange activity was monitored using a fluorescence assay described previously (37Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were transiently transfected as described earlier. Two days post-transfection, coverslips were rinsed in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and incubated in 4 ml of serum-free media containing 2 μm BCECF-AM (37 °C, 15 min). Coverslips were then mounted in a fluorescence cuvette and perfused alternately with Ringer’s buffer (5 mm glucose, 5 mmpotassium gluconate, 1 mm calcium gluconate, 1 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), containing either 140 mmNaCl or 140 mm sodium gluconate bubbled with air/CO2 (19:1). Fluorescence was monitored using a Photon Technologies International RCR fluorimeter at excitation wavelengths 440 and 502.5 nm and emission wavelength 528.7 nm. After calibration using the high potassium nigericin technique (46Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar) at three pH values between 6.5 and 7.5, fluorescence ratios were converted to pHi. Rates of change of pHi were determined by linear regression (Kaleidagraph software) of the initial HCO3− efflux/influx and converted to rates of H+ equivalent flux across the plasma membrane according to the equation: J H+ = βtotal × ΔpHi (47Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar), where, as determined previously, βtotal = 57.5 mm (37Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In all cases the transport activity of sham-transfected cells was subtracted from the total rate to ensure that these rates consist only of AE transport activity. In some assays the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide was perfused through the cuvette for 10 min after a standard assay. Residual transport activity was then monitored in a standard assay with acetazolamide present in all buffers. Curves for transport inhibition by acetazolamide were fitted with Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Cell surface processing assays were performed as described previously (37Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly HEK293 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant AE1 cDNA as described above. Two days post-transfection cells were washed and harvested in phosphate-buffered saline. After a wash with borate buffer (154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm boric acid, pH 9.0), cells were incubated with 5 ml of 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin in borate buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing three times with cold quenching buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mmTris, pH 8.3), cells were solubilized on ice in 500 μl of immunoprecipitate buffer (1% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% (v/v) SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine, 0.1 mm N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 20 min at 16,000 ×g, and the supernatant was retained. Half of the supernatant was removed for subsequent SDS-PAGE analysis (total protein). Immobilized streptavidin resin (50 μl of 1–3 mg of streptavidin/ml of settled gel as a 50% slurry in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm NaN3) was added to the remaining supernatant, which was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Samples were centrifuged for 2 min at 8,000 ×g, and the supernatant was collected and retained for SDS-PAGE analysis (unbound fraction). The resin was washed five times with immunoprecipitate buffer, and proteins were then eluted from the resin by the addition of 250 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 1% 2-dmercaptoethanol and incubation at 65 °C for 5 min. Three samples (total protein, unbound fraction, and the fraction eluted from resin) were analyzed for AE1 expression and cell surface processing by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Immunoblots were scanned with a Scanjet 4C flatbed scanner (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) calibrated with a Q-14 grayscale (Eastman Kodak Co.). Standard curves were prepared to ensure that the measurements were within the linear range of detection. Scanned images were quantified using NIH Image 1.60 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The amount of protein processed to the plasma membrane was expressed as a percentage of the total. The binding of GST fusion proteins of the carboxyl terminus of AE1 (GST-Ct) to CAII immobilized on microtiter plates was carried out as described previously (30Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose and DEAE-Sepharose (32Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5527-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Purified CAII or an inactive mutant (V143Y) (0.2–1 mg of protein/well) were chemically coupled to 96-well microtiter plates using 1-cyclohexyl-3-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluenesulfonate. Plates were washed with antibody buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% gelatin) and incubated with various concentrations (0–200 nm) of purified GST or GST-Ct in antibody buffer. Bound fusion proteins were detected by incubating the plates sequentially in goat anti-GST antibody, biotinylated affinity-purified anti-goat IgG, and peroxide-labeled biotin/avidin. This was followed by incubation with the peroxidase substrate o- phenyldiamine and detection of enzymatic activity at 450 nm in a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microplate reader. Binding curves were fitted with Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Values are expressed ± S.E. of measurement. Statistical significance was determined using a pairedt test with p < 0.05 considered significant. Functional studies were performed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. These cells express practically undetectable levels of chloride/bicarbonate exchange activity (12Kopito R.R. Lee B.S. Simmons D.M. Lindsey A.E. Morgans C.W. Schneider K. Cell. 1989; 59: 927-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) but do contain endogenous carbonic anhydrase. All of the cDNAs were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 vector or pRBG4 (40Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which placed them under the control of the human cytomegalovirus early gene promoter. Immunoblots of lysates from transfected HEK293 cells were probed with either a polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal region of AE1 or an anti-CAII antibody. Fig. 1 indicates that wild-type AE1 and the LAAAA and LNANN mutants were expressed at similar levels in transfected HEK293 cells. Cells transfected with vector alone showed no immunoreactivity for AE1. Immunoblots using an anti-CAII antibody showed that HEK293 cells express CAII and could also be transfected with cDNA for human CAII to increase the level of this enzyme. Densitometry of immunoblots indicated that CAII was overexpressed ∼20-fold compared with endogenous CAII found in HEK293 cells. Absolute amounts of AE1 and CAII expression were determined by immunoblot comparison of expression in transfected HEK293 cells to known amounts of human erythrocyte AE1 protein and purified CAII. The stoichiometry of AE1:CAII was 1.7:1 in cells transfected with AE1 alone or 1:12 in CAII and AE1 co-transfected cells. The same amount of endogenous CAII was expressed in sham-transfected cells and cells transfected with AE1 alone. To determine the role of CAII in facilitating AE1 transport activity, we compared the Cl−/HCO3− exchange activity of cells transiently transfected with AE1 cDNA before and after incubation with acetazolamide, a sulfonamide that inhibits CA enzymatic activity without direct effect on anion exchange (25Cousin J.L. Motais R. Sola F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1975; 253: 385-399Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 48Cousin J.L. Motais R. J. Physiol. 1976; 256: 61-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To measure AE1 transport activity, HEK293 cells grown on coverslips were transiently transfected with AE1 cDNA, loaded with BCECF-AM, a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, and mounted in a fluorescence cuvette. Cells were perfused alternately with chloride-containing (140 mm) and chloride-free Ringer’s buffer. Solutions at pH 7.4 were continually bubbled"
https://openalex.org/W2156807491,"We reported recently that suppression of the renal 1alpha,25-dihyroxyvitamin D3 (1lpha,25-(OH)2-D3) production in aP2-agouti transgenic mice by increasing dietary calcium decreases adipocyte intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i), stimulates lipolysis, inhibits lipogenesis, and reduces adiposity. However, it was not clear whether this modulation of adipocyte metabolism by dietary calcium is a direct effect of inhibition of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3-induced [Ca2+]i. Accordingly, we have now evaluated the direct role of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3. Human adipocytes exhibited a 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 dose-responsive (1-50 nM) increase in [Ca2+]i (P<0.01). This action was mimicked by 1alpha,25-dihyroxylumisterol3 (1alpha,25-(OH)2-lumisterol3) (P<0.001), a specific agonist for a putative membrane vitamin D receptor (mVDR), and completely prevented by 1b,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1beta,25-(OH)2-D3), a specific antagonist for the mVDR. Similarly, 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 (5 nM) caused 50%-100% increases in adipocyte fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression and activity (P<0.02), a 61% increase in glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity (P<0.01), and an 80% inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis (P<0.001), whereas 1beta,25-(OH)2-D3 completely blocked all these effects. Notably, 1alpha,25-(OH)2-lumisterol3 exerted more potent effects in modulating adipocyte lipid metabolism, with 2.5- to 3.0-fold increases in FAS expression and activity (P<0.001) and a threefold increase in GPDH activity (P<0.001). Also 1alpha,25-(OH)2-lumisterol3 was approximately twice as potent in inhibiting basal lipolysis (P<0.025), whereas 1beta,25-(OH)2-D3 completely blocked all these effects. These data suggest that 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3 modulates adipocyte Ca2+ signaling and, consequently, exerts a coordinated control over lipogenesis and lipolysis. Thus, a direct inhibition of 1alpha,25-(OH)2-D3-induced [Ca2+]i may contribute to an anti-obesity effect of dietary calcium, and the mVDR may represent an important target for obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2095851154,"The main hypothesis for prion diseases proposes that the cellular protein (PrPC) can be altered into a misfolded, β-sheet-rich isoform (PrPSc), which in most cases undergoes aggregation. In an organism infected with PrPSc, PrPC is converted into the β-sheet form, generating more PrPSc. We find that sequence-specific DNA binding to recombinant murine prion protein (mPrP-(23–231)) converts it from an α-helical conformation (cellular isoform) into a soluble, β-sheet isoform similar to that found in the fibrillar state. The recombinant murine prion protein and prion domains bind with high affinity to DNA sequences. Several double-stranded DNA sequences in molar excess above 2:1 (pH 4.0) or 0.5:1 (pH 5.0) completely inhibit aggregation of prion peptides, as measured by light scattering, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. However, at a high concentration, fibers (or peptide aggregates) can rescue the peptide bound to the DNA, converting it to the aggregating form. Our results indicate that a macromolecular complex of prion-DNA may act as an intermediate for the formation of the growing fiber. We propose that host nucleic acid may modulate the delicate balance between the cellular and the misfolded conformations by reducing the protein mobility and by making the protein-protein interactions more likely. In our model, the infectious material would act as a seed to rescue the protein bound to nucleic acid.

The importance of this region in the pathogenesis was first recognized when it was discovered that the peptide 106–126 is highly neurotoxic (13Forloni G. Angeretti N. Chiesa R. Monzani E. Salmona M.

The availability of NMR solution structures of different constructs of the cellular form of PrP has opened the possibility to address questions related to the conformation and dynamics of the cellular protein and its interaction with environmental factors (21Riek R.

However, many questions remain unanswered. 1) Why the low efficiency of infection (ratio 1:100,000)? 2) Can recombinant PrPC molecules cause disease in the absence of infectious prion? 3) Are there adjuvant factors? In fact, concerning the last question, recent studies (5Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5104) Google Scholar, 26Telling G.C. Scott M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 79-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar) indicate that another macromolecule (provisionally designated protein X) may interact with the prion protein acting as an adjuvant factor. We find that some nucleic acid sequences bind with high affinity to the mPrP-(23–231) converting it to the β-sheet isoform. DNA also binds to prion sequences containing the region that undergoes the transition to β-sheet, modulating their aggregation. Previous studies have shown that PrP may interact with sulfated glycans (27Caughey B. Brown K. Raymond G.J. Katzenstein G.E. Thresher W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2135-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DNA (28Nandi P.K. Leclerc E. Arch. Virol. 1999; 144: 1751-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and RNA (29Gabus C. Derrington E. Leblanc P. Chnaiderman J. Dormont D. Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Surewicz W.K. Marc D. Nandi P. Darlix J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19301-19309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We also find that there is a dependence on the DNA sequence for binding to the murine prion protein. At high DNA-to-protein ratios, aggregation is inhibited. When the aggregating sequence (S) is present in excess of DNA, the aggregates rescue the protein from the DNA. Based on these findings, we propose a mechanism for the participation of an adjuvant factor (factor X), likely a nucleic acid. The prion protein peptides were synthesized in solid phase. Purity of the peptides was assessed by mass spectrometry and reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The peptides were maintained in a 6 m urea, 10 mm SDS stock solution that was diluted at least 100-fold in the aggregation kinetic assays. The recombinant mPrP-(23–231) was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by high affinity column refolding as described (30Zahn R. von Schroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Light scattering, fluorescence polarization, and fluorescence spectra were recorded on an ISSPC1 spectrofluorometer (ISS, Champaign, IL). Light scattering at 90o was measured for the aggregation kinetic assays, where the peptides previously unfolded in a 5 or 6 m urea solution at pH 4.0 or 5.0 were diluted in buffer, and the light scattering values at 320 nm were monitored as a function of time. The tryptophan fluorescence of the mPrP-(23–231) and of the peptide PrP-(109–149) was measured by exciting at 280 nm and the emission verified from 300 to 420 nm. The hydrophobic probe 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS, purchased from Molecular Probes) fluorescence emission was collected from 400 to 600 nm with excitation at 360 nm. Circular dichroism spectra of mPrP-(23–231) and of peptide solutions were recorded in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C, with 0.1-, 0.5-, or 1-cm path length cells. A double-stranded oligonucleotide with 18 base pairs (E2DBS) labeled with rhodamine at the 3′ end. The excitation wavelength was 580 nm, and the emission was observed through a 2-62 filter. The mPrP-(23–231) was added sequentially to a 25 nm E2DBS solution. The peptides were maintained in a 5 m urea stock solution at pH 5.0 and were diluted in 50 mm MES buffer at pH 5.0 containing 50 or 100 nm E2DBS. Free rhodamine was used as a control and did not bind to prion peptides and recombinant prion protein in the concentration range used for the polarization experiments. The single-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides, high performance liquid chromatography-purified, were purchased from Sinapse Biologia (Brazil). The nucleic acid sequences utilized are as follows: recA1/2 (5′-CACTTGATACTGTATATATATACAGTATAATTGC-3′); Lexcons24 (5′-GATACTGTATATATATACAGTAGA-3′); Lexcons 28 (5′-TCGATACTGTATATATATACAGTAGATC-3′); E2DBS (5′-GTAACCGAAATCGGTTGA-3′); 34-bp poly(AT) and 34-bp poly(GC). The choice of the linear double-stranded DNAs was made on the basis of their relative GC and AT content and because they bind with high affinity to transcription factors such as LexA repressor (31Mohana-Borges R. Pacheco A.B.F. Sousa F.J.R. Foguel D. Almeida D.F. Silva J.L. J. Biol.

In a search for factors that can modulate conversion of the cellular form PrPC to the abnormal conformation PrPSc, we first used two model peptides, corresponding to Syrian hamster PrP residues 109–141 (PrP-(109–141)) and residues 109–149 (PrP-(109–149)). These peptide segments belong to a loop, a small β-strand, and part of an α-helix of the PrP, which are implicated in the conversion into β-sheets, and they lie within one of the most conserved regions in the PrP structure (8Pan K.H.

Structural data for PrP-(109–141) peptide have been obtained by NMR, and its aggregation properties are well documented; conversion into β-sheets is followed by aggregation into amyloid fibers (33Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T. Baldwin M. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The other peptide was chosen because it contains a tryptophan residue that can be used in fluorescence measurements. In mixed water/organic solvents or in the presence of detergents such as SDS, PrP-(109–141) assumes a stable α-helical structure (33Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T. Baldwin M. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and PrP-(109–149) has a similar secondary structure. In the presence of high urea concentrations, the random-coiled peptide is soluble without aggregation (33Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T. Baldwin M. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Aggregation is triggered when both peptides are diluted out of the urea into buffers at pH 4.0 or 5.0. Upon dilution to aqueous buffer, aggregation occurs and can be monitored by light scattering (Fig. 1,A and B, solid lines). Formation of the fibrillar state was also accompanied by different spectroscopic methods (Table I), such as tryptophan fluorescence polarization, binding of thioflavine T, and binding of bis-ANS, as well by atomic force microscopy (not shown). Both peptides aggregate more readily at acidic pH values (pH 4–5). In contrast, there are very small changes in light scattering when the peptides are diluted in 6 m urea (Fig. 1, A and B, dashed line). To ascertain whether nucleic acids bind to prion peptides and affect aggregation, we monitored aggregation in the presence of varying concentrations of nucleic acid (Figs. 1 and 2). Aggregation was inhibited at relatively low concentrations of DNA for all the double-stranded nucleic acids studied, including the large plasmids pUC19 (Fig. 1, C and D), pCI2 (Fig. 1,E and F), and total mouse DNA (not shown). Shorter sequences were also tested at pH values at 4.0 and 5.0; the 34-bp sequence recA1/2 (Fig. 2, A and B), the 24-bp sequence Lexcons24 (Fig.2C) at pH 4.0, the 28 bp-sequence Lexcons28 (2D), and the 18-bp sequence E2 DNA binding sequence (E2DBS) (Fig. 2E) at pH 5.0. The DNA titration curves revealed that the binding reactions at these concentrations of protein (1–10 μm) depend on DNA concentration and are limited by stoichiometry. PrP-(109–149) could aggregate at relatively low concentration (1 μm), which permitted us to achieve DNA-induced inhibition at 0.5–3 μm of nucleic acid depending on the sequence (Fig. 2). The peptide diluted in the absence of DNA-bound thioflavine T (TableI), and the solution was highly turbid, whereas in the presence of a molar excess of DNA the solution was completely transparent. Thioflavine T could not be used when DNA was present because it naturally binds DNA with a large increase in fluorescence (34Canete M. Villanueva A. Juarranz A. Stockert J.C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1987; 33: 191-199PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNAs were less effective, and nucleotide solutions had no effect. High salt concentrations (400 mm) prevented DNA binding, abolishing the inhibition of aggregation (Fig. 2F). Whereas at low salt, DNA inhibited aggregation almost 100%, and in the presence of 400 mm NaCl, DNA inhibited aggregation less than 10%. In general, the inhibitory effects of DNA were more evident at pH 5.0 (for example compare Fig. 2, D and Ewith C). Nucleic acids were recently proposed to bind a short prion peptide (residues 106–121) (35Nandi P.K. Arch.

To examine the relation between DNA binding and inhibition of aggregation, a rhodamine-labeled double-stranded DNA (E2DBS) was used (Fig. 3). Rhodamine-labeled DNA (50 nm) shows an increase in polarization with PrP-(109–149) peptide binding (Fig. 3A). The peptide binds with an apparent affinity in the range 100–200 nm. The binding reaches a maximum at 400 nmprotein (Fig. 3A) and upon increasing in the peptide concentration (leading to an excess in relation to DNA) results in the decrease of polarization accompanied by increase in light scattering (Fig. 3B). Increase of DNA to 100 nm displaces the polarization curve (DNA binding) to higher protein concentrations (Fig. 3A). It is noteworthy that the maximum value of polarization occurs at a protein:DNA ratio of about 8:1 (protein:DNA) (pH 5.0), and increasing peptide concentrations leads to aggregation. The decrease in polarization can be explained by formation of aggregates free of DNA and the resulting “rescue effect” (i.e. the bound protein is released from the DNA). Aggregation proceeds at protein concentrations higher than 0.4 μm in the presence of 50 nm DNA, but it is prevented when DNA concentration is 1 or 2 μm (Fig.3B). In Fig. 3C, the fraction of aggregation is measured as a function of DNA:PrP peptide ratio at pH 5.0, which again leaves no doubt that the excess of DNA-binding sites prevents aggregation. Altogether, the data in Fig. 3 suggest two apparent paradoxical effects for DNA binding as follows: 1) inhibition of aggregation at low protein:DNA ratios, and 2) stimulation of aggregation at high protein:DNA ratios. To characterize further the binding of nucleic acid sequences to PrP-(109–149), spectroscopic studies were carried out. Our results clearly show that short nucleotide sequences, such as the recA1/2, the Lexcons, and E2 operator (E2DBS) would bind and inhibit aggregation. Binding of DNA could be proved by polarization fluorescence measurements (Table I), and affinity in the nanomolar region was obtained. The binding of DNA quenched the Trp fluorescence (Fig.4, A and B) and decreased the binding of anilinonaphthalene sulfonates (Fig.4C). Fluorescence polarization measurements showed that the murine prion protein PrP-(23–231) also binds to nucleic acid with high affinity at the nanomolar level (Fig.5A). The binding of the prion protein to DNA was dependent on the DNA sequence (Fig. 5B), providing strong support to a relevant in vivo binding. Whereas Lexcons28 and 34-bp poly(GC) displaced labeled E2DBS, 24-bp poly(AT) did not have any effect even at 10-fold higher concentration. The changes in polarization of the DNA (E2DBS) upon binding of PrP was similar to that obtained by binding of E2 DNA binding domain protein (32Lima L.M.T. Foguel D. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14289-14294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which indicates that the size of the complex is of the same magnitude. The apparent dissociation constant of mPrP to E2DBS DNA was 25 nm. In contrast, the affinity for 24-bp poly(AT) was about 100-fold smaller (not shown). The apparent dissociation constant for E2DBS did not alter significantly in the pH range from 5 to 7. At pH 5.0, mPrP-E2DBS remained soluble without changes in light scattering up to a 4:1 molar ratio. At higher protein:DNA ratios, there was a slight increase in light scattering in agreement with studies using large DNA sequences (28Nandi P.K. Leclerc E. Arch. Virol. 1999; 144: 1751-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Binding of mPrP to E2DBS (25 nm) reaches saturation around 30–40 nm mPrP (Fig.5A), indicating a binding stoichiometry (protein:DNA) of about 2:1. The formation of a tight PrP-DNA complex that reaches saturation around 50 nm was confirmed by gel-shift assays (not shown). The affinity found here is within the range observed for several DNA-binding proteins (37Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar). The question whether DNA stabilizes a β-sheet structure in solution was further investigated by performing circular dichroism studies on the PrP-DNA complex. Indeed it is clear that binding of DNA prevents aggregation but not the conversion into β-sheet as can be seen from the CD spectra for the prion peptide (Fig. 4, D andE; maximum ellipticity at 218 nm). The ellipticity at 218 nm was about the same in the aggregated material and in the soluble protein-DNA complex (Fig. 4, D and E; Table I), in contrast to the characteristic unfolded structure of the peptide in high concentration of urea. The spectra of the aggregated protein and of DNA-bound protein were not the most usually seen for a β-sheet containing protein. However, some whole β-sheet proteins, such as concanavalin, have similar CD spectra (38Venyaminov S.Yu. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformation Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 69-107Google Scholar). In fact, the spectra of the peptide either in the aggregated state or in the DNA-bound state are similar to that obtained for concanavalin A (38Venyaminov S.Yu. Yang J.T. Fasman G.D. Circular Dichroism and the Conformation Analysis of Biomolecules. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1996: 69-107Google Scholar, 39Wang J.M. Takeda A. Yang J.T. Wu C.S. J.

Biochem. 1994; 222: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which presents a full β-sheet secondary structure. The same peptide in a hydrophobic environment (100 mm of SDS detergent) assumes a helical structure (not shown) as reported previously (33Zhang H. Kaneko K. Nguyen J.T. Livshits T. Baldwin M. Cohen F.E. James T.L. Prusiner S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our most remarkable finding is that the murine prion protein is also converted into a β-sheet-rich structure when bound to DNA in a soluble, non-aggregated form (Fig. 5C), demonstrating that the DNA-induced conversion is a feature of the whole prion protein. This result by itself is extremely important because it shows the oxidized protein in a soluble, β-sheet conformation, which opens new avenues for the determination of its structure.

H. pylori infection has been connected etiologically to peptic ulcer disease (1Kuipers E.J. Thijs J.C. Festen H.P. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 9 Suppl. 2: 59-69PubMed Google Scholar), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma of the stomach (2Wotherspoon A.C. Ortiz-Hidalgo C. Falzon M.R. Isaacson P.G. Lancet. 1991; 338: 1175-1176Abstract PubMed Scopus (1736) Google Scholar), and gastric adenocarcinoma (3Huang J.Q. Sridhar S. Chen Y. Hunt R.H. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). H. pylori colonization invariably causes chronic active gastritis, a disease state characterized by neutrophil infiltration of the gastric mucosa and epithelial layer. Interaction of the bacterium with gastric epithelial cells leads to the production of chemokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8),1 which in turn causes activation and recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. It is now known that attachment of H. pylori to gastric epithelial cells activates multiple signaling pathways that culminate in IL-8 gene transcription. Previous studies have shown that H. pylori is able to induce activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, key regulators of many inflammatory genes including IL-8 (4Keates S. Hitti Y.S.

Moreover, we and others, have recently reported that infection of gastric epithelial cell lines with H. pylori results in the rapid activation of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (6Meyer-ter-Vehn T.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms whereby H. pylori are able to activate gastric epithelial cell MAP kinases are still unclear. The ERK1/2 pathway has been linked to cellular proliferation and differentiation (9Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar), however, our previous findings suggest these proteins also participate in proinflammatory cellular responses in gastric epithelial cells. By blocking upstream ERK1/2 phosphorylation using the MEK inhibitor PD98059 we were able to reduce the amount of IL-8 produced by AGS cells in response to H. pylori infection. Interestingly, this effect was not mediated via blockade of NF-κB activation (8Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been demonstrated that H. pylori- mediated AP-1 activation is prevented by PD98059 (6Meyer-ter-Vehn T. Covacci A. Kist M. Pahl H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16064-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The activity of ERK1/2 are generally regulated through the activation of cell surface receptors. One possible mechanism whereby H. pylori may modulate the ERK1/2 pathway is through the EGF receptor. The EGF receptor is a transmembrane receptor with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, known to regulate the ERK1/2 pathway, via activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras. Numerous stimuli are known to cause transactivation of the EGF receptor, including Substance P (10Castagliuolo I. Valenick L. Liu J. Pothoulakis C. J. Biol.

Here, we report that H. pylori is capable of inducing EGF receptor phosphorylation, which is, in part, responsible for ERK1/2 activation in H. pylori- infected AGS cells. In this study, we also examine the downstream effects of EGF receptor activation on IL-8 regulation byH. pylori, and explore the mechanism by which this bacterium induces EGF receptor phosphorylation. AGS gastric epithelial cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in F-12 HAM medium (pH 7.4: Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cell culture experiments were carried out using 100-mm dishes and 12- or 24-well polypropylene tissue culture plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, MA). All experiments were carried out using confluent monolayers unless otherwise stated. In some experiments, cells were treated with AG1478 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), batimastat (British Biotech, Oxford, UK), HB-EGF neutralizing antibody, EGF (both from R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN), heparin or cyclohexamide (both from Sigma-Aldrich). H. pylori were plated onto Brucella agar supplemented with 5% horse blood (BBL, Becton Dickinson Microbiology, Cockeysville, MD) and incubated at 37 °C in a microaerophilic environment. After 3 days the bacteria were harvested into pyrogen-free Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (Cellgro, Mediatech, Herndon, VA). The bacteria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 ×g for 10 min, and resuspended into antibiotic-free F-12 Ham’s medium. Unless otherwise stated experiments were performed using the cag +, vacuolating cytotoxin secreting H. pylori strain 43504 (American Type Culture Collection). Isogenic H. pylori mutants lacking the picB,cagA, or vacA genes were also studied together with their parental cag +, vacuolating cytotoxin secreting wild type strain (number 60190) (17Tummuru M.K. Sharma S.A. Blaser M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These strains plus thecag− strain J44, were obtained from the culture collection of the Vanderbilt University Campylobacter and Helicobacter Laboratory (Nashville, TN) and have been described previously (17Tummuru M.K. Sharma S.A. Blaser M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 18Peek Jr., R.M. Miller G.G. Tham K.T. Perez-Perez G.I. Zhao X. Atherton J.C. Blaser M.J. Lab. Invest. 1995; 73: 760-770PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori- conditioned media were prepared by suspending bacteria in antibiotic-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C, pelleting at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and then filtering the medium through a 0.2-μm filter (Acrodisc; Gelman, Ann Arbor, MI). AGS gastric epithelial cells plated onto 100-mm dishes were serum-starved for 24 h prior to experiments. Cells were then incubated with H. pylori (1 × 109) bacteria for the indicated times. Monolayers were washed 5 times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed (45 min on ice) using 1 ml of lysis buffer. Lysis buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a commercially available protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemical, Indianapolis, IN). Cells were then scraped, and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Particulate material was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates collected. EGF receptor immunoprecipitations were performed using 1 mg of lysate protein, which was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 2 μg of a monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody (Santa Cruz), followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with a 50-μl aliquot of Protein G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz). The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2 × SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated using 6% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Membranes were then blocked for 1 h with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (0.1%) (TBS-T), and incubated overnight with the appropriate antibodies. Phosphorylated tyrosine residues were detected using monoclonal antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz) at a 1:1000 dilution. Blots were stripped and reprobed with a rabbit anti-EGF receptor polyclonal antibody (1:1000) (Santa Cruz) to detect total protein levels. AGS cells were grown on 12-well plates and maintained in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to the experiment. H. pylori were added in serum-free medium, and co-cultured for varying lengths of time. At the end of the experiment the monolayers were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with SDS sample buffer (containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue). Samples were then sonicated, heated to 100 °C for 5 min, and ∼20 μl of lysate loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with a 5% (w/v) solution of dried milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). This was followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with the phospho-specific MAP kinase antibodies diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer. The membranes were then washed 3 times with TBS-T, and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). A SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used for detection. A phospho-specific p44/p42 MAP kinase antibody was used to detect activated ERK1/2. This antibody detects p44 and p42 MAP kinase (ERK1and ERK2) only when they are catalytically activated by phosphorylation at Thr202 and Tyr204. A phospho-specific p38 MAP kinase antibody was used to detect p38 activated by phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182. A phospho-specific p54/p46 MAP kinase antibody was used to detect JNK. This antibody detects p54 and p46 MAP kinase only when they are activated by phosphorylation at Thr183 and Tyr185. All three antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA. A 1521-bp fragment containing nucleotides −1481 to +40 of the promoter region of the IL-8 gene was cloned into the pGL2-basic luciferase expression vector between Kpn I and Hin dIII restriction sites. The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing using primers specific for the pGL2-basic luciferase expression vector (GL primers 1 and 2; Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The IL-8 luciferase reporter gene and pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) expressing a geneticin (G418) resistance gene were co-transfected into AGS gastric epithelial cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD). AGS clones stably transfected with pcDNA3.1 were selected by adding G418 sulfate (400 μg/ml; Life Technologies) to the culture medium, and positive clones co-transfected with the IL-8 luciferase reporter were identified by their ability to respond to IL-1β (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems). The AGS clone identified as containing both the geneticin resistance gene and the IL-8 luciferase reporter gene was subsequently maintained in G418 selection media. IL-8 protein levels in AGS cell conditioned media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described (4Keates S. Hitti Y.S. Upton M. Kelly C.P.

Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat for windows version 2.0 (Jandel Scientific Software, San Rafael, CA). Unless stated otherwise, ANOVA followed by protectedt tests were used for intergroup comparisons. Ras activation was determined using a commercially available kit (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, 1 mg of lysate protein from treated cells, precleared with 20 μl of glutathione-agarose (Santa Cruz), for 30 min at 4 °C, was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of Raf-1 RBD agarose. The beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and resuspended in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the membrane was blocked for 20 min with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (Tween 0.05%). The blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-Ras monoclonal antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. Activated Ras was then visualized using an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Santa Cruz), and a chemiluminescence detection system. To construct a retroviral vector expressing the dominant negative Ras (Ras-17N), the human Ras-17N fragment was first excised from pZIP-Ras-17N by digestion with Bsp HI and Bam HI. The resulting fragment was then ligated into the retroviral vector pMMP, digested with Nco I and Bam HI. To generate Ras-17N-expressing retroviruses, 293T cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells per 100-mm plate and incubated with 10 ml of 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium for 24 h. The medium was replaced with fresh medium 4 h prior to transfection. The plasmids pMD-gag-pol, pMD-VSVG, and pMMP-Ras-17N were combined in a ratio of 3:1:4 and used to prepare transfection mixtures using Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Forty-eight h after transfection, the media were collected, filtered through 0.45-μm disc filters, and the supernatants were either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. A control retrovirus containing LacZ was generated in an identical manner. pMMP-LacZ, pMD-gag-pol, and pMD-VSVG were all kindly provided by Dr. Richard C. Mulligan (Children’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). To determine whether the EGF receptor is activated by H. pylori infection, lysates from AGS cells infected with H. pylori for 1 h were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate using the phosphotyrosine-specific antibody (PY99) demonstrated the presence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of approximately 170-kDa (Fig.1 A, upper panel). Pretreatment of the cells with the EGF receptor inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 (1 μm) for 30 min was able to completely prevent H. pylori- mediated EGF receptor phosphorylation. To confirm that the immunoprecipitated protein was the EGF receptor the blot was reprobed with an anti-EGF receptor polyclonal antibody (Fig. 1 A, bottom panel). These data show that H. pylori is able to induce phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in AGS cells after 1 h of infection. Time course experiments showed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor as early as 15 min following infection (data not shown). Phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is known to activate the Ras/Raf/MEK pathway resulting in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. To determine whether the ERK1/2 activation we had observed previously in H. pylori- infected AGS cells (8Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar) was mediated through activation of the EGF receptor; we used tyrphostin AG1478, an agent that specifically prevents EGF receptor kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 1 B (upper panel) H. pylori was able to induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by 15 min and this effect was significantly reduced when the cells were pretreated with AG1478 (1 μm). H. pylori- mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was prevented at 15 min by AG1478 and reduced by 50% at the 30-min time point as determined by densitometry. Since cross-talk between signal transduction pathways is common, we examined whether this inhibitor could also prevent the phosphorylation of p38 or JNK in H. pylori infected AGS cells. However, in contrast to our findings for ERK1/2, AG1478 had no evident effect on p38 or JNK phosphorylation levels (Fig. 1 B, middle and lower panels). These data indicate that H. pylori induced activation of ERK1/2 is, at least in part, due to phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, whereas EGF receptor activation does not mediateH. pylori- induced p38 or JNK phosphorylation. Previously, we demonstrated that activation the ERK1/2 pathway by H. pylori is one of the mechanisms whereby the bacterium is able to regulate cytokine production (8Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that blockade of the EGF receptor as an upstream activator of the ERK1/2 pathway may have functional effects on IL-8 gene regulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we used AGS cells stably transfected with an IL-8 luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig.2 A, treatment of these cells with H. pylori for 4 h caused a 30-fold increase in IL-8 luciferase reporter activity. However, reporter activity was reduced to ∼22-fold when EGF receptor phosphorylation was prevented by treatment with AG1478 (1 μm). Consistent with our transcription data, there was a dramatic up-regulation of IL-8 protein production by AGS cells in response to infection with H. pylori for a 4-h period, which was reduced dose dependently when the cells were pretreated with the EGF receptor inhibitor AG1478 (Fig.2 B). We have previously observed that both cag+ and cag− strains ofH. pylori were capable of activating the ERK1/2 pathway, but differ in the degree of activation (8Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 phosphorylation seen in AGS cells infected with cag− H. pylori was considerably reduced compared with those infected with cag+ strains. Therefore, we next examined whether activation of the EGF receptor was also dependent on the cag status of the bacteria. Fig.3 shows the level of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation when cells were infected with either acag+ strain (43504) or cag− strain (J44) ofH. pylori over a 4-h time course. We find that thecag− strain induces a relatively weak activation of the EGF receptor, as compared with the more substantial activation seen withcag+ strain. These data appear to correlate with the ability of the cag+ and cag− H. pylori to induce phosphorylation of ERK1/2, also shown in Fig. 3. Having found a distinct difference betweencag+ and cag− H. pylori in their ability to induce activation of the EGF receptor, we next examined whether isogenic mutants of H. pylori could induce the same response as a wild type cag+ strain (60190). As demonstrated in Fig.4, phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by the picB− mutant was considerably less than for the isogenic wild type H. pylori strain. In contrast, thecagA− mutant induced a similar activation of the EGF receptor when compared with the wild type strain. These data suggest that full activation of the EGF receptor by H. pylori requires an intact type IV secretory apparatus, but not the translocation of the CagA protein into the host cell. Since it has been reported that culture supernatant from vacA+ H. pylori was able to cause dephosphorylation of the EGF receptor (21Pai R. Wyle F.A. Cover T.L. Itani R.M. Domek M.J. Tarnawski A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1617-1624PubMed Google Scholar), we also investigated the effect of a vacA− mutant ofH. pylori on gastric epithelial cell EGF receptor phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4, the absence of the vacA gene had no evident effect on the ability of the bacteria to induce EGF receptor phosphorylation, as compared with the vacA+ wild type strain. Activation of the EGF receptor, as well as other cell surface receptors, stimulates the exchange of GDP for GTP on the small G protein Ras. Once in the active state, Ras can interact with several effector proteins such as Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Active Raf stimulates MEK, which in turn leads to the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. To further delineate the mechanism leading to ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we investigated whether Ras becomes activated following H. pylori infection of AGS cells, and whether we could prevent this activation using AG1478. Our results (Fig.5 A, upper panel) show a marked activation of Ras, at 30 min, which is inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with AG1478 (1 μm). EGF (10 ng/ml), included as positive control, was found to stimulate Ras activation after 10 min. EGF activation of Ras was also prevented by pretreatment with AG1478. Whole cell lysates from these experiments were also probed for phospho-specific and control ERK1/2 to examine the correlation between Ras activation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and to demonstrate equivalent levels of protein loading for the Ras assay (Fig. 5 A, middle and bottom panels, respectively). Interestingly, EGF-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was completely prevented with AG1478, whereas H. pylori activated phospho-ERK1/2 levels, although significantly reduced after AG1478 treatment, were still detectable. This finding suggests that there may be more than one mechanism involved in H. pylori activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. We next examined whether Ras activation byH. pylori was upstream of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To do this we overexpressed dominant negative Ras in AGS cells using retroviral transfection, and examined ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response toH. pylori infection. As shown in Fig. 5 B, ERK1/2 phosphorylation is absent in untreated control cells. However, H. pylori and EGF (10 ng/ml) each caused a strong induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the LacZ (vector control)-transfected cells. EGF activation of ERK1/2 was almost completely abrogated in cells over expressing dominant negative Ras, whereas H. pylori- mediated ERK1/2 activation was only partially inhibited. These findings provide further evidence that ERK1/2 activation by H. pylori can be mediated via both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent pathways. To examine whether soluble factors secreted byH. pylori were responsible for phosphorylation of the EGF receptor, we incubated AGS cells with both whole bacteria or conditioned medium for 1 h. H. pylori- conditioned medium was unable to induce EGF receptor phosphorylation (Fig.6), suggesting that contact between the bacterium and the host cell is necessary for induction of EGF receptor phosphorylation. These data agree with our previous finding, thatH. pylori- conditioned medium is unable to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation (8Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that, in a number of systems where the EGF receptor becomes transactivated, the underlying mechanism involves cleavage of membrane-bound pro-HB-EGF (22Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Cleaved HB-EGF then binds the EGF receptor leading to its phosphorylation. HB-EGF requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans as co-receptors of the EGF receptor and the addition of heparin has been shown to compete with heparan sulfate proteoglycans for HB-EGF binding (23Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore infected AGS cells with H. pylori in the presence of heparin (100 μg/ml). As shown in Fig. 6, heparin markedly inhibited H. pylori-mediated EGF receptor phosphorylation. The data resulting from the heparin co-culture experiments led us to examine whether HB-EGF, an endogenous ligand of the EGF receptor, was mediating EGF receptor activation in H. pylori- infected AGS cells. In support of this hypothesis we found that a HB-EGF neutralizing antibody (25 μg/ml) almost completely blocked H. pylori- mediated activation of the EGF receptor (Fig.7 A). The HB-EGF neutralizing antibody was also found to cause a substantial (48.5% by densitometry) reduction in H. pylori- activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7 B). Shedding of HB-EGF and other EGF receptor ligands has previously been reported to be dependent on the action of matrix metalloproteinases. We explored the possibility that H. pylori may be activating these proteases, and thus cause the shedding of the soluble form of HB-EGF. We investigated this by treating the cells with batimastat (5 μg/ml), a broad spectrum matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor. As shown in Fig.8 A, we found that batimastat could prevent EGF receptor phosphorylation by H. pylori. In addition, we found that this inhibitor could also markedly reduce ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by H. pylori (Fig.8 B). We and others have previously reported that H. pylori activates a number of MAP kinases in gastric epithelial cell lines (6Meyer-ter-Vehn T. Covacci A. Kist M. Pahl H.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3629-3636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Activation of these pathways plays a key role in up-regulating the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 (8Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms whereby H. pylori activates these signaling pathways are still unknown. We now report that H. pylori can induce phosphorylation of the EGF receptor in AGS gastric epithelial cells. H. pylori- induced EGF receptor phosphorylation leads to activation of Ras, which is able to mediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which in turn up-regulates IL-8 gene expression and protein production. We find that EGF receptor phosphorylation mediated by H. pylori is dependent upon an intact type IV bacterial secretory system. Moreover, we find that the mechanism underlying the induction of EGF receptor phosphorylation by H. pylori involves activation of the EGF receptor ligand HB-EGF. One important finding of our study is that there is a differential activation of the EGF receptor depending upon whether the H. pylori strain processes a 40-kb region of genes known as thecag pathogenicity island. The cag pathogenicity island encodes for ∼30 proteins, that based on sequence homology appear to constitute a type IV bacterial secretion system (25Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). It has previously been reported that the absence of the whole pathogenicity island or deletions of individual cag genes result in an impaired ability to activate NF-κB, AP-1, and MAP kinase pathways (6Meyer-ter-Vehn T. Covacci A. Kist M. Pahl H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16064-16072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 7Naumann M. Wessler S. Bartsch C. Wieland B. Covacci A. Haas R.

We have found that the picB− (cagE−) isogenic mutant of H. pylori is able to mediate a much weaker induction of EGF receptor phosphorylation compared with its parental wild type strain. These data suggest that the H. pylori type IV secretion system participates in host cell EGF receptor activation. We also examined whether the CagA protein produced by H. pylori could be involved in EGF receptor activation. To date, CagA is the only H. pylori protein known to translocate from the bacterium into the cell via the type IV secretion system; however, its function or target within the host eukaryotic cell is unknown (27Stein M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 28Odenbreit S. Puls J. Sedlmaier B. Gerland E. Fischer W. Haas R.

Med. 2000; 191: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated through the use of an isogenic cagA− mutant that this protein does not appear to play a role in inducing EGF receptor phosphorylation. This finding is consistent with our current knowledge of CagA, in that the CagA protein itself does not induce an inflammatory response, and plays no role in MAP kinase activation (8Keates S. Keates A.C. Warny M. Peek Jr., R.M. Murray P.G. Kelly C.P. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5552-5559PubMed Google Scholar), NF-κB activation (26Sharma S.A. Tummuru M.K. Blaser M.J. Kerr L.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2401-2407PubMed Google Scholar), or IL-8 production (25Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). From our study we also conclude that the vacuolating toxin produced byH. pylori plays no role in mediating H. pylori- induced EGF receptor phosphorylation, since we found no differences between our wild type and vacA− mutants in their abilities to induce EGF receptor phosphorylation. It has been reported that H. pylori supernatant containing vacuolating toxin can cause dephosphorylation of the EGF receptor, and down-regulate ERK1/2 activation in EGF-treated Kato III cells (21Pai R. Wyle F.A. Cover T.L. Itani R.M. Domek M.J. Tarnawski A.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 1617-1624PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to this, we find that whole intact H. pylori were necessary to induce phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and activate the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. We did not, however, examine the effects of purified vacuolating toxin in our system or investigate the effects of H. pylori supernatant on EGF-treated cells. Instead, we focused on the early signaling events that occur upon contact ofH. pylori with gastric epithelial cells. We have demonstrated for the first time that, through induction of EGF receptor phosphorylation H. pylori is capable of activating the small GTP-binding protein Ras, which activates a signaling cascade resulting in ERK1/2 phosphorylation. However, in our experiments using an EGF receptor inhibitor and dominant negative Ras we were unable to achieve complete blockade of ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by H. pylori. This suggests that additional pathways exist through which the bacteria are able to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study showing that H. pylori regulates the histidine decarboxylase gene through ERK1/2 activation, but via a Ras independent pathway (24Wessler S. Hocker M. Fischer W. Wang T.C. Rosewicz S. Haas R. Wiedenmann B. Meyer T.F. Naumann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3629-3636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We have found that H. pylori induced phosphorylation of the EGF receptor is mediated through the release of EGF receptor ligand: HB-EGF. Previous studies have also examined the association between EGF receptor ligands and H. pylori. Romano et al. (30Romano M. Ricci V. Di Popolo A. Sommi P. Del Vecchio B.C. Bruni C.B. Ventura U. Cover T.L. Blaser M.J. Coffey R.J. Zarrilli R. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1604-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reported that by incubating suspensions of H. pylori or conditioned broth with MKN-28 cells for several hours they were able to up-regulate both amphiregulin and HB-EGF mRNA levels. We find that rapid activation of the EGF receptor by H. pylori (within 15 min) is not mediated through the release of soluble bacterial factors, but instead appears to be contact dependent. Rapid release of HB-EGF from the cell is typically a result of post-translational modifications of membrane-bound HB-EGF, and does not appear to be mediated via production of newly synthesized proteins. Furthermore, replenishment of transmembrane HB-EGF requires 12–24 h (23Raab G. Klagsbrun M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F179-F199PubMed Google Scholar). As our system examined the acute interaction between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells we cannot rule out the possibility that soluble factors secreted by the bacteria may play a role in up-regulating EGF receptor ligand production during the later stages of infection. Transactivation of the EGF receptor by numerous G-protein-coupled receptors has now been identified as a critical element in G-protein-coupled receptor-induced mitogenic signaling (13Roudabush F.L.

The mechanism for activation of the EGF receptor under these circumstances appears to be through matrix metalloproteinases. Matrix metalloproteinases such as MMP-3, once activated, are able to cleave the membrane-bound precursor of HB-EGF causing shedding of its mature, soluble form, which in turn engages and activates the EGF receptor, and thus activates the MAP kinase cascade (22Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). We now report the novel finding that H. pylori-induced EGF receptor phosphorylation is mediated through HB-EGF, and is prevented by the metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. Engagement of the host gastric epithelial cell byH. pylori appears to induce HB-EGF release, which in turn activates EGF receptor and ERK1/2 signaling. We speculate that H. pylori may cause transactivation of the EGF receptor by interacting with a receptor already expressed on the surface of the gastric epithelial cell, or through insertion of bacterial proteins into the host cell. HB-EGF-mediated transactivation of the EGF receptor may be instrumental in inducing the augmented proliferative and inflammatory responses seen in infection of the gastric epithelium bycag+ H. pylori."
https://openalex.org/W1969499061,"In this study we initially examined the interaction between CD44v3 (a hyaluronan (HA) receptor) and Vav2 (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor) in human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cell line). Immunological data indicate that both CD44v3 and Vav2 are expressed in SK-OV-3.ipl cells and that these two proteins are physically linked as a complex in vivo. By using recombinant fragments of Vav2 and in vitro binding assays, we have detected a specific binding interaction between the SH3-SH2-SH3 domain of Vav2 and the cytoplasmic domain of CD44. In addition, we have observed that the binding of HA to CD44v3 activates Vav2-mediated Rac1 signaling leading to ovarian tumor cell migration. Further analyses indicate that the adaptor molecule, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) that is bound to p185HER2 (an oncogene product), is also associated with the CD44v3-Vav2 complex. HA binding to SK-OV-3.ipl cells promotes recruitment of both Grb2 and p185HER2 to the CD44v3-Vav2 complex leading to Ras activation and ovarian tumor cell growth. In order to determine the role of Grb2 in CD44v3 signaling, we have transfected SK-OV-3.ipl cells with Grb2 mutant cDNAs (e.g. ΔN-Grb2 that has a deletion in the amino-terminal SH3 domain or ΔC-Grb2 that has a deletion in the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain). Our results clearly indicate that the SH3 domain deletion mutants of Grb2 (i.e. the ΔN-Grb2 (and to a lesser extent the ΔC-Grb2) mutant) not only block their association with p185HER2 but also significantly impair their binding to the CD44v3-Vav2 complex and inhibit HA/CD44v3-induced ovarian tumor cell behaviors. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the interaction of CD44v3-Vav2 with Grb2-p185HER2 plays an important role in the co-activation of both Rac1 and Ras signaling that is required for HA-mediated human ovarian tumor progression.

Apparently, both post-translational modifications and/or alternative splicing within the CD44 structure determine the functional outcome of this molecule.

Catterall J.B. Turner G.A. Cancer Lett. 1995; 91: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been postulated that CD44 interaction with HA may be one of the important requirements for the peritoneal spread of ovarian cancer. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the ability of CD44-positive ovarian tumor cells to migrate and implant at HA-enriched locations within the peritoneal cavity remain poorly understood, and the oncogenic mechanism(s) required for HA-activated and CD44-specific ovarian tumor progression remain(s) to be determined.Several lines of evidence indicate that the binding of HA to CD44 promotes Rac1 signaling and tumor cell activation (17Bourguignon L.Y.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1829-1838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) reports that the interaction between CD44v3 isoform and Tiam1, one of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs, the Dbl or DH family), up-regulates Rac1 signaling and cytoskeleton-mediated metastatic breast tumor progression. To date, at least 30 different GEFs have been identified (25Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 26Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the search for other CD44 isoform-linked GEFs, which correlate with metastatic behavior, a prime candidate, named Vav2, has been identified. Vav2 is a member of the Vav family of oncoproteins known to act as a GEF for RhoGTPases (e.g. Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42) in a phosphotyrosine-dependent manner (27Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The Vav molecule was first identified as an oncogene based on its ability to induce cell transformation following gene transfer using human tumor DNA (28Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Vav1 is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, whereas the homologous protein, Vav2, is now known to be expressed ubiquitously (29Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 30Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, Vav2 is a 95–100-kDa protein, which contains numerous functional domains and structural motifs found in signal transduction proteins and oncoproteins. These motifs include amino-terminal calponin homology/leucine-rich and acid-rich domains (31Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar), a Dbl homology domain (DH) (32Adams J.M. Houston H. Allen J. Lints T. Harvey R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 611-618PubMed Google Scholar, 33Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), a pleckstrin homology domain (PH) (34Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), a cysteine-rich zinc-binding domain (CR) (31Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar), and two src homology-3 (SH3) domains flanking a single SH2 domain (35Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Science. 1992; 256: 1196-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 36Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In particular, the sequence between aa 198 and 469 contains significant sequence homology to the DH of many proteins, which exhibit GDP/GTP exchange activity for specific members of the Ras superfamily of GTP-binding proteins (32Adams J.M. Houston H. Allen J. Lints T. Harvey R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 611-618PubMed Google Scholar, 33Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). In vitro, Vav2 has been clearly shown to act as a GDP/GTP exchange protein for the Rho subfamily of GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, RhoB, and RhoG (27Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10141-10149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, Vav2 contains one pleckstrin homology domain (PH), which is commonly detected in signaling molecules and cytoskeletal proteins (41Shaw G. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 42Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 2751899Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The PH domain may also mediate the association of Vav2 with the submembrane region of the cell via protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions (41Shaw G. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 42Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 2751899Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region of Vav2 contains an SH2 domain surrounded by two SH3 domains. Although its function is still unclear, this region may facilitate interactions with submembrane signaling complexes.It has been shown that overexpression of Vav2 is sufficient to activate its oncogenic potential (30Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). Vav2-induced cytoskeletal changes and cellular transformation are comparable, but not identical, to those induced by other members of the Dbl family of oncoproteins (30Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these sequence analyses of Vav2 suggest that Vav2 association with the transforming phenotype may be mediated via submembrane cytoskeletal regulation and/or activation of Rho family GTPases. Activation of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA has been shown to produce specific structural changes in the plasma membrane associated with cell movement such as lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fiber formation, respectively (43Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). The coordinated activation of these GTPases is considered to be a possible mechanism underlying tumor cell motility and migration, an obvious prerequisite for metastasis (9Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1099-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 10Bourguignon L.Y.W. Curr. Top.

Biosci. 1998; 3: 637-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).The HER2 oncogene (also called c-ErbB-2 or Neu) encodes an 185-kDa (p185HER2) membrane protein, which contains a single transmembrane spanning region, two cystine-rich extracellular domains, and a tyrosine kinase-associated cytoplasmic domain (44Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). This protein belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor subgroup of the receptor-linked tyrosine kinase superfamily (45Pele E. Yarden Y. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Overexpression or amplification of HER2 oncogene appears to correlate with poor survival rates of many known cancers including ovarian cancer (46Berchuck A. Kamel A. Whitaker R. Kerns B. Olt G.

Zhang T.-Q. Shi D.R. Cancer Lett. 1992; 61: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, the overall survival rate and time of relapse for patients with HER2 overexpression is significantly less than patients lacking HER2 overexpression (46Berchuck A. Kamel A. Whitaker R. Kerns B. Olt G. Kinney R. Soper J.T. Dodge R. Clarke-Pearson D.L. Marks P. McKenzie P. Yin S. Bast J.R.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4087-4091PubMed Google Scholar, 47Hung M.C. Zhang X. Yen D.-H.

Previous studies in transformed cells have also shown that guanidine nucleotide (GDP/GTP) exchange on Ras is stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation of p185HER2 and recruitment of the Sos exchange factor to the plasma membrane with the aid of the Grb2 adaptor protein (48Slamon D.J.

It appears that activation of p185HER2 tyrosine kinase leads to Ras-mediated stimulation of a downstream kinase cascade, which at least includes Raf-1/MEK/MAPK and MEKK-1/JNKK/JNK pathways leading to cell growth (48Slamon D.J.

Previously, we have determined that CD44 and p185HER2 are physically linked to each other via interchain disulfide bonds in human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cell line) (2Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H.B. Chu A. Zhang L. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27913-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Most importantly, HA binding to a CD44-associated p185HER2 complex activates the p185HER2 tyrosine kinase activity and promotes ovarian carcinoma cell growth (2Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H.B. Chu A. Zhang L. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27913-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). We believe that direct “cross-talk” between the two surface molecules, CD44 and the p185HER2, may be one of the most important signaling events in human ovarian carcinoma development.In this study we have investigated a CD44v3-Vav2 interaction with Grb2-linked p185HER2 in ovarian tumor cells in order to understand further the fundamental nature of tumorigenesis and metastasis in this lethal gynecological malignancy. By using a variety of biochemical and molecular biological techniques, we have found that both CD44v3 and Vav2 are overexpressed in human ovarian tumor cells (e.g. SK-OV-3.ipl cell line) and that CD44v3 is closely associated with Vav2 (in particular, the SH3-SH2-SH3 domain of Vav2) in SK-OV-3.ipl cells. Most importantly, we have established that the binding of HA to SK-OV-3.ipl cells stimulates CD44v3-specific Rac1 and Ras signaling and association of the linker molecule, Grb2, with CD44v3-Vav2 and p185HER2 leading to ovarian tumor cell migration and growth. Furthermore, transfection of SK-OV-3.ipl cells with Grb2 mutant cDNAs (ΔN-Grb2cDNA and to a lesser extent the ΔC-Grb2cDNA) significantly inhibits Grb2 association with CD44v3-Vav2 and p185HER2. Further analyses indicate that overexpression of the ΔN-Grb2 mutant (and to a lesser extent the ΔC-Grb2) not only significantly impairs both Rac1 and Ras signaling but also inhibits ovarian tumor cell migration and growth. These findings suggest that CD44v3-Vav2 interactions with Grb2-linked p185HER2 are involved in the stimulation of both Rac1 and Ras signaling leading to the concomitant activation of HA-mediated ovarian tumor cell migration and growth.RESULTSExpression of CD44v3 and Vav2 In Human Ovarian Tumor CellsCD44v3 ExpressionThe expression of CD44 variant (CD44v) isoforms is known to be closely correlated with oncogenic signaling and metastatic behavior of a variety of tumor cells including human ovarian tumor cells (2Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H.B. Chu A. Zhang L. Hung M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27913-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 11Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu D. Zhu H. Front.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7327-7336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The question of what CD44v isoform(s) is expressed in human ovarian tumor cells (e.g.SK-OV-3.ipl cells) is addressed in this study. By using a PCR primer pair to amplify between exon 5 and v3 (exon 7) by RT-PCR, we have detected the presence of one major v3-containing PCR product of ≈400 bp (Fig. 1A, lane 2, based on markers indicated in Fig. 1A, lane 1) in SK-OV-3.ipl cells. This v3-containing PCR product was then “one-step-cloned” into the pCRII vector from Invitrogen Corp. (San Diego, CA) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence confirms that this band belongs to the v3 exon insertion (data not shown). We believe that the RT-PCR is specific since no amplified fragment can be detected in samples incubated without reverse transcriptase (Fig. 1A, lane 3).In order to characterize CD44 protein expression in the human ovarian tumor cells (SK-OV-3.ipl cell line), we have utilized surface biotinylation techniques followed by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (recognizing a common determinant of the CD44 class of glycoproteins, including various variant isoforms) (Fig. 1B, lane 1) or a rabbit anti-CD44v3 antibody (recognizing a v3-specific sequence located at the membrane proximal region of the extracellular domain of CD44) (Fig. 1B, lane 3). Our results indicate that a single surface-biotinylated polypeptide (≈85 kDa) displaying immunological cross-reactivity with CD44 is preferentially expressed on the cell surface of human ovarian tumor cells (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). In particular, an anti-CD44v3 antibody capable of immunoprecipitating the 85-kDa surface-biotinylated protein (Fig. 1B, lane 3) further confirms that the CD44v3 protein is expressed on the surface of SK-OV-3.ipl cells. No CD44-containing material is observed in control samples when normal rat IgG or preimmune rabbit IgG is used in these experiments (Fig. 1B, lane 2 or lane 4).To determine whether CD44v3 is involved in HA binding, SK-OV-3.ipl cells were preincubated with a monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody that recognizes a common determinant of the CD44 class of glycoproteins including CD44v3 isoform followed by the addition of [3H]HA. As shown in TableI, monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (50 μg/ml) (but not normal rat IgG control (50 μg/ml)) significantly inhibits [3H]HA binding. In controls, SK-OV-3.ipl cells were also incubated with 125I-fibronectin. Our data also show that neither rat anti-CD44 antibody nor normal rat IgG is capable of blocking the interaction between certain surface molecule(s) and fibronectin (Table I). These findings support the notion that CD44v3 is the major HA receptor (but not the fibronectin receptor) on ovarian tumor cells. The v3 (or exon 7) insertion in the CD44v3 isoform has also been shown to contain heparin sulfate addition sites (62Bennett K. Jackson D.G. Simon J.C. Tanczos E. Peach R. Modrell B. Stamenkovic I.

Human CRH-R1e was characterized by the deletion of exons 3 and 4; exon 12 from CRH-R1f; exon 11, 27 base pairs (bp) of exon 10 and 28 bp of exon 12 from CRH-R1g and CRH-R1h by the addition of a cryptic exon. In mouse CRH-R1c exon 3 was spliced out; in mCRH-R1e exons 3 and 4 and in mCRH-R1f exon 11 were spliced from mRNA. CRH-R1 was expressed in all skin specimens in patterns dependent on the cell type, physiological status, and presence of pathology. CRH-R1a, the most prevalent form, was detected in almost all samples. Ultraviolet radiation (UV) changed the splicing pattern and induced or increased expression of CRH-R1a in cultured skin cells. Continuing UV treatment of succeeding generations of cells resulted in a progressive increase in the number of CRH-R1 isoforms, which suggests that receptor heterogeneity might favor cell survival. TPA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), forskolin, dbcAMP (N6, 2'-O-dibutyryladenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophospate sodium), and IBMX (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) also changed the splicing pattern. We suggest that a polymorphism of CRH-R1 expression is related to anatomic location, skin physiological or pathologic status, specific cell type, and external stress (UV), and that cAMP-dependent pathways and TPA may regulate CRH-R1."
https://openalex.org/W1575134115,"Members of the Rho family of small GTPases, such as Rho and Rac, are required for actin cytoskeletal reorganization during the migration of carcinoma cells. Phosphodiesterases are necessary for this migration because they alleviate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated inhibition of RhoA (O’Connor, K. L., Shaw, L. M., and Mercurio, A. M. (1998) J.

Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). This complex process involves dynamic and coordinated interactions among integrins, chemoattractant receptors, and the actin cytoskeleton, which result in actin polymerization at the leading edge and contraction of actin bundles within the cell body to promote translocation. These dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton are initiated by the engagement of chemoattractant and integrin receptors on the cell surface with the respective ligands. Such interactions trigger cascades of signaling events that result in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and consequent directed movement (3Condeelis J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 411-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To understand cell migration at a mechanistic level, these signaling events need to be defined and linked to both cell surface receptors and actin dynamics. Members of the Rho family of GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in particular, are considered to be key signaling intermediates for cell migration (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T.

These GTPases are activated by signaling pathways initiated at the cell surface and in their activated or GTP-bound state stimulate downstream effectors that regulate actin polymerization and actin-myosin contraction (1Horwitz A.R.

Despite considerable progress in understanding the function of the Rho GTPases, the mechanisms by which its activities are regulated by cell surface receptors and how this regulation relates to cell migration are unclear (10Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).Recent studies have highlighted an important role for cAMP metabolism in the migration of carcinoma cells and in the regulation of RhoA function. Specifically, we found that cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs)1 facilitate carcinoma cell migration as well as lamellae formation by lowering cAMP levels (11O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). More mechanistic studies have revealed that cAMP inhibits RhoA activity (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J.

In fact, based on these observations, the current study was initiated to test the hypothesis that PKA activity inhibits carcinoma cell migration. Surprisingly, we observed that chemoattractant-stimulated migration requires PKA activity as well as PDE activity. In other terms, our results infer that this migration is controlled by cAMP-dependent as well as cAMP inhibitory signaling mechanisms. We provide an explanation for this paradox by demonstrating that PKA is required for Rac activation by chemoattractants as well as β1 integrins, a function that contrasts with its inhibition of RhoA. An important implication of these findings is that localized fluctuations in the intracellular concentration of [cAMP]i may provide a spatial and temporal regulation of PKA activity that influences Rac and RhoA function.DISCUSSIONRecently, we established the importance of cAMP-dependent PDEs in the migration of carcinoma cells (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,11O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This PDE activity is needed to lower cAMP levels within the cell and facilitate activation of RhoA. In our current study, we show that either LPA- or EGF-stimulated migration involves not only cAMP-inhibitory signaling that requires PDE activity but also a cAMP-dependent mechanism mediated by PKA that involves Rac. Importantly, we find that the activation of Rac in carcinoma cells in response to either chemoattractant stimulation or β1integrin clustering requires PKA activity.Our results represent the first direct evidence that Rac activation can be controlled by cAMP/PKA. This finding is supported by other reports that have indirectly implicated Rac as a target of PKA. For example, PKA is necessary for cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells (24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process that is dependent on Rac (25Braga V. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Also, Rac was shown to be an intermediate in the PKA-dependent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (26Pomerance M. Abdullah H.-B. Kamerji S. Correze C. Blondeau J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40539-40546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we find that PKA is required for the Rac-dependent migration of carcinoma cells. In our study, we demonstrated that Rac activation in response to either β1 integrin clustering or chemoattractant stimulation is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of PKA and not by inhibition of phosphodiesterases. In support of this link between PKA and Rac activation, we reported that the Rac-independent migration of clone A colon carcinoma cells does not require PKA (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).An important implication of our findings is that PKA can contribute to the differential regulation of the Rac and Rho small GTPases. Recent studies (7Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) have indicated a reciprocal relationship between Rac and Rho activation and have provided evidence that Rac can inhibit Rho activity. Our data suggest that increased PKA activity would facilitate Rac activation and impede Rho activation and vice versa, thus facilitating their reciprocal relationship. We and others have shown that cAMP/PKA-mediated signaling has an inhibitory effect on RhoA activity (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Dong J.-M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The basis for this inhibition involves the direct phosphorylation of RhoA by PKA (12Dong J.-M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PKA stimulates Rac activation, however, is unlikely to involve its direct phosphorylation because Rac does not contain a consensus PKA phosphorylation site. PKA may regulate Rac indirectly by modifying the function of molecules that control Rac activation. For example, both Tiam-1 and Trio, which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors involved in Rac activation, have consensus PKA phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, Tiam-1 has been shown to be a target of LPA signaling (27Fleming I.N. Elliot C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and, therefore, may provide a link between PKA and Rac activation.The PKA dependence of Rac activation in the cells we examined contrasts with the reported PKA-mediated inhibition of Pak1 (28Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Pak1, which is a downstream effector of both Rac and Cdc42 (29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar), has been implicated in migration (30Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 31Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 32Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One explanation for this discrepancy is that Rac activation may require only a transient burst of PKA activity, a possibility that is supported by our data on PKA activation in response to β1 integrin clustering. The transient nature of PKA activation may permit Pak to be activated after complete Rac activation and diminution of PKA activity. Clearly, however, more studies are needed to understand the contribution of PKA to the regulation of Rac and Pak1 activation.Recent studies by our group and others have revealed that integrins are involved in the regulation of [cAMP]i and PKA activity (11O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Meyer C.J. Alenghar F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H.-J. Fabray B. Ingber D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 34Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, our finding that β1 integrins can activate PKA is in agreement with studies in other systems (24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Meyer C.J. Alenghar F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H.-J. Fabray B. Ingber D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Most likely, β1integrin signaling stimulates adenyl cyclase activity and, consequently, a localized rise in [cAMP]i that increases PKA activity. Given the established importance of heterotrimeric (ht) G proteins in adenyl cyclase activation and cAMP signaling, integrin-mediated PKA activation could be facilitated by heterotrimeric G proteins. In fact, several recent studies have provided evidence that supports this possibility. For example, mechanical stresses applied to the cell surface stimulate cAMP signaling by modulating local release of signals generated by activated integrins in a G protein-dependent manner (33Meyer C.J. Alenghar F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H.-J. Fabray B. Ingber D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Also, the αvβ3 integrin has been reported to activate ht-Gi by forming a complex with the integrin-associated protein CD47.An important conclusion from our experiments involving pharmacological inhibition of PDE and PKA is that these enzymes, whose activities are counter-opposed, function cooperatively to promote chemotactic migration. Their ability to signal cooperatively implies that these enzymes have distinct functions in migration. We suggest that they function together to create microgradients of cAMP/PKA within a cell that are important for migration. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that localized gradients of the [cAMP]i regulate growth cone movement (35Song H.-J. Ming G.-L. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1997; 388: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The formation of cAMP/PKA gradient within migrating cells may differentially influence Rac and Rho, resulting in spatial and temporal differences in the activation of Rac and Rho. Such differences could be manifested, for example, in the Rac-mediated lamellipodial protrusion and Rho-mediated contractility necessary for migration (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 2000; 286: 1102-1103Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar).PKA regulation of Rac activation may have another important consequence for directed migration. It has been argued that the attractant gradient across a migrating cell is insufficient to signal directionality and that the chemotactic signals at the leading edge need to be amplified to orient and polarize a cell (36Condeelis J.S. Wyckoff J.B. Bailly M. Pestell R. Lawrence D. Backer J. Segall J.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that PKA signaling may provide one mechanism for amplifying chemotactic signals. During chemotaxis, new β1 integrin contacts are formed at the leading edge of the cell in response to a chemoattractant gradient. It can be hypothesized that these new integrin contacts stimulate PKA and, as a consequence, amplify Rac activation. This scenario implies that activated Rac is localized at the leading edge of migrating cells. In fact, activated Rac has been localized at the leading edge of migrating cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology (37Kraynov V.L. Chamberlain C. Bokock G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac1 has been implicated in orientingDictyostelium (38Chung C.Y. Lee S. Briscoe C. Ellsworth C. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5225-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and lymphocytes (39del Pozo M.A. Vicente-Manzanares M. Tejedor R. Serrador J.M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) during chemotaxis. In this context, it is worth noting that the activation of β1 integrins leads to the recruitment and colocalization of a PKA regulatory subunit with integrin complexes and the subsequent activation of PKA (24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our findings highlight the importance of cAMP and PKA in the regulation of small GTPase function and migration and identify important venues for future work. Cell migration in response to growth factors and chemoattractants is essential for embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and the immune response (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 2000; 286: 1102-1103Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). It is also a major factor in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, including cancer (2Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Aznavoorian S. Liotta L.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 541-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). This complex process involves dynamic and coordinated interactions among integrins, chemoattractant receptors, and the actin cytoskeleton, which result in actin polymerization at the leading edge and contraction of actin bundles within the cell body to promote translocation. These dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton are initiated by the engagement of chemoattractant and integrin receptors on the cell surface with the respective ligands. Such interactions trigger cascades of signaling events that result in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton and consequent directed movement (3Condeelis J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 411-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). To understand cell migration at a mechanistic level, these signaling events need to be defined and linked to both cell surface receptors and actin dynamics. Members of the Rho family of GTPases, including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 in particular, are considered to be key signaling intermediates for cell migration (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T.

These GTPases are activated by signaling pathways initiated at the cell surface and in their activated or GTP-bound state stimulate downstream effectors that regulate actin polymerization and actin-myosin contraction (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 2000; 286: 1102-1103Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 9Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 9: 86-92Crossref Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Despite considerable progress in understanding the function of the Rho GTPases, the mechanisms by which its activities are regulated by cell surface receptors and how this regulation relates to cell migration are unclear (10Symons M. Settleman J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 415-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Recent studies have highlighted an important role for cAMP metabolism in the migration of carcinoma cells and in the regulation of RhoA function. Specifically, we found that cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs)1 facilitate carcinoma cell migration as well as lamellae formation by lowering cAMP levels (11O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M.

In fact, based on these observations, the current study was initiated to test the hypothesis that PKA activity inhibits carcinoma cell migration. Surprisingly, we observed that chemoattractant-stimulated migration requires PKA activity as well as PDE activity. In other terms, our results infer that this migration is controlled by cAMP-dependent as well as cAMP inhibitory signaling mechanisms. We provide an explanation for this paradox by demonstrating that PKA is required for Rac activation by chemoattractants as well as β1 integrins, a function that contrasts with its inhibition of RhoA. An important implication of these findings is that localized fluctuations in the intracellular concentration of [cAMP]i may provide a spatial and temporal regulation of PKA activity that influences Rac and RhoA function. DISCUSSIONRecently, we established the importance of cAMP-dependent PDEs in the migration of carcinoma cells (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,11O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This PDE activity is needed to lower cAMP levels within the cell and facilitate activation of RhoA. In our current study, we show that either LPA- or EGF-stimulated migration involves not only cAMP-inhibitory signaling that requires PDE activity but also a cAMP-dependent mechanism mediated by PKA that involves Rac. Importantly, we find that the activation of Rac in carcinoma cells in response to either chemoattractant stimulation or β1integrin clustering requires PKA activity.Our results represent the first direct evidence that Rac activation can be controlled by cAMP/PKA. This finding is supported by other reports that have indirectly implicated Rac as a target of PKA. For example, PKA is necessary for cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in epithelial cells (24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process that is dependent on Rac (25Braga V. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Also, Rac was shown to be an intermediate in the PKA-dependent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (26Pomerance M. Abdullah H.-B. Kamerji S. Correze C. Blondeau J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40539-40546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we find that PKA is required for the Rac-dependent migration of carcinoma cells. In our study, we demonstrated that Rac activation in response to either β1 integrin clustering or chemoattractant stimulation is blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of PKA and not by inhibition of phosphodiesterases. In support of this link between PKA and Rac activation, we reported that the Rac-independent migration of clone A colon carcinoma cells does not require PKA (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).An important implication of our findings is that PKA can contribute to the differential regulation of the Rac and Rho small GTPases. Recent studies (7Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar) have indicated a reciprocal relationship between Rac and Rho activation and have provided evidence that Rac can inhibit Rho activity. Our data suggest that increased PKA activity would facilitate Rac activation and impede Rho activation and vice versa, thus facilitating their reciprocal relationship. We and others have shown that cAMP/PKA-mediated signaling has an inhibitory effect on RhoA activity (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 12Dong J.-M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The basis for this inhibition involves the direct phosphorylation of RhoA by PKA (12Dong J.-M. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22554-22562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which PKA stimulates Rac activation, however, is unlikely to involve its direct phosphorylation because Rac does not contain a consensus PKA phosphorylation site. PKA may regulate Rac indirectly by modifying the function of molecules that control Rac activation. For example, both Tiam-1 and Trio, which are guanine nucleotide exchange factors involved in Rac activation, have consensus PKA phosphorylation sites. Interestingly, Tiam-1 has been shown to be a target of LPA signaling (27Fleming I.N. Elliot C.M. Collard J.G. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33105-33110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and, therefore, may provide a link between PKA and Rac activation.The PKA dependence of Rac activation in the cells we examined contrasts with the reported PKA-mediated inhibition of Pak1 (28Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Pak1, which is a downstream effector of both Rac and Cdc42 (29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar), has been implicated in migration (30Ren X.-D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 31Sells M.A. Boyd J.T. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 837-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 32Sells M.A. Pfaff A. Chernoff J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One explanation for this discrepancy is that Rac activation may require only a transient burst of PKA activity, a possibility that is supported by our data on PKA activation in response to β1 integrin clustering. The transient nature of PKA activation may permit Pak to be activated after complete Rac activation and diminution of PKA activity. Clearly, however, more studies are needed to understand the contribution of PKA to the regulation of Rac and Pak1 activation.Recent studies by our group and others have revealed that integrins are involved in the regulation of [cAMP]i and PKA activity (11O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 593-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33Meyer C.J. Alenghar F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H.-J. Fabray B. Ingber D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 34Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, our finding that β1 integrins can activate PKA is in agreement with studies in other systems (24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Meyer C.J. Alenghar F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H.-J. Fabray B. Ingber D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Most likely, β1integrin signaling stimulates adenyl cyclase activity and, consequently, a localized rise in [cAMP]i that increases PKA activity. Given the established importance of heterotrimeric (ht) G proteins in adenyl cyclase activation and cAMP signaling, integrin-mediated PKA activation could be facilitated by heterotrimeric G proteins. In fact, several recent studies have provided evidence that supports this possibility. For example, mechanical stresses applied to the cell surface stimulate cAMP signaling by modulating local release of signals generated by activated integrins in a G protein-dependent manner (33Meyer C.J. Alenghar F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H.-J. Fabray B. Ingber D.E. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Also, the αvβ3 integrin has been reported to activate ht-Gi by forming a complex with the integrin-associated protein CD47.An important conclusion from our experiments involving pharmacological inhibition of PDE and PKA is that these enzymes, whose activities are counter-opposed, function cooperatively to promote chemotactic migration. Their ability to signal cooperatively implies that these enzymes have distinct functions in migration. We suggest that they function together to create microgradients of cAMP/PKA within a cell that are important for migration. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that localized gradients of the [cAMP]i regulate growth cone movement (35Song H.-J. Ming G.-L. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1997; 388: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The formation of cAMP/PKA gradient within migrating cells may differentially influence Rac and Rho, resulting in spatial and temporal differences in the activation of Rac and Rho. Such differences could be manifested, for example, in the Rac-mediated lamellipodial protrusion and Rho-mediated contractility necessary for migration (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T. Science. 2000; 286: 1102-1103Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 29Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar).PKA regulation of Rac activation may have another important consequence for directed migration. It has been argued that the attractant gradient across a migrating cell is insufficient to signal directionality and that the chemotactic signals at the leading edge need to be amplified to orient and polarize a cell (36Condeelis J.S. Wyckoff J.B. Bailly M. Pestell R. Lawrence D. Backer J. Segall J.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2001; 11: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that PKA signaling may provide one mechanism for amplifying chemotactic signals. During chemotaxis, new β1 integrin contacts are formed at the leading edge of the cell in response to a chemoattractant gradient. It can be hypothesized that these new integrin contacts stimulate PKA and, as a consequence, amplify Rac activation. This scenario implies that activated Rac is localized at the leading edge of migrating cells. In fact, activated Rac has been localized at the leading edge of migrating cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) technology (37Kraynov V.L. Chamberlain C. Bokock G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rac1 has been implicated in orientingDictyostelium (38Chung C.Y. Lee S. Briscoe C. Ellsworth C. Firtel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5225-5230Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and lymphocytes (39del Pozo M.A. Vicente-Manzanares M. Tejedor R. Serrador J.M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) during chemotaxis. In this context, it is worth noting that the activation of β1 integrins leads to the recruitment and colocalization of a PKA regulatory subunit with integrin complexes and the subsequent activation of PKA (24Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, our findings highlight the importance of cAMP and PKA in the regulation of small GTPase function and migration and identify important venues for future work. Recently, we established the importance of cAMP-dependent PDEs in the migration of carcinoma cells (8O'Connor K.L. Nguyen B.-K. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,11O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This PDE activity is needed to lower cAMP levels within the cell and facilitate activation of RhoA. In our current study, we show that either LPA- or EGF-stimulated migration involves not only cAMP-inhibitory signaling that requires PDE activity but also a cAMP-dependent mechanism mediated by PKA that involves Rac. Importantly, we find that the activation of Rac in carcinoma cells in response to either chemoattractant stimulation or β1integrin clustering requires PKA activity.

Also, Rac was shown to be an intermediate in the PKA-dependent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone (26Pomerance M. Abdullah H.-B. Kamerji S. Correze C. Blondeau J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40539-40546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

Our data suggest that increased PKA activity would facilitate Rac activation and impede Rho activation and vice versa, thus facilitating their reciprocal relationship.

The PKA dependence of Rac activation in the cells we examined contrasts with the reported PKA-mediated inhibition of Pak1 (28Howe A.K. Juliano R.L. Nat.

Their ability to signal cooperatively implies that these enzymes have distinct functions in migration. We suggest that they function together to create microgradients of cAMP/PKA within a cell that are important for migration. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that localized gradients of the [cAMP]i regulate growth cone movement (35Song H.-J. Ming G.-L. Poo M.-M. Nature. 1997; 388: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The formation of cAMP/PKA gradient within migrating cells may differentially influence Rac and Rho, resulting in spatial and temporal differences in the activation of Rac and Rho. Such differences could be manifested, for example, in the Rac-mediated lamellipodial protrusion and Rho-mediated contractility necessary for migration (1Horwitz A.R. Parsons J.T.

PKA regulation of Rac activation may have another important consequence for directed migration. It has been argued that the attractant gradient across a migrating cell is insufficient to signal directionality and that the chemotactic signals at the leading edge need to be amplified to orient and polarize a cell (36Condeelis J.S.

https://openalex.org/W2060815067,"Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of pancreatic fibrosis and inflammation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) is a ligand-activated transcription factor which controls growth, differentiation, and inflammation in different tissues. Roles of PPAR-γ activation in PSCs are poorly characterized. Here we examined the effects of PPAR-γ ligands on the key parameters of PSC activation. PSCs were isolated from rat pancreas tissue, and used in their culture-activated, myofibroblast-like phenotype. Activation of PPAR-γ was induced with 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2(15d-PGJ2) or with troglitazone. Expression of PPAR-γ was predominantly localized in the nuclei, and PPAR-γ was transcriptionally active after ligand stimulation. PPAR-γ ligands inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-induced proliferation. This effect was associated with inhibition of cell cycle progression beyond the G1 phase. PPAR-γ ligands decreased α-smooth muscle actin protein expression and α1(I) procollagen and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) mRNA levels. Activation of PPAR-γ also resulted in the inhibition of inducible monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression. 15d-PGJ2, but not troglitazone, inhibited the degradation of IκB-α and consequent NF-κB activation. In conclusion, activation of PPAR-γ inhibited profibrogenic and proinflammatory actions in activated PSCs, suggesting a potential application of PPAR-γ ligands in the treatment of pancreatic fibrosis and inflammation.

In the normal pancreas, stellate cells are quiescent and can be identified by the presence of vitamin A-containing lipid droplets in the cytoplasm. In response to pancreatic injury or inflammation, they are transformed (“activated”) from their quiescent phenotype into highly proliferative myofibroblast-like cells. This process involves changes in cell morphology and gene expression and is characterized by the gradual loss of retinoid content, increased expression of the cytoskeletal protein α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and synthesis of type I collagen and other extracellular matrix components. Many of the morphological and metabolic changes associated with the activation of PSCs in animal models of fibrosis also occur when these cells are grown in culture on plastic (1Bachem M.G.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily originally reported to be expressed at high levels in adipose tissue and to play a critical role in adipocyte differentiation (6Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar, 7Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). Ligands of PPAR-γ include oxidative metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostaglandins of the J series such as 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) (8Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). Although the precise enzymatic pathway leading to 15d-PGJ2 generation is not completely understood, it has been shown that 15d-PGJ2 is produced in intact cells and organisms (9Gilroy D.W. Colville-Nash P.R. Willis D. Chivers J. Paul-Clark M.J. Willoughby D.A. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar) and is likely to represent a physiological ligand for PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ is also activated by antidiabetic drugs of the thiazolidinedione group such as troglitazone (10Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3469) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence that PPAR-γ is implicated as an important regulator of inflammatory and immune responses (11Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar, 12Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). PPAR-γ ligands were shown to inhibit the production of nitric oxide and macrophage-derived cytokines,i.e. tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6, at least in part by antagonizing the activation of transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (11Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3271) Google Scholar, 12Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). They also induce apoptosis in several types of cells including macrophages (13Chinetti G. Griglio S. Autonucci M. Torra I.P.

Although PPAR-γ gene expression is reportedly observed in a variety of tissues in addition to the adipose tissue, little is known about the pathophysiological relevance of PPAR-γ activation in PSCs. In this study, we examined the effects of PPAR-γ ligands on the activation of PSCs: proliferation, expression of α-SMA, expression of α1(I) procollagen and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) genes, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) production. We show here that PPAR-γ ligands inhibit these parameters of PSC activation, suggesting a potential application of PPAR-γ ligands in the treatment of pancreatic fibrosis and inflammation. 15d-PGJ2 and WY-14643, purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), were resuspended at 10 and 100 mm, respectively, in dimethyl sulfoxide. Poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), [α-32P]dCTP, and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Rat IL-1β and TNF-α were from Endogen (Woburn, MA). Recombinant rat platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant human epidermal growth factor was from Life Technologies, Inc. Rabbit antibody against IκB-α was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against PPAR-γ was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibodies against rat type I collagen and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) were from LSL Cosmo Bio (Tokyo, Japan). Troglitazone was kindly provided by Sankyo Pharmaceutical Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and dissolved at 10 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide. All other reagents were from Sigma unless specifically described. Rat PSCs were prepared as previously described using Nycodenz solution (2Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Applegate T.L. Norton I.D. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1998; 43: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Animal Care and Use Guidelines. Isolated stellate cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH), penicillin sodium, and streptomycin sulfate. All experiments were performed using cells between passages two and five. Cells were grown on 96-well flat-bottom plates for cell proliferation assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or on tissue culture dishes for other experiments. On the day of experiment, cells were refed with fresh medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum, incubated for 6 h, and treated with experimental reagents in the presence of 0.1% fetal bovine serum. We assessed PPAR-γ expression in activated PSCs by immunohistochemical staining. Culture-activated PSCs were grown directly on glass coverslips, and immunostaining for PPAR-γ was performed using a streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex detection kit (Histofine Kit; Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Incubations were performed at room temperature unless otherwise specified. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 10 min, and then endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in methanol with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. After immersion in normal rabbit serum for 1 h, the slides were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-PPAR-γ antibody diluted at 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline or rabbit immunoglobulin G at 4 °C overnight. The slides were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin antibody for 45 min followed by peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min. Finally, color was developed by incubating the slides for several minutes with diaminobenzidine (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan). Expression of α-SMA, type I collagen, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) was examined in a similar manner. The luciferase expression vector containing three PPAR-responsive elements (16Osada S. Tsukamoto T. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Osumi T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Takashi Osumi (Himeji Institute of Technology, Hyogo, Japan). The vector contains three copies of PPAR responsive element from the promoter of rat acyl coenzyme A oxidase. For the luciferase assay, ∼1 × 106 PSCs were transfected with 2 μg of the luciferase expression vector along with 40 ng of pRL-TK vector (Promega, Madison, WI) as an internal control, using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, the transfected cells were treated with 15d-PGJ2 (at 5 μm), troglitazone (at 10 μm), or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) for an additional 24 h. At the end of the incubation, cell lysates were prepared using a Pica Gene kit (Toyo Ink Co., Tokyo, Japan), and the light intensities were measured using a model Lumat LB9507 luminescence reader (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). PSCs (∼30% density) were treated with 15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone at various concentrations for 1 h and then stimulated with PDGF (at 10 ng/ml), fetal bovine serum (at 5%), or epidermal growth factor (at 5 ng/ml) for 72 h. Cell proliferation was assessed using a commercial kit (CellTiter nonradioactive cell proliferation assay, Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cell viability was determined by differences in absorbance at wavelength 570versus 690 nm. The cell cycle of PSCs was analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, serum-deprived PSCs (∼60–70% density) were treated with 15d-PGJ2 (5 μm), troglitazone (10 μm), or its vehicle for 1 h and then exposed to 10 ng/ml PDGF. After 24 h, cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.02% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml ribonuclease A. Samples were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 30 min and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Cell fluorescence was measured by FACSCaliber flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed using ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME) to determine the distribution of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle. Confluent PSCs were treated with PPAR-γ ligands at indicated concentrations for 30 min and then stimulated with IL-1β (at 10 ng/ml) or TNF-α (at 10 ng/ml). After 24 h, cell culture supernatants were harvested and stored at −80 °C until measurement. MCP-1 levels in the supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Endogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy total RNA preparation kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Ten μg of total RNA was separated on a 1% agarose-2.2 m formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane filter (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Blots were hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C to the32P-labeled DNA probes of MCP-1, α1(I) procollagen, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) generated by polymerase chain reaction. Specific primer sets were as follows (listed as 5′-3′, sense and antisense, respectively): MCP-1, AGCCAGATGCAGTTAATGCC and GGAAAAGAGAGTGGATGCAT; α1(I) procollagen, CCTGCTGGACCCCGAGGAAAC and TCACACCAGTATCACCAGGT; prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α), TACTTCCTCAGTGTTCAGCC and CATCCAGAGTTCTGTGTGGT. The PCR procedure consisted of 30 cycles at 94 °C (for 1 min), at 55 °C (for 1 min), and at 72 °C (for 1 min). The identity of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was confirmed by direct sequencing. After the hybridization, the filter was washed three times with 2× standard saline citrate (3m NaCl, 0.3 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 10 min. The washed filter was subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C overnight. Nuclear extracts were prepared, and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (17Masamune A. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9368-9375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes for NF-κB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts (∼5 μg) were incubated with the labeled oligonucleotide probe for 20 min at 22 °C and electrophoresed through a 4% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and autoradiographed at −80 °C overnight. A 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extracts for 10 min prior to the addition of the radiolabeled probe in the competition experiments. PSCs were treated with experimental reagents and lysed in SDS buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) for 15 min on ice. The samples were then sonicated for 2 s, heated for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12000 ×g for 5 min to remove insoluble cell debris. Whole cell extracts (∼100 μg protein) were fractionated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was incubated with the first antibody at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated), proteins were visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Differences between experimental groups were evaluated by the two-tailed unpaired Student'st test for other studies. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. It has been shown that PSCs are activated (express α-SMA) after ∼48 h of culture on plastic (2Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Applegate T.L. Norton I.D. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1998; 43: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, all experiments used passaged stellate cells, which were considered activated. Indeed, the fibrillary staining of α-SMA was observed by immunostaining (Fig.1A). We examined PPAR-γ expression by immunostaining. Culture-activated PSCs (on day 7, passage 2) showed positive staining of PPAR-γ predominantly in the nuclei (Fig. 1B). No immunoreactivity was observed when nonspecific rabbit immunoglobulin G was used (data not shown). We also investigated whether PPAR-γ exerts transcriptional effects in culture-activated PSCs. In cells transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid consisting of three copies of the PPAR-responsive element (16Osada S. Tsukamoto T. Takiguchi M. Mori M. Osumi T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), exposure to 15d-PGJ2 (at 5 μm) and troglitazone (at 10 μm) induced an ∼5-fold increase in the activity of the reporter gene (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that PPAR-γ is expressed and transcriptionally active after ligand stimulation in activated PSCs. It has been shown that PPAR-γ ligands modulate cell proliferation in several types of cells (13Chinetti G. Griglio S. Autonucci M. Torra I.P. Delerive P. Majd Z. Fruchart J.-C. Chapman J. Najib J. Staels B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25573-25580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 14Altiok S. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M.

Chem. 1998; 274: 17042-17048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We examined whether PPAR-γ ligands could modulate proliferation of PSCs. Consistent with the previous report (18Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Darby S.J. Rodgers S.C. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1999; 44: 534-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), PDGF induced an approximately 7-fold increase of cell proliferation in serum-free medium after 72 h (Fig.2A). PPAR-γ ligands (15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone) inhibited PDGF-induced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2A). The inhibitory effects were significant starting at 1 μm for 15d-PGJ2 and at 2.5 μmfor troglitazone. At 5 μm 15d-PGJ2 or 10 μm troglitazone, the stimulation of cell proliferation by PDGF was virtually abolished. In these experiments, 15d-PGJ2 and troglitazone up to these concentrations did not affect the cell viability during the incubation as assessed by a trypan blue exclusion test (data not shown). However, when PSCs were treated with PPAR-γ ligands above these concentrations, cytotoxic effects were observed during the incubation. Treatment with a different peroxisome proliferator, WY-14643, at the concentration (at 10 μm) able to activate the PPAR-α isoform did not inhibit PSC proliferation, but it did inhibit PSC proliferation at the concentration (at 100 μm) also able to activate PPAR-γ (19Willson T.M. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D. Henke B.R. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). We also tested the effects of PPAR-γ ligands on cell proliferation in response to epidermal growth factor or 10% fetal bovine serum. Serum-induced cell proliferation was inhibited by PPAR-γ ligands, although the inhibitory effects were less evident than in cells treated with PDGF (Fig. 2C). In addition, the proliferative response induced by epidermal growth factor was inhibited by PPAR-γ ligands (Fig. 2C), indicating that PPAR-γ ligands inhibit proliferation of PSCs independently of the mitogen used. We analyzed the cell cycle in PSCs in the presence or absence of PPAR-γ ligands. Exposure to PDGF was associated with a marked decrease in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase together with an increase in the number of cells in the S phase (Fig.3). The addition of the PPAR-γ ligands before PDGF reduced the number of cells in the S phase, and the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase was similar to the percentage observed in untreated cells. Thus, the addition of PPAR-γ ligands inhibited PDGF-induced progression of the cell cycle beyond the G1 phase. It has been shown that culture-activated PSCs express α-SMA and produce type I collagen. Indeed, α-SMA expression has been accepted as a marker of PSC activation (2Apte M.V. Haber P.S. Applegate T.L. Norton I.D. McCaughan G.W. Korsten M.A. Pirola R.C. Wilson J.S. Gut. 1998; 43: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), and in situhybridization techniques showed that α-SMA-positive cells were the principal source of collagen in the fibrotic pancreas (4Haber P.S. Keogh G.W. Apte M.V. Moran C.S. Stewart N.L. Crawford D.H. Pirola R.C. McCaughan G.W. Ramm G.A. Wilson J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 1087-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In agreement with the result of immunostaining, α-SMA expression was confirmed in culture-activated PSCs by Western blotting, and the treatment of PSCs with PPAR-γ ligands for 48 h significantly reduced α-SMA expression (Fig. 4A). We also examined the effects of PPAR-γ ligands on the expression of α1(I) procollagen and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) genes, both of which play a central role in the collagen synthesis. Type I collagen immunoreaction was detected predominantly intracellularly with the highest intensity in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4B). Prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) is also a key enzyme that catalyzes the formation of 4-hydroxyproline, an essential residue for the folding of the procollagen polypeptide chains into triple helical molecules (21Takahashi Y. Takahashi S. Shiga Y. Yoshimi T. Miura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14139-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Expression of prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) was observed strongly around the nuclei, and the expression spread toward the periphery of the cells (Fig. 4C). Steady-state mRNA levels of α1(I) procollagen and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) were high in culture-activated PSCs, and the levels were significantly decreased by PPAR-γ ligands after a 24-h incubation (Fig. 4D). Activated PSCs acquire the proinflammatory phenotype, and they may modulate the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells. One candidate may be MCP-1, a potent chemoattractant for monocytes and T lymphocytes (22Ben-Baruch A. Michiel D.F. Oppenheim J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11703-11706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α induced MCP-1 production in PSCs (Fig. 5A). Both of the PPAR-γ ligands decreased the inducible MCP-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The inhibitory effects were significant starting at 1 μm for both reagents. At concentrations as high as 5 μm15d-PGJ2 or 10 μm troglitazone, the MCP-1 induction was virtually abolished. We also examined the effects of PPAR-γ ligands on the MCP-1 gene expression by Northern blotting. Both IL-1β and TNF-α increased the level of MCP-1 mRNA, but the effect was inhibited in the presence of PPAR-γ ligands (Fig.5B), suggesting that PPAR-γ ligands inhibited MCP-1 expression at least in part at the transcriptional level. Because activation of NF-κB and AP-1 is important for MCP-1 expression in several types of cells (23Ueda A. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31029-31092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Martin T. Cardarelli P.M. Parry G.C.N. Felts K.A. Cobb R.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of PPAR-γ ligands on the activation of these transcription factors. We first examined the effect of PPAR-γ ligands on NF-κB binding activity by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Two NF-κB-specific DNA-protein complex formations were observed with nuclear proteins extracted from PSCs treated with IL-1β (Fig.6A). Preincubation of PSCs with 15d-PGJ2 decreased IL-1β-induced NF-κB binding activity, but troglitazone did not. Phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory protein IκB-α and the subsequent dissociation of this protein from NF-κB are thought to be necessary for the activation (25Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). We also examined the effect of PPAR-γ ligands on the level of IκB-α by Western blotting. In agreement with the result of electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 15d-PGJ2, but not troglitazone, inhibited IL-1β-induced degradation of IκB-α (Fig.6B). TNF-α also activated NF-κB, and the activation was inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 but not by troglitazone (data not shown). Neither 15d-PGJ2 nor troglitazone affected IL-1β- and TNF-α-induced AP-1-specific binding activity (Fig.7, data not shown).Figure 7PPAR-γ ligands did not alter IL-1β-induced AP-1 activation.PSCs were treated with 15d-PGJ2 or troglitazone at the indicated concentrations for 30 min and then stimulated with IL-1β (at 10 ng/ml). After 1 h, nuclear extracts were prepared, and specific binding activity of AP-1 was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following pancreatic injury, PSCs undergo a transformation from quiescent cells to activated proliferating myofibroblast-like cells, which produce cytokines and extracellular matrix proteins.

The present study demonstrated that two PPAR-γ ligands, the endogenously produced prostanoid, 15d-PGJ2, and troglitazone, inhibited key parameters of PSC activation including cell proliferation, α-SMA expression, α1(I) procollagen and prolyl 4-hydroxylase(α) gene expression, and MCP-1 production. Treatment with a different peroxisome proliferator, WY-14643, at the concentration able to activate the PPAR-α isoform did not inhibit PSC proliferation but did so at the concentration also able to activate PPAR-γ, suggesting that specific activation of PPAR-γ is necessary to inhibit PSC proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2144125902,"Although integrins are crucial for migration of leukocytes through endothelium, integrin-independent mechanisms appear to take over and mediate the migration of leukocytes through extracellular matrix (ECM) in a three-dimensional tissue microenvironment. Discoidin domain receptor (DDR) 1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by collagen, the most abundant ECM protein. In the present study, we detected that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils were induced to express DDR1 after incubation in RPMI 1640. The expression level of DDR1 in PBMC was increased further by stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, lipopolysaccharide, or phytohemagglutinin, but not with interferon-gamma. In vivo, DDR1 mRNA was detectable in mononuclear leukocytes infiltrating human renal tumor tissue. Among three DDR1 isoforms, DDR1alpha was the major transcript in leukocytes. Functionally, overexpression of either DDR1alpha or DDR1beta in THP-1 cells resulted in increased adherence to collagen-coated plates in a beta1-integrin independent manner. However, only DDR1alpha-, but not DDR1beta-, overexpressing cells exhibited marked pseudopod extension and migrated successfully through three-dimensional collagen lattices. Consequently, we propose that the interaction of DDR1alpha with collagen of the ECM results in a requisite intracellular signaling that enables leukocytes to migrate in a tissue microenvironment and participate in host defense."

We focused on nucleophosmin, also known as B23, which was identified as a candidate Myc-responsive gene from a subtractive hybridization screen, and we found that sequences in intron 1, and not 5′ sequences in the proximal promoter, are bound by c-Myc in vivo. Hence, a scanning chromatin immunoprecipitation (SChIP) strategy is useful in analyzing functional transcription factor-binding sites. The genetic program through which a specific transcription factor regulates a biological response is fundamental to our understanding how instructions in the genome are implemented.

Hence, a scanning chromatin immunoprecipitation (SChIP) strategy is useful in analyzing functional transcription factor-binding sites. The c-myc gene, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was first described more than 20 years ago as the cellular homolog to the v-myc oncogene. Several mechanisms including gene amplification, point mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements activate c-myc in human tumors. Myc mediates tumorigenesis through activation of genes involved in cell metabolism, proliferation, and apoptosis as well as repression of genes that may promote cellular differentiation and cell cycle arrest. Along with its heterodimeric partner Max, Myc binds to the canonical enhancer box (E box), 5′-CACGTG-3′, as well as noncanonical sequences in the regulatory regions of target genes, activating transcription (1Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Detailed mechanisms by which Myc represses transcription are yet unknown (1Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Through subtractive hybridization (2Lewis B. Shim H. Li Q. Wu C. Lee L. Maity A. Dang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4967-4978Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), serial analysis of gene expression (3Boon K. Caron H.N. van Asperen R. Valentijn L. Hermus M.C. van Sluice P. Roebuck I. Weirs I. Vote P.A. Schwa M. Vestige R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1383-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and, most recently, cDNA microarray analysis (4Guo Q.M. Malice R.L. Kim S. Chi C. He M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6378-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the full spectrum of genes affected by c-myc is beginning to emerge. Although elucidation of the functions of these genes may prove insightful for defining the role of Myc in both normal and pathologic cell growth and proliferation, mechanisms by which Myc alters gene expression levels remain largely unstudied. Numerous experiments strongly implicate a role for c-myc in promotion of cell growth (increase in cell size) that is independent of proliferation. A decrease in Drosophila Myc (d-myc) function results in small cell and body size, termed Minutes. In contrast, d-myc overexpression in the fly wing increases growth rate and cell mass (6Johnston L. Prober D. Edgar B. Eisenman R. Gallant P. Cell. 1999; 98: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In all stages of the cell cycle, increased lymphocyte cell size and protein synthesis rates are observed in transgenic mice overexpressing c-myc in B cells (7Iritani B. Eisenman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13180-13185Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The role of myc in cell growth is further substantiated by observations that aberrantly high c-myc expression increases hepatocyte size in vivo and correlates with increased mRNA levels of genes involved in protein synthesis including translation initiation factors, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, ribosomal proteins, and nucleolar proteins involved in ribosomal biogenesis such as nucleolin (C23) (8Kim S.

The link between the oncogenic effect of Myc and increased ribosomal biosynthesis is intriguing, in particular regarding the longstanding observation that a morphologic feature of neoplastic transformation is nucleolar hypertrophy. B23 is an abundant nucleolar phosphoprotein that interacts with C23 (12Liu H.T. Yung B.Y. Cancer Lett. 1999; 144: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and functions in the assembly and transport of ribosomes. Nucleic acid binding, ribonuclease, and molecular chaperone activities have been mapped on the B23 protein (13Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interestingly, B23 has also been shown to associate with unduplicated centrosomes. Upon phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclin E in late G1 of the cell cycle, B23 dissociates from centrosomes followed by initiation of centrosome duplication (14Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Dramatic increases in B23 mRNA and protein levels are observed in tumorigenic cells and in cells stimulated with various mitogens (15Feuerstein N. Spiegel S. Mond J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1629-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Feuerstein N. Mond J.J. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1818-1822PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies reveal an important role for B23 in cell growth and proliferation. Previous studies have shown that the expression of c-myc correlates with B23 expression (4Guo Q.M.

S. A. 2000; 97: 11198-11202Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Wild-type Rat1 fibroblasts maintain a B23 transcript level 3.5-fold higher than fibroblasts bearing a homozygous deletion ofmyc (4Guo Q.M. Malice R.L. Kim S. Chi C. He M. Ruff M. Sank K. Lee N.H. Dang C.V. Lieu E.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5922-5928PubMed Google Scholar). In myc-overexpressing avian bursal neoplasia, B23 transcript levels were 3.5-fold higher than in normal bursa (5Gnomon P.E. Rudely A. Jason C. Lording G. Thomas S.J. Brandvold K.A. Lee R. Burnside J. Delrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6378-6383Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Adenoviral transduction of c-myc into mice led to dramatic increase in liver B23 mRNA, which correlated with increasing Myc protein levels 3–5 days post-infection (8Kim S. Li Q. Dang C.V. Lee L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11198-11202Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All of these studies indicate that increased myc expression results in elevated B23 transcript level but evidence for the direct regulation of B23 by c-myc is lacking. Determining whether Myc directly or indirectly, through the induction of other transcription factors, regulates target genes is important in delineating the direct oncogenic effects of the Myc transcription factor (1Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). One approach taken to determine whether a Myc-responsive gene is a direct target is the use of the MycER system. However, these experiments do not reveal which cis-acting elements are important for transcriptional regulation by Myc. With the availability of the human genome sequence and antibodies against specific transcription factors, one can identify important regulatory sequences by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. With ChIP, formaldehyde-fixed chromatin is sheared and immunoprecipitated with a Myc antibody for example, and the resultant DNA assayed for specific DNA sequences by PCR. Recently, ChIP has been employed to demonstrate the recruitment of c-myc or N-myc to promoters of known targets (17Mac S.M. D'Cunha C.A. Farnham P.J. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 29: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Xu D. Popov N. Hou M. Wang Q. Bjorkholm M. Gruber A. Menkel A.R. Henriksson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3826-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 19Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, these studies had not used ChIP to distinguish between potential binding sites in a candidate target gene. The human B23 locus, which contains a number of potential Myc-binding sites including two adjacent canonical (5′-CACGTG-3′) sites in intron 1, is an ideal candidate for scanning with ChIP to identify Myc-associated DNA fragments. By using a quantitative ChIP assay to scan B23 and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we determined that sequences in or around intron 1 are bound preferentially by Myc in vivo and in vitro. Luciferase reporter assays further reveal that the intron 1 sequence, in contrast to sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site, respond to Myc in transient transfections. Thus, our study identifiesB23 as a direct c-myc target and provides proof-of-principle that the technique of scanning ChIP (SChIP), used with the emerging human genome data base, is effective in identifying transcription factor-binding sequences that are important for gene regulation. Rat1 fibroblasts expressing a fusion protein of Myc and the human estrogen receptor (MycER, a gift from J. M. Bishop, University of California, San Francisco) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (200 units/ml), and streptomycin (200 μg/ml). For MycER induction, cells were grown to confluency and then serum-starved (DMEM, 0.1% FBS) for 72 h. 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHTM) was added to a final concentration of 0.25 μm. To block protein synthesis, cycloheximide (CHX) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm 30 min prior to stimulation with 4-OHTM. TGR (wild-type rat fibroblast), H015 (c-myc null fibroblasts), and H015-myc (H015 cells stably expressing a c-myc transgene) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. For the serum stimulation experiments, confluent cells were cultured in 0.25% serum for 48 h before the cells were reactivated with the addition of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Human ATCC 2091 (skin fibroblasts) cells were maintained in DMEM plus 10% FBS. For serum starvation, cells at 70% confluence were switched to DMEM containing 0.1% FBS and incubated for 48 h prior to re-stimulation with serum. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of RNA was run on a 1.2% agarose, 0.7 m formaldehyde denaturing gel before transferring overnight to a nylon membrane (Nytran, Schleicher & Schuell). Rat B23, c-myc, vimentin, and 36B4 ribosomal cDNAs were isolated from plasmids and labeled using a random prime labeling kit. Hybridization signals were quantitated using a PhosphorImager. MycER cells were serum-starved for 72 h before stimulation with either CHX only or CHX plus 4-OHTM for 2 h. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to suppressive subtractive hybridization following the kit's protocol (PCR-Select from CLONTECH). Subtractive products were cloned into pBluescript and screened using PCR-Select Differential Screening kit from CLONTECH. A detailed protocol for formaldehyde cross-linking and chromatin immunoprecipitation has already been published (20Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz; anti-Myc sc-764 and anti-E2F4 sc-1082) were used to precipitate chromatin from 2 × 107 cells. Total input samples were resuspended in 100 μl of TE and were diluted an additional 10-fold before PCR. Immunoprecipitated samples and no antibody controls were resuspended in 30 μl of TE. 1 μl from each sample was analyzed by PCR. PCR was carried out as follows: 1 μl of DNA sample, 0.5 μm each primer, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm each dNTPs, 1× Taq buffer (Promega), 1.25 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) in a total volume of 20 μl. After 35 cycles of amplification, the PCR products were analyzed by ethidium bromide staining of a 1.2% agarose gel. Primers used for PCR of rat ChIP samples were designed either directly from rat genomic sequence or from conserved regions determined from the aligned sequences from at least two species (when rat sequence was not available). For the human ChIP samples, primers were designed from human genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession NT006907) obtained from the public data base.

The kit amplification protocol was followed except for the primer and MgCl2 concentrations that were as stated above. Known quantities of total input DNA were used as standards. 10-Fold serial dilutions of the 2-h serum-stimulated 2091 total input DNA were used to determine the linear range of amplification for each of theB23 primer pairs. Two dilutions of the ChIP samples were amplified to ensure that the quantitation of the products fell in the linear range of the total input DNA. Relative abundance of eachB23 fragment was compared after normalization of the quantity of each fragment in the 2-h ChIP sample to the quantity in the total input DNA sample. A 350-bp region from the humanB23 gene (−274 to +87, +1 is the transcriptional start site) that contains three putative c-myc binding sites was PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pGL2-promoter vector (Promega). Forty-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides containing sequence from intron 1 of B23 with either wild-type (5′-CACGTG-3′) or mutant (5′-CCCGGG-3′) E boxes were synthesized (Life Technologies, Inc.) and cloned into the pGL2-promoter vector. To assess the ability of Myc to transactivate these luciferase reporter constructs, subconfluent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected (Lipofectin, Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2 μg of reporter plasmid and various amounts of either murine leukemia virus-long terminal repeat-driven plasmids expressing wild-type Myc or a mutant Myc that lacks transformation function (deletion of amino acids 106–143, Asp-106–143). The total DNA was equalized in each transfection by adding various amounts of empty murine leukemia virus-long terminal repeat vector. Luciferase activity was assayed with a luminometer 48 h after transfection following the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). Additional 40-bp double-stranded oligonucleotides, containing the noncanonical wild-type (5′-CACGCG-3′) or mutant (5′-CCCGGG-3′) E box most proximal to theB23 transcriptional start site, were synthesized. These oligonucleotides, along with those used in the transactivation experiments, were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide (New England Biolabs) kinase following a standard protocol and purified using Qiaquick nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). For the binding assays, 20-μl reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature in 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT with 0.5 ng of labeled oligonucleotides and total protein ranging from 0.5 to 250 ng. Gels were pre-run at 150 V for 1–2 h in 0.5× TBE. The 6% acrylamide gels were loaded with the entire binding reactions and run for ∼2 h. Myc-Max heterodimers (gift of Nair and Burley) contain DNA binding domains from both proteins (Myc, amino acids 353–434; Max, amino acids 22–103) and were disulfide cross-linked. For the competition experiments, 100 ng of protein were incubated with the wild-type probe and either wild-type or double mutant cold oligonucleotide (100 ng to 5 μg). Gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) for quantitation of percent probe bound. To identify transcripts that are directly regulated by Myc, we utilized a previously described (21Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar) Rat1 fibroblast cell line expressing MycER, a fusion protein consisting of Myc and the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor. When these cells are exposed to 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHTM), the ligand-bound MycER protein disengages from the cytoplasmic chaperone protein HSP-90 and translocates to the nucleus where it activates or represses transcription of Myc target genes. Because the MycER protein is constitutively expressed, protein synthesis inhibitors do not block its function but do block additional protein synthesis. Incubation of the cells with CHX 30 min prior to exposure with 4-OHTM allows only transcription of direct Myc targets. Suppressive subtractive hybridization was performed on MycER cells incubated for 2 h with either CHX plus 4-OHTM or with CHX alone. B23 was 1 of 12 up-regulated clones detected in this screen. To confirm that B23 is directly induced by c-myc in these cells, two independent MycER inductions were performed and analyzed for B23 mRNA levels. After normalization to the36B4 (10Greasley P. Bonnard C. Amati B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 446-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) loading control, B23 transcript levels increased ∼3-fold in cells treated for 8–10 h with either 4-OHTM alone or with 4-OHTM and CHX (Fig.1 A). We sought to determine whether serum could induce B23 expression in a Myc-dependent fashion. Because c-myc is an immediate early serum-response gene, target genes that are strictly dependent on c-myc should have at least two characteristics. First, target gene expression should follow c-myc expression upon serum stimulation of quiescent cells. Second, expression of the target gene should not be induced in serum-stimulated cells lacking c-myc. Both serum-deprived HO15 (myc −/−) and TGR (myc +/+) cells were serum-stimulated over a 24-h period. Total RNA was isolated at various time points and used for Northern blot analysis ofB23, c-myc, and vimentin transcript levels. As expected, c-myc transcription was induced within 1-h following stimulation of the TGR (myc +/+) cells but was absent in the myc nullizygous cells. B23 mRNA levels began to increase 8 h after serum stimulation of TGR cells and reached levels of 3.5-fold higher than the 0-h time point (Fig.1 B). This induction of the B23 transcript was absent in H015 cells, suggesting that serum induction of B23 expression is Myc-dependent. By having observed that B23 may be directly induced by Myc, we sought to determine whether Myc binds the B23 promoter region in vivo. To this end, we employed the ChIP assay with TGR, H015, and H015 cells stably expressing a c-myc transgene (H015-myc). This rat fibroblast system has been effectively used with ChIP for the characterization of several known Myc targets (19Frank S.R. Schroeder M. Fernandez P. Taubert S. Amati B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2069-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Chromatin from log phase cells was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Myc or E2F4. PCR amplification detectedB23, as well as other known c-myc targets (LDH-A, C23, cad), in the TGR and H015-myc samples but not in the H015 DNA that were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 A). Albumin and vimentin, which are either not expressed or not regulated by Myc, respectively, were not detected in the immunoprecipitate. To ensure that the H015 chromatin could be immunoprecipitated, we used an anti-E2F4 antibody as a control. Antibodies to E2F proteins, a family of transcription factors that associate with pocket proteins and play an important role in regulation of gene expression at the G1/S phase transition of the cell cycle, have been used previously to determine promoter occupancy of target genes (22Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Most promoters analyzed were prominently bound by E2F4. In parallel ChIP assays, both the Myc and E2F4 antibodies precipitated theB23 5′ sequences from TGR cells, and only the E2F4 antibody precipitated B23 sequences in the myc null HO15 cells. By contrast, C23, which does not contain an E2F-binding site in its promoter, was only detected in the anti-Myc antibody-precipitated sample (Fig. 2 B). To substantiate further our observations of Myc-dependent serum stimulation of B23 expression, we performed ChIP with TGR cells that were serum-stimulated for 0, 4, 8, or 16 h. As very little Myc is expressed in serum-deprived fibroblasts, very littleB23 and no C23 promoter DNA was detected in the 0-h sample when anti-Myc was used as the precipitating antibody. The quantity of ChIP DNA from both genes increased dramatically at 4 h and remained high to 16 h post-serum stimulation (Fig.2 C). Again, C23 promoter DNA was not detected in any of the anti-E2F4 samples. Interestingly, E2F4 is bound at theB23 promoter at all time points examined. This result is consistent with previous data suggesting that E2F4 is bound to certain promoters from G0 through S phase of the cell cycle (22Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The emergence of the complete human genome sequence provides a unique opportunity to exploit ChIP for the identification of transcription factor binding sequences. From the human B23 genomic locus, we analyzed 3 kb of sequence, which includes 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site, exon 1 and most of intron 1, for Myc binding sites. Two canonical E boxes (5′-CACGTG-3′) were found 10 bp apart in intron 1. Six non-canonical sites also were found, three within 250 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site and three within intron 1 (Fig.3 A). To determine where in this region Myc preferentially binds, we designed PCR primers to amplify ∼350-bp fragments to scan the 5′-regulatory and intron 1B23 sequences by ChIP. Human skin fibroblasts, ATCC 2091, were serum-stimulated for 0 or 2 h. Chromatin was collected, and ChIP analysis was performed using an antibody against Myc (Fig.3 B). Western blot analysis revealed that Myc level is very low at 0 h and peaks at 2 h following serum stimulation in these cells (data not shown). Quantitative analysis using SYBR green and real time PCR revealed that the fragment containing the two canonical E boxes is significantly more abundant than the otherB23-amplified fragments in the 2-h serum-stimulated ChIP sample (Fig. 3 C). To ensure that the fragments amplified represent B23 sequences, we sequence-verified all four fragments. To determine which sequences are important for transcriptional activation of B23 by Myc, we performed reporter assays with luciferase constructs containing sequences from B23 intron 1 or sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site. A reporter construct containing three noncanonical Myc-binding sites from the upstream regulatory region (B23–350) had minimal activity in this assay (Fig. 4 A). However, a reporter construct containing 40 bp from intron 1 with the two canonical E boxes (B23 E boxes) exhibited a 4-fold higher activity than the empty plasmid control. This activity is both E box- and Myc-dependent. Mutation of both E boxes from 5′-CACGTG-3′ to 5′-CCCGGG-3′ (B23 mut) completely abrogates this activity. As expected, a transformation-deficient Myc mutant (Asp-106–143) was inactive when assayed with any of our B23 reporter constructs (23Stone J. de Lange T. Ramsay G. Jokobovits E. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Lee W.M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1697-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The three noncanonical Myc-binding sites in the B23 promoter are identical in sequence (5′-CACGCG-3′). Previously, it was shownin vitro that Myc can bind the noncanonical, 5′-CACGCG-3′, and the canonical, 5′-CACGTG-3′, sequences with similar affinity (24Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Our ChIP data, however, suggest that Myc binds more efficiently to the canonical E boxes at the B23 locus in vivo. To evaluate the extent to which Myc binds these sequences in vitro, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using 40 bp double-stranded oligonucleotides containing both the canonical and noncanonical binding sites in the context of the B23 genomic sequence (for oligonucleotide sequences, see TableII). The Myc-Max complex bound an oligonucleotide containing the wild-type E boxes from intron 1 but not an oligonucleotide in which both E boxes have been mutated. This interaction is specific because increasing concentrations of unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide competed for binding with Myc-Max but the mutant oligonucleotide could not (Fig. 4 B). Next, we measured the relative binding of Myc to the canonical and noncanonical E boxes in B23 by comparing an oligonucleotide containing a single noncanonical binding site most proximal to the transcriptional start site with an oligonucleotide containing one intact E box from intron 1 (the other E box sequence was changed to 5′-CCCGGG-3′). As seen in Fig. 4, C and D, the percent of probe bound by Myc-Max is about 3 times greater with the canonical E box oligonucleotide than the oligonucleotide with the non-canonical binding site. Additional evidence suggests that sequences flanking the E boxes are also important for Myc binding (Fig.5). Taken together, our ChIP, transactivation and gel shift assays suggest that thecis-acting elements in the 5′ end of the gene that are most important for activation of B23 by c-myc are the two canonical E boxes in intron 1 of the human locus.Table IISequences of oligonucleotides used in gel shift assays 5′ 10 20 30 3′ ccgctgggagCACGTGgttgcCACGTGgttgggggagcB23 intron 1 E boxes (wt E boxes fig 4B) ccgctgggagCCCGGGgttgcCCCGGGgttgggggagcB23 intron 1 double mutant (mut E boxes Fig 4B) ccgcaaccgctgggagCACGTGgttgcCCCGGGgttggB23 intron 1 single E box (CACGTG oligo Fig 4C) gtgggagggcttcggagCACGCGcgcggaggcgggacttgWild-type B23 upsteam E box (CACGCG oligo Fig 4C) gtgggagggcttcggagCCCGGGcgcggaggcgggacttgMutant B23 upstream E box (CCCGGG oligo Fig 4D) Wild-type and mutant-binding sites are capitalized. Open table in a new tab Wild-type and mutant-binding sites are capitalized. Understanding the biological consequences of transcription requires the identification of genes that are directly regulated by specific transcription factors. Our approach, SChIP, provides a powerful new way not only to verify genes directly regulated by Myc but also to identify precisely sequences important for transcriptional regulation. Until recently, the MycER system was the only tool available to provide evidence that a gene is directly regulated by Myc. Increasingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation is utilized to demonstrate the direct binding of Myc to target genes in vivo thus strengthening the evidence that Myc regulates transcription of these genes (20Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Upon identification of B23 as a direct Myc target in the MycER system, we used ChIP with the available rat genomic sequence and found that a Myc antibody can precipitate the 5′ region of the rat gene in wild-type fibroblasts (TGR) but not in c-myc null cells. The previously described c-myc targets cad, LDH-A, and C23, which contain 1, 2, or 4 canonical E boxes in their regulatory regions, respectively, were also precipitated by anti-Myc antibody in this assay. Interestingly, in c-myc null cells ectopically overexpressing Myc, there appears to be an enrichment of these target gene sequences in the ChIP assay over that seen in wild-type cells. We speculate from this observation that elevated Myc protein levels increase the number of target gene sites bound by Myc in a population of cells. Our use of ChIP has revealed the dynamic association of c-Myc to its genomic targets in the experimental model of serum-stimulated fibroblast growth. Upon serum stimulation of quiescent cells,myc RNA and protein levels increase dramatically within the first 2 h. ChIP analysis of the B23 and C23 promoters revealed that little or no Myc protein is bound in quiescent rat fibroblasts. Association of Myc with B23 and C23 sequences increases significantly by 4 h and remains high until 16 h post-serum stimulation. This correlates well with our observation that steady state B23 mRNA levels begin to increase in these cells 8 h following serum stimulation. A somewhat different result is observed upon serum stimulation of human fibroblasts. In quiescent cells, we detected low levels of Myc binding at both the B23 (Fig. 3) and C23 (data not shown) sequences that greatly increased after 2 h of serum stimulation. The rat fibroblasts are an immortalized cell line whereas the human cells are primary fibroblasts assayed after only 7 passages in culture. Thus, these observations may reflect differences between species of origin or the immortalization state of the cells. Because the public human genome sequence data base is richer than that of any other mammalian model organism, we utilized ChIP to scan a model human Myc target gene. It is known that Myc can bind to canonical (5′-CACGTG-3′) as well as numerous non-canonical DNA sequences bothin vitro (24Blackwell T.K. Huang J. Ma A. Kretzner L. Alt F.W. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5216-5224Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and in vivo (25Grandori C. Mac J. Siebelt F. Ayer D. Eisenman R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4344-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It is often the case that many putative Myc-binding sites lie throughout a target gene. Complete sequencing of the much smaller yeast genome has facilitated a ChIP approach to locate genomic binding loci of DNA-binding proteins (26Ren B. Robert F. Wyrick J.J. Aparicio O. Jennings E.G. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Schreiber J. Hannett N. Kanin E. Volkert T.L. Wilson C.J. Bell S.P. Young R.A. Science. 2000; 290: 2306-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1588) Google Scholar). With the nearly complete human genome sequence available, it has become feasible to screen large genomic regions for potential Myc-binding sites. With sequence in hand, it becomes plausible to design ChIP experiments that scan a large region of DNA to identify which sites are bound by Myc. The human B23 gene contains 2 canonical and 6 noncanonical Myc-binding sites in the 3 kb of sequence surrounding the transcriptional start site. Our quantitative scanning ChIP analysis of this region revealed that the 350-bp sequence containing the 2 E boxes as well as 2 noncanonical sites in intron 1 was enriched 10–20-fold over adjacent sequences of similar size that contain either 1, 3, or no noncanonical sites. Such a strong association, which is corroborated by our gel shift assays and transactivation studies, implies that these sites are important for the transcriptional regulation of B23 by Myc. We surmise that the combination of human genomic DNA sequence analysis with ChIP is a powerful new approach for studying DNA binding of any transcription factor. Specifically, in the case of Myc, one can begin to discriminate among putative binding sites within a candidate gene to determine which ones are relevant for transcriptional regulation. Our studies with B23 as a model target provide evidence that supports the feasibility of using SChIP. SChIP provides a novel approach to facilitate our understanding of the dynamic binding of transcription factors that regulate the complex circuitry of genes induced under different physiological or pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1523616760,"Polyglutamine protein aggregation is associated with eight inherited neurodegenerative disorders. In Huntington's disease, N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form intracellular aggregates and mediate cellular toxicity. Recent studies have shown that chaperones inhibit polyglutamine-mediated aggregation and cellular toxicity. Because chaperones also inhibit caspase activation to protect cells from death, it remains unclear whether the protective effect of chaperones on polyglutamine-mediated cellular toxicity is dependent on their inhibition of protein aggregation. In this study, we show that several chaperones including HSP 40, HSP 70, and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor can inhibit cellular toxicity caused by N-terminal mutant huntingtin fragments. However, only HSP 40 is able to inhibit huntingtin aggregation. Furthermore, time-course study suggests that the protection of chaperones against huntingtin toxicity is not the result of their suppression of huntingtin aggregation. Chaperones inhibit caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation mediated by mutant huntingtin, and this inhibition is independent of huntingtin aggregation. We propose that the inhibition of caspase activity by chaperones is involved in their suppression of polyglutamine toxicity.

Among them, HSP 40 is a cofactor for HSP 70, an ATPase whose expression is up-regulated by a variety of cellular stresses (21Silver P.A. Way J.C.

The fact that chaperones inhibit both polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity logically raises the possibility that they protect against polyglutamine-mediated cellular toxicity by suppressing polyglutamine aggregation (10Carmichael J.

Although the latter possibility explains the finding that in Drosophila polyglutamine models chaperones suppress neurodegeneration but not intranuclear aggregates (29Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 30Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Benzer S. Science. 2000; 287: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), it is still unclear whether the inhibition of aggregates in the cytoplasm is required for the protective effects of chaperones. Because understanding the mechanism of protection of the chaperone will help find targets for treating polyglutamine diseases, it is important to investigate how chaperones protect cells from polyglutamine-mediated toxicity. In this study, we examined the relationship between huntingtin aggregation and the protective effects of several different chaperone molecules including N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) that is an ATPase and enriched in neuronal cells (31Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 32Haas A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 471-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The studies demonstrate that the suppression of cellular toxicity by chaperones is independent of huntingtin aggregation in either the nucleus or the cytoplasm. The protective effects of chaperones are commonly associated with their suppression of caspase activation. We propose that the protection of chaperones against polyglutamine toxicity is more likely to relate to their inhibition of caspase activity. Reverse transcription-PCR using RNAs from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells was performed to isolate full-length cDNAs for human HSP 70, HSP 40, and NSF. HSP 70 cDNA was isolated with a sense nucleotide primer 5′-CAGAAGGATCCATGGCCAAAGC-3′ and an antisense primer 5′-GGAATTCATCTACCTCCTCAATGG-3′. HSP 40 cDNA was isolated using a sense primer 5′-GAGGGATCCATGGGTAAAGACTAC-3′ and an antisense primer 5′-GAATTCTATTGGAAGAACCTGCTC-3′. NSF cDNA was isolated using a sense primer 5′-GGATCGATCGAGCGCAGAGCTG-3′ and an antisense primer 5′-CAGAATTCATCGAAATCAAGGGGG-3′. The PCR products were subcloned into the PRK-HA vector, which provides the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) at the C termini of the expressed proteins (33Li S.H. Lam S. Cheng A.L. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2859-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Huntingtin DNA constructs in the PRK vectors were obtained from our previous studies (33Li S.H. Lam S. Cheng A.L. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2859-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These DNA constructs encode the HD exon1 proteins with 20 or 120–150 glutamines. The nuclear localization sequence (NLS) PKKKRKV of the SV large T antigen was placed at the N terminus of huntingtin to generate NLS-tagged huntingtin. Red fluorescence protein (RFP,CLONTECH) was also inserted into the PRK vector for expression in HEK293 cells. The DNA constructs were sequenced at the Emory DNA core facility. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. The subconfluent (80%) HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μg/ml LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) per well. For co-transfection, huntingtin and chaperone or RFP cDNAs were mixed together to transfect HEK293 cells. Western blotting was used to find amounts of co-transfected cDNAs that gave rise to the protein expression level equivalent to that with transfection of only one type of cDNA. The same amounts of huntingtin cDNA and the PRK vector were used for expression of huntingtin alone in HEK293 cells. The control was PRK vector transfection alone. Primary neuronal culture was performed using the same method as described in our previous study (6Li H. Li S.H. Johnston H. Shelbourne P.F. Li X.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Neurons were isolated from the striatum of embryonic day 14–16 rats and cultured in neurobasal/B27 medium. For transfection, 7-day-striatal neurons were transfected with cDNAs encoding the HD exon1 proteins containing 120 (120Q) glutamine repeats or co-transfected with the cDNAs encoding chaperones HSP 70, HSP 40, or NSF using theCaPO4precipitation method. For Western blotting, transfected cells were collected and solubilized in the SDS sample buffer. The protein samples were then resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with rabbit EM48 antibody or mouse anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). EM48 was generated in our previous study using glutathione S-transferase fusion protein antigen containing the first 256 amino acids of human huntingtin with a deletion of polyglutamine and polyproline stretches (6Li H. Li S.H. Johnston H. Shelbourne P.F. Li X.J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). For filter trap assays, the pellet fraction (13,000 × g for 10 min) of the disrupted cells was treated with 2% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, sonicated for 10 s, and filtered through a cellulose acetate membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, 0.2-μm pore size). A Dot-blot filtration unit was used for filter trap assays (8Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The SDS-insoluble aggregates that were retained on the filters were detected by incubation with EM48 followed by detection using a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Transfected cells for immunofluorescent labeling were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, preincubated with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Primary antibodies (1:500 dilution) and secondary antibody conjugated with either fluorescein isothocyanate or rhodamine (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used for immunofluorescence staining. Hoechst dye (1 μg/ml) was used to label the nuclei. Cell viability was determined by a modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTS) assay (Cell Titer 96, Promega) as described in our previous study (33Li S.H. Lam S. Cheng A.L. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2859-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were transferred onto 96-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well in serum-free medium, and 20 μl of MTS reagent (2.1 mg/ml) was added to each well. The cells were then incubated for 45–60 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The reaction was stopped by adding 25 μl of 10% SDS. The plates were read with a microplate reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS, Molecular Devices, Palo Alto, CA) at 490 nm. Each data point was obtained using a triplet assay, and vector transfection served as a control. Fluorometric assays of caspase-3 and caspase-9 activity (33Li S.H. Lam S. Cheng A.L. Li X.J. Hum. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 5: 14545-14548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were performed using kits obtained from Bio-Rad. Cultured HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with mutant huntingtin 120Q or NLS-150Q or co-transfected with huntingtin and chaperone for 24 or 48 h in 6-well plates. After cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4/NaHPO4, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate). To measure caspase activity, 200 μl of assay buffer (40 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS, 20% sucrose) were added to a tube with a final concentration of 10 ng/μl of the peptide substrate (Ac-DEVD-AFC) for caspase-3 and LEHD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl cumarin for caspase-9. Cell lysates (200 μg of protein) were added to the tube to start the reaction. When the caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-Fmk) was used to measure the specificity of the assay, it was added to cell lysates at a concentration of 50 μm for 30 min before the addition of the specific caspase substrate. Background was obtained with the same assay buffer without cell lysates. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h followed by the measurement of the caspase activity with a fluorescence plate reader (Fluostar Galaxy, BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC) set at 390 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. To examine the cleavage of caspase-9, a rabbit polyclonal antibody against human caspase-9 (35Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) was used for Western blotting. All values were obtained from 3–5 independent experiments and expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was assessed by using Student’s t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To study the effects of chaperones on the aggregation of mutant huntingtin, we transfected the HD exon1 protein containing 120Q in HEK293 cells. Using EM48, an antibody that specifically recognizes huntingtin aggregates (5Gutekunst C.A. Li S.H. Yi H. Mulroy J.S. Kuemmerle S. Jones R. Rye D. Ferrante R.J. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J.

Genet. 2000; 25: 385-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we observed abundant aggregates in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. More huntingtin aggregates were seen at 48 h than at 24 h after transfection, indicating that the aggregation of mutant huntingtin increased over time (Fig.1). Most huntingtin aggregates, however, were in the cytoplasm or the perinuclear region. When the mutant huntingtin (150Q) was tagged with nuclear localization sequences (NLS-150Q), most of the NLS-tagged huntingtin was localized in the nuclei of transfected cells. However, a 24-h transfection of NLS-150Q resulted in a diffuse distribution of huntingtin in the nuclei of most transfected cells. At 48 h, more intranuclear aggregates were seen (Fig. 1), indicating that the extent of huntingtin aggregation in the nuclei also increased as the time for huntingtin expression was prolonged. Because nuclear aggregation of polyglutamine proteins is not influenced by chaperones (29Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 30Kazemi-Esfarjani P. Benzer S. Science. 2000; 287: 1837-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), we focused on the effects of chaperones on the aggregation of the 120Q protein in the cytoplasm. HSP 40, HSP 70, and NSF were chosen for comparing the effects of different chaperones on huntingtin aggregation. Co-transfection of HSP 40 with 120Q dramatically inhibited the formation of huntingtin aggregates (Fig.2 A). In contrast, co-transfection of HSP 70 with 120Q did not significantly change the density of aggregates formed by 120Q. Similarly, the expression of NSF with 120Q also failed to suppress huntingtin aggregation in transfected cells. An examination of NLS-150Q transfected cells revealed similar results showing that HSP 40 inhibited the aggregation of nuclear huntingtin, whereas HSP 70 and NSF did not (data not shown). To confirm that these transfected cells expressed both transfected huntingtin and chaperones, double immunofluorescence labeling of these cells was performed using EM48 and 12CA5 antibody that reacts with the HA epitope in transfected chaperones. Cells expressing both HSP 40 and 120Q had much fewer aggregates than those expressing both HSP 70 and 120Q (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, cells expressing both NSF and 120Q also displayed abundant aggregates in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Some aggregates were labeled by antibodies to HSP 40 and huntingtin, suggesting that HSP 40 was colocalized with aggregates. To better examine the effects of chaperones on huntingtin aggregation, we used Western blots to detect aggregated proteins that usually remained in the stacking gel (Fig. 3). Co-transfection of huntingtin with chaperones into HEK293 cells gave rise to the protein products as expected (Fig. 3 A). The majority of the 120Q protein without NLS displayed as aggregated proteins even after transfection for 24 h, reflecting the rapid aggregation of overexpressed mutant huntingtin in the cytoplasm. HSP 40, but not HSP 70 and NSF, could significantly reduce the amount of aggregated huntingtin and increase the level of the monomer form of the 120Q protein. This effect, however, was attenuated at 48 h when 120Q protein aggregation was more intensified, perhaps because a greater extent of aggregation of overexpressed huntingtin at 48 h reduces the ability of HSP 40 to inhibit aggregation. To examine the expression level of chaperones, the same protein samples used for examining transfected huntingtin were also analyzed by Western blots with 12CA5 antibody (Fig. 3 B) The expression levels of these chaperones were similar, also suggesting that the inhibition of huntingtin aggregation is specific to HSP 40 expression. To further confirm this observation, we used a filter trap assay, which is also able to detect polyglutamine protein aggregation (8Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). With this assay, we found that HSP 40, but not HSP 70 and NSF, significantly inhibited the aggregation of the 120Q protein (Fig. 3 B). Thus, immunofluorescence labeling, Western blots, and filter trap assays all support the idea that only HSP 40 is able to significantly inhibit huntingtin aggregation in transfected HEK293 cells. We have shown that mutant huntingtin also formed aggregates when it was directed to the nuclei by the NLS epitope (Fig. 1). To examine whether chaperones have different effects on the aggregation of nuclear huntingtin, we co-transfected NLS-150Q with chaperones into HEK293 cells. Transfection of NLS-150Q resulted in smear products on the blot with two major bands (64 and 54 kDa in Fig.4). It is possible that NLS-150Q with a larger glutamine repeat might be unstable in the nucleus before it forms aggregates. Transfection for 24 h did not allow NLS-150Q proteins to aggregate in the nucleus to the same degree as the 120Q proteins in the cytoplasm. Consistent with the immunocytochemical result as shown in Fig. 1, the aggregation of the nuclear huntingtin became significant at 48 h after transfection. At this time point, HSP 70 or NSF expression did not affect the aggregation of NLS-150Q either. In contrast, HSP 40 expression was still able to inhibit the aggregation of nuclear huntingtin, leading to the increased amount of monomer forms of NLS-150Q (Fig. 4). The predominant distribution of 120Q in the cytoplasm allowed us to study the relationship between cytoplasmic aggregates and cytotoxicity. To examine the effect of chaperones on huntingtin aggregation in neurons, we expressed the 120Q protein in cultured striatal neurons. Similar to what we saw in HEK293 cells, 120Q forms cytoplasmic aggregates. In addition, it causes nuclear DNA fragmentation. Co-expression of HSP 40 with 120Q could prevent DNA fragmentation and reduce huntingtin aggregation (Fig.5). As a result, fewer aggregates were visible in huntingtin-transfected cells. Like HSP 40, transfected HSP 70 and NSF could also reduce DNA fragmentation in 120Q-transfected cells. However, the amount of huntingtin aggregates was not significantly reduced by the overexpression of HSP 70 and NSF. Thus, the protection of DNA fragmentation by these chaperones seemed not to be associated with their ability to remove huntingtin aggregates. Some transfected neurons displayed huntingtin aggregates that also contained HSP 40 or HSP 70. More interestingly, these aggregates were localized in the neurites. Most of these aggregates were negative to the 12CA5 antibody that labeled the transfected chaperones. It is possible that aggregated huntingtin masked protein immunoreactivity, making chaperones in the aggregates unrecognizable by the antibody. Alternatively, the interaction of chaperones between the huntingtin and chaperones, if any, was not stable for aggregated huntingtin. The experiments described above suggest that the prevention of cellular toxicity by chaperones is independent of polyglutamine aggregation. To quantitatively examine the effects of chaperones on huntingtin toxicity, we used an MTS assay, which detects early apoptotic events of transfected cells. HEK293 cells allowed for higher transfection efficiency enabling us to quantify the viability of transfected cells using the MTS assay (33Li S.H. Lam S. Cheng A.L. Li X.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2859-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We observed that the transfection of 120Q for either 24 or 48 h significantly decreased cell viability (50–58% of vector transfection) (Fig.6 A). Similar reduction has been reported in other types of huntingtin-transfected cells (36Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; : 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). This inhibition apparently did not depend on the extent of huntingtin aggregation. For example, 120Q transfection produced more aggregated huntingtin at 48 h than at 24 h (Figs. 2 and 3). However, a similar reduction of cell viability was seen at both time points (Fig.6 A). The decreased cell viability is specifically associated with expanded polyglutamine in the 120Q protein, because transfection of N-terminal huntingtin with a normal repeat (20Q) did not significantly affect cell viability (Fig. 6 A). Also, transient transfection of HSP 70 alone did not significantly influence cell viability. Similar to other studies of the protective effect of HSP 70 on huntingtin toxicity (36Jana N.R. Zemskov E.A. Wang G. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; : 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), all chaperones we tested could significantly reduce huntingtin toxicity by increasing viability to 75–85% of the control. This incomplete protection could be the result of activation of other chaperone-independent pathways by mutant huntingtin. This possibility is also suggested by the results from NLS-150Q transfected cells. After transfection for 24 h, the cytotoxicity of NLS-150Q was not significantly suppressed by transfected chaperones. At 48 h, however, its toxicity could be inhibited by chaperones (Fig. 6B). The inhibitory effects of the transfected chaperones are apparently independent of their ability to inhibit the aggregation of NLS-150Q in the nucleus (Fig. 4). The delayed protection of chaperones against NLS-150Q may be due to the time required for intranuclear huntingtin to affect gene expression and to induce cytoplasmic apoptotic events that might be inhibited by chaperones. Chaperones are found to reduce cellular toxicity mediated by a variety of stresses and apoptotic stimuli (37Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). To confirm that our experiment conditions do allow chaperones to promote cell survival, we also examined the effects of chaperones on cells treated with staurosporine, an apoptotic agent that has been used to test the protective effects of the chaperone (38Jaattela M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M. EMBO J. 1998;"

The responses elicited by phospholipid growth factors are pleiotropic and include the enhancement of cell survival, induction of cell proliferation, regulation of the actin-based cytoskeleton affecting cell shape, adherence, and chemotaxis, and the activation of Cl− and Ca2+ ion conductances. LPA has been implicated in a number of disease and injury states, due to elevated levels of LPA in fluids surrounding the tissues involved, including corneal injury, lung disease, atherosclerosis, ovarian cancer, and wound healing. The eight receptors in the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family encode G protein-coupled receptors activated by the phospholipid growth factors LPA and S1P (4Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 5Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 58: 1188-1196Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The EDG family is subdivided into two clusters based on ligand selectivity. S1P1/3/2/4/5 receptors (formerly EDG1/3/5/6/8) are specifically activated by S1P (4Spiegel S. Milstien S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 55-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), whereas LPA1/2/3receptors (formerly EDG2/4/7) are specifically activated by LPA (5Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 58: 1188-1196Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Members of the S1P receptor subfamily display 40–50% sequence identity to each other and 30–35% identity to the members of the LPA receptor subfamily (5Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 58: 1188-1196Crossref Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 6Van Brocklyn J.R. Graler M.H. Bernhardt G. Hobson J.P. Lipp M. Spiegel S. Blood. 2000; 95: 2624-2629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These homologies and a distant relatedness to the cannabinoid receptors (7Elphick M.R. Egertova M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 356: 381-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Salzet M. Breton C. Bisogno T. Di Marzo V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4917-4927Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) suggest that the LPA- and S1P-specific subfamilies may have evolved from a common ancestral lipid receptor through the evolutionary development of distinct ligand binding pockets. If so, ligand selectivity should be determined by a limited number of conserved and/or related amino acids. We have previously shown that three residues, Arg120, Glu121, and Arg292, are all required for S1P recognition by S1P1/EDG1 (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z.

One of these residues, Arg120 in S1P1/EDG1, which is predicted to ion pair with the phosphate moiety of S1P, is a conserved arginine in the entire EDG family. The model further predicted that Arg292interacts with the phosphate and Glu121 interacts with the amine of S1P. Alanine substitution for any of these three amino acids in S1P1/EDG1 caused loss of binding and activation by S1P (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J. Baker D.L. Liliom K. Spiegel S. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39379-39384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, recognition of LPA and discrimination between S1P and LPA by the highly related EDG family G protein-coupled receptors have not yet been determined. In this study, we have developed a theoretical model of the LPA1/EDG2 receptor alone and in complex with LPA based on the previously described and experimentally validated S1P1/EDG1 receptor model. Computational analysis of the ligand binding interactions has predicted that a single amino acid, Glu121 in S1P1/EDG1, which corresponds to Gln125 in LPA1/EDG2, influences the specificity for S1P or LPA. Experimental characterization of site-directed mutants confirms that the glutamate-to-glutamine replacement is sufficient to change the specificity of S1P1 from S1P to LPA, whereas the glutamine-to-glutamate replacement in LPA1 resulted in recognition of both S1P and LPA. To facilitate comparison between aligned positions in different receptors with different sequential residue positions, the numbering system introduced first by Ballesteros and Weinstein will be used (10Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Conn P.M. Sealfon S.C. Methods in Neurosciences. 25. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 366-428Google Scholar). In this numbering system, residues are given two-part numbers. The first part of the number indicates the transmembrane helical domain in which the residue occurs. The second part of the number indicates a position in that domain relative to a residue most conserved throughout the G protein-coupled receptor family, which is given the number 50. Thus Arg120 in S1P1 and Arg124 in LPA1 are both numbered 3.28, indicating their position in the third transmembrane helical domain relative to the conserved arginine in the (E/D)RY motif which is numbered 3.50. A model of LPA1 (GenBankTM accession numberU80811) was developed by homology to the previously developed model of S1P1 (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z.

Alignment of the EDG sequences was initially performed using the MOE software package (version 2001.01, Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada) and optimized by manual removal of gaps within the transmembrane domains. Subsequent homology modeling utilized default conditions to generate a preliminary model that was then manually refined to optimize the interhelical hydrogen bonding network. Cis-amide bonds present in the loop regions were converted to the trans conformation by manual rotation followed by optimization of two amino acids on either side of the amide bond to a root mean square gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol·Å using the AMBER94 forcefield (11Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M.J. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11640) Google Scholar). After these manual refinements, the receptor model was optimized using the AMBER94 forcefield to a root mean square gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol·Å. C18:1 LPA was docked into the LPA1 model, and the complexes were evaluated based on electrostatic interactions between the receptor and ligand. The complex with the best electrostatic interactions selected from the docking procedure was further refined using molecular dynamics simulations under constant volume at 300 K. Molecular dynamics simulations utilized a 1-fs time step with 30 ps of equilibration prior to the 100-ps data collection phase. The final snapshot from the simulation was subsequently minimized to a root mean square gradient of 0.01 kcal/mol·Å with the AMBER94 forcefield. The N-terminal FLAG epitope-tagged S1P1 and LPA1 receptor constructs (GenBankTM accession numbers AF233365 andU80811, respectively) were provided by Drs. Timothy Hla and Songzhu An, respectively. Site-specific mutations were generated using the ExSiteTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). S1P1-3.29Q and S1P1-3.29A were generated by replacement of GAA in codon 121 with CAA and GCA, respectively. LPA1-3.29E and LPA1-3.29A were generated by substitution of CAG in codon 125 with GAA and GCA, respectively. At the same time a silent mutation was introduced that provided aBamHI restriction site in these constructs but did not affect coding for glycine and serine in codons 122 and 123. For LPA1-3.29E and LPA1-3.29A, a silent mutation was introduced adding a StuI restriction site between codons 125 and 127. Clones were verified by complete sequencing of the inserts. RH7777 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Ft. Collins, CO). Cells (3 × 106) were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid DNA in 30 μl of Cytofectene reagent (Bio-Rad) for 16 h. The following day the transfection medium was replaced with 8 ml of fresh medium. Before ligand binding and receptor activation assays, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium and then serum-starved for at least 3 h. Western blot analysis of the FLAG epitope-tagged receptor construct was performed using a protocol described earlier (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J.

Briefly, RH7777 cells (2 × 105) were incubated at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) binding buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin with the indicated concentration of S1P (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) for 30 min. Cells were centrifuged and washed twice with binding buffer. Cell-bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding was determined as the difference between total binding and binding in the presence of 30 μm cold S1P. Standard errors were computed on the basis of triplicate samples. For LPA binding, transfected cells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium and cultured in serum-free Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium for an additional 6 h. The cells were homogenized by 30-s sonication in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer containing 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended by 10-s sonication in 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmglucose, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), and 5 μm fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) and stored at −80 °C. Membrane protein concentration was measured by Micro BCA assay kit (Pierce). A 40-μg aliquot of membrane protein was used in the radioligand binding experiments. Incubations were performed at 4 °C for different times (10–120 min) using a constant 30 nm concentration of32P-labeled C18:1 LPA (Avanti Polar Lipids) or using different concentrations (0.03–500 nm) of32P-labeled C18:1 LPA while incubating a constant 30 min. Membrane-bound radioactivity was separated by filtration on GF/B filters (Whatman) using a Brandel harvester (Gaithersburg, MD). The filter was washed first with 1 ml of ice-cold Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 μm bovine serum albumin and two more times with phosphate-buffered saline alone. Nonspecific LPA binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm cold C18:1 LPA (Avanti Polar Lipids). The bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. S.E. was computed on the basis of triplicate samples. Every binding experiment was repeated using membranes isolated from at least three different transfections. Functional assays were performed in RH7777 cells transiently transfected with the constructs by measuring S1P- and LPA-activated [35S]GTPγS binding as described previously (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J. Baker D.L. Liliom K. Spiegel S. Tigyi G. J. Biol.

A 20-μg aliquot of membrane protein was incubated in 1.0 ml of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) assay buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS (1191 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) with different concentrations of S1P or LPA for 30 min at 30 °C. Membrane-bound radioactivity was then separated by filtration through a Whatman GF/B glass filter and quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Samples were run in triplicate, and the activation assay was performed using membranes isolated from at least three transfections. Localization of wild type S1P1, LPA1, and mutants expressed in RH7777 cells was done as described previously (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J.

Following an 18-h serum starvation, transfected cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and the receptor protein was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were viewed using an LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The eight known members of the EDG family were aligned based on amino acid sequence using the MOE program (Fig.1B). The LPA1model was developed by homology to the previously described and experimentally validated S1P1 model (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J.

The first 35 and the last 33 amino acid residues were deleted from the LPA1amino acid sequence because there was no corresponding S1P1template structure available for these regions. Manual adjustments removed gaps in the transmembrane domains of the aligned sequences prior to homology modeling. Polarity-conserved positions (14Zhang D. Weinstein H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were identified and examined for interhelical hydrogen bonding interactions. Where geometrically possible, side chains were rotated manually to improve hydrogen bonding among these residues. These interactions, present in the high-resolution crystal structure of rhodopsin (15Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.

The LPA1 model included interhelical hydrogen bonding networks among the following residues, Asn1.50-Asp2.50-Asn7.49, Ser3.39-Ser7.46, Leu2.42-Asn2.45-Asn3.42, Ala6.43-Asn7.45, corresponding to hydrogen bonding interactions originally developed in the S1P1 model and also observed in the crystal structure of rhodopsin (15Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). The entire model was then minimized to a gradient of 0.1 kcal/mol·Å. This relatively high gradient prevented collapse of the binding pocket due to an absence of ligand or water molecules during the minimization. The LPA1 model was docked with LPA using the MOE program. A complex in which LPA was positioned within the helical bundle with the highest electrostatic score was chosen for further evaluation. This complex resembles the experimentally validated S1P·S1P1 complex. However, in LPA1amino acid side chains were found to protrude further into the binding pocket than in the S1P1 model. These side chains were manually rotated to decrease steric interactions. Geometry optimization with the use of distance restraints between the phosphate of LPA and the nearest cationic amino acids was used to optimize ion-pairing interactions involving the phosphate due to experimental evidence underlining the requirement of the phosphate in receptor binding (16Jalink K. Hengeveld T. Mulder S. Postma F.R. Simon M.-F. Chap H. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The resulting complex was then minimized to a root mean square gradient of 0.001 kcal/mol·Å by a multistep process that first constrained the backbone atoms while allowing amino acid side chains to minimize followed by minimization of the entire complex. The resulting complex (Fig. 2) shows considerable similarity to the model of the S1P·S1P1complex with regard to the region of the receptor-occupied by the ligand. The model of the LPA·LPA1 complex derived from computational docking studies indicates several key interactions between polar amino acids in LPA1 and the polar head group of LPA (Fig. 2B). In particular, Arg3.28 and Lys7.36 form ion pairs with the phosphate group of LPA. Examination of the aligned amino acid sequences of the entire EDG family showed two intriguing features. First, the position 3.28 is a conserved arginine in every EDG receptor (Fig. 1B). Second, position 7.36 is a positively charged amino acid in the LPA-binding EDG subfamily. The model also indicates that the sn-2 hydroxyl of LPA accepts a hydrogen bond from the amide of Gln3.29 in LPA1. The oxygen of the side chain carbonyl in Gln3.29 also accepts a hydrogen bond from the phosphate hydrogen (Fig. 2B). Position 3.29 is a conserved glutamine in every LPA-specific EDG receptor, whereas it is a conserved glutamic acid in every S1P-specific receptor (Fig. 1B). Comparison of the interactions in the S1P·S1P1 model (9Parrill A.L. Wang D.-A. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J. Baker D.L. Liliom K. Spiegel S. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39379-39384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) with those in the LPA·LPA1 complex (Fig. 2B) suggests that ligand specificity might be determined by the naturally occurring single amino acid difference at position 3.29. In S1P1, Glu3.29 is positioned within 2.5 Å of the positively charged ammonium group of the sphingosine backbone and forms an ion pair with the ammonium group of S1P. Computational modeling of the S1P1 receptor in complex with LPA, a glycerophospholipid that lacks an ammonium group, indicates that it is unable to ion pair with Glu3.29, leaving the carboxylate of Glu3.29 within 5 Å of the anionic phosphate of LPA with no counterion to mitigate the repulsive interaction between the two. This hypothesis is much more focused than could be obtained by simple primary sequence comparisons of the S1P and LPA receptors (Fig.1B). Sequence comparison identifies 30 positions where a conserved residue or residue type in one subfamily is altered in the other. The addition of three-dimensional information, such as the homology models we have developed or simpler snake models demonstrating positions of residues relative to the extracellular surface, reduce this number. The three-dimensional computational model described herein thus enabled us to formulate two specific hypotheses. First, Gln3.29 is required for LPA binding to LPA1. Second, position 3.29 is the single amino acid residue that accounts for the LPA and S1P specificity of LPA1 and S1P1, respectively. To test these two hypotheses we generated point mutations in both receptors by converting Glu3.29 to Gln in S1P1 or mutating Gln3.29 to Glu in LPA1. To establish that these polar interactions are essential for ligand binding, two additional alanine replacement mutants, S1P1-3.29A and LPA1-3.29A, were generated. The predicted influence of position 3.29 on ligand specificity was evaluated by characterizing the S1P1 and LPA1 receptor constructs having Glu, Gln, and Ala at position 3.29 transiently transfected into LPA and S1P receptor-negative RH7777 cells (17Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To verify that the point mutants were expressed in comparable amounts, cell lysates were analyzed for receptor expression by Western blot using the N-terminal FLAG epitope present in every construct (Fig.3). The level of expression was similar for every mutant and wild type receptor. To verify proper targeting of the mutant receptors to the plasma membrane, immunocytological staining for the FLAG epitope was done in serum-starved cells (Fig.4). Laser confocal microscopy showed that every receptor construct was predominantly targeted to the cell surface as seen for the wild type receptors.Figure 4Receptor localization in the presence and absence of phospholipids. The immunocytochemical preparations were probed by the anti-FLAG M2 antibody. The first column shows that each receptor construct is similarly localized to the plasma membrane in serum-starved cells. The second and third columns show agonist-induced (100 nm, 15 min) internalization of wild type S1P1, LPA1, and their mutants in response to S1P and LPA, respectively. The receptors not activated by S1P or LPA remain localized in the plasma membrane. In contrast, those receptors that can be activated by S1P or LPA are internalized into the cytoplasm.

Fitting a one-site model to the [32P]S1P binding data for these two constructs (Table I) gaveKD values of 36 ± 2 and 79 ± 12 nm, respectively. Likewise, dose-response curves for S1P-induced [35S]GTPγS binding (Fig.5) provided EC50 values for these constructs of 1.7 ± 0.7 and 453 ± 95 nm(Table I).

To explore the molecular basis of this effect, known exocytotic proteins were screened for PKA substrates. Both cysteine string protein (CSP) and soluble NSF attachment protein-α (α-SNAP) were phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, but immunoprecipitation of cellular α-SNAP failed to detect 32P incorporation. In contrast, endogenous CSP was phosphorylated in synaptosomes, PC12 cells, and chromaffin cells. In-gel kinase assays confirmed PKA to be a cellular CSP kinase, with phosphorylation occurring on Ser10. PKA phosphorylation of CSP reduced its binding to syntaxin by 10-fold but had little effect on its interaction with HSC70 or G-protein subunits. Furthermore, an in vivo role for Ser10 phosphorylation at a late stage of exocytosis is suggested by analysis of chromaffin cells transfected with wild type or non-phosphorylatable mutant CSP. We propose that PKA phosphorylation of CSP could modulate the exocytotic machinery, by selectively altering its availability for protein-protein interactions.

Essays Biochem. 1995; 30: 77-95PubMed Google Scholar). In regulated exocytosis, vesicles accumulate in the cytoplasm and only fuse with the plasma membrane upon receipt of an appropriate stimulus (usually, but not always, an increase in intracellular free Ca2+). As regulated exocytosis is the basis of chemical transmission in the brain, much research has been devoted to uncovering its molecular mechanism. This has revealed the involvement of a large number of proteins (2Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 3Lin R.C. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 19-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), which can be classified into three groups. The first group, proteins involved in vesicle fusion events in all eukaryotes, includes the SNAP1 receptors, SNAPs, RABs, and the Sec1 family. The second group comprises proteins involved in regulated exocytosis in various cell types and diverse organisms but absent in yeast. This group includes the synaptotagmins and cysteine string proteins (CSP). The third class can be defined as proteins whose role in regulated exocytosis is cell type-specific. An example from this group is the synapsins, which are important modulators of the synaptic vesicle cycle in neurons (4Greengard P. Valtorta F. Czernik A.J. Benfenati F. Science. 1993; 259: 780-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). The complex interactions between the numerous proteins of these classes presumably enables sophisticated fine-tuning of exocytosis to suit the particular physiological needs of each cell type. In addition to the cell type-specific repertoire of exocytotic proteins expressed, further control over the exocytotic mechanism can be exerted post-translationally (5Turner K.M. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 459-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Indeed, a large number of studies have implicated protein kinases in the modulation of regulated exocytosis from many cell types by using cell-permeable inhibitors or activators, including Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (6Nichols R.A. Sihra T.S. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Nature. 1990; 343: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar,7Schweitzer E.S. Sanderson M.J. Wasterlain C.G. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2619-2628PubMed Google Scholar), mitogen-activated protein kinase (8Cox M.E. Ely C.M. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (9Yawo H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5293-5300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosine kinases (8Cox M.E. Ely C.M. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Parsons S.J. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1103-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, one shortfall of this approach is that the modulation of exocytosis may be indirect, either by effects on membrane receptor or ion channel phosphorylation or via direct steric inhibition of ion channels (e.g. Ref.10Li G. Hidaka H. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, application of kinase activators or inhibitors (or indeed purified kinases themselves) to permeabilized cells, where receptors and ion channels are bypassed, is a more rigorous demonstration of a role for protein kinases in the direct regulation of the exocytotic machinery. However, a review of the literature reveals only PKA and PKC or their pharmacological effectors produce an almost universal enhancement of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis in all secretory models studied, for example nerve terminals (11Murphy T.V.

Therefore, identification of PKA or PKC exocytotic substrates will reveal fundamental mechanisms for the direct regulation of exocytosis by phosphorylation. To address this issue, our approach was to screen known exocytotic proteins for in vitro kinase substrates. Reasoning that this information would only be relevant if the phosphorylation(s) observed also occurred in the cell, we set out to confirm this and to subsequently determine any functional significance of in vivo phosphorylation. In the present study, we have identified the synaptic vesicle protein CSP as a novel PKA substrate both in vitro and in three different neuronal/neuroendocrine cell preparations, and we mapped the phosphorylation site to Ser10 in the conserved N-terminal domain of CSP. We also show that Ser10 phosphorylation can reduce CSP binding to syntaxin but not to HSC70 or G-protein subunits. Furthermore, mutation of Ser10 to a non-phosphorylatable alanine residue alters the known effects of CSP overexpression on the kinetics of exocytotic fusion. Thus, PKA may enhance exocytosis by changing the protein-protein interactions of CSP. CSP rabbit polyclonal antiserum was as described previously (22Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7320-7323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Anti-α-SNAP monoclonal antibody was obtained from Synaptic Systems (Göttingen, Germany). Purified G-proteins and anti-Gα antiserum were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-Gβ monoclonal antibody was obtained from Affiniti (Exeter, UK). Catalytically active PKC was from Alexis Corp. (Nottingham, UK). Synthetic CSP-(4–14) peptides, each with an additional N-terminal cysteine residue, were from MWG Biotec (Milton Keynes, UK). The sequences of these peptides were CSP-(4–14), CQRQRSLSTSGE; CSP-(4–14)-S10A, CQRQRSLATSGE; and CSP-(4–14)-S10pS, CQRQRSLpSTSGE (where pS is phosphoserine). [32P]Orthophosphate, [γ-32P]ATP, goat anti-rabbit 125I-IgG, glutathione- and protein G-coupled Sepharose FF beads were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Collagenase was from Lorne Laboratories (Oxford, UK). PKA catalytic subunit, H-89, 8-Br-cAMP, Kemptide, purified HSC70, and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Expression and purification of recombinant His6-tagged CSP1, α-SNAP, complexin, and Rab3A protein were performed as described previously (23Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Recombinant GST-syntaxin 1A and GST-VAMP2 were expressed and purified as described previously (24Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc.

Site-directed mutagenesis of pcDNA3.1-myc-csp (27Zhang H. Kelley W.L. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Lang J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was achieved using the Quickchange system (Stratagene). For the S10A mutant, the primers are as follows: sense, 5′-CAGCGCTCACTC(T/G)C(T/G)ACCTCTGGGGAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CTCCCCAGAGGT(A/C)G(A/C)GAGTGAGCGCTG-3′. Nucleotides in parentheses indicate bases that were changed to generate the amino acid substitution. The mutated sequence generated an Nru I restriction site (underlined), which was used to select mutant colonies. Automated sequencing was performed in both directions across the entire coding sequence to ensure introduction of the desired mutation only (University of Durham, Durham, UK). Primary cultures of chromaffin cells were prepared from freshly dissected bovine adrenal glands. Briefly, each gland was flushed three times with 10 ml of Krebs buffer and then twice injected and incubated with 5 ml of Krebs containing 1 mg/ml type XIV protease at 37 °C for 15 min. The medullae were then dissected from the glands, digested by incubation with 50 ml of Krebs containing 1.3 mg/ml type III collagenase, and shaken at 37 °C for 30 min. The resulting crude single cell suspension was then filtered through muslin to remove undigested tissue and washed four times in Krebs buffer by centrifugation at 1000 ×g. The cells were filtered once more through muslin, centrifuged through a layer of 4% bovine serum albumin, and the pellet resuspended in culture medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 5% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μm cytosine arabinofuranoside, and 80 μm fluorodeoxyuridine). The cell yield was then calculated, and the chromaffin cells were diluted in culture medium and either plated at 10 × 106cells/60-mm Petri dish (for 32P labeling) or cultured overnight in suspension (at 1 × 106 cells/ml) prior to co-transfection by electroporation of CSP constructs and pEGFP as described previously (28Graham M. Burgoyne R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in culture at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for 3 days prior to use. PC12 cell lines (wild type and CSP1-overexpressing clone 1) were maintained in culture as described previously (29Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% non-essential amino acids and 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. HeLa cells (2 × 105/35-mm dish) were co-transfected with CSP constructs (1 μg) and pCMV-syntaxin (1 μg) using 4 μl/dish FuGene6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. P2 rat forebrain synaptosomes purified on a Ficoll gradient were prepared as described previously (30Tandon A. Bannykh S. Kowalchyk J.A. Banerjee A. Martin T.F.J. Balch W.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the preparation was determined by Bradford assay (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). For the detection of cellular protein phosphorylation, chromaffin cells (10 × 106 cells/condition), PC12 cells (10 × 106 cells/condition), or rat forebrain synaptosomes (2 mg of protein/condition) were incubated in phosphate-free Krebs buffer containing 1.5 mCi/ml 32Pi for 4 or 1 h, respectively. Cells or synaptosomes were then treated for 15 min with Krebs buffer containing various secretagogues or kinase modulators. Cells or synaptosomes were then lysed, and CSP or α-SNAP was immunoprecipitated using protocols described previously (32Evans G.J.O. Pocock J.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were processed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, followed by exposure of the blots to a Phosphorscreen and then immunoblotting for CSP or α-SNAP. Phosphorscreens were read with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager SI. Analysis of phosphorimages and immunoblot autoradiograms was performed using ImageQuant 5.1 (Molecular Dynamics) software. All phosphorylation reactions were performed at 30 °C in a volume of 40 μl of MES buffer (50 mm MES, pH 6.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and initiated with the addition of 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and unlabeled ATP to a final concentration of 100 μm. For determination of the time course and stoichiometry of phosphorylation of CSP or α-SNAP, 0.5 μm His6-tagged protein was incubated with 5 μg/ml PKA or 1.5 μg/ml PKC for 1 min to 3 h. For the preparation of phosphorylated and mock-phosphorylated CSP for the phosphorylation site mapping, syntaxin binding, and HSC70 ATPase assays, 20 μg of His6-tagged CSP was incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml PKA for 3 h. Phosphorylation of proteins was quantitated by terminating the reactions with 2× SDS sample buffer, resolving the samples on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, and liquid scintillation counting the excised Coomassie-stained CSP bands. In the case of peptide phosphorylation for the determination K m and V max, initial rate conditions were used. CSP-(4–14) peptides or Kemptide were used at 0.1–30 μmand incubated for 5 min with 0.3 μg/ml PKA or 0.2 μg/ml PKC. Under these conditions, the incorporation of phosphate was linear with time and enzyme concentration. Reactions were terminated by spotting onto Whatman P81 phosphocellulose paper followed by extensive washing in 5 mm orthophosphoric acid and determination of incorporated32P was by liquid scintillation counting. Kinetic parameters were calculated by linear regression of S/V versus S plots (where S is substrate concentration and V is initial rate of phosphorylation). For the identification of the in vitro PKA phosphorylation site of CSP, phosphorylated and mock-phosphorylated His6-tagged CSP were prepared as described above. 5 μg of32P-labeled CSP (mock or phosphorylated) was reduced and carboxymethylated in the presence of 8 m urea. Following dilution of the urea to a concentration of 2 m, 0.5 μg of modified trypsin (Promega) was added, and digestion was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37 °C. The digestion mixture was loaded onto a narrow-bore C4 RP-HPLC column (Brownlee Aquapore) operating at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The peptides were then separated by elution with a gradient of 0–64% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over a period of 90 min. Elution was monitored at an absorbance of 214 nm. The fraction containing the phosphorylated peptide was identified by comparison of the two RP-HPLC traces and by Cerenkov counting of the manually collected peptides. This fraction was split in half. One-half was applied to a GFC filter on a model 471A Protein Sequenator (Applied Biosystems, UK) and the amino acid sequence acid sequence of the peptide determined by Edman degradation. The remainder was covalently attached to Sequelon membrane (Millipore, UK) using an adaptation of the manufacturer’s instructions. The membrane was placed in the sequenator and subjected to Edman degradation as above, but after each cycle the ATZ-amino acid released by hydrolysis was automatically transferred to a microcentrifuge tube using ethyl acetate and the32P content determined by Cerenkov counting. For the mapping of the CSP phosphorylation site in PC12 cells, CSP1-overexpressing PC12 cells (clone 1 (29Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) were labeled with32P, and the CSP was immunoprecipitated as described above. The whole 32P-labeled CSP immunoprecipitate from 10 × 106 cells was resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel alongside 2 μg of 32P-labeled His6-tagged CSP that had been phosphorylated in vitro by PKA. The gel was Coomassie-stained and briefly exposed to a Phosphorscreen to locate the32P-labeled immunoprecipitated CSP. The PC12 CSP and recombinant CSP bands were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion by trypsin. The tryptic peptides were analyzed as described above by RP-HPLC, and the fractions were counted for radioactivity. The in-gel kinase assay was performed as described previously (33Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (34Pyle R.A. Schivell A.E. Hidaka H. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17195-17200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, cellular proteins solubilized in lysis buffer (20 μg) from rat brain, PC12 cells, synaptosomes, and chromaffin cells were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels with and without 0.1 mg/ml recombinant His6-tagged CSP protein added to the matrix. The gels were then incubated in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with 20% propan-2-ol for 30 min. Following equilibration in buffer A for 1 h, the lysate proteins were denatured with 6 m guanidine HCl for 2 h. The proteins were then renatured by incubation overnight at 4 °C in buffer A with 0.05% Tween 20. Gels were then equilibrated in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min prior to the phosphorylation reaction where gels were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in kinase buffer with 100 μm ATP and 6 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by washing the gels five times for 20 min in 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate. The gels were exposed to a Phosphorscreen for quantitation of incorporated 32P. The binding of His6-tagged mock- and PKA-phosphorylated CSP to GST-syntaxin 1A was as described previously (35Chamberlain L.H. Graham M.E. Kane S. Jackson J.L. Maier V.H. Burgoyne R.D. Gould G.W. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 445-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the chemiluminescence detection system has a narrow linear range and a wide range of CSP or phospho-CSP concentrations were used in the binding assay, a 125I-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was used for CSP immunoblotting. 125I labeling of immunoblots was determined by exposure to a Phosphorscreen and subsequent densitometric analysis. The activation of HSC70 ATPase activity by CSP was determined by a spectrophotometric assay as described previously (36Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Chromaffin cells co-transfected with CSP wild type or mutant constructs and pEGFP were simultaneously permeabilized with 20 μm digitonin and stimulated with 10 μm free calcium. Amperometric responses were recorded and analyzed as described previously (28Graham M. Burgoyne R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation by PKA and PKC of 10 proteins known to have a direct or modulatory role in the late stages of exocytosis was studied (Fig.1 A). Proteins that were not phosphorylated by either kinase were complexin, neuronal calcium sensor-1, syntaxin 1A, and VAMP2. The PKC phosphorylation of nSec1, SNAP-25A, and synaptotagmin confirmed previous observations (37Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 38Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Nordstedt C. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14548-14553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, CSP, Rab3A, and α-SNAP were novel PKC substrates. Therefore, this initial screen generated an abundance of PKC substrates that are potential candidates for the PKC-mediated regulation of exocytosis, some of which have been studied previously (37Fujita Y. Sasaki T. Fukui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7265-7268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 38Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Nordstedt C. Greengard P. Czernik A.J. J.

In contrast to PKC, our data for PKA phosphorylation agrees with previous findings (24Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11945-11949Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) that very few exocytotic proteins are PKA substrates. We found that α-SNAP is phosphorylated by PKA, in agreement with Ref. 24Hirling H. Scheller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11945-11949Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, and that CSP is a novel PKA substrate. Because there is a wealth of data supporting a role for PKA in the modulation of exocytosis, the study of any exocytotic PKA substrate is particularly pertinent. We therefore pursued the characterization of CSP and α-SNAP phosphorylation by PKA. Fig. 1 B confirms that both CSP and α-SNAP are good in vitro substrates for PKA. Under conditions optimized for maximal phosphorylation, it was found that phosphorylation of CSP by PKA plateaued after 60 min at 30 °C at a stoichiometry of ∼1.0 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (Fig. 1 B). α-SNAP by comparison was phosphorylated to a lesser extent by PKA with a stoichiometry of only ∼0.6 mol of phosphate/mol of protein (Fig. 1 B). Because the efficiency of in vitro phosphorylation of a recombinant protein is not a true indication of any in vivo phosphorylation events, we went on to characterize both CSP and α-SNAP phosphorylation in vivo. To assess whether endogenous CSP and α-SNAP are phosphorylated in vivo, we employed two alternative neuronal model systems commonly used for studying regulated exocytosis, bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, and rat brain synaptosomes. The cells or synaptosomes were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and subjected to stimulation with a secretagogue (nicotine or KCl. respectively) or the cell-permeable PKA agonist, 8-Br-cAMP, and then lysed. CSP and α-SNAP were immunoprecipitated from the lysates with specific antisera, subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Incorporated 32P was detected by Phosphorscreen (Fig. 2), whereas location of the protein on the two-dimensional membrane was confirmed by immunoblotting with the immunoprecipitating antibody. Densitometric analysis of immunoprecipitated CSP demonstrated that it was phosphorylated in synaptosomes under resting conditions. Interestingly, in chromaffin cells, phosphorylation of CSP was induced by nicotine or 8-Br-cAMP treatment (Fig. 2 A). α-SNAP was not detectably phosphorylated under any condition in either chromaffin cells or synaptosomes (Fig. 2 B). The direct phosphorylation of CSP by PKA in vitro together with the stimulation of CSP phosphorylation by cAMP treatment in vivo suggests that PKA is a cellular CSP kinase. We employed an in-gel kinase assay to confirm that PKA from cell and tissue lysates could phosphorylate CSP. Triton-soluble lysates from rat brain tissue, synaptosomes, PC12 cells, and chromaffin cells and purified PKA catalytic subunits were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel with or without CSP contained in the gel matrix. Following denaturation and renaturation of the lysate proteins, the gels were incubated in a kinase reaction buffer containing [32P]ATP, washed, and exposed to a Phosphorscreen. No significant kinase autophosphorylation was observed in the control gel (Fig. 3 B). In the CSP-containing gel the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig.3 C, lane 1) produced an intense band of ∼40 kDa (the predicted mass of this protein) corresponding to the band on the Coomassie stain of the same gel (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). A band of ∼40 kDa was observed in all of the lysate lanes of the same molecular weight as the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig.3 C, lanes 2–5). Addition of the PKA inhibitor H-89 (42Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the kinase reaction buffer for a CSP-containing gel almost abolished phosphorylation of the 40-kDa band in all lanes (Fig.3 D), confirming that the 40-kDa band observed in Fig.3 C, lanes 2–5, was PKA. By having established that CSP is a probable in vivo substrate for PKA, we sought to identify the phosphorylation site(s) by using preparative quantities of recombinant His6-CSP phosphorylated in vitro by PKA with [γ-32P]ATP. PKA- and mock (identical conditions in the absence of kinase)-phosphorylated His6-CSP was prepared, and the proteins were digested with trypsin and the resulting peptides separated by RP-HPLC (Fig. 4,A and B). It was found that the HPLCA 214 trace for PKA-phosphorylated CSP contained an additional peak (the peak denoted by * in Fig. 4 B) when compared with the trace for the mock-phosphorylated protein (Fig.4 A). Fractions collected manually containing peaks of peptide content were subjected to Cerenkov counting, and only the additional peak found in the PKA-phosphorylated sample contained32P. All of the peptide fractions from the tryptic digestion were sequenced by Edman degradation, and it was found that the phosphorylated peptide had the same sequence as an adjacent peak (the peak denoted by # in Fig. 4, A and B) found in both the mock and phosphorylated samples and corresponding to CSP-(8–24) with the sequence SLSTSGESLYHVLGLDK (Fig. 4 C). Because this peptide contains 4 serines and 1 threonine the specific residue(s) phosphorylated by PKA could not be instantly identified. Thus, to determine the location of 32P-labeled residues in CSP-(8–24), the peptide was covalently attached to a Sequelon membrane and subjected to Edman degradation. The sequentially released amino acid derivatives were counted for radioactivity, and virtually all of the radioactivity contained in CSP-(8–24) was in Ser10(Fig. 4 D). To demonstrate further that PKA only phosphorylates Ser10and not either of the 2 serines or 1 threonine residue immediately surrounding Ser10, we performed in vitro PKA phosphorylation of a synthetic peptide corresponding to CSP-(4–14) and two peptides with either an alanine or phosphoserine residue substituted at the 10-position (Table I).

Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). Type I PI 3-kinases are primarily involved in receptor-mediated signal transduction and preferably use PtdIns (4,5)P2 as the substrate in vivo but also phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate at the 3-OH position of the inositol ring. The type III PI 3-kinases exclusively phosphorylate PtdIns and are essential for vesicular trafficking. Both type I and type III PI 3-kinases are heterodimeric enzymes consisting of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit. By contrast, the type II PI 3-kinases are monomeric enzymes that use PtdIns and PtdIns 4-phosphate as substrates. Their function in signal transduction is poorly understood. Few studies provide evidence for a role of type II kinases in chemokine and growth factor receptor-mediated cell activation (2Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol.

A common structural characteristic of type II PI 3-kinases is a C2-like domain at the C terminus. The C2 domains of many proteins mediate calcium-dependent phospholipid binding (8Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 973-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, type II PI 3-kinases lack a critical aspartate residue in their C2-like domain and the requirement of calcium for membrane binding and catalytic activity remains controversial (4Arcaro A.

They share a similar structure containing an unique N terminus, a catalytic domain, a PX domain, and a C2-like domain at the C terminus (10Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys.

Although HsPI3K-C2α and HsPI3K-C2β share wide tissue distribution, HsPI3K-C2γ expression is restricted to hepatocytes and is enhanced during liver regeneration (11Misawa H. Ohtsubo M. Copeland N.G.

Signaling through insulin receptor or chemokine receptors induces activation of HsPI3K-C2α (2Turner S.J. Domin J. Waterfield M.D. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Biol.

Recent reports demonstrate that HsPI3K-C2α is concentrated in trans-Golgi network and is present in clathrin-coated pits (13Domin J. Gaidarov I. Smith M.E. Keen J.H. Waterfield M.D. J. Biol.

Phosphoinositide signaling in the nucleus is regulated independently from plasma membrane phosophoinositide pathways. Some nuclear phosphoinositides and their metabolizing enzymes are not extracted with non-ionic detergents, which indicates that they are not associated with membrane structures (14Payrastre B.

Two PtsIns 4-phosphate 5-kinases (Iα and IIα) are reported to localize to nuclear speckles together with their product PI (4,5)P2 (15Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). By electron microscopy analysis, speckles were found to consist of two morphologically and functionally distinct domains. The larger and denser regions seen by fluorescence microscopy correspond to interchromatin granule clusters, which are not active in transcription. The more diffusely distributed splicing factors and the regions of the periphery of the interchromatin granule clusters correspond to perichromatin fibrils, where transcription takes place (16Fu X.D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 17Spector D.L. Fu X.D. Maniatis T.

The composition of nuclear speckles is highly dynamic because pre-mRNA transcribing and processing factors move rapidly in and out and are concentrated by transient associations with functionally related components (19Lewis J.D. Tollervey D. Science. 2000; 288: 1385-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Thus, the overall morphological appearance of nuclear speckles reflects the transcriptional activity of the cell. (20Phair R.D. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). In response to inhibition of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription, speckles become larger, round up, and lose their irregular shape (21Sinclair G.D. Brasch K. Exp. Cell Res. 1978; 111: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 22O'Keefe R.T. Mayeda A. Sadowski C.L. Krainer A.R. Spector D.L. J.

Furthermore, it has been proposed that cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation control the subnuclear distribution of splicing factors, thereby regulating their association with the speckles (24Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 25Gui J.F. Lane W.S. Fu X.D. Nature. 1994; 369: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). We show here that HsPI3K-C2α is present in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. In many cases translocation of proteins into the nucleus is conferred by distinct import signals. The best characterized are nuclear localization signals (NLS) consisting of one or more clusters of basic amino acids (26Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 922-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A signal sequence for nuclear localization of HsPI3K-C2α was mapped to a short stretch of highly basic amino acids localized within the C2 domain of the kinase, a domain that is known to target a variety of proteins to the plasma membrane. In the nucleus the HsPI3K-C2α concentrates at nuclear speckles together with pre-mRNA-processing factors. Antibodies against PI3K-C2 were raised in rabbits immunized with chimeric proteins containing glutathione S-transferase fused either to amino acids 62–131 of murine p170 (GenBankTMaccession number U55772) (27Virbasius J.V.

Immune sera were purified by affinity chromatography using the corresponding domains of p170 (antibody AXIX) and HsPI3K-C2α (antibody AXXIII) immobilized onN-hydroxysuccinimide-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Fluorescent dye-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Human autoimmune Sm serum and anti-CAP monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. A.

DNA fragments corresponding to subdomains of HsPI3K-C2α were generated by the PCR using specific primers. For transient expression the fragments were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP (CLONTECH). Domains corresponding to the N terminus of HsPI3K-C2α were fused upstream of GFP (vector pEGFP-N1), whereas domains corresponding to the C terminus of HsPI3K-C2α were fused downstream of GFP (vector pEGFP-C1). Parts of the C2-like domain of HsPI3K-C2α were fused to the C terminus of red fluorescent protein (vector pDsRed1-C1,CLONTECH). HeLa (ATCC) cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s minimal essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Treatment of HeLa cells with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide, or 40 μg/ml α-amanitin (all from Sigma) was carried out for 5 h at 37 °C. For transfection, subconfluent cell cultures were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). To 200 μl of cell suspension 50 μl of DNA mixture (200 mm NaCl, 10 μg of plasmid DNA, and 30 μg of carrier DNA (salmon sperm, Stratagene)) was added. After electroporation (960 μF, 240 V) the cells were cultured for 16–48 h before analysis. HeLa cells (∼1–5 × 107 cells) were treated with cytochalasin B (10 μg/ml) in culture medium for 30 min, trypsinized, washed 2 times with PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml cytochalasin B, 40 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min and then passed several times through a 27-gauge syringe needle. The cell homogenate was layered onto 300 μl of 30% sucrose (w/v) in lysis buffer and spun at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant (PNS) containing membranes and cytosol was collected and further processed. The pellet consisting of nuclei and few unbroken cells was resuspended in lysis buffer, homogenized, divided into four equal parts, and centrifuged as before. After an additional wash with lysis buffer, nuclear pellets were resuspended either in lysis buffer and left on ice for 15 min or in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and placed for 15 min on ice or in high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) and incubated on ice for 30 min or in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2 containing RNase free DNase I (20 units/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 20 min on ice. The aliquots were then centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. Proteins in the supernatants and pellets were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed with cold acetone, and finally dissolved in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 100 mm DTT, 0.01% bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Nuclear envelopes were separated from the nuclear extracts as follows. Nuclei were resuspended in buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 units/ml RNasin (Promega), 40 mmNaF, 0.5 mm NaVO4, 40 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) and disrupted by sonication using a micro-tip (two 15-s pulses at 50 W). The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 ×g to pellet nuclear envelopes, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was further separated by high speed centrifugation (15 min, 400,000 × g) into a soluble fraction and a pellet. The PNS was fractionated into cytosol and a high speed pellet consisting of membranes, cytoskeleton, and ribosomal structures as follows. PNS was passed three times through a 27-gauge needle and cleared at 5,000 g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 400,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. For RNase treatment high speed pellets prepared from PNS and nuclear extract were resuspended in RNase digestion buffer (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated without or with RNases A (1 mg/ml) and T1 (50 units/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. After treatment the samples were fractionated into supernatant and pellet at 400,000 × g for 15 min. Proteins were separated on 8% or 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels prepared from a acrylamide stock (33.5% acrylamide, 0.3% bisacrylamide) and blotted onto Immobilon-P (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and probed with specific antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were decorated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies or protein G-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed twice in PBS and lysed in buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (40 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 min, and supernatants were precleared with GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 min. Immunoprecipitation of HsPI3K-C2α with antibody AXXIII was carried out at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Immune complexes were bound to GammaBind G-Sepharose for 30 min, collected by centrifugation, and washed two times in lysis buffer, once in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, then in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), once in 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, and finally in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.05% SDS. For λ-phosphatase treatment immunoprecipitates were additionally washed twice in phosphatase buffer (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% Brij 35) and resuspended in 50 μl of the same buffer. After warming up at 30 °C for 3 min, 50 units of λ-phosphatase (New England Biolabs) was added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. HsPI3K-C2α was immunoprecipitated as described in the previous section except that the washing steps were omitted and, instead, immune complexes bound to GammaBind were washed three time with lysis buffer and then treated with buffer or λ-phosphatase as mentioned above. After phosphatase treatment, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 0.5 m LiCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), once with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and once with 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2. The resulting immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm NaF). PI 3-kinase activity was determined in of 50 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 10 μg each PtdIns and phosphatidylserine, 0.1% sodium cholate, 0.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP. Samples were warmed up for 10 min at 30 °C, and reactions were initiated by the addition of MgCl2 and ATP (containing 5–10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)). Reactions were terminated after 20 min with 100 μl of 1 m HCl, and the lipids were extracted with 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1). The aqueous phase was washed twice with 80 μl of 1 mHCl:methanol (1:1), and the lipids were dried and analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described (29Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). HeLa cells, grown on glass coverslips, were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm Pipes (pH 6.7) for 1 min at room temperature and immediately fixed in cold (−70 °C) methanol for 10 min or in 0.4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After several washes in PBS the coverslips were blocked in PGB (PBS containing 10% goat serum (Sigma) and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) for 15 min followed by the incubation with the primary antibody for 1 h in a humidified chamber. Antibodies were diluted in PGB and used at the following concentrations: affinity-purified anti-HsPI3K-C2α (5 μg/ml), anti-Sm serum (1:1000 dilution). The coverslips were then washed several times with PBS and incubated again with PGB for 10 min. Fluorescence dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (1 μg/ml) were added for 1 h in PGB. Coverslips were then washed extensively with PBS and once with water and mounted in polyvinyl alcohol (Gelvatol, Sigma) supplemented with 1% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (Sigma). PI 3-kinases were shown to associate with different cellular compartments including the cytosol, the plasma membrane, endosomes, and the nucleus. To study the subcellular localization of the type II HsPI3K-C2α, we generated two polyclonal antibodies directed against the N terminus of the human sequence (amino acids 1–134, AXXIII) and a domain encompassing amino acids 62–171 of the murine homologue p170 (AXIX). Both antibodies immunoprecipitated HsPI3K-C2α from cell lysates and recognized the protein on Western blots. The specificity of the antibodies was further confirmed by mass spectrometry of peptides obtained by proteolytic digestion of immunoprecipitated proteins (Table I). Affinity-purified antibody preparations were used for the indirect immunofluorescence analysis of the subcellular localization of HsPI3K-C2α. As shown in Fig. 1, HeLa cells stained with antibody AXIX display a weak punctate staining in the cytoplasm. The most prominent signal was observed in the nucleus, where HsPI3K-C2α concentrates in speckle-like structures. HsPI3K-C2α-positive speckles appear to surround nucleoli and were not observed outside of the nucleus. This particular nuclear localization of HsPI3K-C2α was also detected in primary human dendritic cells and a variety of cell lines tested such as human pancreatic Aspc-1 cells and epithelial tumor MCF7 cells as well as murine macrophages J774A.1 and fibroblast NIH-3T3. A similar immunostaining pattern of HsPI3K-C2α is observed with antibody (AXXIII), with the only difference that the speckles were set against a diffuse staining of the nucleoplasm. The difference is most likely because of the accessibility of the distinct epitopes. Antibody AXXIII recognizes HsPI3K-C2α, which is associated with speckles and diffusely distributed in the nucleoplasm, whereas antibody AXIX reacts preferentially with a subset of HsPI3K-C2α that is present in speckles. Preincubation of antibodies with the corresponding recombinant antigens completely abolished nuclear staining (not shown). The staining of HsPI3K-C2α was independent on the fixation method employed; however, the best results were obtained by using methanol fixation. Permeabilization of cells with Triton X-100 before fixation did not alter the nuclear staining pattern, indicating that the kinase was resistant to detergent extraction.Table IProteolytic peptides of HsPI3K-C2α detected by mass spectrometry45DRQVTDNGRGFELSSSTRK6386RALDIDVEK94230IASTSEFLK2381016DALHDVQSFSTRYEHVLGALLSVGGK10401041RLREELLK10481415TYSFRQDGRIK1425Peptides were obtained after digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C.

Mass determination was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight spectrocopy. Cell fractionation experiments were performed to further investigate the subcellular localization of HsPI3K-C2α. Homogenates of HeLa cells were subjected to differential centrifugation and separated into nuclei and PNS. Fig. 2 A shows that HsPI3K-C2α is present in the nuclear fraction and in the PNS. After high speed centrifugation of the PNS, all HsPI3K-C2α was recovered in the pellet from which it could not be solubilized with the detergent Triton X-100. Treatment of nuclei with the Triton X-100, which removes nuclear membranes but leaves the nuclear lamina intact, also did not release HsPI3K-C2α (Fig. 2 A). In accordance with the immunofluorescence data, these findings indicate that in the nuclei and in the PNS, HsPI3K-C2α is not retained by cellular membranes, but it is associated with Triton X-100-insoluble macromolecular structures. Extraction of nuclei with high ionic strength (0.4 m NaCl) or treatment with DNase I also did not solubilize HsPI3K-C2α (Fig.2 A), suggesting that the kinase is not bound to DNA but, rather, associates with the nuclear matrix or RNA-containing structures. Fractionation of the nuclei into nuclear extract and envelope resulted in separation of HsPI3K-C2α from lamin B, which suggests that the kinase is not a constituent of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 2 B). High speed centrifugation led to the precipitation of HsPI3K-C2α from nuclear extract, indicating that in the extract the kinase remained associated with macromolecular structures. Next, we examined whether the association of HsPI3K-C2α with nuclear and cytoplasmic complexes depends on the presence of RNA. Fig. 2 C shows that after prolonged incubation with RNases A and T1, HsPI3K-C2α was almost completely released from the high speed pellet obtained from nuclear extracts and was also to a large extent released from complexes isolated from the PNS. From this finding it can be concluded that in both, the cytoplasm and the nucleus, HsPI3K-C2α associates with RNA-containing structures. Many nuclear factors localize in distinct nuclear “bodies” or subnuclear compartments that exhibit a spot-like pattern when analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Because HsPI3K-C2α shows a comparable staining pattern, we attempted to determine with which type of subnuclear bodies the kinase associates. Double labeling of HeLa cells with antibody AXIX and a human autoimmune Sm antiserum, which reacts with Sm proteins and U170K of snRNPs, revealed a marked co-localization HsPI3K-C2α with snRNPs (Fig. 3). Many Sm antiserum-reactive speckles were also positive for HsPI3K-C2α. A similar pattern of co-localization was observed for HsPI3K-C2α and the 5′-terminal trimethylguanosine (m3G) cap of snRNPs (not shown). However, double immunostaining of HeLa cells for HsPI3K-C2α and known components of POD (promyelocytic leukemia [PML]-organizing domains containing the PML protein), coiled bodies (fibrillarin, coilin A), and particles containing the autoantigen of Sjorgen’s syndrome La/SS-B failed to show an association of the kinase with these nuclear structures (not shown). Thus, HsPI3K-C2α displays significant co-localization only with snRNPs. High transcriptional activity of the cell coincides with a more widespread localization of pre-mRNA-processing factors and small speckles, whereas upon inhibition of transcription by RNA polymerase II, speckles lose their irregular shape, round up, and fuse into larger clusters. To examine the effect of the inhibition of RNA polymerase II on the subnuclear localization of HsPI3K-C2α, HeLa cells were treated with α-amanitin (40 μg/ml) or actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) for 5 h. Cells incubated with α-amanitin showed a similar alteration in the shape of HsPI3K-C2α-positive and Sm-positive speckles (Fig. 3). Speckles appear more round, and connections between them are no longer visible compared with control cells (Fig. 3). The same effect was observed when cells were treated with actinomycin D (not shown). By contrast, inhibition of translation with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) for 5 h had no effect on the subnuclear localization of HsPI3K-C2α and Sm proteins (Fig. 3). This observation indicates that the structure of the speckles is not maintained by labile protein factors. Inhibition of transcription or translation neither caused a redistribution of HsPI3K-C2α between"

In Streptococcus pneumoniae, CpsB, CpsC, and CpsD affect tyrosine phosphorylation and are critical for the production of a mature capsule in vitro. To characterize the interactions between these proteins and the phosphorylation event they modulate,cps2B, cps2C, and cps2D from the capsule type 2 S. pneumoniae D39 were cloned and expressed both individually and in combination in Escherichia coli. Cps2D purified from E. coli was not phosphorylated unless it was co-expressed with its cognate transmembrane domain, Cps2C. Purified phosphorylated Cps2D had tyrosine kinase activity and could phosphorylate both dephosphorylated Cps2D and an exogenous substrate (poly-Glu-Tyr) in the absence of ATP. Cps2B exhibited phosphatase activity against both purified phosphorylated Cps2D and p-nitrophenyl phosphate. An additional role for Cps2B as an inhibitor of Cps2D phosphorylation was demonstrated in both co-expression experiments in E. coli and in vitro experiments where it blocked the transphosphorylation of Cps2D even in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate. cps2C and cps2D deletion mutants in S. pneumoniae produced no detectable mature capsule during laboratory culture. Both were avirulent in systemic mouse infections and were unable to colonize the nasopharynx, suggesting that the failure to produce capsule was not dependent on the environment. Based on these results, we propose a model for capsule regulation where CpsB, CpsC, CpsD, and ATP form a stable complex that enhances capsule synthesis.

To date, 90 serologically and structurally distinct capsular polysaccharides have been identified among S. pneumoniae isolates (9Henrichsen J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2759-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capsule genetic loci are arranged as cassettes, with genes encoding functions required to produce a specific capsule structure flanked by genes common to all capsular serotypes (10Arrecubieta C. Garcia E. Lopez R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Dillard J.P. Vandersea M.W. Yother J. J. Exp.

The upstream common region, found in apparently all capsule types, is comprised of four genes: cpsA, cpsB, cpsC, and cpsD (13Guidolin A. Morona J.K. Morona R. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect.

Because of their conserved nature, the proteins encoded by these sequences are expected to play a general but necessary role in the production, processing, or regulation of capsule. In the type 3 capsule locus, most of these genes are truncated or otherwise mutated, and the functions they encode are irrelevant to type 3 synthesis, which proceeds by a processive mechanism involving a single polymerase (10Arrecubieta C.

Capsule production in most of the of the other S. pneumoniae serotypes is expected to occur by a mechanism analogous to that of the Escherichia coli K antigens and involves the formation of a lipid-linked repeat unit on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (17Kolkman M.A. Wakarchuk W. Nuijten P.J. van der Zeijst B.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Polymerization of repeat units is predicted to occur on the extracellular face of the membrane by a mechanism involving growth at the reducing end of the polymer (18Whitfield C. Roberts I.S. Mol.

The best studied of these homologues, ExoP from Sinorhizobium meliloti and the Wzc proteins from E. coli, are single proteins whose N-terminal transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmic (ATP-binding) domains correspond to the S. pneumoniae CpsC and CpsD, respectively (20Gonzalez J.E.

The membrane-associated linker domain that connects the transmembrane and ATP-binding domains in the Gram-negative homologues is not present in the S. pneumoniae proteins. ExoP has been directly linked to chain length regulation in S. meliloti, and defined mutations cause a shift from high molecular mass exopolysaccharide succinoglycan to low molecular mass exopolysaccharide succinoglycan, as well as an increase in free repeat units in the medium (20Gonzalez J.E.

These activities suggest a role for ExoP and its homologues in the polymerization of bacterial polysaccharides. Homologues of CpsC and CpsD occur in other streptococci, including Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus), where loss of these proteins causes a reduction in polysaccharide molecular size (25Cieslewicz M.J.

Deletion ofcps19fC or cps19fD in this strain resulted in very small amounts of capsular polysaccharide and a failure to produce a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein similar in size to Cps19fD.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 1M. H. Bender and J. Yother, unpublished data. 1M. H. Bender and J. Yother, unpublished data.Site-directed mutations in cps19fD showed that phosphorylation was dependent on a tyrosine-rich domain, as well as the active site of a Walker A ATP-binding domain (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, although the ATP binding domain was essential for capsule production, the tyrosine-rich domain was not. Thus, ATP binding to CpsD, but not phosphorylation is necessary for capsule production. Acps19fB deletion resulted in increased levels of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, but 10-fold less capsule was detected on this mutant. This result, coupled with the location ofcpsB upstream of cpsC and cpsD in an arrangement that parallels the Wzb phosphatase homologue locations (21Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), led Morona et al. (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to suggest that CpsB may be a phosphatase, although it lacks homology to any known phosphatases.The process of tyrosine phosphorylation and its relationship to capsule production in S. pneumoniae is still poorly understood and is different from the E. coli K antigen system, where phosphorylation positively affects polysaccharide synthesis (22Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 26: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It appears to be similar, however, to colanic acid synthesis in E. coli, where phosphorylation results in decreased synthesis (29Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J. Doublet P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Information regarding the role of CpsB is especially limited because of its unique sequence and the scarcity of enzymatic data for any of its streptococcal homologues. In this study, we analyzed the interaction between Cps2B, Cps2C, and Cps2D from the type 2 S. pneumoniae D39 in both in vitro assays and E. coli expression systems. The type 2 polysaccharide repeat unit2 consists of a tetrasaccharide backbone of →4)-β-d-Glc-(1→3)-α-l-Rha-(1→3)-α-l-Rha-(1→3)-β-l-Rha-(1→ with a disaccharide side chain of α-d-GlcUA-(1→6)-α-d-Glc- linked α-(1→2) to the first rhamnose in the backbone from the side chain glucose (30Jansson P.E. Lindberg B. Anderson M. Lindquist U. Henrichsen J. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 182: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The sequence of the type 2 locus containing the genes required to produce this polymer has been determined, and the type 2 common genes are highly homologous to those in all S. pneumoniae capsule types (31Iannelli F. Pearce B.J. Pozzi G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2652-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate tyrosine kinase activity for Cps2D and phosphatase activity for Cps2B. We also show that Cps2B has two different activities that may modulate capsule production in S. pneumoniae. Our results suggest that CpsB may be a central point of control for the capsule-associated phosphotyrosine regulatory system.DISCUSSIONBased on studies performed with the type 19F-Rx1 S. pneumoniae (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and the purified Gram-negative CpsD homologues (21Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol.

IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 339-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), CpsD was expected to be an autophosphorylating tyrosine kinase. Our results demonstrated tyrosine kinase activity for Cps2D and showed that Cps2C was required for its initial autophosphorylation. Once phosphorylated, however, Cps2D alone was an active tyrosine kinase. This result mimicked that seen with theE. coli K30 capsule homologue Wzccps, where the transmembrane domain is essential for phosphorylation, but contrasted with the E. coli colanic acid homologue Wzcca, where phosphorylation occurred independent of the transmembrane domain (22Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 26: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 38Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Bonci A. Cresti S. Rossolini G.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 191-198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are three potential sites of phosphorylation within the phosphotyrosine acceptor domain of Cps2D (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 31Iannelli F. Pearce B.J. Pozzi G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2652-2654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The banding patterns observed when Cps2C and Cps2D were co-expressed in E. coli indicated that multiple tyrosines were phosphorylated in this system, but complete phosphorylation of the tyrosine-rich domain may not occur.Cps2D∼P purified from E. coli lacked the transmembrane Cps2C, yet it retained tyrosine kinase activity and the ability to transfer a phosphate to an endogenous substrate. The latter was neither dependent on nor affected by ATP, suggesting that the phosphate was being transferred directly from Cps2D∼P. Thus, although Cps2C is required for the initial autophosphorylation of Cps2D, it is not a factor in transphosphorylation. Of the three polysaccharide-associated tyrosine kinases that have been purified from Gram-negative bacteria, only Wzc22 min (formerly Etk) has been shown to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate (poly-Glu-Tyr) (26Ilan O. Bloch Y. Frankel G. Ullrich H. Geider K. Rosenshine I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3241-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Ptk, the first member of this family to be characterized, failed to transphosphorylate poly-Glu-Tyr (37Grangeasse C. Vincent C. Doublet P. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 339-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Wzcca was not tested (21Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known whether these other proteins can transphosphorylate in the absence of their transmembrane domains. The ability of CpsD∼P to do so and to localize to the cytoplasm (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) allows for the possibility that it can act as a second messenger with the ability to phosphorylate other proteins in the cell. Experiments in our laboratory are being performed to study this possibility.Morona et al. (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) showed that deletion ofcps19fB resulted in an increase in intensity of the CpsD∼P band on an anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot. This result, coupled with the fact that the majority of Gram-negative polysaccharide tyrosine kinase systems have a cognate phosphatase that is encoded by a gene located upstream of the kinase-encoding sequence (21Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CpsB has no homology to other known phosphotyrosine-protein phosphatases nor to any proteins other than its homologues in the streptococcal, staphylococcal, and lactococcal capsule loci (39Rubens C.E. Wessels M.R. Heggen L.M. Kasper D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7208-7212Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 40Sau S. Bhasin N. Wann E.R. Lee J.C. Foster T.J. Lee C.Y.

Microbiol. 1997; 24: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast to the enzymes in Gram-negative bacteria, which are low molecular mass acid phosphatases, CpsB has a higher molecular mass (28 kDa versus 17 kDa) and exhibits optimum phosphatase activity at a higher pH (8.0 versus 6.5) (21Vincent C. Doublet P. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Cozzone A.J. Duclos B. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3472-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vincent C. Duclos B. Grangeasse C. Vaganay E. Riberty M. Cozzone A.J.

Biol. 1998; 278: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A domain search of the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) revealed limited homology to a family of phosphoesterases, but the resulting alignments failed to define regions with functional homology (data not shown). In addition to its phosphatase activity, Cps2B bound Cps2D and Cps2D∼P and inhibited the transfer of a phosphate from Cps2D∼P to Cps2D, even when its phosphatase activity was eliminated. CpsB thus appears to be a novel phosphatase with two mechanisms by which it can affect capsule synthesis, i.e. removal of phosphates from CpsD∼P and prevention of the phosphorylation event.The mechanism(s) by which CpsC/CpsD and their homologues affect polysaccharide synthesis is not known. Phosphorylation appears to be a central controlling point in all of the systems, although opposite effects have been reported. In S. pneumoniae capsules and E. coli colanic acid synthesis, phosphorylation inhibits polysaccharide production, whereas assembly of the E. coli K30 capsular polysaccharide is enhanced by phosphorylation (22Wugeditsch T. Paiment A. Hocking J. Drummelsmith J. Forrester C. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 26: 2361-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C.

Biol. 2000; 304: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Our results with the cloned pneumococcal proteins indicate that interaction of CpsC and CpsD with concomitant phosphorylation of CpsD is the default state that occurs in the absence of any other regulatory controls. This observation, along with the fact that capsule expression in S. pneumoniae occurs in the absence of CpsD phosphorylation (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), suggests that another protein may ultimately control phosphorylation associated with CpsD. Based on the activities of CpsB, we suggest that it may fulfill such a role. A current model ofS. pneumoniae capsule production suggests that CpsD and CpsB are involved in a cycle of ATP-dependent phosphorylation and dephosphorylation that modulates CpsD∼P levels. The results of Morona et al. (28Morona J.K. Paton J.C. Miller D.C. Morona R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) showed that CpsB, CpsC, CpsD, and a functional ATP binding site in CpsD are required for capsule synthesis, but phosphorylation is not necessary. Their model proposed that capsule production is enhanced when a complex that includes CpsC, CpsD, and bound ATP is formed. To that, we would add CpsB. The requirement for CpsB in the complex readily explains the reduced encapsulation of the CpsB mutants, provides a more efficient mechanism for controlling capsule synthesis, and is consistent with the observation that phosphorylation of Cps2D in E. coli is inhibited by the presence of Cps2B.Although the specific steps at which tyrosine kinases affect polysaccharide synthesis are not known, data from both the Gram-positive and Gram-negative systems suggest that polymerization of repeat units may be involved (20Gonzalez J.E.

Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Formation of the putative CpsB-CpsC-CpsD-ATP complex may allow for efficient synthesis of high molecular mass polymer by either directly or indirectly enhancing the activity of the polymerase. Dissociation of the complex, presumably resulting from some environmental signal, would result in autophosphorylation of CpsD and a reduction in polymerization. Whether CpsD∼P directly affects the polymerase or any other functions remains to be determined. The signal that might initiate dissociation of the complex is likewise unknown; however, the membrane-associated proteins CpsA and CpsC are potential candidates for sensors in the pathway. This mechanism for modulating capsule polymerization has direct relevance during infection and colonization. It has been shown that only low levels of capsule are required to colonize, but invasive infections require a substantially larger amount of capsule (4Magee A.D. Yother J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3755-3761Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The capsule-associated tyrosine kinase system represented by CpsB, CpsC, and CpsD has the potential to control the amount of capsule produced and therefore regulate the switch from a colonizing strain to an invasive one. Studies to directly test our model regarding the mechanism(s) of regulation associated with the tyrosine kinase system are underway. The results of those studies should allow us to further define the capsule synthesis complex and possible downstream phosphorylation events modulated by CpsD∼P. Production of a polysaccharide capsule is essential forStreptococcus pneumoniae virulence and colonization (1Avery O.T. Dubos R. J. Exp.

Capsule production allows S. pneumoniae to circumvent host defenses by blocking antibody deposition, reducing complement activation, and attenuating opsonophagocytosis (5Brown E.J. Curr. Top.

To date, 90 serologically and structurally distinct capsular polysaccharides have been identified among S. pneumoniae isolates (9Henrichsen J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1995; 33: 2759-2762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capsule genetic loci are arranged as cassettes, with genes encoding functions required to produce a specific capsule structure flanked by genes common to all capsular serotypes (10Arrecubieta C. Garcia E. Lopez R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Dillard J.P. Vandersea M.W. Yother J. J. Exp.

The upstream common region, found in apparently all capsule types, is comprised of four genes: cpsA, cpsB, cpsC, and cpsD (13Guidolin A. Morona J.K. Morona R. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5384-5396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Morona J.K. Morona R. Paton J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 751-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because of their conserved nature, the proteins encoded by these sequences are expected to play a general but necessary role in the production, processing, or regulation of capsule. In the type 3 capsule locus, most of these genes are truncated or otherwise mutated, and the functions they encode are irrelevant to type 3 synthesis, which proceeds by a processive mechanism involving a single polymerase (10Arrecubieta C.

The importance of growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues has been documented for PLCγ1; however, despite the critical importance of PLCγ2 in B-cell signal transduction, neither the tyrosine kinase(s) that directly phosphorylate PLCγ2 nor the sites in PLCγ2 that become phosphorylated after stimulation are known. By measuring the ability of human PLCγ2 to restore calcium responses to the B-cell receptor stimulation or oxidative stress in a B-cell line (DT40) deficient in PLCγ2, we have demonstrated that two tyrosine residues, Tyr753 and Tyr759, were important for the PLCγ2 signaling function. Furthermore, the double mutation Y753F/Y759F in PLCγ2 resulted in a loss of tyrosine phosphorylation in stimulated DT40 cells. Of the two kinases that previously have been proposed to phosphorylate PLCγ2, Btk, and Syk, purified Btk had much greater ability to phosphorylate recombinant PLCγ2 in vitro, whereas Syk efficiently phosphorylated adapter protein BLNK. Using purified proteins to analyze the formation of complexes, we suggest that function of Syk is to phosphorylate BLNK, providing binding sites for PLCγ2. Further analysis of PLCγ2 tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Btk and several kinases from the Src family has suggested multiple sites of phosphorylation and, in the context of a peptide incorporating residues Tyr753 and Tyr759, shown preferential phosphorylation of Tyr753.

Four families of mammalian phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC),1 PLCβ (β1–β4), PLCγ (γ1, γ2), PLCδ (δ1-δ4), and PLCε, have been described. Each family is characterized by the distinct domain organization and type of signaling pathways that regulate enzyme activity.PLCγ isoforms are mainly regulated through receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (e.g. growth factor receptors) or receptors (such as B- and T-cell antigen receptors) that are linked to the activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases through a complex signaling network (3Rebecchi M.J.

The two isoforms of PLCγ have distinct tissue distributions; whereas PLCγ1 is expressed ubiquitously, the pattern of expression of PLCγ2 is characterized by high levels in cells of hematopoietic origin. Transgenic studies suggested that the biological function of these isoforms is reflected in their cellular distribution. Thus, a deficiency in PLCγ1 is embryonic lethal in mice (6Ji Q.-S.

Generation of a number of targeted mutations in specific genes in DT40 cells provided valuable information about signaling components linking the activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. Using this system, it has been found that protein-tyrosine kinases from Src, Tec (e.g. Btk), and Syk/ZAP70 families are essential signaling components of the BCR pathway (10Takata T. Sabe H. Hata A.

Activation of Syk kinase results in phosphorylation of BLNK that could provide binding sites for PLCγ2 and a number of other proteins. Syk, together with Btk, has also been implicated in phosphorylation of PLCγ2, which, through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production, results in calcium mobilization. A similar pathway seems to be involved in calcium responses to oxidative stress after exposure of B-cells to hydrogen peroxide (16Tomlinson M.G. Woods D.B. McMahon M. Wahl M.I. Witte O.N. Kurosaki T.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the BCR complex and tyrosine kinases Syk, Lyn, and Btk, are components required for calcium responses. In addition, phosphorylation of several protein components, including BLNK and PLCγ2, has been described.Despite extensive genetic dissection of B-cell signal transduction, it has not been shown which tyrosine kinase(s) directly phosphorylate PLCγ2 or which sites in PLCγ2 become phosphorylated in response to BCR activation or oxidative stress. Similarly, the relative importance of specific tyrosine residues for signaling function of PLCγ2 has not been clarified. More generally, the molecular mechanism of activation of PLCγ and the role of phosphorylation in this process is not well understood. Previous studies of PLCγ phosphorylation have been mainly restricted to PLCγ1 in signaling through growth factor receptors (19Wahl M.I. Nishibe S. Kim J.-W. Kim H. Rhee S.-G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3944-3948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Kim J.-W. Sim S.-S. Kim U.-H. Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.-G. J. Biol.

Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These studies revealed multiple phosphorylation sites, not all of which appear to be functionally critical at least in the context of a specific signaling pathway.To analyze phosphorylation and importance of specific tyrosine residues in PLCγ2, we used DT40 cell lines stimulated by BCR cross-linking or by oxidative stress. In experiments where the human wild-type and mutated PLCγ2 constructs were tested for reconstitution of calcium responses in DT40 PLCγ2− cells, two tyrosine residues have been identified as important for PLCγ2 phosphorylation and activation in B-cells. Further experiments, using purified protein components, implicated tyrosine kinase Btk and possibly some kinases from the Src family in direct phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and suggested that the requirement for Syk kinase in PLCγ2 activation mainly involves phosphorylation of the adapter protein BLNK.DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation of both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 has been well documented for the majority of cellular systems where the activation of PLCγ isoforms takes place (3Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 4Rhee S.-G. Annu. Rev.

However, phosphorylation sites and the importance of specific tyrosine residues that become phosphorylated have been analyzed only for PLCγ1 in cells stimulated through growth factor receptors. Within a complex profile of PLCγ1-phosphorylated peptides, obtained after EGF stimulation, two main tyrosine-phosphorylated residues have been mapped as Tyr771 and Tyr1254, and one minor site has been found to correspond to Tyr783 (19Wahl M.I. Nishibe S. Kim J.-W. Kim H. Rhee S.-G. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3944-3948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the use of phosphospecific antibodies to Tyr(P)783confirmed phosphorylation of this site in stimulated cells (23Matsuda M. Paterson H.F. Rodriguez R. Fensome A.C. Ellis M.V. Swann K. Katan M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Yu H. Fukami K. Itoh T. Takenawa T. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Similar patterns of phosphorylation have been seen after stimulation of fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor and in several other systems (3Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 4Rhee S.-G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 5Carpenter G. Ji Q.-S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 21Kim H.-K. Kim J.-W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.-G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.-G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These (Tyr771, Tyr783, and Tyr1254) and some additional sites have been identified after in vitro phosphorylation of purified PLCγ1 by EGF receptor kinase (20Kim J.-W. Sim S.-S. Kim U.-H. Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Carpenter G. Rhee S.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3940-3943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutational studies have revealed that only Tyr783 was critical, while other residues had less impact on PLCγ1 function when tested in platelet-derived growth factor signaling (21Kim H.-K. Kim J.-W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.-G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.-G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), demonstrating that not all phosphorylation sites may be functionally important. Taking into account the complexity of the phosphorylation pattern and possible functional redundancy, the studies of PLCγ2 described here focused on a mutagenesis approach based on information obtained for the PLCγ1 isoform. Comparison of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 sequences has revealed that of three tyrosine residues in the loop region between the C-SH2 and the SH3 domain, only two are conserved (Tyr753 and Tyr759 in PLCγ2, the latter corresponding to phosphorylation site Tyr783 in PLCγ1), while there is no conservation of sequences in the C-terminal region, including residue Tyr1254 in PLCγ1 (Fig. 1). Our mutagenesis analysis of tyrosines in PLCγ2 within the C-SH2/SH3 loop region demonstrated that both Tyr753 and Tyr759 are required to restore calcium signaling in DT40 cells deficient in PLCγ (Fig.2 B). Thus, the conserved residue corresponding to Tyr759 in PLCγ2 and Tyr783 in PLCγ1 is important for the function of both isoforms. The other conserved residue (753 in PLCγ2/775 in PLCγ1) has not been mutated in PLCγ1 and has not been identified as one of the major phosphotyrosine sites in response to EGF stimulation. Further studies are required to establish whether or not this site is functionally important in any of a number of different signaling pathways leading to phosphorylation of PLCγ1.Comparison between properties of a double mutant within the C-SH2/SH3 loop region in PLCγ1 (Y771F/Y783F, where Tyr771 is unique for PLCγ1) observed in previous studies (21Kim H.-K. Kim J.-W. Zilberstein A. Margolis B. Kim J.-G. Schlessinger J. Rhee S.-G. Cell. 1991; 65: 435-441Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) with the PLCγ2 Y753F/Y759F double mutant in the same region described here (Figs. 2and 3) reveals several similarities. For example, both proteins (PLCγ1 Y771F/Y783F and PLCγ2 Y753F/Y759F) retained full in vitro catalytic activity. Also, when the function of these proteins has been analyzed in the context of platelet-derived growth factor signaling for PLCγ1 and in B-cell signaling for PLCγ2, these mutations not only inhibited generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and calcium mobilization but also abolished phosphorylation of the PLCγ protein. In the case of PLCγ1, it has been shown that the Y771F/Y783F mutation resulted in a loss of not only phosphorylation in the C-SH2/SH3 loop region but also phosphorylation of Tyr1254 at the C terminus. Since the phosphorylation profile of PLCγ2 in stimulated B-cells also appears to be complex, it is possible that the double mutation Y753F/Y759F in PLCγ2 could have a similar effect on other potential phosphorylation sites. It has been speculated that the main impact of tyrosine phosphorylation on the function of PLCγ isoforms could be to, through conformational changes, increase the access of the enzyme to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate present in the plasma membrane and in this way result in a higher rate of substrate hydrolysis (3Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 4Rhee S.-G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 5Carpenter G. Ji Q.-S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 253: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). However, these conformational changes in the C-SH2/SH3 loop region may also be required to expose additional phosphorylation sites.Genetic analysis of DT40 cells has suggested the importance of several nonreceptor tyrosine kinases for PLCγ2-mediated calcium signaling (8Kurosaki T. Maeda A. Ishiai M. Hashimoto A. Inabe K. Takata M. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 176: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar,9Kurosaki T. Tsukada S. Immunity. 2000; 12: 1-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been established which of these enzymes could phosphorylate PLCγ2 directly. This was examined here (Figs. 5, 6, and8) using purified preparations of PLCγ2 constructs and various tyrosine kinases with an emphasis on Btk and Syk, both essential for PLCγ2 signaling.The role of Btk in B-cell signaling has been extensively studied. B-cells deficient in Btk and stable cell lines where the wild-type or different Btk mutants have been transfected into these deficient cells have been assessed for calcium signaling and PLCγ2 phosphorylation (11Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 16Tomlinson M.G. Woods D.B. McMahon M. Wahl M.I. Witte O.N. Kurosaki T. Bolen J.B. Johnston J.A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1961-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). While the calcium responses in Btk−cells were abolished, in most reports only reduction in PLCγ2 phosphorylation has been observed, suggesting the involvement of additional tyrosine kinases in phosphorylation of this PLC. Thein vitro phosphorylation study using purified components described here demonstrated that Btk could directly phosphorylate PLCγ2, including an important residue, Tyr753 (Figs. 5,6, and 8). Our studies have also shown that additional sites are phosphorylated by Btk in vitro. However, the identity of all sites remains to be established, together with their physiological relevance. Furthermore, studies of Btk have also suggested that the role of this protein in calcium signaling could be more complex than a requirement for PLCγ2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Mutations in the Btk PH and SH2 domains as well as a mutation affecting the catalytic activity resulted in a loss of signaling function, as measured by restoration of calcium responses in DT40 Btk− cells (11Takata M. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). While the Btk PH domain could be involved in critical membrane binding interactions, it is possible that the Btk SH2 and/or SH3 domains provide important sites for a formation of a signaling complex. It has been reported recently that a tyrosine kinase-inactivating mutation (in the active site and different from the nonactive site mutation affecting the catalytic activity in a preceding study) did not abolish the function of Btk in calcium signaling (16Tomlinson M.G. Woods D.B. McMahon M. Wahl M.I. Witte O.N. Kurosaki T. Bolen J.B. Johnston J.A. BMC Immunol. 2001; 2: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This further emphasizes the potential scaffolding role of Btk and the possibility that the important tyrosine residues phosphorylated by Btk, and possibly other critical residues in PLCγ2, could also be phosphorylated by another kinase. Surprisingly, the studies using a panel of different tyrosine kinases (Fig. 8) have identified Lck, an Src family kinase where a link to B-cell signaling was not confirmed in all studies (10Takata T. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukuda T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 32Corey S.J. Anderson S.M.

Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2315-2321Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), as a tyrosine kinase that can efficiently phosphorylate a peptide incorporating Tyr753 and Tyr759 residues of PLCγ2.Protein-tyrosine kinase Syk has also been implicated in B-cell signaling and shown to be required for both PLCγ2 phosphorylation and calcium responses (10Takata T. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukuda T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the essential adapter protein BLNK, forming complexes with a number of signaling components including PLCγ2, needs to be phosphorylated by Syk in order to bind other proteins (13Fu C. Turck C.W. Kurosaki T. Chan A.C. Immunity. 1998; 9: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 14Ishiai M. Kurosaki M. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of Syk in calcium responses could be to phosphorylate both PLCγ2 and BLNK or to phosphorylate only BLNK, thereby enabling formation of signaling complexes. The data presented here (Fig. 5) show that Syk does not efficiently phosphorylate PLCγ2, but it does phosphorylate BLNK. Furthermore, phosphorylation of BLNK by Syk, in the absence of additional components, could be sufficient to provide docking sites for direct binding of PLCγ2 (Fig. 7).In summary, we identified tyrosine residues Tyr753 and Tyr759 as important for activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 in B-cells. Based on this observation, the roles of various tyrosine kinases that genetic analysis has implicated in regulation of PLCγ2 were further assessed. Direct phosphorylation of PLCγ2 by Btk is observed; however, the role of Syk may not be to phosphorylate PLCγ2 directly but to provide docking phosphotyrosine sites on the adapter protein BLNK, essential in B-cell signaling. The hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate by phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C occurs in response to a large number of extracellular signals (reviewed in Refs. 1Williams R.L.

Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). Four families of mammalian phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC),1 PLCβ (β1–β4), PLCγ (γ1, γ2), PLCδ (δ1-δ4), and PLCε, have been described. Each family is characterized by the distinct domain organization and type of signaling pathways that regulate enzyme activity. PLCγ isoforms are mainly regulated through receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (e.g. growth factor receptors) or receptors (such as B- and T-cell antigen receptors) that are linked to the activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases through a complex signaling network (3Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 4Rhee S.-G. Annu. Rev.

The two isoforms of PLCγ have distinct tissue distributions; whereas PLCγ1 is expressed ubiquitously, the pattern of expression of PLCγ2 is characterized by high levels in cells of hematopoietic origin. Transgenic studies suggested that the biological function of these isoforms is reflected in their cellular distribution. Thus, a deficiency in PLCγ1 is embryonic lethal in mice (6Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The importance of PLCγ2 in signaling in B-cells has not only been documented in experiments using transgenic animals deficient in PLCγ2 (7Wang D. Feng J. Wen R. Marine J.-C. Sangster M.Y. Parganas E.

Generation of a number of targeted mutations in specific genes in DT40 cells provided valuable information about signaling components linking the activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) to an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations. Using this system, it has been found that protein-tyrosine kinases from Src, Tec (e.g. Btk), and Syk/ZAP70 families are essential signaling components of the BCR pathway (10Takata T. Sabe H. Hata A.

In addition, an adapter BLNK (B-cell linker protein), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, and PLCγ2 itself were required for calcium responses triggered by the BCR (12Miyaka T. Maeda A.

Activation of Syk kinase results in phosphorylation of BLNK that could provide binding sites for PLCγ2 and a number of other proteins.

Most of the analogues do not possess a 3′-OH. Hence, when incorporated selectively into viral DNA by RT, DNA chain termination occurs and is responsible for the antiviral effect. During anti-retroviral therapies, the emergence of drug-resistant viruses limits the efficiency of nucleoside drugs, and this limitation represents a major cause of failure to control a HIV infection. Most drug-resistant viruses isolated from nucleoside analogue-treated patients harbor mutations in the viral pol gene (2Schinazi R. Larder B. Mellors J.W. Intl. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar). Remarkably, the set of resistance mutations selected during antiretroviral therapy is specific to the nucleoside drug. When 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT) is given as the sole drug, several patterns of amino acid changes involving M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215F or Y, and K219Q give rise to up to a 200-fold AZT-resistant virus (3Larder B.A. Kemp S.D.

When 2′,3′-dideoxynucleotides (ddNs) are given to patients, ddN-resistance emerges and is mainly correlated with single amino acid substitutions such as L74V or K65R (2Schinazi R. Larder B.

However, its clinical relevance is increasing since K65R has been identified in a significant number of viral isolates resistant to three recent antiretroviral drugs (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine, (−)-β-d-dioxolaneguanosine, and Abacavir (1592U89) (2Schinazi R.

K65R is thus a multidrug resistance substitution, and understanding the mechanism by which K65R confers drug resistance might help designing new drugs either elliciting no resistance or active against drug-resistant viruses. K65R RT has been extensively studied in vivo and in vitro, but a detailed molecular mechanism by which this substitution confers ddNTP resistance is still lacking. K65R RT has been reported to perform an equally (12Gu Z. Salomon H. Cherrington J.M. Mulato A.S. Chen M.S. Yarchoan R. Foli A. Sogocio K.M. Wainberg M.A. Antimicrob.

K65R RT shows resistance to ddNTPs relative to wild-type RT in steady-state kinetics assays by an unknown mechanism (6Gu Z. Fletcher R.S. Arts E.J. Wainberg M.A. Parniak M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28118-28122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Gu Z. Arts E.J. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The crystal structure of an RT·DNA·dNTP complex has revealed the catalytic mechanism of nucleotide incorporation into DNA (18Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar), but many questions remain concerning the role of K65R in drug resistance. Indeed, it can be seen in the crystal structure that the lysine 65 side chain contacts an oxygen atom on the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide poised for catalysis at the reverse transcriptase active site. The relation of this contact to drug resistance is puzzling since the γ-phosphate is too far (>7.5 Å) from the 3′-ribose position to explain satisfactorily how Arg65 could discriminate the 3′-deoxy moiety of an incoming ddNTP. Mutational analysis of lysine 65 and molecular modeling of this substitution in the RT active site have suggested that K65R alters the binding affinity of the ddNTP substrate (19Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Kaushik N. Lim H. Parniak M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 77-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, since dNTPs and ddNTPs are identical at their γ-phosphate position, it remains unclear how selectivity for 3′-OH is achieved. Pre-steady state kinetics is the method of choice to measure the substrate efficiency of a nucleotide analogue for RT. The efficiency of incorporation of a nucleotide into DNA is given by the ratiok pol/K d,k pol being the rate constant for the creation of the phosphodiester bond and K d the equilibrium binding (or affinity) constant of the nucleotide for RT (20Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Discrimination of a ddNTP relative to its natural counterpart dNTP is reflected by the efficiency of incorporation of the ddNMP into DNA relative to that of the natural substrate dNMP. Although this has been done for various ddNTPs and wild-type RT, such constants have not been determined for K65R RT. In this paper, we have made use of pre-steady state kinetics to determine the affinity constant K d as well as the catalytic constant k pol of formation of the phosphodiester bond for several dNTP and ddNTP substrates by either wild-type or K65R RT. We show that the presence of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the 3′-OH and one oxygen atom of the β-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide is critical for an efficient catalytic step. This intramolecular interaction represents the missing link to explain how ddNTPs are discriminated up to 14-fold better by K65R RT than wild-type RT. We show that these data can be used to design nucleotide analogues that efficiently suppress drug resistance at the enzyme level. The wild-type RT gene construct p66RTB has been described (21Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This plasmid was further modified and used to construct the mutant RT gene at codon 65 (K65R) using synthetic oligonucleotides and a strategy described in Ref. 21Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing. All recombinant RTs were expressed and purified as p66/p51 heterodimers, and active sites titrated as described (21Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, UK. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). All 32P-labeled nucleotides, adenosine 5′-triphosphate, 2′-deoxy- and 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates (dNTPs and ddNTPs) were purchased from Pharmacia. α-Borano-(R p)-2′,3′-dideoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate (α-BH3-dATP) was synthesized and purified essentially as described (22He K. Hasan A. Krzyzanowska B. Shaw B.R. J. Org. Chem. 1998; 63: 5769-5773Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). NMR assignments are available upon request. Diastereoisomers were purified (>99%) by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on C18 column using a 0 to 15% acetonitrile gradient in 10 mm triethyl ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.8. The pyrophosphorolytic repair assay has been described (24Selmi B. Boretto J. Navarro J.M. Sire J. Longhi S. Guerreiro C. Mulard L. Sarfati S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13965-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the primer/template system (50 nm) used for both pyrophosphorolysis and ATP-mediated repair assays was a 5′-32P-labeled 21-mer DNA primer (5′-ATACTTTAACCATATGTATCC-3′) annealed to a 35-mer (5′-NNNNNNNNNXNNNGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) DNA tem- plate. The varying template “X” specifies a single nucleotide insertion site for the nucleotide analogue under study, four bases away from the 3′ end of the primer. N represents any of the four nucleotides different from X. DNA polymerization was initiated by the addition of wild-type or K65R RT (100 nm) and nucleotides (5 μm of the analogue, 5′-triphosphate, and 25 μm each of 3 dNTPs at the exclusion of the natural counterpart of the nucleotide analogue) for 15 min at 37 °C in RT buffer. The repair reaction was started by adding the natural counterpart of the nucleotide analogue to reach a final concentration of 25 μm in the presence of either pyrophosphate (PPi) or ATP. In this manner, the repair reaction is performed in the presence of the next correct nucleotide binding on top of the terminated primer, under conditions approximating those found in the infected cell. Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and products analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. The % repair of blocked primer is the ratio ×100 of extension products larger than 25 nucleotides over those larger than 24 nucleotides (23Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D.

Pre-steady state kinetics were performed using dATP, dCTP, dTTP, ddATP, ddCTP, and α-BH3-ddATP in conjunction with wild-type and K65R RT as described (20Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of product (P) over time was fitted with a burst equation, (P)=A·(1−exp(−(kapp·t))+ksstEq. 1 where A is the amplitude of the burst,k app is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond, and k ss is the kinetic constant of the steady-state, linear phase. The dependence of k app on dNTP concentration is described by the hyperbolic equation, kapp=kpol·(dNTP)/(Kd+(dNTP))Eq. 2 where K d and k pol are the equilibrium constant and the catalytic rate constant of the dNTP for RT, respectively. K d and k pol were determined from curve-fitting using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, PA). The coordinates of RT in complex with DNA and nucleotide were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data base (PDB). The PBD accession number is 1RTD. The crystal structure models were displayed using TURBO and MOLSCRIPT programs (25Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Cryst. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar, 26Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Directory.in: Silicon Graphics Mountain View, CA1991: 97Google Scholar). The K65R substitution in RT is responsible for viral resistance to a variety of ddN. In the crystal structure of RT in complex with DNA and nucleotide, the ε-NH2 group of lysine 65 contacts the γ-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. This phosphate is part of the PPi product of the polymerization reaction. Because PPi- or ATP-mediated repair of analogue-terminated DNA chains are mechanisms of drug resistance (24Selmi B. Boretto J. Navarro J.M. Sire J. Longhi S. Guerreiro C. Mulard L. Sarfati S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13965-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), the K65R substitution might enhance the pyrophosphorolytic reaction and thus RT-mediated repair of ddNMP-terminated DNA. On the other hand, K65R RT has been reported to discriminate against ddNTPs better than wild-type RT using steady-state kinetic assays (17Gu Z. Arts E.J. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2760-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Sluis-Cremer N. Arion D. Kaushik N. Lim H. Parniak M.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 77-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the K65R substitution is able to interact either directly or indirectly with the 3′-OH of the incoming nucleotide, and that resistance proceeds by enhanced discrimination against ddNTPs rather than repair of ddNMP-terminated DNA. As a first step to determine which of these mechanisms might be involved in K65R RT-mediated ddNTP resistance, the crystal structure of a ternary complex made of RT, a DNA primer/template, and a nucleotide was examined. Examination of the crystal structure of the RT·DNA·dNTP ternary complex (18Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) shows that the 3′-OH of the incoming nucleotide makes an intramolecular hydrogen bond with one nonbridging oxygen of the β-phosphate (Fig.1). In this manner, the nucleotide is held in the active site so as to facilitate the in-line attack of the 3′-OH of the primer onto the α-phosphate of the incoming nucleotide. Apart from lysine 65, arginine 72, the main chain nitrogen of alanine 114, and the magnesium ions stabilize the triphosphate moiety. The intramolecular hydrogen bond does not exist when a ddNTP is incorporated, and this lack of interaction may explain why ddNTPs are less efficient substrates for incorporation than dNTPs. This catalytically important hydrogen bond has been inferred in both the bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase/DNA/ddNTP and the rat β-polymerase DNA·ddNTP ternary complexes (28Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar, 29Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a similar intramolecular hydrogen bond activating phosphoryltransfer also exists in nucleotide diphosphate kinase (23Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this case, the 3′-OH of the phosphorylated nucleoside diphosphate hydrogen bonds to O-6 bridging the β,γ-phosphate and activates it, explaining why ddNDPs are 104-fold less efficient substrates than dNDPs. Because this catalytically important hydrogen bond occurs between the 3′-OH and the β-phosphate belonging to the PPi moiety of the nucleotide, this hydrogen bond might also be critical during pyrophosphorolysis, the reverse reaction of DNA polymerization. Indeed, when the DNA chain is terminated with a ddNMP, no hydrogen bond would be formed between the incoming PPi and the 3′-ddNMP-terminated DNA. We hypothesized that this lack of interaction should affect either PPi binding or the pyrophosphorolysis reaction rate, and might relate K65R with pyrophosphorolysis and drug resistance. This hypothesis was tested using a primer terminated by thymine nucleotide analogues presenting different 3′-groups. Four thymine analogues were used in this experiment: AZTTP, 3′-NH2-dTTP, d4TTP, and ddTTP. Pyrophosphorolytic or ATP-mediated repair of either analogue-terminated DNA was examined using a gel-based assay as described previously (24Selmi B. Boretto J. Navarro J.M. Sire J. Longhi S. Guerreiro C. Mulard L. Sarfati S. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13965-13974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this assay, DNA synthesis by RT is terminated at a specific template position by incorporation of a 3′-modified thymidine analogue in the absence of dTTP. Then, dTTP and either ATP or PPi are added to the reaction, excision of the terminator occurs, and synthesis resumes because of the presence of dTTP. The appearance of extension products is diagnostics of the ability of RT to repair the terminated DNA chain using ATP or PPi. The results are presented in Fig.2. Wild-type RT is able to repair AZTMP-terminated DNA with best efficiency when compared with other terminated DNAs (Fig.2 A). Using 150 μm PPi, the repair efficiency of AZTMP-terminated DNA is ∼4-fold better than that observed using 3.2 mm ATP, the latter having almost no effect on other terminated DNAs (not shown). The efficiency of PPi-mediated repair follows the decreasing order AZTMP ≫ ddTMP> 3′-NH2-dTMP = d4TMP, indicating that the nature of the 3′-ribosyl is important for the repair reaction. In agreement with results obtained by others, the ddNMP-terminated DNA chain is poorly repaired by RT relative to AZTMP-terminated DNA (27Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar,30Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Using K65R RT, again 3.2 mm ATP do not promote significant repair of ddNMP-terminated DNA when compared with PPi (not shown). Using either K65R RT or wild-type RT, AZTMP-terminated DNA is repaired better than ddCMP or ddAMP-terminated DNA using 150 μm PPi (Fig. 2 B). Unlike in the case of AZTMP-terminated DNA, ddNMP-terminated DNA repair seems to level off during the course of the repair reaction. This suggests that either the repair reaction reaches an equilibrium between repair and synthesis during the course of the experiment, or most of the RT·ddNMP-terminated DNA complex is under a form which is catalytically noncompetent for the repair reaction. As described in the case of AZT resistance, the latter form could be a dead-end complex made of RT, the terminated DNA, and the next correct nucleotide binding on top of the terminated primer (27Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 30Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Schinazi R.F. So A.G. Scott W.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 3465-3472Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The repair reaction was conducted under several experimental conditions of nucleotide, PPi, primer/template, and RT concentrations. Under no circumstances was a significant difference in the efficiency of repair of ddNMP-terminated DNA observed between wild-type and K65R RT (not shown). Both the low level of repair of ddNMP, relative to AZTMP-terminated DNA and the similar behavior of wild-type relative to K65R RT suggests that ddNMP-terminated DNA repair is not significantly involved in the mechanism of resistance by K65R RT. Therefore, discrimination of ddNTP at the RT active site is a likely alternative, and was examined using wild-type and K65R RT comparatively. Discrimination of a ddNTP relative to a dNTP can be measured using pre-steady state kinetics of incorporation of a single nucleotide into DNA by RT (20Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Reardon J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4473-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In these experiments, the binding affinity K d of a nucleotide for RT can be determined together with the rate constant k polof phosphodiester bond formation. The ratiok pol/K d is defined as the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation into DNA, and allows comparison of incorporation efficiencies between any nucleotide substrates. Such measurements were first performed for adenine and cytidine nucleotides, and the results are presented in TableI.Table IPre-steady state kinetic constants of wild-type and K65R RT for primed heteropolymeric DNA templatesWild-type RTK65R RTdATPddATPdCTPddCTPdTTPdATPddATPdCTPddCTPdTTPKd (μm)aKd and k pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.7.4733.87.8814.2517.5bValue from Selmi et al.

Open table in a new tab Wild-type RT discriminates ddATP and ddCTP relative to dATP and dCTP, respectively. Using dATP and ddATP, the discrimination originates less from a loss of affinity than from a decrease in the catalytic rate constant. Indeed, K d increases 4.5-fold from 7.5 to 33.8 μm while k pol decreases 7.7-fold from 50.2 s−1 to 6.5 s−1. The overall incorporation efficiencyk pol/K d drops 35-fold from 6.7 s−1 μm−1 to 0.19 s−1 μm−1 upon the absence of a 3′-OH group in the adenine nucleotide. Although less pronounced, the results are similar when dCTP is compared with ddCTP. The absence of a 3′-OH group in the cytidine nucleotide increases the affinity constant 2-fold (from 7.9 to 14.25 μm) while the catalytic constant decreases 2.8-fold (7.3 to 2.6 s−1). The overall incorporation efficiencyk pol/K d decreases only 5-fold from 0.93 s−1 μm−1 to 0.18 s−1 μm−1 upon the absence of a 3′-OH group in the cytidine nucleotide. We note that the catalytic rate constant k pol (dATP) at 50.2 s−1 is almost 7-fold higher than k pol (dCTP) at 7.3 s−1, a result in agreement with others (20Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Reardon J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4473-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We conclude that wild-type RT exhibits a “natural” resistance to ddATP and ddCTP. Wild-type RT is able to discriminate 35- and 5-fold ddATP and ddCTP relative to their natural counterparts dATP and dCTP, respectively. The same experiments were conducted using K65R RT. As shown in Table I, this variant RT discriminates ddATP and ddCTP relative to dATP and dCTP in a more pronounced fashion than wild-type RT, respectively. Using dATP and ddATP, the discrimination again originates less from a decreased affinity than from a decrease in the catalytic rate constant. K d increases 6.9-fold from 6.9 to 47.5 μm while k poldecreases 16.4-fold from 11.6 s−1 to 0.7 s−1. This yields an overall 112-fold decrease in incorporation efficiencyk pol/K d from 1.69 s−1 μm−1 to 0.015 s−1 μm−1 upon the absence of a 3′-OH group in the adenine nucleotide. For cytidine nucleotides, both a 9.2-fold increase in K d and a 8-fold decrease ink pol yield a 74-fold drop in the efficiency of incorporation k pol/K d, from 0.96 to 0.013 s−1 μm−1. We conclude that K65R RT exhibits resistance to both ddATP and ddCTP as judged by the 112- and 74-fold discrimination of ddATP and ddCTP relative to dATP and dCTP, respectively. Resistance to ddNTPs by a variant RT is defined as the ratio between discrimination observed using variant RT over discrimination observed for wild-type RT. For adenine nucleotides, K65R RT discriminates 112-fold against ddATP whereas wild-type RT discriminates only 35-fold against ddATP. Therefore, K65R RT is 3.2-fold resistant to ddATP. When cytidine nucleotides are considered, a discrimination of 74-fold by K65R RT is compared with a 5-fold discrimination by wild-type RT, yielding a 14-fold resistance to ddCTP by K65R RT. We note that in the case of adenine nucleotides, K65R RT acquires resistance to ddATP at the expense of general dNTP incorporation efficiency. Indeed, K d(dATP) remain"

Analysis of the effects of individual Aib substitutions at each position in [Ala3,12,Gln10,Har11,Trp14]PTH(1–14)NH2([M]PTH(1–14)) on cAMP-stimulating potency in HKRK-B28 cells revealed that Aib at most positions diminished potency; however, Aib at positions 1 and 3 enhanced potency. Thus [Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–14) was ∼100-fold more potent than [M]PTH(1–14) (EC50 = 1.1 ± 0.1 and 100 ± 20 nm, respectively), ∼100,000-fold more potent than native PTH(1–14), and 2-fold more potent than PTH(1–34).

The structure of PTH as it is bound to the P1R is not known, but NMR analyses of PTH(1–34) analogs in a variety of polar and non-polar solvents suggest that the N-terminal portion of PTH (within residues Ser3 to Lys13) contains a short segment of α-helix.

A recent crystallographic study of PTH(1–34) reveals a continuous helical structure that extends nearly the full length of the molecule (Ser3 to Asn33) with only a slight (15°) bend at the midsection (19Jin L. Briggs S.L. Chandrasekhar S. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Schevitz R.W. Smiley D.L. Tashjian A.H. Zhang F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27238-27244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Short N-terminal native PTH peptide fragments, such as PTH(1–14)NH2, exhibit very weak signaling potency (EC50 for stimulation of cAMP accumulation ∼100 μm) (11Luck M.D. Carter P.H. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The weak activity of such N-terminal peptides is due, at least in part, to their weak receptor-binding affinity. In the case of PTH(1–34), most of the receptor-binding energy is derived from interactions between the (15–34) portion of the ligand and the large (∼170 amino acid) N-terminal extracellular domain of the receptor (N domain) (6Bergwitz C.

These N domain interactions are thought to position the N-terminal residues of the ligand within proximity of the J domain of the receptor, and thereby enable the interactions that are required for the induction of transmembrane signaling (6Bergwitz C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7741-7753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In a recent series of studies on the PTH(1–14) scaffold peptide, we showed that certain substitutions at several sites in the peptide resulted in enhanced potency (23Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Shimizu M. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.J. J. Biol.

Acta. 2001; 1538: 290-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The most potent PTH(1–14) analog thus identified was [Ala3,12,Gln10,Har11,Trp14]PTH(1–14)NH2([M]PTH(1–14)), which is 1,600-fold more potent than native PTH(1–14) for stimulating cAMP formation in LLC-PK1-derived HKRK-B28 cells, and only 60-fold weaker than PTH(1–34) (23Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At least some component of the improvement in signaling capability observed in [M]PTH(1–14) can be attributed to improvements in binding affinity, as the peptide could inhibit the binding of 125I-PTH(3–34) to HKRK-B28 cells (IC50 ∼90 μm), whereas native PTH(1–14) could not (23Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Each PTH(1–14) peptide (native or modified) studied to date exhibits approximately the same signaling potency on a mutant P1R construct that lacks most of the N-terminal domain (P1R-delNt) as it does on the wild-type P1R; in contrast, PTH(1–34) is 100-fold less potent on P1R-delNt as it is on P1R-WT (11Luck M.D. Carter P.H. Gardella T.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T.

Thus, unlike PTH(1–34), which utilizes both N and J domain interactions and thereby achieves high potency, the N-terminal PTH peptide fragments appear to utilize only J domain interactions. These findings suggest that high potency could be attained by an N-terminal PTH analog that interacts only with the J domain, providing that the problem of weak binding affinity is overcome. In experimental support of this notion is the finding that N-terminally truncated PTH-1 receptor constructs which have the N-terminal residues of PTH (e.g. residues 1–11) covalently tethered to TM1 of the J domain exhibit robust basal cAMP signaling activity (10Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19456-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the current study, we extended our work on N-terminal PTH analogs and investigated the functional consequences of introducing α-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) substitutions into [M]PTH(1–14) and related analogs. This sterically hindered amino acid constrains the peptide backbone conformation often as an α-helix (26Kaul R. Balaram P. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 7: 105-117Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our functional data show that Aib substitutions at positions 1 and 3 of N-terminal PTH oligopeptide analogs result in considerable improvements in the capacities of the peptides to interact with the P1R, specifically with the juxtamembrane region of the receptor. These functional effects are associated with changes in the spectroscopic properties of the peptides that are indicative of increased α-helicity. All peptide analogs contained a free N terminus and a carboxamide at the C terminus. The peptide indicated as PTH(1–34) is [Nle8,21,Tyr34]ratPTH(1–34)NH2(the native rat PTH(1–34) sequence is Ala1-Val2-Ser3-Glu4-Ile5-Gln6-Leu7-Met8-His9-Asn10-Leu11-Gly12-Lys13-His14-Leu15-Ala16-Ser17-Val18-Glu19-Arg20-Met21-Gln22-Trp23-Leu24-Arg25-Lys26-Lys27-Leu28-Gln29-Asp30-Val31-His32-Asn33-Phe34). The [M]PTH(1–14) and shorter length [M]PTH(1-X) derivatives are rat PTH analogs in which “M” refers to the amino acid modifications, Ala3,12,Gln10,Har11,Trp14, unless a residue position is deleted by C-terminal truncation or replaced by Aib, as indicated. The peptide indicated as [M]PTH(1–21) is [Ala3,12,Nle8,Gln10,Har11,Trp14,Arg19,Tyr21]ratPTH(1–21)NH2; [Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–21) is the same peptide with Ala1 and Ala3 replaced by Aib. The peptide indicated as [Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–34) is [Aib1,3,Nle8,21,Gln10,Har11,Ala12,Trp14,Arg19,Tyr34]rPTH(1–34)NH2. The peptide indicated as hPTH(1–34) is [Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)NH2, and [Aib1,3]hPTH(1–34) is the same peptide with Ser1 and Ser3 replaced by Aib. Peptides were prepared on automated peptide synthesizers (model 430A PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, or model 396 MBS Advanced ChemTect, Louisville, KY) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) main chain protecting group chemistry, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate/1-hydroxybenzotriazole/diisopropylethylamine (1:1:2 molar ratio) for coupling reactions, and trifluoroacetic acid-mediated cleavage/side chain deportation (MGH Biopolymer Synthesis Facility, Boston). All peptides were desalted by adsorption on a C18-containing cartridge; PTH(1–34), [M]PTH(1–21), and those [M]PTH(1–14) and shorter analogs that were ≤70% pure at this stage were purified further by HPLC. The dry peptide powders were reconstituted in 10 mm acetic acid and stored at −80 °C. The purity, identity, and stock concentration for each peptide was secured by analytical HPLC, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Radiolabeling of [M]PTH(1–21) and [Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–21) was performed using Na125I (2,200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and chloramine-T; the resultant radioligands were purified by HPLC. The cell line HKRK-B28 (27Takasu H. Guo J. Bringhurst F.R. J. Bone Miner.

All cells, in 24-well plates, were treated with fresh media and shifted to 33 °C for 12–24 h prior to assay (31Bergwitz C. Jusseaume S.A. Luck M.D. Jüppner H. Gardella T.J. J. Biol.

Cells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, adjusted to pH 7.7 with HCl) and treated with 200 μl of cAMP assay buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) and 100 μl of binding buffer containing varying amounts of peptide analog (final volume = 300 μl). The medium was removed after incubation for 30–60 min at room temperature, and the cells were frozen on dry ice, lysed with 0.5 ml 50 mm HCl, and refrozen (−80 °C). The cAMP content of the diluted lysate was determined by radioimmunoassay. The EC50response values were calculated using nonlinear regression (see below). Binding reactions were performed with HKRK-B28 cells or in COS-7 cells in 24-well plates. The cells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer and then treated successively with 100 μl of binding buffer, 100 μl of binding buffer containing various amounts of unlabeled competitor ligand, and 100 μl of binding buffer containing ∼100,000 cpm of125I-[M]PTH(1–21) or125I-[Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–21) (∼26 fmol; final volume = 300 μl). Incubations were 4–6 h at 4 °C, at which time near equilibrium conditions were attained, as judged by association time course experiments performed with each radioligand and HKRK-B28 cells or transfected COS-7 cells. Cells were then placed on ice, and the binding medium was removed, and the monolayer was rinsed three times with 0.5 ml of cold binding buffer. The cells were subsequently lysed with 0.5 ml of 5 m NaOH and counted for radioactivity. For each tracer and in each experiment, the nonspecific binding was determined as the radioactivity that bound in the presence of the same unlabeled peptide at a concentration of 1 μmand was ∼1–2% of total radioactivity added for each tracer. The maximum specific binding (B0) was the total radioactivity bound in the absence of competing ligand, corrected for nonspecific binding, and for each tracer ranged from 8 to 20% of the total radioactivity added. Nonlinear regression was used to calculate binding IC50 values (see below). COS-7 cells transfected as above with hP1R-WT or hP1R-delNt were treated with serum-free, inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin andmyo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (2 μCi/ml) for 16 h prior to assay. At the time of the assay, the cells were rinsed with binding buffer containing LiCl (30 mm) and treated with the same buffer with or without a PTH analog. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 min, after which the buffer was removed and replaced by 0.5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. After 3 h on ice, the lysate was collected and extracted twice with ethyl ether. The lysate was then applied to an ion exchange column (0.5-ml resin bed), and the total inositol phosphates were eluted as described previously (32Berridge M.J. Dawson R.M.C. Downes C.P. Heslop J.P. Irvine R.F. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar) and counted in liquid scintillation mixture. Metatarsals from embryonic (gestational day 15.5) mice were excised and cultured in a 37 °C humidified incubator (5% CO2) in serum-free α-minimum Eagle's media in 24-well plates. Sixteen hours later, a PTH analog or vehicle was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C with peptide or vehicle added again at the 24-h time point. At the end of the incubation period (64 h total), the samples were fixed with 10% formalin/phosphate-buffered saline and then directly visualized on a dissecting microscope using white light. Sections were processed forin situ hybridization analysis using 35S-labeled riboprobes specific for collagen type X mRNA, a developmental marker gene expressed only in hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco model 710 spectropolarimeter; peptides were analyzed at a concentration of 20 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, or the same buffer containing 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol at 20% (v/v). Spectroscopic scans were performed at 20 °C and at wavelengths between 185 and 255 nm, with data recorded at each 1-nm interval. Eight (Fig. 6) or six (Fig. 7) scans were accumulated and averaged for each sample. At each wavelength, the mean residue ellipticity [θ] (in dimensions of degree × cm2/dmol) was calculated by the equation [θ] = θ × (100/l × C ×n), where θ is the raw ellipticity value (in dimensions of millidegree), l is the sample path length in cm,C the molar peptide concentration, and n the number of residues in the peptide (33Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The helical content of each peptide was estimated by dividing [θ] observed at 222 nm for that peptide by −28,100, which is the reported [θ]222observed for a model helical decapeptide (33Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar).Figure 7Effect of Aib-1,3 substitutions in hPTH(1–34). The peptides hPTH(1–34) ([Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)NH2) and [Aib1,3]hPTH(1–34) ([Aib1,3,Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)NH2) were analyzed for the capacity to stimulate cAMP formation in COS-7 cells transfected with either hP1R-WT or hP1R-delNt (A) and for secondary structure by CD spectroscopy (B).A, the cAMP values are expressed as a percent of the maximum response elicited in each experiment by hPTH(1–34) on hP1R-WT, the average of which was 150 ± 26 pmol/well (n = 3). The basal cAMP levels observed for hP1R-WT and hP1R-delNt were 6.2 ± 0.1 and 3.7 ± 0.4 pmol/well, respectively. The data shown (mean ± S.E.) are combined from three experiments, each performed in duplicate. B, the peptides were analyzed at a concentration of 20 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (20% v/v), as described under “Materials and Methods.” The curveshown for each peptide is a composite of six scans.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Calculations were performed using MicrosoftTM Excel. Nonlinear regression analyses of binding and cAMP dose-response data were performed using the four-parameter equation: yp = min + ((max − min)/(1 + (IC50/x)slope)). The Excel Solver function was utilized for parameter optimization, as described previously (34Carter P.H. Juppner H. Gardella T.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4972-4981Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 35Bowen W.P. Jerman J.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Differences between paired data sets were statistically evaluated using a one-tailed Student's ttest, assuming unequal variances for the two sets. We first analyzed the effect of introducing individual Aib substitutions at each position in the scaffold peptide [Ala3,12,Gln10,Har11,Trp14]ratPTH(1–14)NH2([M]PTH(1–14)) (23Shimizu M. Carter P.H. Khatri A. Potts Jr., J.T. Gardella T. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3068-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In cAMP stimulation assays in HKRK-B28 cells, the parent peptide [M]PTH(1–14) stimulated an approximate 70-fold maximum increase (Emax(obs)) in intracellular cAMP, which was equal to that attained by PTH(1–34), but the potency of the shorter peptide was 40-fold less than that of PTH(1–34) (EC50 = 100 ± 20 and 2.5 ± 0.4 nm, respectively; Fig. 1 and TableI). Severe reductions in [M]PTH(1–14) potency occurred with Aib substitutions at positions 6, 8, and 9 (all >2,300-fold); moderate reductions occurred with substitution at positions 2, 4, 5, and 11 (all 170–670-fold), and minor reductions occurred with substitutions at positions 7, 10, and 12–14 (all ≤30-fold; Table I). Single substitution of Aib at position 1 or 3 improved potency 10- and 8-fold, respectively, relative to [M]PTH(1–14) (p ≤ 0.01). Combining these Aib substitutions revealed an additive effect, as [Aib1,3,M]PTH(1–14) was 90-fold more potent in stimulating cAMP formation than was [M]PTH(1–14) (EC50 = 1.1 ± 0.1 and 100 ± 20 nm, respectively), and even more potent than PTH(1–34) (EC50 = 2.5 ± 0.4 nm, p = 0.01; Fig.2A and Table I).Table IcAMP stimulation and hP1R-binding properties in HKRK-B28 cellsPeptide1-aPeptides were based on the rat PTH sequence and were carboxyamidated.

The core DNA-binding domain is mutated in about 50% of all human tumors. The crystal structure of the core domain in complex with DNA illustrated how a single core domain specifically interacts with its DNA consensus site and how it is inactivated by mutation. However, no structural information for the tetrameric full-length p53-DNA complex is available. Here, we present novel experimental insight into the dimerization of two p53 core domains upon cooperative binding to consensus DNA in solution obtained by NMR. The NMR data show that the p53 core domain itself does not appear to undergo major conformational changes upon addition of DNA and elucidate the dimerization interface between two DNA-bound core domains, which includes the short H1 helix. A NMR-based model for the dimeric p53 core-DNA complex incorporates these data and allows the conclusion that the dimerization interface also forms the actual interface in the tetrameric p53-DNA complex. The significance of this interface is further corroborated by the finding that hot spot mutations map to the H1 helix, and by the binding of the putative p53 inhibitor 53BP2 to this region via one of its ankyrin repeats.

In addition to non-transcriptional functions, p53 acts primarily as a transcriptional activator, that regulates the expression of several genes involved in cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence, anti-angiogenesis, and apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 2Levine A.J.

These three p53 family members play distinct roles in differentiation, development, and tumor suppression (reviewed in Ref. 5Yang A. McKeon F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Tetrameric p53 binds specifically to a DNA consensus sequence consisting of two consecutive palindromic 10-bp half-sites, where each half-site is formed by two head-to-head quarter-sites (8El-Deiry W.S.

Lee P.W. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3342-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The p53 DBD comprises several hot spot regions for mutation that inactivate p53 in more than half of all human tumors (1Hollstein M. Hergenhahn M. Yang Q. Bartsch H. Wang Z.Q. Hainaut P. Mutat.

However, only one out of three p53 DBDs is bound to DNA sequence specifically in this crystal structure. Recently, the crystal structure of free mouse p53 DBD has been solved (22Zhao K. Chai X.

Owing to its prominent role in tumorigenesis, the restoration of wild-type p53 activity for tumor therapy has gained widespread attraction (24Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Ball K.L. Biochem.

The crystal structure of the p53 DBD-DNA complex is compatible with a model where four p53 DBDs bind to the consensus DNA without steric clashes (Fig. 7B in Ref. 10Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D.

Yet, no structural information is available for the intact tetrameric p53 bound to DNA owing mainly due to the difficulties in obtaining suitable protein samples. Here, we present the results of NMR experiments that allow for the first time the experimental identification of the actual dimerization interface between two p53 DBDs cooperatively bound to their consensus DNA in aqueous solution. This dimerization interface resides in the short H1 helix previously suggested to be involved in protein-protein interaction (10Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). Based on NMR data, we have created a consistent model for the dimeric p53 DBD-DNA complex. The findings that inactivating hot spot p53 mutations map in the dimerization interface (43Walker D.R. Bond J.P. Tarone R.E. Harris C.C. Makalowski W. Boguski M.S. Greenblatt M.S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and that the putative p53 inhibitor 53BP2 binds to this region via one of its ankyrin repeats (44Gorina S. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) further support this model. We therefore conclude that the experimentally identified region forms the actual p53 interface in the tetrameric p53-DNA complex. Based on the symmetry of the dimeric p53 DBD-DNA complex a sandwich-like model (12Waterman J.L. Shenk J.L. Halazonetis T.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) is discussed for the intact tetrameric p53-DNA complex. This model is characterized by tetrameric p53 binding as a dimer of dimers to two separate juxtaposed DNA consensus sites, implying an inherent ability of p53 to link DNA strands, e.g. in transcriptionally active complexes (45Stenger J.E. Tegtmeyer P. Mayr G.A. Reed M. Wang Y. Wang P. Hough P.V. Mastrangelo I.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6011-6020Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It brings into accord the symmetry of the p53 TD with the structural requirements of p53 DBD binding to the palindromic DNA consensus sequence without assuming a conformational switch upon DNA binding.

TAMRA-labeled DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG-BIOTECH and TIB Molbiol.15NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose was obtained from Martek Biosciences. C-terminal (residues 361–382: GSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKK-NH2) and N-terminal (residues 79–94: APAAPTPAAPAPAPSWPLS-NH2) p53 peptides were synthesized using standard Fmoc peptide chemistry and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. Residues 94–312 of human p53 coding for the wild-type p53 DBD (10Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 21Bullock A.N.

A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) were amplified from plasmid pT7.7Hup53 (46Midgley C.A. Fisher C.J. Bartek J. Vojtesek B. Lane D. Barnes D.M. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into a modified pQE40 vector (Qiagen). p53 DBDs were expressed as inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli BL21 co-transfected with pUBS520 (47Brinkmann U. Mattes R.E. Buckel P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 85: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). For the preparation of unlabeled p53 DBD, bacteria were grown in Luria broth medium. For preparation of uniformly U-15N- and U-13C,15N-labeled p53 DBDs, bacteria were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal medium containing antibiotics, minerals, and vitamins supplemented with 2 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 4 g/liter [13C6]glucose as only nitrogen and carbon source up to an optical density of 0.8, followed by overnight induction at 37 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-d-thiogalactoside. After induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended, and ruptured by high-pressure dispersion. Inclusion bodies were isolated, washed, and solubilized in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 6 m guanidine HCl, and 10 mm DTT as described previously (48Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In the following, p53 DBD was refolded according to standard procedures (48Lilie H. Schwarz E. Rudolph R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and purified as published (21Bullock A.N. Henckel J. Fersht A.R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 23Wong K.B. DeDecker B.S. Freund S.M. Proctor M.R. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Due to the high purity (>80%) of the inclusion body preparation, no additional Heparin Hi-Trap column was necessary during the purification. Refolded and concentrated p53 DBD was dialyzed into 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 50 mmKCl, and 5 mm DTT, loaded onto a SP-Sepharose Fast Flow cation exchange column (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) and eluted with a linear KCl gradient. The final purification was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on a High Load 26/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.) in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm DTT. The purity of p53 DBD was >98%. 5% (v/v) 2H2O was added to the p53 DBD and samples were concentrated using 5 K Ultrafree 4 Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) to 200–500 μm, dialyzed into 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 5 mm DTT containing 40–100 mm KCl, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Final yields were some 60 mg of uniformly U-15N-labeled and some 45 mg of uniformly U-13C,15N-labeled p53 DBD per 1-liter culture. Electrospray mass-spectrometry confirmed the identity and complete isotopic labeling of p53 DBD, as well as cleavage of the N-terminal methionine after translation. The protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically according to Bradford (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar) or using an extinction coefficient of ε280 nm = 15,930 m−1cm−1 (50Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with 12.5% gels. The monomeric state of all p53 DBD preparations was confirmed by analytical size exclusion chromatography with a TSK gel G 3000SW (TosoHaas) analytical gel filtration at a flow-rate of 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm DTT. Specific DNA binding activity of the p53 DBDs was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (51Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The15N,1H-HSQC spectrum of the refolded U-15N-labeled p53 DBD was identical to the one published recently (23Wong K.B. DeDecker B.S. Freund S.M. Proctor M.R. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of the DNA binding properties of p53 DBD was performed with a ConfoCor fluorescence correlation spectrometer (Carl Zeiss Jena and Evotec OAI). 5′-TAMRA-labeled CON2x5 and CON4x5 DNA oligonucleotides containing one or two 10-mer p53 consensus half-sites, 16-meric CON2x5 (5′-CCTAGACATGCCTAAT-3′) and 26-meric CON4x5 (5′-CCTAGACATGCCTAGACATGCCTAAT-3′) (18Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), were annealed with complementary oligonucleotides. The concentrations of the annealed double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were determined using FCS and adjusted to an equimolar ratio in relation to quarter-sites (3 nm for CON2x5, 1.5 nm for CON4x5). Measurements were performed at 20 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, and 0.1% Triton X-100 in the presence of 1 nm supercoiled, nonspecific pBluescript (pBS) DNA (Stratagene) to suppress nonspecific DNA binding. Experimental autocorrelation curves were fitted using the FCS-plus 1.0 software package (Evotec OAI). For the determination of apparent binding constants by the program Prism 3.0, the values were fitted to the equation: f = [DBD)]/([DBD] +Kd), for [DNA] ≪ [DBD] and [DNA] ≪Kd, where f is the fraction of complexed TAMRA-labeled oligonucleotide and Kd is the apparent equilibrium binding constant. NMR investigations on p53 DBD were carried out on Bruker DMX750 and DMX600 spectrometers equipped with a triple channel (1H, 13C, 15N) and quadruple channel (1H, 13C, 15N,31P) inverse probe head, respectively. Water suppression was achieved by magic angle gradients (52Mattiello D.L. Warren W.S. Mueller L. Farmer B.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3253-3261Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), either employing heteronuclear or homonuclear WATERGATE (53Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar) gradient echoes. Standard sample conditions for p53 DBD are given above; the standard temperature was 293 K. NMR diffusion experiments were carried out using first-order compensation for linear convection effects (54Jerschow A. Muller N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 134: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), bipolar square-shaped diffusion-encoding pulsed magnetic field gradients (2-ms duration, strength ranging from 3 to 57 G/cm), and a WATERGATE suppression scheme serving at the same time as a longitudinal eddy current compensation delay. The diffusion mixing time was set to 125 ms. Saturation transfer difference experiments (55Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar) were performed by selectively irradiating either on imino protons of DNA (around 12.2–13.8 ppm) or on methyl protons of p53 DBD (at 0.28 ppm), using a series of 120° Gauss pulses for 3 s. The WATERGATE suppression scheme was concomitantly used as a T2 filter (20-ms duration) to suppress residual signals from the complexed state. Residues were assigned according to Wong et al. (23Wong K.B. DeDecker B.S. Freund S.M. Proctor M.R. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides CON4x5 and CON2x5 (sequence see above) were annealed, diluted into the NMR buffer, and titrated into the NMR sample. Generally, a 1.2–1.5 mexcess of consensus quarter-sites relative to the p53 DBD was necessary to achieve stochiometric binding. The pH of the solution was verified during measurements by monitoring the 31P NMR chemical shift of the phosphate buffer. Hydrodynamic calculations were performed with the DIFFC module of the DASHA software package (version 3.48b) (56Orekhov V.Y. Nolde D.E. Golovanov A.P. Korzhnev D.M. Arseniev A.S. Appl. Magnetic Res. 1995; 9: 581-588Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar), using the published crystal structure of the p53 DBD (PDB-ID: 1TSR, chain B) and the modeled structure of the dimeric p53 DBD-DNA complex described in this article (see below). The bead model (representing molecules as sets of bead-like spherical friction centers) was used with beads centered in all CA, CG, and CZ (side chains of Arg, Tyr, Phe, and Trp) atoms of the protein as well as in all C2 (nucleobases), C3′ (ribose), and phosphor atoms of the DNA. Beads were scaled equally and a hydration shell of 0.5 atoms thickness was added. Molecular modeling was performed with the program X-PLOR (57Brünger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) using the parallhdg force field. The crystal structure of the p53 DBD-DNA complex (PDB-ID: 1TSR) was the basis of the calculations (10Cho Y. Gorina S. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1994; 265: 346-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). From chain B, which is the only subunit bound specifically to the DNA in the crystal structure, a starting structure of the dimer was generated by applying a C2-symmetry operation to the monomer. First, the structure was optimized with fixed internal atom coordinates until no clashes between the subunits could be detected. Second, the internal atom coordinates were tethered according to chemical shift changes observed by the NMR experiment, i.e. atoms, which show only little shift changes were fixed, and no restraint was put on atoms, which show the strongest shift changes. The system was minimized using 300 steps of conjugate gradient, relaxed using 5000 steps with a time step of 3 fs, and a temperature of 300 K and finally another 300-step minimization was performed. Figures were created with InsightII (MSI Inc.). The allosteric model of p53 regulation proposes that the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 interacts with the p53 DBD and keeps it in a latent state incapable of specific interaction with DNA. Upon cellular stress the C terminus is subjected to phosphorylation and acetylation, releasing the inhibitory interaction such that p53 can bind to its specific consensus sites and activate the corresponding target genes (31Hupp T.R.

In addition, several publications have suggested that an N-terminal region of p53 participates in its regulation (36Kim A.L. Raffo A.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Monaco R. Abarzua P. Fine R.L. J.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8438-8442Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) allowed us to probe for the postulated interaction between the C terminus and the p53 DBD (60Selivanova G. Ryabchenko L. Jansson E. Iotsova V. Wiman K.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3395-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) by NMR spectroscopy and to map possible shift differences upon the protein structure. The experiments were carried out by titrating U-15N-labeled p53 DBD (residues 94–312) with the C-terminal peptide (residues 361–382, phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) under varying conditions (i.e. varied temperatures, pH, and ionic strengths). These NMR experiments included protein-detected (15N,1H-HSQC) and peptide-detected methods (1H spectra, diffusion-ordered spectroscopy, inversion recovery, and saturation transfer difference experiments with selective saturation of p53 DBD methyl groups). None of the performed experiments, however, produced any indication of molecular interactions between the C-terminal peptide and p53 DBD. In addition, no direct interactions were found between a peptide covering the N-terminal polyproline-rich part of p53 (residues 76–94) (59Muller-Tiemann B.F. Halazonetis T.D. Elting J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6079-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and the U-15N-labeled p53 DBD. Likewise, no contacts were found between the C-terminal peptide (residues 361–382) and the polyproline-rich region of a U-15N-labeled N-terminal extended p53 DBD construct (residues 40–312) (36Kim A.L. Raffo A.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Monaco R. Abarzua P. Fine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34924-34931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which proved to be highly flexible in the NMR spectra. We then verified the hypothesis that consensus DNA might be involved in the interaction between the C terminus and the p53 DBD. While no direct interaction of the C-terminal peptide with p53 DBD in complex with DNA consensus oligonucleotide could be detected, we observed clear evidence of weak unspecific interactions between the peptide and the oligonucleotide as titratable NMR shift changes of the isolated DNA imino protons (data not shown). Earlier studies have demonstrated that p53 DBD cooperatively binds to DNA consensus sequences covering one or two consensus half-sites, whereas binding to a single quarter-site cannot be detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (11Wang Y. Schwedes J.F. Parks D. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2157-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16McLure K.G. Lee P.W. EMBO"
https://openalex.org/W2166138837,"The heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 is a master transcriptional regulator of oxygen homeostasis and a possible target for gene therapy of ischemic disease. Although the role of oxygen concentration in HIF-1a protein stabilization is well established, it is less clear whether and how oxygen-regulated mechanisms contribute to HIF-1a protein modifications, nuclear translocation, heterodimerization with the b-subunit, recruitment of cofactors, and gene trans-activation. Because the HIF-1a protein is proteolytically degraded under normoxic conditions, we established two HeLa Tet-Off cell lines (HT42 and HT43), which inducibly overexpress high levels of HIF-1a under normoxic conditions, allowing to distinguish hypoxia-dependent from hypoxia-independent activation mechanisms. Using these cells, we found that normoxically induced HIF-1a is localized to the nucleus, binds DNA, and trans-activates reporter and endogenous target genes. The levels of p53 expression remained unaffected. The MAP kinase inhibitor PD98059 attenuated HIF-1a protein modifications and trans-activation ability but not protein stabilization and DNA-binding activity. Because overexpressed HIF-1a is fully localized to the nucleus but displays only partial DNA-binding and trans-activation activity, mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation might be required for full HIF-1 activation. HIF-1a protein was also overexpressed in vivo, following the transplantation of HT42 cells into nude mice, demonstrating the feasibility of HIF-1a gene transfer."

Cell growth was modulated by changing the amount of epidermal growth factor, serum, and androgene in culture media. Using the microspectrofluorimetric method with Fura-2 and Mag Fura-2 as probes, we show that in these cells, the growth rate is correlated with intracellular calcium pool content. Indeed, an increased growth rate is correlated with an increase in the calcium pool filling state, whereas growth-inhibited cells show a reduced calcium pool load. Using Western blotting and immunocytochemistry, we show that endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump expression is closely linked to LNCaP cell growth, and are a common target of physiological stimuli that control cell growth. Moreover, we clearly demonstrate that inhibition of these pumps, using thapsigargin, inhibits LNCaP cell growth and prevents growth factor from stimulating cell proliferation. Our results thus provide evidence for the essential role of functional endoplasmic reticulum calcium pumps and calcium pool in control of prostate cancer LNCaP cell growth, raising the prospect of new targets for the treatment of prostate cancer.

Ca2+ concentration within the endoplasmic reticulum sarcoendoplasmic Ca2+-ATPases thapsigargin dihydrotestosterone epidermal growth factor epidermal growth factor receptor compound 56 Modulation of calcium (Ca2+) homeostasis is a mechanism common to signal transduction pathways that regulates a wide range of cell phenomena. Cytosolic Ca2+ is known to control numerous cell functions, including contraction, gene expression, and cell proliferation (1Berridge M.J. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Maintenance of Ca2+ levels within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum is another critical factor for cell growth (2Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Meadows J.J. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. Biol. Chem. Apr. 1994; 269: 11927-11933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the Ca2+ content of intracellular pools controls the progression through the cell cycle (3Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Moreover, a close connection has been shown between depletion of Ca2+pools and induction of apoptosis by several laboratories (4Preston G.A. Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wertz I.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11470-11477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), including our own (6Skryma R. Mariot P. Bourhis X.L. Coppenolle F.V. Shuba Y. Abeele F.V. Legrand G. Humez S. Boilly B. Prevarskaya N. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The endoplasmic reticulum is a dynamic environment perfectly designed for protein synthesis and post-translational modifications. The folding maintenance of high intraluminal Ca2+ is essential for these processes (7Michalak M. Mariani P. Opas M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, alterations in Ca2+concentration within the endoplasmic reticulum ([Ca2+]ER)1may destabilize the physiological balance of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen, and inhibit cell growth. Numerous mechanisms controlling Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum, Ca2+accumulation within endoplasmic reticulum, and Ca2+ binding of intraluminal Ca2+, are responsible for the regulation and maintenance of intraluminal endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+homeostasis (8Corbett E.F. Michalak M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 307-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Accumulation of Ca2+ within the pools is mediated by sarcoendoplasmic Ca2+-ATPases (SERCA) family, which is widely distributed within the endoplasmic reticulum of most cell models. It has been well described that exposure of cells to SERCA blocker thapsigargin (TG) results in emptying of Ca2+ pools and inhibition of cell proliferation (3Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4986-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) suggesting the potential role of SERCA proteins in control of cell growth. However, at the present time, the data concerning the role of [Ca2+]ER and SERCA in cell growth are rather contradictory. Indeed, in some models TG induces reversible (2Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Meadows J.J. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. Biol. Chem. Apr. 1994; 269: 11927-11933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or irreversible (9Furuya Y. Lundmo P. Short A.D. Gill D.L. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6167-6175PubMed Google Scholar) growth arrest, whereas in other one, it stimulates proliferation (10Charlesworth A. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32528-32535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our knowledge, the role of SERCA expression in control of cell growth by physiological stimuli such as growth factors and hormones was never studied. Our study thus aimed to demonstrate the role of Ca2+ pool and SERCA expression in the control of cell proliferation by physiological growth regulators in prostate cancer cells. Androgens are considered to play a crucial role in the development and progression of prostate cancer, since men castrated before puberty do not develop this disease (11Prinsloo S.E. Van Aswegen C.H. Adv. Clin. Chem. 2000; 35: 101-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, antiandrogens inhibit prostate growth in vitro (12Olea N. Sakabe K. Soto A.M. Sonnenschein C. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) andin vivo (13Singh S.M. Gauthier S. Labrie F. Currr. Med. Chem. 2000; 7: 211-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is also known that, testosterone is irreversibly converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) within the prostate gland by the 5-αa-reductase enzyme, and that DHT is the active androgen in the prostate (14Petrow V. Prostate. 1986; 9: 343-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Human prostate growth is also regulated by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), and it was recently shown that progression to prostate cancer is correlated with disruption of EGF signaling (15Djakiew D. Prostate. 2000; 42: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Indeed, malignant human prostate cells exhibit an enhanced capacity for autocrine expression of EGF. Furthermore, EGF receptor (EGF-R) is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and adding anti-EGF-R antibody inhibits the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro (16Fong C.J. Sherwood E.R. Mendelsohn J. Lee C. Kozlowski J.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5887-5892PubMed Google Scholar) and in xenografted micein vivo (17Prewett M. Rockwell P. Rockwell R.F. Giorgio N.A. Mendelsohn J. Scher H.I. Goldstein N.I. J. Immunother. Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 1996; 19: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Thus, EGF appears to be a major growth factor implicated in prostate cancer development. In this study, we used a human prostate cancer cell line derived from a lymph node metastasis, LNCaP, which is the only well characterized prostate cancer cell line that exhibits both growth factor and androgen-sensitive proliferation (for review, see Ref. 18Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The results reported in this study reveal that, in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells, an increased growth rate (induced by EGF) is correlated with a higher Ca2+ pool content without any change in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt), accompanied by increased SERCA-2b expression. On the other hand, a decrease in growth rate (induced by androgens or serum deprivation) is associated with a decrease in intracellular Ca2+ pool content and also decreased SERCA-2b expression. These results suggest that the content of intracellular Ca2+ stores may play a pivotal role in the control of prostate cancer cell growth by androgens and growth factors. In this study, we also show that the reduction in Ca2+ store content of cells exposed to TG correlates with the decrease in cell growth. Moreover, in TG-treated cells, EGF is unable to increase both cell growth and Ca2+ store content. Our study thus provides the first direct evidence that SERCA expression and Ca2+ pool content are common target for physiological stimuli controlling cell growth, and may play a central role in cancer cell growth control, raising the prospect of new targets for the treatment of cancer. The androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP obtained from the American Type Culture Collection was maintained in culture in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed, Poly-Labo, Strasbourg, France) and 5 mml-glutamine (Sigma, L'Isle d'Abeau, France). Cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Prior to fluorescence measurements, the cells were trypsinized and transferred to glass slips. Cells were used 1–4 days after trypsinization. The medium was replaced every 48 h. The assay medium was the same as that used for culture, but supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. The 6-well plates (Nunc) had a final volume of 2 ml and were assayed 48 h after seeding. LNCaP were cultured at 4 × 104 cells per well for 4 or 6 days of treatment with or without reagents, as indicated. Proliferation was determined by cell counting. The medium was replaced every 48 h. The serum-free medium was the same as the control medium, but without serum. For experiments requiring DHT-free serum, we used RPMI without phenol red and charcoal-stripped serum. The control medium was supplemented with 10−10m DHT. The culture medium was replaced by an HBSS solution containing 142 mmNaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm HEPES, and 5.6 mm glucose. The osmolarity and pH of this solution were adjusted to 310 mOsm liter−1 and pH 7.4, respectively. When a Ca2+-free medium was required, CaCl2 was omitted and replaced by equimolar MgCl2. Dye loading was achieved by transferring the cells into a standard HBSS solution containing 1 μm Fura-2 AM (Calbiochem, Meudon, France) for 40 min at 37 °C, then rinsing them three times with dye-free solution. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured by an imaging system (Quanticell 900, Visitech, United Kingdom). The glass coverslip was mounted in a chamber on a Nikon microscope equipped for fluorescence. Fura-2 fluorescence was excited at 340 and 380 nm and emitted fluorescence was measured at 510 nm. The [Ca2+]cyt concentration was derived from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities for each of the excitation wavelengths (F 340/F 380), and from the Grynkiewicz equation. All recordings were made at room temperature. The cells were continuously perfused with HBSS solution and chemicals were added via a whole chamber perfusion system. The flow rate of the whole chamber perfusion system was set to 1 ml/min and the chamber volume was 500 μl. TG, the most potent selective SERCA inhibitor (19Takemura H. Hughes A.R. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12266-12271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar), is often used to estimate Ca2+ pool content (21Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In the presence of extracellular Ca2+, SERCA inhibition generally results in a biphasic increase in [Ca2+]cyt, reflecting a passive Ca2+ release through endoplasmic reticulum leak channels, followed by capacitative Ca2+entry through plasma membrane Ca2+ release-activated channels promoted by store depletion (21Thastrup O. Dawson A.P. Scharff O. Foder B. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Bjerrum P.J. Christensen S.B. Hanley M.R. Agents Actions. 1989; 27: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In a Ca2+-free medium, TG only induces an increase in [Ca2+]cyt, due to Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+content was estimated in Fura-2 loaded cells by measuring the difference between basal [Ca2+]cyt and Ca2+ peaks induced by TG (23Baffy G. Miyashita T. Williamson J.R. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6511-6519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LNCaP cells were loaded with 2 μm of the AM-ester derivative of Mag Fura-2 (Mag Fura-2 AM) for 45 min at 37 °C. This compartmentalized fluorescent dye has been successfully used to monitor changes in free Ca2+within the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (24Hofer A.M. Schulz I. Cell Calcium. 1996; 20: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After incubation by Mag Fura-2 AM, the cells were briefly rinsed in a hight K+solution (in mm: 125 KCl, 25 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.1 MgCl2, pH 7.2). They was then exposed for 2 min to 5 μg/ml digitonin diluted in the high K+ solution supplemented with 0.2 mm MgATP, with free [Ca2+] clamp to 170 nm using Ca2+/EGTA buffers (WinMaxc 1.7 software). Following digitonin permeabilization, Mag Fura-2 is localized in the subcellular compartments. Ratio imaging measurements of Mag Fura-2 fluorescence were made using a Quanticell 900 imaging system (Visitech, UK). Cells were lysed in an ice-cold buffer (pH 7) containing (in mm) 10 HEPES, 10 KCl, 0.05 dithiothreitol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The lysates were then homogenized and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 3,500 × g. The supernatants were centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7), 160 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The microsomes were stored at −80 °C until use. After centrifugation (10,000 ×g), the microsomal pellets were fractionated in a standard Laemmli-type SDS-PAGE (10%). The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry electroblotter (Bio-Rad). After the transfer, the membrane was cut into thin strips that were further processed for immunodetection. The strips were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TNT (15 mm Tris buffer (pH 8), 140 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% skimmed dry milk, washed in TNT 3 times), then incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody: anti-SERCA2a, -2b (25Wuytack F.

J. 1990; 271: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), for 1 h at room temperature. After thorough washing in TNT, the strips were treated with the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), diluted in TNT (1/7500) for 1 h. After several washes in TNT without milk, the strips were processed for chemiluminescent detection using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blots were then exposed to X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The cells were seeded on glass coverslips and grown to 70–80% confluence. They were then fixed in cold acetone for 15 min at −20 °C. The coverslips were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 1.2% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min to avoid nonspecific binding, and subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C in 100% humidity with the primary antibodies for SERCA2b (polyclonal rabbit IgG). The slides were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline with 1.2% gelatin, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit IgG labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate, Jackson), washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and mounted in Mowiol. The sections were observed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with epifluorescence (excitation, 450–490 nm; emission, 520 nm). Negative controls consisted in the omission of the primary antibody. Results were expressed as mean ± S.E. Plots were produced using Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software, Inc.). Each experiment was repeated several times. Turkey-Kramer test was used for statistical comparison among means and differences andp < 0.05 was considered significant. It is now well established that EGF controls prostate cell growth. As expected, EGF stimulated LNCaP cell growth in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1). This effect of EGF was assessed by cell counting after 6 days of treatment with doses of EGF between 0.2 and 5 ng/ml. A significant increase in the number of cells was observed at all doses tested. Maximum stimulation was obtained after treatment with 2 ng/ml EGF. At this concentration, cell growth reached 223 ± 6.1% of control. This increase in the total number of cells was not due to a decrease in apoptosis, as the level of apoptosis, measured by the Hoechst staining method, was under 1% in both control and EGF-treated cells (data not shown). As maintenance of luminal Ca2+within the endoplasmic reticulum has been demonstrated to be essential for cell growth in some cell lines (2Waldron R.T. Short A.D. Meadows J.J. Ghosh T.K. Gill D.L. Biol. Chem. Apr. 1994; 269: 11927-11933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Short A.D. Bian J. Ghosh T.K. Waldron R.T. Rybak S.L. Gill D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. 1996; 329: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the Ca2+ pool content was modulated in EGF growth-stimulated LNCaP cells. The basal cytosolic Ca2+level is not affected when LNCaP cell growth is stimulated by EGF. Under control conditions, the [Ca2+]cytcontent of LNCaP cells was 58 ± 28 nm. No increase in [Ca2+]cyt was observed in cells treated with 2 ng/ml EGF, either after short-term (30 min) or prolonged (between 1 h and 4 days) treatment with EGF (data not shown). However, the Ca2+ release induced by 1 μm TG in cells treated for 4 days with 2 ng/ml EGF was much higher than that in control cells (Fig. 2 A). It is important to point out the remarkable similarity between the extent of LNCaP cell proliferation (Fig. 1) and the amplitude of the TG-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (Fig. 2 B). The maximal amplitude of TG-induced Ca2+release (493 nm ± 139, n = 15), corresponding to 176% of the TG response observed under control conditions (280 nm ± 170 nm, n= 16), was measured in cells with a maximal growth rate (treated with 2 ng/ml EGF). This result suggests that there is a close connection between the Ca2+ pool content and proliferation of LNCaP cells. Moreover, 12 pm compound 56 (C56), a potent and specific inhibitor of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity (28Bridges A.J. Zhou H. Cody D.R. Rewcastle G.W. McMichael A. Showalter H.D. Fry D.W. Kraker A.J. Denny W.A. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) made EGF incapable of stimulating LNCaP cell growth (see table in Fig. 3). Under these conditions, where cell growth was unaffected by EGF, the amount of Ca2+ that could be released from the endoplasmic reticulum was the same as under control conditions (see histogram in Fig. 3). These results have been confirmed using the direct quantification of luminal [Ca2+]ER (Table I). The luminal [Ca2+]ER is much higher in EGF-treated cells (200 ± 19 μm) than in control cells (90 ± 5 μm). C56 made EGF incapable to increase the luminal [Ca2+]ER (83 ± 8 μm in EGF/C56 cells) whereas it is without effect on control cells (79 ± 6 μm in C56 cells). Thus, our results clearly demonstrate that the increased growth rate induced by EGF is correlated with the increased amount of Ca2+ in Ca2+stores.Figure 3Inhibition of the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity prevents EGF from inducing increases in Ca2+ pool content or cell growth. Cells were seeded on glass slips in a medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 2 × 104 cells per dish. On the following day, the medium was replaced by a medium containing 2% serum (CTL) supplemented with 2 ng/ml EGF, and 12 pmcompound 56 (C56), alone or combined with 2 ng/ml EGF. The medium was replaced every 48 h. After 4 days treatment, the Ca2+ pool content was determined by the amplitude of Ca2+ release induced by TG (1 μm) in a Ca2+-free HBSS medium. After 6 days treatment, the number of cells in each well was counted. Histograms show the amplitude of TG-induced Ca2+ release. Table I illustrates the corresponding growth rate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IQuantification of [Ca 2+ ]ER, using microspectrofluorimetric method with Mag Fura-2 as a probeMediumCTLEGFC56C56/EGF0SVF0SVF/EGFDHTDHT/EGF0DHT0DHT/EGFLuminal [Ca2+] (μm)90 ± 5200 ± 1979 ± 683 ± 830 ± 3137 ± 11135 ± 12245 ± 3230 ± 4147 ± 12Number of cells22292121281328222118LNCaP cells were grown 4 days on glass coverslips and loaded with 2 μm of the AM-ester derivative of Mag Fura-2 for 45 min at 37 °C.

Ratio imaging measurements of Mag fura-2 fluorescence were made using a commercial imaging system (Quanticell 900, Applied Imaging, UK). It is now well established that the growth of prostate cancer cells depends on the presence of androgens and serum in the culture medium (18Webber M.M. Bello D. Quader S. Prostate. 1997; 30: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and that DHT and serum deprivation inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation. In our experiments, the removal of DHT (the active androgen in the prostate) or serum from the culture medium inhibited LNCaP cell proliferation (see table in Fig. 4 A). After 6 days, the number of cell in DHT-free medium corresponded to 77% ± 6% of control conditions, whereas the number of cells in serum-free medium corresponded to 84 ± 2% of control. This inhibited growth rate cannot be explained by an increase in apoptosis, as no increase in apoptosis (measured by Hoechst staining) was observed in our experiments after DHT removal (in agreement with Refs. 29Berchem G.J. Bosseler M. Sugars L.Y. Voeller H.J. Zeitlin S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 735-738PubMed Google Scholar and 30Saeed B. Zhang H. Ng S.C. Prostate. 1997; 31: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or serum deprivation (data not shown). As in EGF growth-stimulated LNCaP cells, [Ca2+]cyt remained unchanged after the removal of DHT or serum (data not shown). However, the amplitude of the TG-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum was significantly smaller in growth-inhibited LNCaP cells (Fig. 4). Indeed, in cells cultured in a DHT-free medium, the amplitude of the TG induced Ca2+ release corresponded to 46 ± 13% (n = 20) of control, while the amplitude in serum-free cultured cells was 62 ± 2% (n = 17) of control (see histograms in Fig. 4). Thus, our results provide evidence that a decrease in LNCaP cell growth rate induced by androgen or serum deprivation is correlated with a decrease in the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pool content. It is important to note that EGF was able to induce an increase in both Ca2+ pool content (see histograms in Fig. 4 B) and cell growth (see table in Fig. 4 B) in DHT-free and serum-free cultured cells. These results were confirmed using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Mag Fura-2 AM (Table I): luminal [Ca2+]ER is reduced in both serum-free or DHT-free cells (30 ± 3 μm in serum-free cells (0SVF) and 30 ± 4 μm in DHT-free cells (0DHT)). Furthermore, EGF increases the luminal [Ca2+]ER in serum-free cells (137 ± 11 nm in 0SVF/EGF cells), and in DHT-free cells (147 ± 12 μm in 0DHT/EGF cells). Thus, our results suggests that the Ca2+ pool content plays a common role in growth regulator signal transduction, leading to physiological growth in LNCaP cells. As we suggest that TG-sensitive Ca2+ store content and cell growth in LNCaP cells are linked, we investigated the effect of LNCaP cell-growth regulators (EGF, serum, and DHT) on the expression of SERCAs, proteins known to play an important role in the maintenance of luminal [Ca2+]ER (31Stokes D.L. Wagenknecht T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been suggested that SERCA proteins regulate cell growth by controlling growth and transformation related genes (27Cheng G. Liu B.F., Yu, Y. Diglio C. Kuo T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of EGF, DHT, and serum on the expression of two SERCA isoforms: SERCA2a (the cardiac/slow skeletal muscle isoform) and SERCA2b (the ubiquitously expressed isoform). Western blot analysis on microsomal preparations (Fig. 5 A) showed that SERCA2b was constitutively expressed in LNCaP cells under control (CTL) conditions. In our experiment, SERCA2a protein expression was not detected under control conditions or in treated cells (data not shown). SERCA2b proteins were overexpressed in LNCaP cells treated with 2 ng/ml EGF for 4 days (Fig. 5 A). The EGF induced increase in the expression of SERCA2b proteins in LNCaP cells was confirmed by immunocytochemical assays (Fig. 5 B). This EGF induced up-regulation of SERCA2b expression in LNCaP cells seemed to be dependent on tyrosine kinase activity, as it was not observed when cells were treated with 2 ng/ml EGF in the presence of 12 pm C56 (the specific inhibitor of EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity). Treating LNCaP cells with C56 alone had no effect on SERCA2b expression under control conditions. SERCA2b protein expression was reduced when LNCaP cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 4 days (0SVF) (Fig. 5 B). In the same way, SERCA2b expression was lower in cells cultured in a DHT-free medium for 4 days (0DHT) than in control (DHT). Moreover, in both serum-free and DHT-free cultures, EGF induced an increase in SERCA2b expression (see 0SVF/EGF compared with 0SVF, and 0DHT/EGF compared with 0DHT). These results show that, in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells, SERCA2b are a common target of physiological stimuli controlling cell growth. This suggests thus that SERCA proteins play a central role in LNCaP cell growth control. Our experiments show a close connection between the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store content, SERCAs expression, and proliferation of LNCaP cells. As SERCA proteins are known to control the endoplasmic reticulum load (31Stokes D.L. Wagenknecht T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of the well known SERCAs inhibitor, TG, on LNCaP proliferation. TG application inhibits SERCA proteins, inducing the emptying of Ca2+ stores. When LNCaP cells were treated with 0.01 nm TG, the minimal dose that induces a transient increase in cytosolic Ca2+ (data not shown), for 4 days, there was no change in either the basal Ca2+ level or the apoptosis rate (data not shown). However, the Ca2+ content within the endoplasmic reticulum was considerably reduced by this treatment (Fig. 6): the amplitude of the Ca2+response to applications of 1 μm TG was only 45 ± 4% of the control cell response. Under these conditions, LNCaP cell proliferation was reduced: the cell growth rate corresponded to 49 ± 2% of that observed under control conditions (see Fig. 6). Moreover, in cells treated with 0.01 nm TG for 4 days, EGF was unable to induce an increase in the Ca2+ content of the endoplasmic reticulum, which was not statistically different from the amplitude of the Ca2+ release in cells treated with TG alone (57 ± 4% of control) and had no effect on cell proliferation as compared with cells treated with TG alone (51 ± 1% of the control). This result suggests that the increase in endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pool content and SERCA proteins play a central role in EGF control of LNCaP cell proliferation. This work demonstrates the involvement of Ca2+ pools and SERCA2b proteins in regulating prostate cancer cell proliferation. It is now well established that EGF is a major growth factor involved in prostate cancer development. It has been demonstrated that LNCaP cells possess EGF-R (32Schuurmans A.L. Bolt J. Mulder E. Urol. Int. 1989; 44: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We therefore used EGF to increase growth, in order to investigate the role of Ca2+ in the regulation of LNCaP cell growth. In agreement with a previous observation by MacDonald and Habib (33MacDonald A. Habib F.K. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 65: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), our experiments show that EGF increases LNCaP cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximum effect at 2 ng/ml. As [Ca2+]cyt is considered to play an important role in controlling cell growth, we initially studied the possible modification in [Ca2+]cyt when proliferation was stimulated. Our results failed to demonstrate any variation in [Ca2+]cyt when LNCaP cell proliferation was stimulated by EGF. This result seems surprising because it has been clearly demonstrated that EGF (34Pandiella A. Malgaroli A. Meldolesi J. Vicentini L.M. Exp. Cell. Res. 1987; 170: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and other growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (31Stokes D.L. Wagenknecht T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and fibroblast growth factor (35Merle P.L. Usson Y. Robert-Nicoud M. Verdetti J. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2687-2698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) can induce an increase in [Ca2+]cyt after a few minutes application. However, in human epithelial kidney cells HEK2 and HEK3 stably expressing the M2 and M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, respectively, it has been shown that EGF-R has a different, endogenously expressed, Ca2+ signaling pathway. Indeed, EGF caused a transient Ca2+ increase in HEK3 cells, whereas there was no Ca2+ variation in HEK2 cells. This discrepancy was attributed to the lack of sphingosine kinase activity in HEK2 cells (36Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Lass H. Kuchar I. Alemany R. Guo Y. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In our cell line, the fact that EGF did not induce an increase in [Ca2+]cyt cannot be explained by such a lack of sphingosine kinase activity, since its functionality was demonstrated by Nava et al. (37Nava V.E. Cuvillier O. Edsall L.C. Kimura K. Milstien S. Gelmann E.P. Spiegel S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4468-4474PubMed Google Scholar). However, we suggest that our results which showed that EGF did not induce any short-term increase in [Ca2+]cyt, may be explained by the lack of an other element in the EGF-R signal transduction cascade leading to Ca2+ signaling. Our results also failed to demonstrate any effect of EGF on [Ca2+]cytafter 1–3 h or 4 days of treatment. Thus, it can be concluded that an increase in [Ca2+]cyt is not a part of the process by which LNCaP cell growth is stimulated by EGF. It has been documented that Ca2+ pools control numerous cell functions, including protein synthesis and cell proliferation (38Gill D.L. Waldron R.T. Rys-Sikora K.E. Ufret-Vincenty C.A. Graber M.N. Favre C.J. Alfonso A. Biosci. Rep. 1996; 16: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the potential variation in LNCaP Ca2+ pool content linked to increased proliferation. Our results show that the Ca2+ pool content increases in growth-stimulated cells. Furthermore, using the specific EGF-R tyrosine kinase activity inhibitor, C56, we showed that, when EGF was unable to induce an increase in Ca2+ pool content, it also failed to stimulate cell growth. The remarkable similarity in dose and time response between LNCaP cell proliferation and the amplitude of TG-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores indicates that an increase in Ca2+ pool content plays a central role in controlling LNCaP cell growth, and may be an important part of the signaling cascade by which EGF stimulates LNCaP cell growth. To further investigate the role of Ca2+ pool content in controlling cell growth, the second part of our experiments aimed to study Ca2+ homeostasis in growth-inhibited LNCaP cells. As it had previously been observed that LNCaP cell growth was reduced in DHT- and serum-deprived cells, LNCaP cells were cultured in DHT- or serum-free media, to study changes in Ca2+ homeostasis. Our results clearly show that, when LNCaP cell growth is inhibited by DHT or serum deprivation, the Ca2+ pool load is reduced, whereas the [Ca2+]cyt is not affected. Moreover, in our experiments, EGF increased both Ca2+ pool content and cell growth in DHT- and serum-free medium, suggesting that Ca2+ pools are a common target in the processes by which stimulatory and inhibitory physiological stimuli control LNCaP cell growth. In this study, for the first time we have directly measured endoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+] using Mag Fura-2 fluorescent dye in growth-stimulated and growth-inhibited prostate cancer cells. These direct measurements of endoplasmic reticulum [Ca2+] in cells treated by EGF and DHT or serum-deprived medium lead us to suggest that Ca2+ pools may play a central role in controlling human prostate proliferation, thus indicating a new mechanism involved in cancer cell growth. It is well known that Ca2+ pools accumulate Ca2+ through the action of SERCA proteins (31Stokes D.L. Wagenknecht T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5274-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As we suggested that the Ca2+ pool content had an impact on cell growth control, we investigated the expression of SERCA proteins in growth-stimulated and growth-inhibited cells. Our study reveals that, in LNCaP cells, SERCA2b proteins (the ubiquitously expressed SERCA isoform) were up-regulated by EGF after 4 days of treatment. This result is consistent with that reported in smooth muscle cells, showing that platelet-derived growth factor induced the overexpression of SERCA proteins (39Magnier C. Papp B. Corvazier E. Bredoux R. Wuytack F. Eggermont J. Maclouf J. Enouf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15808-15815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SERCA2b protein expression is down-regulated by removing DHT or serum from culture media. The fact that the level of SERCA expression in LNCaP cells is correlated with cell growth is of a great interest, and suggests a close correlation between SERCAs expression and proliferation in cancer cells. To verify this hypothesis, we studied LNCaP cell proliferation when SERCAs had been inhibited by treatment with 0.01 nm TG (the minimum dose that induced a transient increase [Ca2+]cyt in our experiments). It had been previously shown that TG was capable of inducing apoptosis in several cell models (6Skryma R. Mariot P. Bourhis X.L. Coppenolle F.V. Shuba Y. Abeele F.V. Legrand G. Humez S. Boilly B. Prevarskaya N. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 71-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (40Jiang S. Chow S.C. Nicotera P. Orrenius S. Exp. Cell. Res. 1994; 212: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In all these studies, TG was used at a concentration of 1–0.01 μm. However, our results showed that 0.01 nm TG did not induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells, as verified by the Hoechst staining method. Our experiments showed that, after a 4-day treatment at 0.01 nm TG, the Ca2+pool load decreased and cell proliferation was significantly inhibited. Moreover, EGF was unable to induce either an increase in Ca2+ pool content or cell growth in SERCA-inhibited cells. These results confirm our hypothesis that SERCA protein expression regulates growth in LNCaP cells by controlling the Ca2+pool load. Moreover, a previous study by Kuo et al. (41Kuo T.H. Liu B.F., Yu, Y. Wuytack F. Raeymaekers L. Tsang W. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 399-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) shows that genes encoding components of the major Ca2+transport pathway, including SERCAs, are regulated by the Ca2+ load of luminal endoplasmic reticulum. This study leads us to propose that the SERCA-related Ca2+ load of endoplasmic reticulum could amplify the processes by which SERCAs expression controls cell growth in our model. In summary, this study provides the first direct evidence that SERCA expression and Ca2+ pool content may play a central role in growth control in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. This raises the prospect of new targets for the treatment of prostate cancer."

Natural mutations of CCR5 that impair surface expression bestow in the homozygous state complete resistance to M-tropic HIV infection. ccr5Δ32 is the major prototype of such mutants. ccr5Δ32 heterozygosity is associated with delayed onset of AIDS and reduced risk of initial transmission, and this correlates with reduced levels of CCR5 and reduced infectability of CD4+ cells. In addition to gene dosage, sequestration of wild type (WT) CCR5 by mutant protein has been proposed as a mechanism to explain reduced surface expression of CCR5 in cells fromccr5Δ32 and CCR5-893(−) heterozygotes. However, here we demonstrate that a molar excess ofccr5Δ32 or related deletion mutants does not significantly impair the cell surface density of co-expressed WT receptor either in human epithelial cells or Jurkat T cells. Further, ligand-dependent signaling and M-tropic HIV usage of WT receptor are also unaffected. Nascent WT receptor does associate withccr5Δ32 and related mutant proteins and with other unrelated CC and CXC chemokine receptors under transient labeling conditions. However, using confocal microscopy, we demonstrate that in the steady state, WT and truncated CCR5 proteins segregate into nonoverlapping subcellular compartments. These findings together with the observed and known variability in the cell surface density of CCR5 on quiescent PBLs lead us to conclude that reduced CCR5 gene dosage rather than receptor sequestration is the major determinant of reduced CCR5 expression in cells from ccr5Δ32 heterozygotes.

Relative cell surface levels of CD4 and chemokine receptors modulate primary HIV infection. Naturally occurring mutations in the co-receptors and their cognate ligands influence HIV transmission and AIDS progression.

Another natural variant of CCR5, CCR5-893(−) observed exclusively in Asians, terminates prematurely at the 299th residue, resulting from a frameshift that fuses 10 residues of the −1 frame and therefore lacks the natural C-tail (18Ansari-Lari M.A. Liu X.M.

FACS analysis of cell surface CCR5 density in fresh PBMCs of a large number of donors showed that, despite considerable individual variability,CCR5/ccr5Δ32 heterozygotes had significantly lower levels of CCR5 than WT homozygotes. Further, a direct correlation between steady state levels of CCR5 and M-tropic HIV infectability was established (17Wu L. Paxton W.A. Kassam N. Ruffing N. Rottman J.B. Sullivan N. Choe H. Sodroski J.

Two reports have addressed mechanisms underlying CCR5 deficiency at the cell surface in ccr5Δ32 andCCR5-893(−) heterozygotes. Histological analysis of HeLa cells co-transfected with ccr5Δ32 and WT receptor demonstrated trapping of the WT receptor by the mutant in the ER and loss of cell surface expression of WT receptor (20Benkirane M.

Simultaneous infection of Jurkat T cells with recombinant Sendai viruses encoding WT CCR5 and the CCR5-893(−) mutant was shown to decrease the cell surface density of WT receptor by FACS analysis (19Shioda T.

Overexpression of ccr5Δ32 and related deletion mutants was shown to inhibit M-tropic HIV usage of co-transfected WT receptor in HeLa-CD4 cells encoding an indicator gene. Further, using a yeast two-hybrid system, it was shown that CCR5 was capable of dimerizing with itself or C-terminally truncated deletion mutants (20Benkirane M. Jin D.Y. Chun R.F. Koup R.A. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30603-30606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). These findings were interpreted to suggest that ccr5Δ32 andCCR5-893(−) mutant proteins dominantly interfered with the functional expression of wt CCR5 by heterodimerization with and cytoplasmic sequestration of WT protein. In this study, we have examined the effect of ccr5Δ32 and related deletion mutants on the expression and function of WT CCR5 in a system that controlled for gene expression. In contrast to the previous reports, we found that overexpression of CCR5 deletion mutants did not significantly affect the surface presentation or function of WT receptor. WT CCR5 protein did physically associate with the various deletion mutants under nascent labeling conditions, but such transient associations also occurred between CCR5 and other CC and CXC chemokine receptors and did not appear to be functionally relevant. The implications of these findings and possible reasons for the discrepancy with the earlier reports are discussed. Construction of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat- or cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter-linked expression plasmids for WT CCR2B, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR1, and CXCR2 has been described (4Alkhatib G.

The various mutants described in this paper were constructed in vitro by the overlap PCR method (29Venkatesan S. Gerstberger S.M. Park H. Holland S.M. Nam Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7469-7480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned using a commercial vector, pCDNA3.1 directional TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corp., Rockville, MD). Some of the mutants were also cloned into FLAG vector (Sigma) that appended a FLAG epitope at the N terminus of the indicated mutants. Δ32 CCR5 open reading frame was PCR-amplified from the T cell DNA of a CCR5Δ32 homozygotic individual and cloned into pCR3.1 vector. Monolayers were transfected by the CaCl2 method (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) or by lipofection using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The JJK line of Jurkat T cells (contributed by Dan Littman; Columbia University, New York) in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum was transfected by use of a Bio-Rad electroporator at a setting of 250 V and 960 microfarads. Pseudotyped HIV stocks expressing firefly luciferase (luc) in place of Nef were prepared by transfecting 293-T cells (by CaCl2precipitation) with 5 μg each of defective HIV provirus, pNL4–3 Env(−) vpR(−) luc(+), and plasmids encodingenv genes from AMLV and M-tropic HIV strains, JRFL (obtained through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Rockville, MD), AD88, and T-tropic HIV NL4–3. Virus in the culture supernatants was quantified by reverse transcriptase assay and adjusted to constant reverse transcription units/ml. 293-T cells were transfected with an equimolar mixture of WT CCR5 and CD4 lacking the C-tail (truncated CD4, known as tCD4) and, where indicated, with a 2.5-fold molar excess (over WT CCR5) of Δ4, Δ8, and Δ32 mutant CCR5 plasmids. After checking the transfection efficiency by FACS analysis, CD4+ cells were purified by binding to and elution from CD4 antibody-coated magnetic beads using a commercial kit (Dynal Inc., Lake Success, NY) that resulted in recovery of >90% CD4+ cells. Eluted cells were seeded into 48-well plates (0.5–1 × 105 cells/well) and infected in triplicate with the respective pseudotyped luc-expressing HIVs. Virus particles without env served as negative control, while AMLVenv pseudotyped virus served as an HIV-irrelevant control. An identical number of untransfected cells were infected by the same viruses. For comparing the relative efficiencies of HIV entry,luc expression induced by AMLV pseudotyped virus was adjusted to constant levels. For this purpose, AMLV pseudotyped virus infection was performed on transfectants prior to CD4 immune selection. At 24–30 h after infection, cell lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using a commercial kit (Promega Corp.) and a microplate luminometer (Multex, Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). The following monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) or rabbit antisera were used to identify CCR5 and other chemokine receptors: 1) for CCR5, FITC- or APC-conjugated mAb 2D7, PE-conjugated mAb 3A9 (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), FITC-conjugated mAb 181 and 182 (R & D Systems), unconjugated mAbs 2D7, 3A9, 180, and 182 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Rockville, MD), and rabbit antibody against the N-terminal end of CCR5 (27Alkhatib G. Locati M. Kennedy P.E. Murphy P.M. Berger E.A. Virology. 1997; 234: 340-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); 2) for CCR2, mAb, clone 48607 (R & D Systems); 3) for CCR3, mouse mAb clone, 7B1 (National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program); 4) for CXCR1, mAb CDw128 (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA); 5) for CXCR2, mAb, clone 48311 (R & D Systems) or unconjugated mAb, IL-8-Rb (BD-Pharmingen). For detecting CD4, FITC- or PE-conjugated mAb Leu 3A (BD-Pharmingen) or APC- or tricolor (TC)-conjugated mAb S3.5 (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used. For CD8 detection, FITC- or PE-conjugated mAb Leu 2A (BD-Pharmingen), or mAb 3B5 conjugated with APC or TC (Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used. For secondary staining, dye-conjugated purified Fab fragments with the relevant species-specific reactivity were obtained from commercial sources (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Antibody binding and flow cytometric analysis protocols have been described before (30Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For metabolic labeling experiments, 293-T cells (106 to 107) at 24–30 h after transfection (as described in the appropriate figure legends) were rinsed three times with and incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum (0.2 ml/sample) for 10 min. Cells were labeled for 30 min by the addition of [35S]Trans-label (ICN Biomedicals Inc. Costa Mesa, CA) to 1 mCi/ml. For measuring the kinetics of protein biosynthesis, 2 × 107 cells were labeled for 15 min in 500 μl of labeling medium (1 mCi/ml), followed by a metabolic chase in 20 volumes of complete growth medium. Conditions for processing labeled cells, SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) have been described (30Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For measuring ligand-dependent CCR5 phosphorylation, 293-T cells (two T25 flask equivalents) were co-transfected with WT CCR5 and CD8 alone or with different amounts of CCR5 deletion mutants as indicated in the figure legend. Cells were harvested by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, an aliquot of each sample was tested for CD8 expression by FACS analysis, and the remaining cells were rinsed three times and incubated as a suspension culture in complete growth medium at 37 °C. Individual transfectants were adjusted to reflect a similar percentage of CD8+ cells and rinsed with 20 volumes of 2× HEPES-buffered, phosphate-deficient RPMI and incubated (4 × 106cells/ml) in the same medium containing 1.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °C. HEK-293 (2 × 106) cells stably expressing WT CCR5 provided the positive control for the assay. The cells were then incubated for 30 min with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml) in the presence of okadaic acid (1 μm). Cells were stimulated with 100 nm MIP-1β or RANTES (purchased from Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) for 15 min followed by processing for immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and PhosphorImager analysis as described (30Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For co-precipitation experiments, 293-T cells were co-transfected with WT CCR5, tagged at the C terminus with six histidines (WT-His6) and the indicated CCR mutants carrying a FLAG epitope at the respective N termini. Other transfections included pairwise combinations of WT-His6 with the Δ32 mutant or expression plasmids for CCR2B, CXCR1, or CXCR2. Transfections were labeled for 30 min with [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) to 0.5 mCi/ml, and cell extracts were prepared as described. After preclearing the cell extracts with protein G-agarose, the samples were divided in half and immunoprecipitated with FLAG-specific (Sigma) or His6-specific mAb (CLONTECH; BD-Pharmingen) prebound to protein G beads. CCR5Δ32 protein was precipitated with rabbit IgG against Δ32 frameshift sequence, and the other chemokine receptors were precipitated with the respective mAbs described above. For immunofluorescence detection of receptors on live cells, transfected cells plated on coverslips were rinsed with PBS and reacted with receptor-specific antibodies in PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. For WT CCR5 and certain deletions, FITC- or APC-conjugated 2D7 (BD-Pharmingen) or FITC-conjugated 182 (R & D Systems) mAbs were used. Since these and some other mAbs failed to recognize deletions extending upstream of the third intracellular loop (Δ8 equivalent), transfections were also checked with rabbit serum against the 26-residue MDYQVSSPIYDINYYTSEPCQKINVK N-terminal sequence of CCR5. For specific detection of CCR5Δ32 protein, we generated rabbit antiserum against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated 12-residue CHGHLLLGNPKNSASVSK C-terminal peptide corresponding to the frameshift sequence in the CCR5Δ32 gene. Rabbit antisera against CCR5 peptides were titrated to determine the optimal dilution that gave the best signal/noise ratio in immunofluorescence assays when used in combination with 1:500 dilutions of Alexa 568 or FITC second antibodies. FLAG epitope was detected using FITC FLAG mAb or by use of M2 murine mAb and rabbit IgG against FLAG peptide as first antibodies (Sigma) followed by chromophore-tagged second antibodies. In cases where first antibodies were unlabeled, the coverslips were rinsed five times with PBS and stained with second antibodies (Fab) fragments, conjugated with APC, FITC, Texas Red, or Alexa dyes 488, 568, or 630 obtained commercially (Molecular Probes; Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories) in PBS containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C. After rinsing five times with PBS, the coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, AL). For detecting intracellular antigens, cells were fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C, rinsed five times with PBS, permeabilized by a 15-min treatment with 0.25% Triton X-100 (or Nonidet P-40) in PBS at 25 °C, and reacted as above with the respective antibody combinations. The following organelle-specific antibodies were used to detect co-localization of the receptors with various subcellular compartments: 1) for ER, mAbs (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) or rabbit sera against calnexin or calreticulin (Stressgen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada); 2) for Golgi, Deng mAb, and 3) for plasma membrane, anti-transferrin receptor (CD71, from Beckman-Coulter) or mAb against Na+/K+ ATPase (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). Images were collected on a Leica TCS-NT/SP confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton, PA) and analyzed as described (30Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 293-T cells were co-transfected with CD4 and WT CCR5 together with 4-fold molar excess of vector DNA or the indicated CCR5 deletion mutants. At 36 h post-transfection, aliquots of ∼105 cells were checked for transfection efficiency by FACS analysis. The remaining cells were adjusted to reflect a constant fraction of CD4+ cells. Transfectants (∼107/ml) were used for a RANTES-dependent Ca2+ flux assay as described (30Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All transfectants were also evaluated for Ca2+ flux responses to 200 nm concentrations of SDF1-α and/or ATP. To analyze the effects of truncation mutants on the function of WT CCR5, we engineered serial C-terminal CCR5 deletions for transient expression. We have shown previously that an intact C-terminal tail was required for optimal cell surface expression of CCR5, and transport-impaired mutants were retained mostly in the ER/Golgi compartments but displayed no obvious defects in protein turnover (30Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To inquire whether larger deletions might display unusual properties of protein processing and interfere with function of WT CCR5, we engineered additional deletions excising sequence up to the fifth TM domain. These mutants are illustrated in Fig.1 and are labeled Δ4 through Δ8. They were tagged at the N termini with a FLAG epitope, and for comparison, WT CCR5 was tagged similarly. The naturally occurring CCR5Δ32 mutant that replaced the sequence downstream of the second ECL by a frameshift sequence of 33 residues represented the largest deletion mutant. Steady-state cell surface expression of the mutants shown in Fig. 1 was examined following transfection of 293-T or HeLa cells. CD8 was co-transfected, and the distribution of CD8 and CCR5 was examined by two-color FACS using two different monoclonal antibodies or rabbit antiserum against the CCR5 N terminus. A representative FACS profile is given in Fig. 2A. Two-color dot plot analysis of cells co-transfected with WT CCR5 and CD8 revealed a double positive diagonal population with almost equivalent staining for both receptors. By this analysis, none of the CCR5 truncation mutants used was identified at the cell surface. To examine more directly the subcellular distribution of WT and mutant CCR5, we analyzed living HeLa cells transfected with individual mutants by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Some of the more commonly used mAbs such as 2D7 and 182 were not reactive with CCR5Δ32 because it lacked the epitope or with Δ8, probably due to misfolding. To ensure uniform antibody reactivity, we used rabbit IgG against N-terminal CCR5 peptide or mAb 180 targeted against an N-terminal epitope. Twelve fields (10–20 cells/field) were examined for each staining from two separate experiments for each antibody. Live cells expressing WT CCR5 exhibited uniform punctate cell surface fluorescence (Fig.2B). Δ4 (terminated at the 306th residue) and all upstream deletions including the natural CCR5Δ32 variant displayed no surface staining. When the transfectants were fixed and permeabilized prior to antibody staining, all of the CCR5 mutants displayed similar levels of intracellular antibody reactivity (Fig. 2B). To examine the intracellular sites of retention of CCR5 mutants, fixed and permeabilized transfectants were immunostained with a mixture of antibodies against CCR5 and the indicated organelle component(s). As discussed in a previous report (30Venkatesan S. Petrovic A. Locati M. Kim Y.-O. Weissman D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40133-40145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), cells were treated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml) and anisomycin (25 μg/ml) for 30 min prior to fixation to facilitate clearing of nascent proteins from the ER. Without this treatment, there was substantial retention of both wt and mutant CCR5 in the ER (not shown). With CCR5 pseudocolored ingreen and the organelles in red, co-localized regions appear yellow (Fig.3). Co"

Three genetically and functionally distinct PPAR isoforms occur in mammals, PPARα (NR1C1), PPARβ (NR1C2), and PPARγ (NR1C3) (1Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Ligand-bound PPARs modulate target gene expression by binding to DNA response elements composed of a direct repeat of the hexameric core motif AGGTCA separated by a single base pair (DR-1). High affinity binding of PPARs to these PPAR-response elements (PPREs) occurs after heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor (RXR). PPAR·RXR heterodimers interact with PPREs located in the promoter region of genes implicated in a number of physiological processes including fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, adipogenesis, carcinogenesis, and development. PPARα, in particular, exerts regulatory control over the expression of numerous genes encoding proteins involved in lipid oxidation and transport (1Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 266-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Fruchart J.C. Duriez P. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 7Jump D.B.

Among these are anti-hyperlipidemic drugs used for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, including clofibrate, bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, and the potent experimental PPARα agonist Wyeth-14,643 (Wy-14,643) (8Issemann I.

Treatment of rodents with these compounds, collectively termed peroxisome proliferators, causes an increase in the size and number of peroxisomes, hepatomegaly, and after chronic administration, tumor formation (2Corton J.C. Lapinskas P.J. Gonzalez F.J. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Issemann I. Green S.

PPARα is also activated by a variety of natural long chain fatty acids, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic, linoleic, linolenic, and arachidonic acids (13Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Wahli W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar, 14Gottlicher M. Widmark E. Li Q. Gustafsson J.A. Proc.

No single high affinity natural ligand has been identified for PPARα, raising the possibility that PPARα may serve as a generalized cellular sensor of fatty acid flux. Consistent with this hypothesis, enzymes such as acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), bifunctional enzyme (BE), and thiolase, which are involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, are known targets for PPARα regulation (15Dreyer C.

PPARα also affects the processes of fatty acid transport and uptake through positive regulation of genes encoding the fatty acid transport protein, fatty-acid translocase (CD36), and the liver cytosolic fatty acid-binding protein (18Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Other PPARα target genes involved in lipid homeostasis are CYP4A microsomal ω-hydroxylases (19Aldridge T.C. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Biochem.

The expression of PPARα and many of its target genes is up-regulated in response to pathophysiological stresses, such as starvation, that are associated with the release of fatty acids into the circulation from adipose tissue as part of the process for mobilizing energy stores (24Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Generation of a PPARα-null mouse definitively established the role of PPARα as the mediator of the pleitropic effects of peroxisome proliferators (17Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). This model has also confirmed the importance of PPARα in lipid homeostasis. In the absence of PPARα, cellular fatty acid flux is impaired due to reduced mitochondrial fatty acid import and β-oxidation, leading to hepatic lipid accumulation in animals fed a high fat diet (25Djouadi F. Weinheimer C.J. Saffitz J.E. Pitchford C. Bastin J. Gonzalez F.J. Kelly D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar).In addition to lowering serum triglyceride levels, peroxisome proliferator anti-hyperlipidemia drugs such as bezafibrate also lower plasma cholesterol levels in humans (26Stahlberg D. Reihner E. Rudling M. Berglund L. Einarsson K. Angelin B. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1025-1030PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol represents a quantitatively important route of cholesterol elimination from the body. The rate-limiting step in this process is catalyzed by the hepatic microsomal enzyme cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) (27Jelinek D.F. Andersson S. Slaughter C.A. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1), another hepatic microsomal enzyme, is the major determinant of the ratio of cholic acid (CA) to chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; Fig. 1), the major products of bile acid biosynthesis, in the bile (28Vlahcevic Z.R. Pandak W.M. Stravitz R.T. Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am. 1999; 28: 1-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, changes in the expression ofCYP7A1 and CYP8B1 affect both the quantity and quality of bile acid biosynthesis, factors that can influence both the elimination of cholesterol from the liver and the absorption of dietary lipids from the intestine. Recent studies indicate that PPARα may exert regulatory control over CYP7A1 (29Patel D.D. Knight B.L. Soutar A.K. Gibbons G.F. Wade D.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 747-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 30Marrapodi M. Chiang J.Y. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 514-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Cheema S.K.

Feedback and feed-forward regulation is a recurrent means by which homeostatic control over essential biochemical pathways is achieved. Thus, we hypothesized that the end products of bile acid biosynthesis, CA and CDCA, were capable of affecting PPARα function. By using in vivo and in vitroapproaches, we show that bile acids inhibit transcriptional activation by PPARα, demonstrating the existence of endogenous antagonists of PPARα-dependent signaling.RESULTSMice fed a diet containing 1% CA for 5 days exhibited no significant increases in liver size as indicated by the liver/body weight ratio in these animals compared with chow-fed controls (Fig. 2 A). As expected, feeding mice a chow diet for 3 days followed by a diet containing 0.1% Wy-14,643 for 2 days caused significant hepatomegaly compared with chow-fed mice. In contrast, mice fed the 1% CA diet for 3 days followed by a 1% CA, 0.1% Wy-14,643 diet for 2 days exhibited a significant reduction in the magnitude of hepatomegaly compared with mice fed the 0.1% Wy-14,643 diet alone. None of the dietary regimens altered the hepatic expression of PPARα mRNA or the mRNA levels for its obligate heterodimerization partner RXRα (Fig. 2 B). However, administration of the Wy-14,643 diet caused substantial increases, compared with chow-fed mice, of the mRNA levels for CYP4A1, CYP4A3, ACOX, BE, and thiolase, all known to be targets for PPARα regulation (15Dreyer C.

When mice received the combined CA/Wy-14,643 dietary regimen, hepatic target gene induction was reduced substantially compared with Wy-14,643 alone. Mice fed the CA-containing diet also exhibited reduced constitutive levels of the mRNA for these target genes compared with chow-fed mice.Figure 2Inhibition of Wy-14 ,643-induced hepatomegaly and target gene expression by cholic acid. Mice were fed normal chow for 5 days, a 1% CA diet for 5 days, chow for 3 days followed by a 0.1% Wy-14,643 diet for 2 days, or a 1% CA diet for 3 days followed by a 1% CA, 0.1% Wy-14,643 diet for 2 days.

As expected, administration of the Wy-14,643 diet failed to cause induction of CYP4A1, CYP4A3, ACOX, BE, and thiolase mRNA levels in the livers of PPARα-null mice (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, reduced levels of CYP4A1, CYP4A3, and thiolase mRNAs were caused by CA or CA/Wy-14,643 feeding to PPARα-null mice. However, the magnitude of this effect was not as great as that observed for CA feeding to wild-type mice. These data suggest the existence of PPARα-independent mechanism(s) by which bile acids can affect the constitutive expression of some PPARα target genes. Bile acids serve as physiological ligands for the farnesoid X-receptor (FXR), a nuclear receptor critical for the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis and transport (33Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M.

To determine whether the reduced PPARα target gene induction caused by CA feeding was FXR-dependent, either through direct actions on the target gene promoters or indirectly viaSHP induction, FXR-null mice were examined. These mice have reduced constitutive SHP expression and lack inducible SHP expression in response to dietary bile acids (33Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, FXR-null mice exhibited normal PPARα hepatic target gene induction in response to the Wy-14,643 diet and experienced a similar attenuation, compared with wild-type mice, of this response when the combined Wy-14,643/CA dietary regimen was applied.Figure 3Modulation of PPAR α target gene expression by cholic acid in PPAR α- and FXR -null mice. PPARα-null or FXR-null mice were fed normal chow for 5 days, a 1% CA diet for 5 days, chow for 3 days followed by a 0.1% Wy-14,643 diet for 2 days, or a 1% CA diet for 3 days followed by a 1% CA, 0.1% Wy-14,643 diet for 2 days. Total RNA was prepared from the livers of PPARα-null (A) and FXR-null (B) mice and analyzed by Northern blot analysis using the indicated cDNA probes.

CDCA was used in these assays in place of CA, as the former is more readily taken up into cells (38Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Treatment of the transfected cells with CDCA caused a dose-dependent decrease of luciferase activity in the absence of Wy-14,643 treatment (Fig. 4 A). Similarly, CDCA treatment also caused a dose-dependent decrease in the magnitude of reporter gene activation caused by 10 μm Wy-14,643 treatment. To determine whether bile acids also interfered with transactivation mediated by other PPARα isoforms, experiments were performed using cells transfected with PPARβ or PPARγ in place of PPARα. As shown in Fig. 4 B, treatment of PPARα-transfected cells with Wy-14,643 caused a 5-fold increase of reporter gene expression compared with Me2SO-treated cells. However, co-treatment with 50 μm CDCA almost entirely abolished reporter gene activation caused by 10 μmWy-14,643. In contrast, reporter gene activation of PPARβ- and PPARγ-transfected cells treated with the selective agonists bezafibrate (10 μm) and troglitazone (10 μm) was unaffected by co-treatment with 50 μm CDCA. CA was without effect on PPARα-dependent transactivation, likely due to an inability of this compound to be taken up effectively by the cells.Figure 4Inhibition of PPAR α reporter gene expression by bile acids.

The key components of this assay included reporter constructs for full-length murine PPARα fused to the transactivation domain of VP16 and the nuclear receptor interaction domains of CBP or NCoR fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. Treatment of transfected CV-1 cells with Wy-14,643 caused efficient CBP recruitment as evidenced by an increase in luciferase reporter gene activity (Fig. 6). In contrast, treatment with increasing concentrations of CDCA reduced both basal CBP association and Wy-14,643-induced CBP recruitment. Wy-14,643 treatment also reduced the constitutive level of PPARα·NCoR association as evidenced by a decrease in reporter gene activation. Similarly, 100 μm CDCA treatment caused a significant decrease in NCoR association.

C57BL/6 mice mount a vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the immunodominant virus peptide VP2121-130 and clear TMEV infection. Interferon-g (IFN-g)R-/- mice also mount a strong CTL response against the VP2121-130 epitope, but because of genetic deficiencies in critical IFN-g signaling pathways, they do not clear TMEV infection and develop prominent neurological deficits within 6 wk. This pronounced disease process, coupled with a defined CTL response, provides an ideal model for evaluating the importance of antiviral CTL activity in the development of severe demyelination and loss of motor neuron function. By administering the VP2121-130 peptide before and during TMEV infection, 99% of the VP2121-130-specific CD8+ T cell response was inhibited. No decrease in virus infection was observed. Peptide treatment did result in significantly less motor dysfunction, even when no differences in levels of demyelination were observed. Although most investigators focus on the role of CD4+ T cells in demyelinating disease, these studies are the first to demonstrate a clear contribution of antiviral CD8+ T cells in neurological injury in a chronic-progressive model of multiple sclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2166077943,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease process associated with elevated levels of plasma cholesterol, especially low-density lipoproteins. The latter become trapped within the arterial wall and are oxidized and taken up by macrophages to form foam cells. This process is an initiating event for atherosclerosis. Fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) are involved in fatty acid metabolism and cellular lipid transport, and adipocyte FABP (aP2) is also expressed in macrophages. We recently generated mice lacking both apolipoprotein (Apo)E and aP2 (ApoE-/-aP2-/-) and found that these mice, compared with ApoE-/- mice, developed markedly smaller atherosclerotic lesions that contained fewer macrophages. Here we investigated the mechanism(s) responsible for this prevention of atherosclerotic lesion formation. Bone marrow transplantations were performed in ApoE-/- mice, receiving cells from either ApoE-/- or ApoE-/-aP2-/- mice. The lack of aP2 in donor marrow cells led to the development of smaller (5.5-fold) atherosclerotic lesions in the recipient mice. No differences were found in plasma cholesterol, glucose, or insulin levels between recipients of bone marrow cells from ApoE-/- or ApoE-/-aP2-/- mice. However, the expression of chemoattractant and inflammatory cytokines was decreased in macrophages from ApoE-/-aP2-/- mice compared with ApoE-/- mice, which may contribute to the decrease in atherosclerotic lesion formation. Taken together, we demonstrate the importance of macrophage aP2 in the development of atherosclerotic lesions."

We have also prepared the Gαi mutants whose C-terminal 11 or 5 amino acids were replaced with those of Gαt, Gαo, and Gαq to evaluate the role of the C-terminal tail of the α-subunit on the specific coupling of bovine rhodopsin with Gt. Replacement of loop 2 of bovine rhodopsin with that of the scallop rhodopsin caused about a 40% loss of Gt and Go activation, whereas that of loop 3 enhanced the Go activation four times with a 60% decrease in the Gt activation. These results indicated that loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin is one of the regions responsible for the specific coupling with Gt. Loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin discriminates the difference of the 6-amino acid sequence (region A) at a position adjacent to the C-terminal 5 amino acids of the G protein, resulting in the different activation efficiency between Gt and Go. In addition, the binding of region A to loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin is essential for activation of Gt but not Gi, even though the sequence of the region A is almost identical between Gαt and Gαi.

Imai H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 1299-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It is a 35–55-kDa membrane protein consisting of a single polypeptide opsin and a chromophore 11-cis-retinal. The opsin contains seven transmembrane α-helices, the structural motif typical of the G protein-coupled receptors. Light isomerizes the 11-cis-retinal into the all-trans form, which induces the conformational changes of the opsin to activate the retinal G protein. Several lines of evidence have now revealed that there are at least three subtypes of visual pigments, each of which couples with the Gt,1Gq, or Go subtype of the G protein, respectively (2Kojima D. Terakita A. Ishikawa T. Tsukahara Y. Maeda A. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22979-22982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Among the G protein subtypes, the latter two have been widely distributed in a variety of cells in various animals (3Simon M.I. Strathmann M.P. Gautam N. Science. 1991; 252: 802-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar), whereas the Gt has been identified only in the photoreceptor cells (4Lerea C.L. Somers D.E. Hurley J.B. Klock I.B. Bunt-Milam A.H. Science. 1986; 234: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and some types of taste cells in vertebrates (5Ruiz-Avila L. McLaughlin S.K. Wildman D. McKinnon P.J. Robichon A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 2The expression of Gt2 mRNA in rat mesencephalic tissue was recently reported based on reverse transcription PCR (11Yamaguchi I.

In addition, Gt biochemically exhibits unique characteristics different from other types; that is, Gt can be easily solubilized in an aqueous solution without detergent (7Kuhn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and it exhibits a high affinity to GDP (8Wessling-Resnick M. Johnson G.L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4316-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The latter characteristic of Gt is physiologically important because it is one of the key characteristics to account for the low noise of the signal transduction. Therefore, together with the inverse agonist nature of the chromophore in visual pigment (9Han M. Lou J. Nakanishi K. Sakmar T.P. Smith S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23081-23085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), Gt is thought to be the highly differentiated G protein to mediate the signal transduction cascade with low noise. Although vertebrate rhodopsins couple with Gt in the native photoreceptor cells, they exhibit the ability to activate Gi and Go as evidenced by the in vitro studies (10Kanaho Y. Tsai S.C. Adamik R. Hewlett E.L. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7378-7381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From this point of view, bovine rhodopsin could be classified as a receptor that couples with the Gifamily of the G protein. However, among most Gi/Go-coupled receptors, only a few receptors exhibit efficient activities to Gt (11Yamaguchi I. Harmon S.K. Todd R.D. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

The process of interaction between bovine rhodopsin and Gt has been extensively investigated by various techniques, and it was suggested that the second, third, and extra cytoplasmic loops of bovine rhodopsin are involved in the Gt activation (15Franke R.R.

However, almost all of the experiments were performed using only Gt and its peptide fragments, and it is still unclear which of the interaction sites is specific to the Gt subtype. That is, there is no evidence for the interaction site(s) to account for the activation ability specific for Gt. Therefore, elucidation of the specific interaction site(s) between vertebrate rhodopsins and Gt is important for furthering our understanding of the signal transduction system in vertebrates. In the present study, we have tried to obtain a clue to the specific interaction site(s) between bovine rhodopsin and Gt. For this purpose, we have constructed bovine rhodopsin mutants whose second or third cytoplasmic loops were replaced with the corresponding loop of the Go-coupled scallop rhodopsin (see Fig. 1A) and investigated the difference in the activation efficiencies for Gt, Go, and Gi among these mutants and wild type. Furthermore, to elucidate the mechanism of the specific interaction between the cytoplasmic loops of bovine rhodopsin and the C-terminal region of the G protein α-subunit, we have constructed the Gαi mutants whose C-terminal 11 or 5 amino acids were replaced with those of Gαt, Gαo, and Gαq (see Fig. 1B) and investigated the difference in the activation efficiencies for these mutants between the wild type and the loop-replaced mutants of rhodopsin. These results showed that the third cytoplasmic loop of bovine rhodopsin discriminates between Gt and Go by recognizing the region including 6 amino acids (see Fig. 1B,region A) adjacent to the region including the C-terminal 5 amino acids (see Fig. 1B, region B), whereas that of the SCOP2 does not discriminate region A. There was little difference in the activation efficiency of Gibetween the wild type rhodopsin and the loop 3-replaced mutant, which suggested that the interaction between loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin and region A is not important for catalyzing the GDP-GTP exchange reaction on Gi. From these findings, the molecular mechanism of the coupling specificity of bovine rhodopsin with Gt and the functional diversity among the G proteins are discussed. [35S]GTPγS (37 TBq/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The cDNA encoding rat Gαi1 was isolated from the cDNA library of rat brain (kindly provided by Dr. H. Itoh, Tokyo Institute Technology). The hybridoma that produces the anti-bovine rhodopsin monoclonal antibody was generously supplied by Dr. R. Molday (University of British Columbia). Oligomers of DNA for the PCR mutagenesis were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The DNA encoding bovine opsin, which has 30 unique restriction sites, was synthesized to carry out the cassette mutagenesis. The third loop-replaced mutant cDNA fragment was constructed by using standard PCR mutagenesis techniques with the SCOP2 cDNA as the template. The PCR fragments were constructed into the bovine opsin cDNA restriction sites, XhoI and XbaI for the loop 2 replacement and BsrGI and NdeI for the loop 3 replacement, and the constructed DNAs were ligated into the expression vector SRα using the restriction sites HindIII and EcoRI. Expression and purification of the rhodopsins were carried out according to our previous methods (25Nagata T. Terakita A. Kandori H. Kojima D. Shichida Y. Maeda A.

Briefly, the visual pigments were extracted in 1% dodecylmaltoside in a buffer composed of 50 mm HEPES and 140 mm NaCl (pH 7.0). They were absorbed into the rhodopsin antibody 1D4 and then eluted by the buffer supplemented with the epitope for the antibody, a C terminus nonapeptide (TSQVAPA), and 0.02% dodecylmaltoside. The visible spectra were recorded with a Shimadzu MPS-2000 recording spectrophotometer at 4 °C (26Shichida Y. Tachibanaki S. Mizukami T. Imai H. Terakita A.

For expression of the mutant Gαi1s having the C-terminal 11 amino acids of Gαq, Gαo, and Gαt (see Fig.1), PCR methods were applied to replace the C terminus sequence of the Gαi1 cDNA by those of the rat Gαq, Gαo, and Gαt cDNAs. The wild type and mutant Gαi1s were unmyristoylated. 4Recombinant Gαi used in this experiment should be unmyristoylated, because we did not coexpress the enzyme gene that myristoylates the Gαi in the expression system.

The purified wild type and mutant Gαi1s were mixed with an equal amount of transducin βγ before use. Gt concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal.

Go and Gi concentration were estimated from the saturated intrinsic GTPγS binding to them in the presence of 10 μm GTPγS at 20 °C. Activation of the G protein by visual pigments was measured by monitoring the amount of GTPγS bound to the G protein according to our previous report (31Terakita A. Yamashita T. Tachibanaki S.

The rhodopsin solutions were irradiated with orange light for 30 s or kept dark and then immediately mixed with the G protein solution. The buffer composition of the mixture is the same in the Gt, Gi, and Go activation assays (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% dodecylmaltoside, 0.1% sodium cholate, 0.8 mg/ml of phosphatidylcholine, except for the concentration of GTPγS and GDP (1 μm[35S]GTPγS (1000–2000 cpm/pmol) and 2 μmGDP for the Gt and Gi assays and 0.1 μm [35S]GTPγS (∼30000 cpm/pmol) and 100 μm GDP for the Go assay). G protein final concentrations in Gt, Go, and Giassays were 800, 600, and 900 nm, respectively. Concentrations of mutant Gis were the same as that of wild type Gi. After the mixture was incubated for a selected time in the dark, an aliquot (20 μl) was mixed with 200 μl of stop solution (Gt and Gi assays: 20 mmTris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mmMgCl2, 2 μm GTPγS, and 2 μmGDP; Go assay: 20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm GTPγS and 100 μm GDP) and then immediately filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane to trap the amount of [35S]GTPγS bound to the G proteins. The membrane was then washed four times with 200 μl of washing buffer (20 mm Tris/Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2) to diminish free [35S]GTPγS and put into 2 ml of scintillator (ACS II; Amersham) to assay using a liquid scintillation counter (LS 6000IC; Beckman). It should be noted that we selected the experimental conditions under which no intrinsic uptakes of GTPγS in Gt, Gi, and Go were observed to precisely compare the activation efficiencies of rhodopsin and its chimeras to one of the G proteins of different characteristics. We also compared the efficiencies of activation of the various G proteins by rhodopsin and chimeras after confirming that the activation efficiencies of G proteins were linearly correlated with the concentrations of pigments and that these pigments concentrations exhibited the linear kinetics up to 90 s in each G protein activation assay (see Fig. 2). Fig. 1A shows the alignment of the amino acid sequences of the second and the third cytoplasmic loops of the rhodopsins. According to the alignment, we prepared mutants of bovine rhodopsin in which the second or the third cytoplasmic loop was replaced with the corresponding loop of SCOP2, the Go-coupled scallop rhodopsin. All of the mutants and wild type rhodopsin exhibited almost the same absorption maxima at 499 nm, and upon irradiation at 4 °C, they were converted to meta II intermediates whose maxima were located at 380 nm (data not shown). These results enabled us to use the same irradiation conditions for all of the mutant and wild type rhodopsins for the GTPγS binding assay. The ability of the mutant rhodopsins to activate the G protein subtypes was assayed by monitoring the light-dependent GTPγS binding to the G proteins (Fig. 2). We selected different experimental conditions under which no intrinsic exchanges of GTPγS in Gt, Gi, and Go were observed to precisely compare the activation efficiencies of rhodopsin and its chimeras to one of the G proteins of different characteristics. Fig. 2 provides three kinds of information about our G protein activation assays. First, no intrinsic GTPγS binding to G protein was detected under our experimental conditions. The experimental results of most effective rhodopsin to each G protein are shown in the figure to demonstrate that no intrinsic GTPγS binding was observed in any rhodopsins. Second, a linear relationship between pigment concentration and G protein activation in each G protein assay is shown, where the G protein activation was measured 45 s after the activation of rhodopsin or the loop-replaced mutant. Finally, these pigment concentrations exhibited the linear kinetics up to 90 s in each G protein activation assay. We also confirmed that other rhodopsins exhibited a linear effect on G protein activation when the same amounts of these rhodopsins were added to the reaction mixture. It should be noted that the Go assay was carried out at a low temperature (0 °C) in the presence of high GDP and low GTPγS concentrations to diminish a large intrinsic uptake of GTPγS by Go. As a result, we added a relatively large amount of rhodopsin to effectively activate Go, although the initial rate of Go activation was still smaller than those of others. In the following experiments, we calculated the initial rates of G protein activation from the amounts of GTPγS binding to G proteins for 45 s and compared the G protein activation abilities of wild type and mutant rhodopsin. The rhodopsin concentrations used in Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6 (10 nm for Gt, 100 nm for Go, and 10 nm for Gi) are in the range of the concentration that gave a linear effect on G protein activation.Figure 6Initial rates of activation of G protein mutants by rhodopsin mutants. Three kinds of G protein mutants were prepared by substitution of the C-terminal 11 amino acids of Gαi (Gi/wild) by those of Gαt (Gi/t11), Gαo(Gi/o11), and Gαq(Gi/q11). Activation of these G proteins by wild type and rhodopsin mutants, which possessed loop 3 of SCOP2, was measured. The data are the means ± S.D. of three separate experiments. Wild type and mutant G proteins bound ∼9000 fmol GTPγS in the presence of 60 nm light-stimulated mutant rhodopsin having loop 3 of Go-rhodopsin upon incubation for 10 min, and the initial rates of wild type and mutant Gis, which were catalyzed by unirradiated rhodopsins, were less than 14 μmol/min/mol rhodopsin (data not shown). Note that the different absolute amounts of Gi/wild between Figs. 4 and 5 were due to different preparations of G proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3 shows the effects of the loop 2 replacement of bovine rhodopsin with that of SCOP2 on the activation efficiencies for Gt, Go, and Gi. The replacement caused about a 40% loss of activity to Gt, suggesting that the loop 2 sequence of SCOP2 affects the activation ability of bovine rhodopsin. A similar loss of activation ability was observed when Go was subjected to the experiments, although the loss of the Giactivation ability was not very prominent. These results showed that the replacement effect was not specifically observed for the Gt activation, suggesting that the loss of the activation ability is not due to the deficiency of the specific coupling with Gt but due to the inadequate sequence of the SCOP2 for the formation of the active state of bovine rhodopsin. In a previous study, we have demonstrated that the N-terminal 7 amino acids of loop 2 are important for the formation of active state of bovine rhodopsin (32Yamashita T. Terakita A. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34272-34279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Among the 7 amino acids in the introduced loop 2 of SCOP2, the cysteine at position 134 has a characteristic different from that of the glutamic acid in the ERY motif of bovine rhodopsin. In fact, the replacement of Cys134 with glutamic acid in the loop 2-replaced mutant rescued its Gt activation efficiency to 80% of the wild type (data not shown). The replacement of loop 3 with the corresponding loop of SCOP2 resulted in a 60% loss of the activation ability for Gt (Fig.4A); the extent of the loss is more prominent than that observed in the loop 2-replaced mutant (Fig.3A). In contrast, the mutant activated Go four times more efficiently than the wild type (Fig. 4B), suggesting that loop 3 of SCOP2 is more suitable for the Goactivation than that of bovine rhodopsin, or loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin could not take a proper conformation to efficiently activate Go. Because bovine and scallop rhodopsins are colocalized with Gt and Go, respectively (2Kojima D. Terakita A. Ishikawa T. Tsukahara Y. Maeda A. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22979-22982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), in the native photoreceptor cells, it is reasonable that these rhodopsins exhibit some specificity to Gt and Go. The present results showed that loop 3 is one of the regions specifically interacting with the G proteins, which is in contrast to the role of loop 2 that could be related to the conformational change of the rhodopsin molecule to form the state activating the G proteins (32Yamashita T. Terakita A. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34272-34279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, we could not directly compare the activation efficiency of Gt by the wild type or the loop 3-replaced mutant with that of Go, because, in addition to the different character of each G protein, the experimental conditions to assay G protein activations were different among the G proteins. In other words, we could not estimate whether both the loops of the wild type and mutant or either of the loops exhibit different affinities to these G proteins. One of the ways to overcome these difficulties is the construction of G protein mutants from one of the G protein subtypes, whereas the mutants have the sequences responsible for the specific coupling with the receptor subtypes. Several mutational analyses of the G protein α-subunit suggested that the C terminus is one of the determinants for the characteristics of the G protein subtype in receptor coupling, which is well conserved among each subtype (33Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 34Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Natochin M. Muradov K.G. McEntaffer R.L. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2669-2675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have prepared the Gαi mutants in which the C-terminal sequences were replaced with the corresponding sequences of Gαt, Gαo, and Gαq, respectively. Under the same experimental conditions as wild type Gi, no Gi mutant exhibited a significant uncatalyzed rate of exchange of GTPγS (data not shown). To examine the effect of the C terminus replacements, we first prepared the Gαimutants whose C-terminal 5 amino acids were replaced with those of Gαo and Gαq. Hereafter, the mutants are referred to as Gi/o5 and Gi/q5, respectively. It should be noted that the C-terminal 5 amino acids of Gαi are identical to those of Gαt (Fig.1B). The wild type rhodopsin and the loop 3-replaced mutant exhibited a similar ability to activate Gi/wild and Gi/o5, whereas they exhibited little ability for Gi/q5 (Fig.5). The latter is consistent with the fact that the C terminus sequence of Gq is different from those of the Gi group and is one of the regions for the impairment of the Gi/Go-coupled receptor (33Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we observed differences in the activation ability between the wild type and the mutant when the Gαi mutants having the C-terminal 11 amino acids of Gαt and Gαo (Gi/t11 and Gi/o11, respectively) were subjected to the experiments (Fig.6). As expected from the sequence similarity of the C-terminal 11 amino acids between Gαi and Gαt, the wild type rhodopsin activated the Gi/t11 with an efficiency similar to that of Gi/wild. However, it showed only about a 20% efficiency to activate Gi/o11 (Fig. 6). The mutant having the loop 3 of SCOP2 activated Gi/o11 as efficiently as Gi/wild and Gi/t11, and the activation efficiencies are similar to those of Gi/wild and Gi/t11 observed in the wild type (Fig. 6). These results indicated that loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin could not take the proper conformation to interact with the C-terminal 11 amino acids of Go, resulting in a less efficient activation of Gi/o11. The interesting observation is that the lower activation efficiency of Gi/o11 shown by the wild type relative to the mutant is comparable with the difference in the Go activation efficiency between these pigments (Fig.4B). Therefore, the difference in the Goactivation efficiency between the wild type and the mutant could be mainly due to the reduced activation ability of the wild type but not to the efficient activation ability of the mutant. Hereafter, the region of the 6 amino acids from the N terminus and that of the 5 amino acids from the C terminus of the 11 amino acids are referred to as regions A and B, respectively (Fig. 1B). The mutant activated Gi/o11 as efficiently as Gi/wild, suggesting that the interaction of the loop 3 of SCOP2 with region A is not essential for the activation mechanism of Gi. These results also suggested the specific role of the interaction between the loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin and region A of Gt in the activation mechanism of Gt (see “Discussion”). As already described, bovine rhodopsin can be classified as one of the receptors that couple with the Gi family of the G protein, but it has a specific ability to activate Gt. The present studies using the loop-replaced rhodopsin mutants and the C terminus-replaced Gαi mutants strongly suggest the specific role of region A (Fig. 1B) in the activation mechanism of Gt by bovine rhodopsin. That is, bovine rhodopsin can discriminate the difference in the amino acid sequence of region A between Gt and Go, suggesting that region A is one of the recognition sites of Gt by bovine rhodopsin. Our spectroscopic experiments by using the C-terminal peptide (regions A + B) supported our conclusion that is based on the analyses of G protein C terminus mutants; the peptide of the C-terminal 11 amino acids of Gαt stabilizes the meta II intermediate of bovine rhodopsin in the rod outer segments more than two times greater than that of Gαo (dissociation constants are about 2 and 5 mm, respectively; data not shown). Because the sequence of Gt is identical with that of Goup to the 9 amino acids adjacent to the C-terminal 11 amino acids, it is likely that the 6 amino acids in region A are enough for the difference in the stabilization of meta II between Gt and Go. Therefore, there could be present a specific interaction between loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin and region A of Gt for the efficient activation of Gt. On the other hand, the wild type and loop-replaced mutant showed the activation ability for Gi similar to each other (Figs.3C, 5, and 6). This is in contrast to the fact that they showed the activation ability for Gt considerably different from each other (Fig. 4). Because the sequence of region A is almost identical between Gt and Gi, these facts could originate from the different role of the interaction between loop 3 and region A. The difference in the activation efficiency of Gtbetween the wild type and the loop 3-replaced mutant could be explained either by the efficient activation of Gt by the loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin or less activation of Gt by loop 3 of SCOP2. In the former case, the binding of the loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin with region A induces a proper conformational change(s) in the Gt molecule to efficiently activate Gt, whereas the proper conformational change(s) could not occur upon binding of the loop 3 with region A of Gi. In the latter case, there is a specific activation mechanism of Gtdifferent from Gi and Go, and the mechanism could not work upon the interaction of region A of Gt with loop 3 of SCOP2. In either case, the experimental results could be explained by the specific interaction between the loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin and region A of Gt. Several kinds of evidence demonstrated the involvement of the α5 helix adjacent to the C terminus in G protein activation (36Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Koenig B. Hofmann K.P.

In addition to the sequence of region A, the sequence of the α5 is also highly homologous between Gt and Gi (40Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). These facts suggest that the conformational changes of the α5 helix upon binding of the loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin to region A could be similar between Gt and Gi. Thus it is likely that the binding of loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin to region A (and region B) could facilitate an additional conformational change(s) in the region other than the α5 helix in the Gt molecule to induce the GDP-GTP exchange reaction on Gt, whereas an additional conformational change, if any, may not be essential for the exchange reaction on Gi. The difference in structure in the region other than the α5 helix between Gt and Gi, which affects the GDP-GTP exchange reactions of these proteins (42Bae H. Cabrera-Vera T.M. Depree K.M. Graber S.G. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14963-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was recently reported. Thus identification of the region that is affected upon binding of loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin to the region A will be our future research. It remains to be determined which region in loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin is responsible for the binding to region A, although our experiments clearly showed a specific interaction between the loop 3 and region A. 5During the course of the preparation of this manuscript, Khorana and co-workers (47Cai K. Itoh Y. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4877-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 48Itoh Y. Cai K. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4883-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) published the cross-linking data showing that the cysteine introduced at position 240 in the third cytoplasmic loop of the light-activated rhodopsin could contact with residues 342–345 in the C-terminal region, residues 310–313 in the α4-β6 loop, and residues 19–28 at the N-terminal helix. To specify the binding region in loop 3, we divided loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin into three segments and prepared six chimerical mutants between bovine rhodopsin and SCOP2, as has already been done in the loop 2 mutants of bovine rhodopsin (32Yamashita T. Terakita A. Shichida Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34272-34279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to specify the region, probably because the number of amino acids in the loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin is different from those in the loop 3 of SCOP2 (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, we found that the mutant of bovine rhodopsin, where amino acids at positions 237 to 249 were deleted (Δ237–249; Ref.15Franke R.R. Konig B. Sakmar T.P. Khorana H.G. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1990; 250: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), showed no ability for both Gt and Go. Because the deleted mutant still contains the four hydrophobic residues (Val250, Thr251, Val254, and Ile255) responsible for the selective interaction with the Gi group of the G protein by binding to the C-terminal 5 amino acids (34Liu J. Conklin B.R. Blin N. Yun J. Wess J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11642-11646Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it is reasonable that the deleted region 237–249 in the loop 3 is important for the binding to region A. The interesting observation is that the deleted mutant showed a partial ability to activate Gi (30% of that shown by the wild type), whereas it showed a loss of Gt and Go activation as described above. Because the deleted region forms a unique loop structure with the extrusion to the cytoplasmic surface in the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin (43Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar), its binding to region A might cause the proper conformation of the region adjacent to the α5 helix in the Gαt molecule, but the binding to region A may not be necessary for the conformational change of the corresponding region in the Gi molecule. In summary, the present study shows the presence of a specific interaction between the loop 3 of bovine rhodopsin with region A in Gαt, which is one of the candidates to account for the coupling specificity of bovine rhodopsin with Gt. As far as we know, this is the first experimental evidence that accounts for the specificity of bovine rhodopsin to Gt. Further experiments via a strategy of deletional and site-directed mutagenesis will shed light on the mechanism of the Gt specificity of vertebrate rhodopsin and its relation to the diversity of the receptor-G protein coupling.

Although many proteins of animal origin have been found to carry this modification, including transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, nuclear pore proteins, viral proteins, oncogene products, and tumor suppressors, very little is known about its incidence in the plant world (3Thornton T.M.

PPV is the causal agent of sharka, a very devastating disease affecting stone fruit crops of the Prunus genus. The potyvirus genome consists of a single-stranded messenger-polarity RNA molecule of about 10 kb, with a VPg protein at its 5′ end and a poly(A) tail at its 3′ end. This genome is translated into a large polyprotein that is further processed by three virus-encoded proteases (9Revers F. Gall O.L. Candresse T. Maule A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 366-376Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Riechmann J.L. Laı́n S. Garcı́a J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The genome is encapsidated by ∼2000 units of a single type of capsid protein (CP), encoded at the 3′ end of the genome (11Shukla D.D. Ward C.W. Brunt A.A. The Potyviridae. CAB International, Cambridge1994Google Scholar) (Fig.1).The potyvirus CP is involved in cell to cell and long distance movement inside the plant. In particular, the N- and C-terminal parts of the CP are known to be involved in systemic movement (12Dolja V.V. Haldeman R. Robertson N.L. Dougherty W.G. Carrington J.C.

Virology. 1995; 206: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal region of the potyvirus CP, which is extremely variable among different virus species, holds an Asp-Ala-Gly (DAG) amino acid triad that is essential for aphid transmission (14Atreya C.D.

In this paper we explain that PPV CP, in addition to being phosphorylated, is modified by O-linkedN-acetylglucosamination. At least one of the glycosylated residues lies at the N-terminal region of the protein, namely at a 15-amino acid sequence that is deleted in some natural non-aphid-transmissible (NAT) PPV mutants (17López-Moya J.J. Canto T. Dı́az-Ruı́z J.R. López-Abella D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Maiss E. Timpe U. Briske-Rode A. Leseman D.-E. Casper R. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is the first extensive characterization of this modification in a plant protein.DISCUSSIONSince the first description of protein glycosylation at specific serine or threonine residues by single β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties (25Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a large number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins of many eukaryotic organisms have been found to carry this modification (24Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).O-Glycosylation with terminal GlcNAc modification has been described for nuclear pore complex proteins of tobacco, but in contrast with O-GlcNAc modification of animal proteins, the size of the sugar chains of these tobacco proteins corresponded to more than five monosaccharide units, which were not further characterized (26Heese-Peck A. Cole R.N. Borkhsenious O.N. Hart G.W. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,27Heese-Peck A. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the size of one of the peptides detected by the MALDI-TOF analysis of PPV CP corresponds to a single GlcNAc modification (Figs. 3 and 4), resembling the typicalO-GlcNAc glycosylation of animal proteins. Taking into account that the sequence of the PPV CP peptide carrying the identified modification has two serine and two threonine residues, the doubly glycosylated form detected by the MALDI-TOF analysis is likely to correspond to two single O-GlcNAc modifications rather than to the attachment of two O-GlcNAc molecules to a single threonine or serine residue, although our present data do not allow us to rule out the latter possibility. The MALDI analysis did not precisely identify the O-GlcNAc-modified residues at the N-terminal region of PPV CP, although the fact that no glycosylation was detected in the 1–39 peptide of PPV-MCMV CP (Fig. 3), which conserves Ser-16, suggests that the modification could affect residues Thr-19, Thr-24, and/or Ser-25. In this regard, the YinOYang program 2R. Gupta, S. Brunak, and J. Hansen, manuscript in preparation. predicts these three residues, but not Ser-16, as putative targets for O-GlcNAc modification (data not shown).O-GlcNAc modifications of structural and non-structural proteins of animal viruses with double-stranded RNA (8González S.A. Burrone O.R. Virology. 1991; 182: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or DNA (5Benko D.M. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Gibson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2573-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Mullis K.G. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Marchase R.B. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5317-5323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whitford M. Faulkner P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genomes have been described. However, to our knowledge, PPV CP is the first protein of a plant virus and of a virus with a positive strand RNA genome, for which a typical O-GlcNAcylation has been unambiguously demonstrated. O-GlcNAc-modified proteins appear to have two common features: they are also phosphorylated, and they form reversible multimeric complexes via interactions that are regulated by phosphorylation (1Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The CP of potyviruses may exhibit both traits. Protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions have to be established and disturbed in virion assembly and RNA desencapsidation, respectively. Moreover, very recently it has been shown that phosphorylation down-regulates the RNA binding activity of the CP of a potyvirus, PVA (16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that PVA CP was phosphorylated in the infected plants, but the authors suggested that it was not phosphorylated when packaged into virions, based on the fact that disrupted particles but not intact virions could be phosphorylatedin vitro by a plant protein extract. Our immunoreaction experiments (Fig. 5) appear to indicate that PPV CP was phosphorylated at threonine and serine residues when it was assembled in virions. These data are not in conflict with those of Ivanov et al.(16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), because phosphorylation of the assembled CP might be only partial, and disassembled CP would, therefore, be susceptible to further phosphorylation. In agreement with this suggestion, the phosphorylation levels of PPV-PS and PPV-R CPs appear to be different. Probably, these differences reflect changes in the global extent of phosphorylation rather than specific features of the phosphorylation patterns, because sequence analysis showed only minor differences between PPV-PS and PPV-R CPs in the likelihood of phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues predicted by the NetPhos 2.0 program (29Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar) or in the total content of these amino acids (data not shown). The fact that the CP of PPV-CPV, which lacks the two serine and two threonine residues present in the first 39 amino acids of the CP of PPV-R, showed a phosphorylation level similar to that of this protein suggests that the contribution of these threonine and serine residues to the phosphorylation status of the CP assembled in virions is rather low.O-GlcNAcylation is known to be reciprocal to phosphorylation in many proteins; thus, O-GlcNAc residues could be protecting the N terminus of the CP, which is surface-exposed (30Shukla D.D. Strike P.M. Tracy S.L. Gough K.H. Ward C.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1497-1508Crossref Google Scholar), against phosphorylation when the CP is assembled in virions. Interestingly, six of the eight serine and threonine residues that the YinOYang program2 predicts to be able to suffer reciprocalO-GlcNAc/phosphate modifications are in the N-terminal region of the PPV-R CP (data not shown). In any case, although the simultaneous detection of O-GlcNAc modification and phosphorylation in PPV virions could be due to the presence of a mixture of molecules carrying each modification in an excluding manner, it appears more likely that CP molecules forming PPV particles could be modified with both phosphate and O-GlcNAc residues, as has been proposed for other proteins (24Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).What is the functional relevance of O-GlcNAc modifications for PPV infection? The fact that PPV-NAT, PPV-CPV, and PPV-MCMV (Fig.1) are viable indicates that O-GlcNAc-modified residues at the 13–27-amino acid segment deleted by the NAT mutation are not essential. No significant differences in infectivity or virus accumulation in herbaceous hosts have been observed between these mutant viruses and wild-type PPV under experimental conditions (data not shown). This does not preclude the possibility that some differences in adaptation to the selective pressure of their natural environment could exist among these viruses. In this regard, the fact that NAT mutants have appeared spontaneously when PPV was propagated in herbaceous plants after transfer from its natural woody host (17López-Moya J.J. Canto T. Dı́az-Ruı́z J.R. López-Abella D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Maiss E. Timpe U. Briske-Rode A. Leseman D.-E. Casper R. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggests that NAT region, and possibly its phosphorylation andO-GlcNAcylation, could be important for viral fitness, at least in some hosts. Moreover, the possibility thatO-GlcNAcylation of PPV CP is restricted to the N-terminal peptide analyzed in this work is quite unlikely, and an appropriate modification of Ser/Thr residues in other regions of the CP might be relevant for virus viability.An effect of protein phosphorylation on the stability of poliovirus capsids and its consequent involvement in viral uncoating was described some years ago (31Ratka M. Lackmann M. Ueckermann C. Karlins U. Koch G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3954-3960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation of PVA CP affects its capacity to interact with RNA, suggesting that this modification might contribute to the control of the amount of genomic RNA available for translation, replication, encapsidation, and movement (16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A similar role has been suggested for the phosphorylation of the CP of PVX (32Atabekov J.G. Rodionova N.P. Karpova O.V. Kozlovsky S.V. Novikov V.K. Arkhipenko M.V. Virology. 2001; 286: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the movement protein of TMV (33Karpova O.V. Rodionova N.P. Ivanov K.I. Kozlovsky S.V. Dorokhov Y.L. Atabekov J.G. Virology. 1999; 261: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which has been shown to modulate the effect of these proteins on translation of the genomic RNA. It would be expected thatO-GlcNAcylation, reciprocal to phosphorylation, could also play a key role in these regulatory mechanisms.O-GlcNAc modification of the capsid protein is probably not a specific feature of potyviruses. No data are available on this kind of modification in animal viruses with positive strand RNA genome. However, it has been reported that capsid proteins of some positive strand RNA viruses of plants, namely, barley stripe virus, cowpea mosaic virus (34Partridge J.E. Shannon L.M. Gumpf D.J. Colbauch P. Nature. 1974; 247: 391-392Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and PVX (35Tozzini A.C. Ek B. Palva E.T. Hopp H.E. Virology. 1994; 202: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), could be glycosylated, although the cowpea mosaic virus results have been recently challenged (36Altmann F. Lomonossoff G.P. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The saccharide chain appeared to be attached to the potato virus X CP via an O-glycosidic linkage, but a more extensive characterization of the CP sugar moieties was not done. Further work is needed to determine the extent and the relevance ofO-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, as well as the relationships between these two kinds of modifications, in the CPs of RNA viruses. O-Linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a simple monosaccharide modification that is abundant on serine or threonine residues of nuclear and cytoplasmic eukaryotic proteins (1Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar,2Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although many proteins of animal origin have been found to carry this modification, including transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, nuclear pore proteins, viral proteins, oncogene products, and tumor suppressors, very little is known about its incidence in the plant world (3Thornton T.M. Swain S.M. Olszewski N.E. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 424-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). O-GlcNAc has been suggested to be reciprocal to phosphorylation (2Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and some studies carried out on different proteins have shown that O-GlcNAc andO-phosphate alternatively occupy the same or adjacent sites. This supports the hypothesis that the saccharide could somehow be blocking phosphorylation (4Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Structural proteins from several animal viruses such as the cytomegalovirus basic phosphoprotein (5Benko D.M. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Gibson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2573-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the adenovirus fiber protein (6Mullis K.G. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Marchase R.B. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5317-5323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the baculovirus gp41 protein (7Whitford M. Faulkner P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the non-structural NS26 protein from a rotavirus (8González S.A. Burrone O.R. Virology. 1991; 182: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), have been described to be modified by O-GlcNAc, but no function for these modifications has been envisaged. Plum pox virus (PPV)1 is a member of the Potyvirus genus of plant viruses. PPV is the causal agent of sharka, a very devastating disease affecting stone fruit crops of the Prunus genus. The potyvirus genome consists of a single-stranded messenger-polarity RNA molecule of about 10 kb, with a VPg protein at its 5′ end and a poly(A) tail at its 3′ end. This genome is translated into a large polyprotein that is further processed by three virus-encoded proteases (9Revers F. Gall O.L. Candresse T. Maule A. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 366-376Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 10Riechmann J.L. Laı́n S. Garcı́a J.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The genome is encapsidated by ∼2000 units of a single type of capsid protein (CP), encoded at the 3′ end of the genome (11Shukla D.D. Ward C.W. Brunt A.A. The Potyviridae. CAB International, Cambridge1994Google Scholar) (Fig.1). The potyvirus CP is involved in cell to cell and long distance movement inside the plant. In particular, the N- and C-terminal parts of the CP are known to be involved in systemic movement (12Dolja V.V. Haldeman R. Robertson N.L. Dougherty W.G. Carrington J.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1482-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 13Dolja V.V. Haldeman-Cahill R. Montgomery A.E. Vandenbosch K.A. Carrington J.C. Virology. 1995; 206: 1007-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Moreover, the N-terminal region of the potyvirus CP, which is extremely variable among different virus species, holds an Asp-Ala-Gly (DAG) amino acid triad that is essential for aphid transmission (14Atreya C.D. Raccah B. Pirone T.D. Virology. 1990; 178: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Atreya P.L. Atreya C.D. Pirone T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7887-7891Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The CP from a potyvirus, the potato virus A (PVA), has been described recently to be phosphorylated in serine and threonine residues (16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and this modification appears to down-regulate the RNA binding function of PVA CP. In this paper we explain that PPV CP, in addition to being phosphorylated, is modified by O-linkedN-acetylglucosamination. At least one of the glycosylated residues lies at the N-terminal region of the protein, namely at a 15-amino acid sequence that is deleted in some natural non-aphid-transmissible (NAT) PPV mutants (17López-Moya J.J. Canto T. Dı́az-Ruı́z J.R. López-Abella D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Maiss E. Timpe U. Briske-Rode A. Leseman D.-E. Casper R. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is the first extensive characterization of this modification in a plant protein. DISCUSSIONSince the first description of protein glycosylation at specific serine or threonine residues by single β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties (25Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a large number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins of many eukaryotic organisms have been found to carry this modification (24Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).O-Glycosylation with terminal GlcNAc modification has been described for nuclear pore complex proteins of tobacco, but in contrast with O-GlcNAc modification of animal proteins, the size of the sugar chains of these tobacco proteins corresponded to more than five monosaccharide units, which were not further characterized (26Heese-Peck A. Cole R.N. Borkhsenious O.N. Hart G.W. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,27Heese-Peck A. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the size of one of the peptides detected by the MALDI-TOF analysis of PPV CP corresponds to a single GlcNAc modification (Figs. 3 and 4), resembling the typicalO-GlcNAc glycosylation of animal proteins. Taking into account that the sequence of the PPV CP peptide carrying the identified modification has two serine and two threonine residues, the doubly glycosylated form detected by the MALDI-TOF analysis is likely to correspond to two single O-GlcNAc modifications rather than to the attachment of two O-GlcNAc molecules to a single threonine or serine residue, although our present data do not allow us to rule out the latter possibility. The MALDI analysis did not precisely identify the O-GlcNAc-modified residues at the N-terminal region of PPV CP, although the fact that no glycosylation was detected in the 1–39 peptide of PPV-MCMV CP (Fig. 3), which conserves Ser-16, suggests that the modification could affect residues Thr-19, Thr-24, and/or Ser-25. In this regard, the YinOYang program 2R. Gupta, S. Brunak, and J. Hansen, manuscript in preparation. predicts these three residues, but not Ser-16, as putative targets for O-GlcNAc modification (data not shown).O-GlcNAc modifications of structural and non-structural proteins of animal viruses with double-stranded RNA (8González S.A. Burrone O.R. Virology. 1991; 182: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or DNA (5Benko D.M. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Gibson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, to our knowledge, PPV CP is the first protein of a plant virus and of a virus with a positive strand RNA genome, for which a typical O-GlcNAcylation has been unambiguously demonstrated. O-GlcNAc-modified proteins appear to have two common features: they are also phosphorylated, and they form reversible multimeric complexes via interactions that are regulated by phosphorylation (1Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The CP of potyviruses may exhibit both traits. Protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions have to be established and disturbed in virion assembly and RNA desencapsidation, respectively. Moreover, very recently it has been shown that phosphorylation down-regulates the RNA binding activity of the CP of a potyvirus, PVA (16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that PVA CP was phosphorylated in the infected plants, but the authors suggested that it was not phosphorylated when packaged into virions, based on the fact that disrupted particles but not intact virions could be phosphorylatedin vitro by a plant protein extract. Our immunoreaction experiments (Fig. 5) appear to indicate that PPV CP was phosphorylated at threonine and serine residues when it was assembled in virions. These data are not in conflict with those of Ivanov et al.(16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), because phosphorylation of the assembled CP might be only partial, and disassembled CP would, therefore, be susceptible to further phosphorylation. In agreement with this suggestion, the phosphorylation levels of PPV-PS and PPV-R CPs appear to be different. Probably, these differences reflect changes in the global extent of phosphorylation rather than specific features of the phosphorylation patterns, because sequence analysis showed only minor differences between PPV-PS and PPV-R CPs in the likelihood of phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues predicted by the NetPhos 2.0 program (29Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar) or in the total content of these amino acids (data not shown). The fact that the CP of PPV-CPV, which lacks the two serine and two threonine residues present in the first 39 amino acids of the CP of PPV-R, showed a phosphorylation level similar to that of this protein suggests that the contribution of these threonine and serine residues to the phosphorylation status of the CP assembled in virions is rather low.O-GlcNAcylation is known to be reciprocal to phosphorylation in many proteins; thus, O-GlcNAc residues could be protecting the N terminus of the CP, which is surface-exposed (30Shukla D.D. Strike P.M. Tracy S.L. Gough K.H. Ward C.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1497-1508Crossref Google Scholar), against phosphorylation when the CP is assembled in virions. Interestingly, six of the eight serine and threonine residues that the YinOYang program2 predicts to be able to suffer reciprocalO-GlcNAc/phosphate modifications are in the N-terminal region of the PPV-R CP (data not shown). In any case, although the simultaneous detection of O-GlcNAc modification and phosphorylation in PPV virions could be due to the presence of a mixture of molecules carrying each modification in an excluding manner, it appears more likely that CP molecules forming PPV particles could be modified with both phosphate and O-GlcNAc residues, as has been proposed for other proteins (24Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).What is the functional relevance of O-GlcNAc modifications for PPV infection? The fact that PPV-NAT, PPV-CPV, and PPV-MCMV (Fig.1) are viable indicates that O-GlcNAc-modified residues at the 13–27-amino acid segment deleted by the NAT mutation are not essential. No significant differences in infectivity or virus accumulation in herbaceous hosts have been observed between these mutant viruses and wild-type PPV under experimental conditions (data not shown). This does not preclude the possibility that some differences in adaptation to the selective pressure of their natural environment could exist among these viruses. In this regard, the fact that NAT mutants have appeared spontaneously when PPV was propagated in herbaceous plants after transfer from its natural woody host (17López-Moya J.J. Canto T. Dı́az-Ruı́z J.R. López-Abella D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Maiss E. Timpe U. Briske-Rode A. Leseman D.-E. Casper R. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggests that NAT region, and possibly its phosphorylation andO-GlcNAcylation, could be important for viral fitness, at least in some hosts. Moreover, the possibility thatO-GlcNAcylation of PPV CP is restricted to the N-terminal peptide analyzed in this work is quite unlikely, and an appropriate modification of Ser/Thr residues in other regions of the CP might be relevant for virus viability.An effect of protein phosphorylation on the stability of poliovirus capsids and its consequent involvement in viral uncoating was described some years ago (31Ratka M. Lackmann M. Ueckermann C. Karlins U. Koch G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3954-3960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation of PVA CP affects its capacity to interact with RNA, suggesting that this modification might contribute to the control of the amount of genomic RNA available for translation, replication, encapsidation, and movement (16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A similar role has been suggested for the phosphorylation of the CP of PVX (32Atabekov J.G. Rodionova N.P. Karpova O.V. Kozlovsky S.V. Novikov V.K. Arkhipenko M.V. Virology. 2001; 286: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the movement protein of TMV (33Karpova O.V. Rodionova N.P. Ivanov K.I. Kozlovsky S.V. Dorokhov Y.L. Atabekov J.G. Virology. 1999; 261: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which has been shown to modulate the effect of these proteins on translation of the genomic RNA. It would be expected thatO-GlcNAcylation, reciprocal to phosphorylation, could also play a key role in these regulatory mechanisms.O-GlcNAc modification of the capsid protein is probably not a specific feature of potyviruses. No data are available on this kind of modification in animal viruses with positive strand RNA genome. However, it has been reported that capsid proteins of some positive strand RNA viruses of plants, namely, barley stripe virus, cowpea mosaic virus (34Partridge J.E. Shannon L.M. Gumpf D.J. Colbauch P. Nature. 1974; 247: 391-392Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and PVX (35Tozzini A.C. Ek B. Palva E.T. Hopp H.E. Virology. 1994; 202: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), could be glycosylated, although the cowpea mosaic virus results have been recently challenged (36Altmann F. Lomonossoff G.P. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The saccharide chain appeared to be attached to the potato virus X CP via an O-glycosidic linkage, but a more extensive characterization of the CP sugar moieties was not done. Further work is needed to determine the extent and the relevance ofO-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, as well as the relationships between these two kinds of modifications, in the CPs of RNA viruses. Since the first description of protein glycosylation at specific serine or threonine residues by single β-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties (25Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a large number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins of many eukaryotic organisms have been found to carry this modification (24Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).O-Glycosylation with terminal GlcNAc modification has been described for nuclear pore complex proteins of tobacco, but in contrast with O-GlcNAc modification of animal proteins, the size of the sugar chains of these tobacco proteins corresponded to more than five monosaccharide units, which were not further characterized (26Heese-Peck A. Cole R.N. Borkhsenious O.N. Hart G.W. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar,27Heese-Peck A. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the size of one of the peptides detected by the MALDI-TOF analysis of PPV CP corresponds to a single GlcNAc modification (Figs. 3 and 4), resembling the typicalO-GlcNAc glycosylation of animal proteins. Taking into account that the sequence of the PPV CP peptide carrying the identified modification has two serine and two threonine residues, the doubly glycosylated form detected by the MALDI-TOF analysis is likely to correspond to two single O-GlcNAc modifications rather than to the attachment of two O-GlcNAc molecules to a single threonine or serine residue, although our present data do not allow us to rule out the latter possibility. The MALDI analysis did not precisely identify the O-GlcNAc-modified residues at the N-terminal region of PPV CP, although the fact that no glycosylation was detected in the 1–39 peptide of PPV-MCMV CP (Fig. 3), which conserves Ser-16, suggests that the modification could affect residues Thr-19, Thr-24, and/or Ser-25. In this regard, the YinOYang program 2R. Gupta, S. Brunak, and J. Hansen, manuscript in preparation. predicts these three residues, but not Ser-16, as putative targets for O-GlcNAc modification (data not shown). O-GlcNAc modifications of structural and non-structural proteins of animal viruses with double-stranded RNA (8González S.A. Burrone O.R. Virology. 1991; 182: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or DNA (5Benko D.M. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Gibson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2573-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Mullis K.G. Haltiwanger R.S. Hart G.W. Marchase R.B. Engler J.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5317-5323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Whitford M. Faulkner P. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3324-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) genomes have been described. However, to our knowledge, PPV CP is the first protein of a plant virus and of a virus with a positive strand RNA genome, for which a typical O-GlcNAcylation has been unambiguously demonstrated. O-GlcNAc-modified proteins appear to have two common features: they are also phosphorylated, and they form reversible multimeric complexes via interactions that are regulated by phosphorylation (1Hart G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 315-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The CP of potyviruses may exhibit both traits. Protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions have to be established and disturbed in virion assembly and RNA desencapsidation, respectively. Moreover, very recently it has been shown that phosphorylation down-regulates the RNA binding activity of the CP of a potyvirus, PVA (16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that PVA CP was phosphorylated in the infected plants, but the authors suggested that it was not phosphorylated when packaged into virions, based on the fact that disrupted particles but not intact virions could be phosphorylatedin vitro by a plant protein extract. Our immunoreaction experiments (Fig. 5) appear to indicate that PPV CP was phosphorylated at threonine and serine residues when it was assembled in virions. These data are not in conflict with those of Ivanov et al.(16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), because phosphorylation of the assembled CP might be only partial, and disassembled CP would, therefore, be susceptible to further phosphorylation. In agreement with this suggestion, the phosphorylation levels of PPV-PS and PPV-R CPs appear to be different. Probably, these differences reflect changes in the global extent of phosphorylation rather than specific features of the phosphorylation patterns, because sequence analysis showed only minor differences between PPV-PS and PPV-R CPs in the likelihood of phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues predicted by the NetPhos 2.0 program (29Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar) or in the total content of these amino acids (data not shown). The fact that the CP of PPV-CPV, which lacks the two serine and two threonine residues present in the first 39 amino acids of the CP of PPV-R, showed a phosphorylation level similar to that of this protein suggests that the contribution of these threonine and serine residues to the phosphorylation status of the CP assembled in virions is rather low.O-GlcNAcylation is known to be reciprocal to phosphorylation in many proteins; thus, O-GlcNAc residues could be protecting the N terminus of the CP, which is surface-exposed (30Shukla D.D. Strike P.M. Tracy S.L. Gough K.H. Ward C.W. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 1497-1508Crossref Google Scholar), against phosphorylation when the CP is assembled in virions. Interestingly, six of the eight serine and threonine residues that the YinOYang program2 predicts to be able to suffer reciprocalO-GlcNAc/phosphate modifications are in the N-terminal region of the PPV-R CP (data not shown). In any case, although the simultaneous detection of O-GlcNAc modification and phosphorylation in PPV virions could be due to the presence of a mixture of molecules carrying each modification in an excluding manner, it appears more likely that CP molecules forming PPV particles could be modified with both phosphate and O-GlcNAc residues, as has been proposed for other proteins (24Comer F.I. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29179-29182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). What is the functional relevance of O-GlcNAc modifications for PPV infection? The fact that PPV-NAT, PPV-CPV, and PPV-MCMV (Fig.1) are viable indicates that O-GlcNAc-modified residues at the 13–27-amino acid segment deleted by the NAT mutation are not essential. No significant differences in infectivity or virus accumulation in herbaceous hosts have been observed between these mutant viruses and wild-type PPV under experimental conditions (data not shown). This does not preclude the possibility that some differences in adaptation to the selective pressure of their natural environment could exist among these viruses. In this regard, the fact that NAT mutants have appeared spontaneously when PPV was propagated in herbaceous plants after transfer from its natural woody host (17López-Moya J.J. Canto T. Dı́az-Ruı́z J.R. López-Abella D. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 2293-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 18Maiss E. Timpe U. Briske-Rode A. Leseman D.-E. Casper R. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) suggests that NAT region, and possibly its phosphorylation andO-GlcNAcylation, could be important for viral fitness, at least in some hosts. Moreover, the possibility thatO-GlcNAcylation of PPV CP is restricted to the N-terminal peptide analyzed in this work is quite unlikely, and an appropriate modification of Ser/Thr residues in other regions of the CP might be relevant for virus viability. An effect of protein phosphorylation on the stability of poliovirus capsids and its consequent involvement in viral uncoating was described some years ago (31Ratka M. Lackmann M. Ueckermann C. Karlins U. Koch G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3954-3960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that phosphorylation of PVA CP affects its capacity to interact with RNA, suggesting that this modification might contribute to the control of the amount of genomic RNA available for translation, replication, encapsidation, and movement (16Ivanov K.I. Puustinen P. Merits A. Saarma M. Makinen K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13530-13540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A similar role has been suggested for the phosphorylation of the CP of PVX (32Atabekov J.G. Rodionova N.P. Karpova O.V. Kozlovsky S.V. Novikov V.K. Arkhipenko M.V. Virology. 2001; 286: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and the movement protein of TMV (33Karpova O.V. Rodionova N.P. Ivanov K.I. Kozlovsky S.V. Dorokhov Y.L. Atabekov J.G. Virology. 1999; 261: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which has been shown to modulate the effect of these proteins on translation of the genomic RNA. It would be expected thatO-GlcNAcylation, reciprocal to phosphorylation, could also play a key role in these regulatory mechanisms. O-GlcNAc modification of the capsid protein is probably not a specific feature of potyviruses. No data are available on this kind of modification in animal viruses with positive strand RNA genome. However, it has been reported that capsid proteins of some positive strand RNA viruses of plants, namely, barley stripe virus, cowpea mosaic virus (34Partridge J.E. Shannon L.M. Gumpf D.J. Colbauch P. Nature. 1974; 247: 391-392Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and PVX (35Tozzini A.C. Ek B. Palva E.T. Hopp H.E. Virology. 1994; 202: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), could be glycosylated, although the cowpea mosaic virus results have been recently challenged (36Altmann F. Lomonossoff G.P. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The saccharide chain appeared to be attached to the potato virus X CP via an O-glycosidic linkage, but a more extensive characterization of the CP sugar moieties was not done. Further work is needed to determine the extent and the relevance ofO-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation, as well as the relationships between these two kinds of modifications, in the CPs of RNA viruses.

In the present study, we found that blocking αv integrin functionality with a function-blocking monoclonal antibody or down-regulating αv integrin expression with αv-specific antisense oligonucleotides significantly decreased the levels of active p38 MAPK and inhibited cell-associated uPA expression in invasive breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. These results suggest a function link between αv integrin, p38 MAPK activity, and uPA expression in invasive tumor cells. We also found that vitronectin/αv integrin ligation specifically induced p38 MAPK activation and uPA up-regulation in invasive MDA-MB-231 cells but not in non-invasive MCF7 cells. Finally, using a panel of melanoma cells, we demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of αvintegrin subunit is required for αv integrin ligation-induced p38 MAPK activation.

Cancer (Phila.). 1997; 80: 1529-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)1 is of particular importance because uPA, through interaction with the uPA receptor (uPAR), facilitates the conversion of plasminogen into plasmin and the activation of metalloproteinases (3Collen C.

In addition, studies performed in experimental models both in vitro and in vivo demonstrate that the levels of uPA are closely associated with the degree of tumor cell invasion (14Xing R.H.

From these facts, it is apparent that uPA plays a key role in tumor progression and metastasis. Integrins are heterodimers composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits. There are at least 14 α and 8 β subunits, forming at least 21 different integrins, which are the major receptors for extracellular matrix proteins (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar). The αv integrins are a major subfamily with restricted tissue/cell distribution (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8940) Google Scholar). They have classical integrin functions such as mediating cell attachment and spreading (24Pytela R.

Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2704) Google Scholar) and promoting tumor cell survival (30Montgomery A.M.P. Reisfeld R.A. Cheresh D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, ligation of αv integrins with their ligands has been reported to regulate the expression of several metalloproteinases (MMPs) and uPA/uPAR in various cancer cell types (32Koistinen P.

Furthermore, both αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins physically interact with uPAR upon uPA ligation, and these interactions are essential for tumor progression (38Xue W. Mizukami I. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R.

Therefore, uPA/uPAR and αvintegrins may function in concert to promote tumor metastasis. The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) transduce extracellular signals into cellular responses and play important roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, cell migration, and cytoskeleton remolding (41English J.

Mammalian cells express four types of MAPKs, ERKs, p38 MAPKs, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and big MAPKs. Recent studies have shown that MAPKs including ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, and p38 can be activated by integrin ligation, and the induced MAPK activities are important for many integrin-mediated cellular responses. For example, ligation of β1 integrin with fibronectin activates ERK1/2, and this β1 integrin-induced ERK activation is essential for cell cycle progression in NIH-3T3 cells (44Zhu X. Assoian R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Ligation of α2β1 integrin with collagen induces the activation of p38 MAPK, and the activity of p38 MAPK is essential for collagen-induced collagenase-1 and -3 expression in human fibroblast cells (45Ravanti L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12266-12272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) showed that endogenous p38 MAPK activity is elevated in cultured invasive breast cancer cells and that the higher p38 MAPK activity is important for breast cancer invasiveness by stabilizing uPA mRNA. However, it is unclear what maintains the elevated endogenous p38 MAPK activity in invasive tumor cells. In this paper, we investigated the role of integrins in the constitutive p38 MAPK activity and uPA expression. In the present study, we demonstrate that blocking αv integrin ligation or down-regulating αv integrin expression decreases endogenous p38 MAPK activity and inhibits uPA expression. Plating cells on vitronectin (Vn)-coated surface activates p38 MAPK and increases uPA expression in invasive MDA-MB-231 cells but not in non-invasive MCF7 cells. These findings suggest that αv integrin ligation specifically activates p38 MAPK and up-regulates uPA expression in invasive cancer cells. In addition, we provided evidence that only the cytoplasmic tail of αv integrin subunit is important for αvintegrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation. Polyclonal antibodies to phospho-p38 and p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal antibody to uPA was obtained from American Diagonostica (Greenwich, CT). Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to β1 (P4C10), α6β4 (ASC-3), αvβ5 (P1F6), and αv (AV-1) and the non-function-blocking mAb to αv (LM142) were purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cell line were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). M21-L4, M21-L12, CS1, CS1/β3, and CS1/β5 cell lines were provided by Dr. David Cheresh (The Scripps Research Institute). All cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (high glucose) containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate for 24 h, and 20 μg/ml function-blocking mAbs (P4C10, ASC-3, P1F6 or AV-1) was then added to the cells for 8 h. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mmNa3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture). Cell lysates were boiled in nonreducing SDS sample buffer, electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The p38 MAPK and activated p38 MAPK were detected with anti-p38 and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK polyclonal antibodies, respectively. The amount of uPA was detected with an anti-uPA polyclonal antibody. We previously developed two efficient αv-specific antisense oligonucleotides (AS1 and AS2) and a non-functional control oligonucleotide (AS3) (37Huang S. Stupack D. Liu A. Cheresh D. Nemerow G.R. Oncogene. 1999; 19: 1915-1923Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sequences for AS1, AS2, and AS3 are GGGACGCCAAGCCGGGAG (nucleotide −16 to −33 relative to AUG translational start codon), AAAAGCCATCGCCGAAAG (nucleotide 9 to −8 relative to AUG translational start codon), and GGAGGCCGCGGGGACCGA (nucleotide 49 to 32 relative to AUG translational start codon), respectively. To down-regulate αv integrin expression on MDA-MB-231 cells, we added antisense oligonucleotides, AS1, AS2, or AS3 (2 nmol), into overnight MDA-MB-231 culture with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a total volume 1 ml for 36 h. Cells were lysed, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting to detect the levels of activated p38 MAPK and uPA with the respective antibodies. To determine the effect of αv integrin ligation on the activities of MAPKs, cell lines MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 were starved in serum-free medium for 24 h, and 3-cm culture dishes were coated with 1 μg/ml of Vn solution at 4 °C. Cells were detached with 10 mm EDTA, kept in suspension in serum-free medium for 30 min, and then replated onto Vn-coated culture dishes. At varying times, cells were lysed in ice-cold RIPA buffer, and cell lysates were then subjected to immunoblotting to detect the levels of activated p38 MAPK. To determine the effect of αv integrin ligation on uPA expression, MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells were plated on Vn-coated dishes and cultured for 1 or 2 days. Cells were lysed, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting to detect the levels of uPA. To prepare cells expressing the cytoplasmic tail-deleted αv integrin subunit, the expression vector pcDNA1/αvΔ995 was transfected into M21L12 cells with LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer’s protocol. The pcDNA1/αvΔ995 contains the αv integrin subunit with carboxyl-terminal deletion up to GFFKR sequence (provided by Zhuohua Zhang, Burnham Institute). Cells were selected with G418 (0.8 mg/ml) for 3 weeks, and the resistant cells were plated on a Vn-coated surface for 1 h. The attached cells were collected and selected by Vn adhesion a second time. The cells were then analyzed using flow cytometry with an αv-specific mAb (LM142, Chemicon) to confirm cell surface αv integrin expression. The established cell line was designated as M21/αvΔ995. To prepare cells expressing cytoplasmic tail-deleted β3or β5 integrin subunit, pCI/β3Δ716 or pCI/β5Δ720 were transfected in CS1 cells as described above. Plasmid pCI/β3Δ716 contains the β3integrin subunit with a carboxyl-terminal deletion ending with the sequence ALLIW, and pCI/β5Δ720 contains the β5 integrin subunit with a carboxyl-terminal deletion ending with LLAIW (provided by Glen Nemerow, Scripps Research Institute). The transfected cells were selected with G418, and the resistant cells were further selected by two rounds of Vn adhesion. The expression of cell surface αvβ3 or αvβ5 integrins was confirmed by flow cytometry using αvβ3-specific mAb (LM609, Chemicon) or αvβ5-specific mAb (P1F6, Chemicon), respectively. The new lines were designated as CS1/β3Δ716 and CS1/β5Δ720. Extracellular matrix proteins including Vn, osteopontin, fibronectin, and laminin have been reported to up-regulate uPA expression in various cell types (51Ciambrone G.J. Mckeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 6296-6301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Integrin ligation has also been shown to activate p38 MAPK in mast cells and fibroblasts (45Ravanti L. Heino J. López-Otın C. Kähari V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 46Xu J. Clark R.A. Parks W.C. Biochem.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that integrin ligation may contribute to the elevated endogenous p38 MAPK activity and up-regulated uPA expression in invasive breast cancer cells. To test this hypothesis, we treated the invasive MDA-MB-231 cells with function-blocking mAbs to β1, αv, αvβ5, and α6β4 integrins. Immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-p38 antibody showed that the levels of activated p38 MAPK were moderately inhibited by function-blocking mAb to β1integrin subunit (P1F6) and not affected by function-blocking mAbs to α6β4 integrin (ASC-3) (Fig.1 A). In contrast, function-blocking mAb to αv integrin (AV-1) and αvβ5 integrin (P1F6) significantly inhibited p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A). Because MDA-MB-231 cells expressed significant levels of each of these integrins (data not shown), these results suggest that the functionality of αv integrins is important for the sustained endogenous p38 MAPK activity in MDA-MB-231 cells. To examine further the functional correlation between αvintegrins and p38 MAPK activity, we also treated MDA-MB-231 cells with two previously developed αv-specific antisense oligonucleotides (AS1 and AS2) (37Huang S. Stupack D. Liu A. Cheresh D. Nemerow G.R. Oncogene. 1999; 19: 1915-1923Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to down-regulate αvintegrin expression. As determined by flow cytometry, AS1 and AS2 at 2 μm reduced over 80% of cell surface αvintegrin expression (data not shown). Treatment of cells with AS1 or AS2 significantly inhibited the levels of endogenous p38 MAPK activity (Fig. 1 B); in contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the non-functional AS3 displayed a similar level of p38 MAPK phosphorylation as the untreated cells (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that αv integrins are essential for elevated endogenous p38 MAPK activity in invasive breast cancer cells. We next examined the role of αv integrin on cell-associated uPA expression. Various amounts of αv integrin function-blocking mAb (AV-1) were added to cultures of attached MDA-MB-231 cells for 8 h. After treatment, the cells were lysed, and the levels of uPA were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-uPA antibody. The amount of uPA was reduced by mAb AV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. At least 80% of cell-associated uPA expression was blocked with 20 μg of AV-1 (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, a non-function-blocking mAb to αv integrins (LM142) showed no inhibitory effect on the levels of cell-associated uPA (Fig. 2 A). These data suggest that functional αv integrins are required for uPA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. In a parallel study, we also treated MDA-MB-231 cells with the αv-specific antisense oligonucleotide, AS2, or control oligonucleotide, AS3, and followed the effect on uPA expression by immunoblotting. The amount of cell-associated uPA was significantly decreased in AS2-treated cells, whereas AS3 showed no inhibitory effect on uPA levels (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these studies suggest a functional link between αv integrins, p38 MAPK activity, and uPA expression in invasive breast cancer cells. We next examined whether αv integrin ligation was capable of activating p38 MAPK in both invasive MDA-MB-231 and non-invasive MCF7 breast cancer cells. Cells were first starved overnight and then suspended in serum-free medium for 30 min to reduce endogenous p38 MAPK activity. Subsequently, we plated cells on Vn-coated surfaces for varying times (10 min to 2 h). Immunoblotting with an antibody specific to phospho-p38 MAPK showed that αv integrin ligation with Vn induced dramatic p38 MAPK phosphorylation as early as 10 min and reached maximal p38 MAPK activity at 20 min in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, αv integrin ligation did not activate p38 MAPK in non-invasive MCF7 cells (Fig. 3 B). These results suggest that αv integrin ligation may specifically induce p38 MAPK activation in invasive breast cancer cells. To examine the effect of αv integrin ligation on uPA expression, MDA-MB-231 or MCF7 cells were plated on Vn-coated plates for 1–2 days. Cells were then lysed, and the amount of uPA protein was quantitated by immunoblotting. MDA-MB-231 cells cultured on a Vn-coated surface exhibited a much higher amount of cell-associated uPA protein than those cultured on an uncoated surface (Fig.4). In contrast, no difference in the levels of uPA expression could be detected between MCF-7 cells cultured on Vn-coated and uncoated surface (Fig. 4). These results suggest that Vn may specifically induce uPA expression in invasive breast cancer cells. We also investigated the importance of αvβ3 and αvβ5integrins in Vn-induced p38 MAPK activation using human melanoma M21 and CS1 cell systems. In the M21 cell system, the M21-L12 line does not express the αv integrin subunit, thus no αvintegrin is present at the cell surface; the M21-L4 line was established by the stable transfection of the αv integrin subunit in M21-L12 cells, and this line expresses both αvβ3 and αvβ5integrins (58Chellaiah M. Fitzgerald C. Filardo E.J. Cheresh D.A. Hruska K.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2432-2440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the CS1 cell system, the CS1 line expresses neither β3 nor β5 integrin subunit; the CS1/β3 and CS1/β5 lines were created by the stable transfection of β3 subunit or β5subunit in CS1 cells, thus these lines express either αvβ3 or αvβ5integrin, respectively (59Filardo E.J. Brooks P.C. Deming S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 60Filardo E.J. Deming S.L. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1615-1622PubMed Google Scholar). Allowing M21-L4, CS1/β3, or CS1/β5 cells to attach on Vn-coated surface for 30 min resulted in a significant increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig.5, A and B). However, plating M21-L12 or CS1 cell on Vn did not lead to p38 MAPK activation (Fig. 5, A and B). These results suggest that both αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins are capable of mediating p38 MAPK activation. To determine which integrin subunit is important for p38 MAPK activation, we examined the effect of Vn on p38 MAPK activation in M21-L12 cells transfected with αv integrin subunit lacking its intracellular domain (αvΔ995). Although both this line and M21-L4 line adhered equally well to Vn (data not shown), the Vn-induced p38 MAPK activation was completely abolished in M21/αvΔ995 cells (Fig. 5 A). These results suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of αv subunit is required for αv integrin ligation-induced p38 MAPK activation. Subsequently, we also examined Vn-induced p38 MAPK activation in CS1 cells transfected with intracellular domain-lacking β3 (β3Δ716) or β5 subunit (β5Δ720) plasmids, and we found that Vn-induced p38 MAPK activation was not disabled in these two lines (Fig.5 B). These results strongly suggest that the intracellular domain (the cytoplasmic tail) of the αv subunit, rather than the intracellular domain of the β3 or β5 subunit, is essential for αvintegrin-mediated p38 MAPK activation. Our previous studies (50Huang S. New L. Pan Z. Han J. Nemerow G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12266-12272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the endogenous p38 MAPK activity is elevated in invasive breast cancer cells and that constitutive p38 MAPK activity is essential for uPA/uPAR expression and matrix invasion by breast cancer cells. However, it is not clear how elevated p38 MAPK activity is maintained in invasive breast cancer cells. Early studies (51Ciambrone G.J. Mckeown-Longo P.J. J. Biol.

Several recent studies (45Ravanti L. Heino J. López-Otın C. Kähari V.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2446-2455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 57Mainiero F. Soriani A. Strippoli R. Jacobelli J. Gismondi A. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 7-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that engaging integrins with their ligands can activate p38 MAPK in mast and fibroblast cells. These findings prompted us to investigate whether integrin ligation contributes to the elevated p38 MAPK activity in invasive breast cancer cells. We found that treatment of highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells with function-blocking mAb to αv integrins greatly reduced the level of p38 MAPK activity and uPA expression (Figs. 1 A and2 A). Similarly, down-regulating αv integrin expression with antisense oligonucleotides also significantly inhibited p38 MAPK activity and uPA expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figs.1 B and 2 B). These finding suggest a function link between αv integrin, p38 MAPK, and uPA expression in invasive breast cancer cells. Whereas αv integrins are expressed in both invasive and noninvasive breast cancer cells, we detected elevated p38 MAPK activity and uPA overproduction in most of invasive breast cancer cells but not in non-invasive cells (50Huang S. New L. Pan Z. Han J. Nemerow G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12266-12272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We thus compared the extent of αv integrin ligation-induced p38 MAPK activation and uPA up-regulation in both invasive and non-invasive cells. We have shown that plating invasive MDA-MB-231 cells on Vn-coated surface induces dramatic p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A) and up-regulates uPA expression (Fig. 4 A); in contrast, engaging αv integrins with immobilized Vn neither activated p38 MAPK (Fig. 3 B) nor induced uPA expression in non-invasive MCF7 cells (Fig. 4 B). A recent study reported that αv integrins can be present in two functional states in breast cancer cells, and only the activated state of αvintegrins is expressed in metastatic cells (61Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Functional studies further showed that only the activated αv integrins were able to promote breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis (61Felding-Habermann B. O'Toole T.E. Smith J.W. Fransvea E. Ruggeri Z.M. Ginsberg M.H. Hughes P.E. Pampori N. Shattil S.J. Saven A. Mueller B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 62Trusolino L.

Therefore, we consider the possibility that only the activated state of αv integrins is capable of mediating p38 MAPK activation and uPA up-regulation. Both integrin subunits are capable of mediating signaling events. In the present study, we have shown that only the cytoplasmic tail of αv integrin subunit is essential for Vn-induced p38 MAPK activation. A recent study (47Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kähari V.-M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) has shown that engaging the α2β1 integrin with a three-dimensional collagen gel activates p38 MAPK. In another study (49Klekotka P.A. Santora S.A. Zutter M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9503-9511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the cytoplasmic tail of α2 integrin subunit was found to be specific for collagen I-stimulated p38 MAPK activation in NmuMg cells. Furthermore, the amino acid residues essential for p38 MAPK activation are distinct from those required for ERK activation (48Klekotka P.A. Santora S.A. Wang H. Zutter M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32353-32361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We currently are investigating the role of the αv integrin cytoplasmic tail in uPA up-regulation. Substantial evidence has been generated which indicates that uPA plays an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis (3Collen C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 4Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Experimental models have also shown that inhibiting uPA function can significantly block tumor progression in animals (19Alonso D.F. Farias E.F. Ladeda V. Davel L. Puricelli L. Bal de Kier Joffe E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2006; 40: 209-223Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 20Krüger A. Soeltl R. Lutz V. Wilhelm O.G. Magdolen V. Rojo E.E. Hantzopoulos P.A. Graeff H. Gansbacher B. Schmitt M.

However, broad inhibitors of uPA (serpin) have not been considered as therapeutic agents because of their general effect on the fibrinolytic system (4Blasi F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that αv integrin expression/function is important for uPA up-regulation in invasive breast cancer cells. These findings implicate that therapeutic approaches for breast cancer may be developed by blocking αv integrin expression or function.

To further explore the involvement of p16INK4a in replicative senescence, we constructed a retroviral vector containing antisense p16INK4a, pDOR-ASp16, and introduced it into early passages of human diploid fibroblasts. The introduction of this construct significantly suppressed the expression of wild-type p16INK4a. It also imposed a finite increase in proliferative life span and significant delay of several other cell senescent features, such as cell flattening, cell cycle arrest, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase positivity. Moreover, telomere shortening and decline in DNA repair capacity, which normally accompany cell senescence, are also postponed by the ASp16 transfection. The life span of fibroblasts was significantly extended, but the onset of replicative senescence could not be totally prevented. Telomerase could not be activated even though telomere shortening was slowed. These observations suggest that the telomere pathway of senescence cannot be bypassed by ASp16 expression. These data not only strongly support a role for p16INK4a in replicative senescence but also raise the possibility of using the antisense p16INK4atherapeutically. p16INK4a, a tumor suppressor gene that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and cyclin-dependent kinase 6, is also implicated in the mechanisms underlying replicative senescence, because its RNA and protein accumulate as cells approach their finite number of population doublings in tissue culture.

Some tumor suppressors and cell cycle inhibitors are indicated to be involved in the cell senescence process. p16INK4a has been known as a tumor suppressor gene, because it was identified as a cell cycle inhibitor that negatively regulates the cell cycle kinases CDK4 and CDK6 (8Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). Its loss or inactivation has been found in a broad range of tumors (9Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Graff J.R.

Meanwhile, a substantial body of evidence suggests a role for p16INK4a in senescence of cultured cells. p16INK4a accumulation occurs in diploid fibroblasts, T-lymphocytes, keratinocytes, mammary epithelial cells, uroepithelial cells, and prostate cells as cells enter senescence. p16INK4a also can induce some features of cell senescence (6Campisi J.

Expression of p16INK4a in glioma cells, diploid fibroblasts, and squamous carcinoma cells is associated with cell flattening and expression of the senescence-associated marker, pH 6.0 optimum β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) (15Kato D. Miyazawa K. Starborg M. Wada I. Oka T. Sakai T. Peters G. Hara E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sustained p16INK4a expression can cause a prolonged growth inhibition in several tumor cell lines and can cooperate with p53 to induce apoptosis (16Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Santoni-Rugiu E. Bartek J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the actual mechanisms by which p16INK4a imposes cell senescence remain to be elucidated. A key unresolved issue is whether p16INK4a accumulation is the cause or result of cell senescence. Our studies try to address this question by sustained overexpression or inhibition of p16INK4a in human diploid fibroblasts, and further, we explore the possible regulation pathways of p16INK4a in cell senescence. Human embryonic lung diploid fibroblast 2BS cells (obtained from the National Institute of Biological Products, Beijing, China) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. All cells were grown in medium containing 100 μg/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (17Tang Z.Q. Zhang Z.Y. Zheng Y.S. Corbley M.J. Tong T.J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1994; 73: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Li J.H. Zhang Z.Y. Tong T.J. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1995; 80: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). p16INK4a cDNA in pBluescript was a kind gift from Dr. David Beach (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). The full-length p16INK4a cDNA (800 bp) was placed into the retroviral vector pDOR-neo (19Wang X. Jiang K. Ren Q. Chen P. Wang W. Tong T. Gao J. Prog. Nat. Sci. 1999; 9: 432-439Google Scholar) in both orientations. The p16 cDNA is driven by the 5′-long terminal repeat promoter, and the neoR cassette is driven by the SV40 early promoter. These two constructs were termed pDOR-p16 and pDOR-ASp16. They were transfected by Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) into 4 × 105 early passage 2BS cells (PD20) (60–70% confluence). pDOR-neo vector was also transfected as a control. The transformants, after sustained selection by G418 (400 μg/μl; Life Technologies, Inc.), were termed as 2BS/p16, 2BS/ASp16, and 2BS/neo, respectively. 10 μg of genomic DNA of each cell line, which had been digested with Hin dIII and Pst I, was used for Southern blotting. DNA was electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and hybridized to either a p16 cDNA or a neo probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by the Prime-a-Gene labeling system (Promega). The membrane was exposed to a Kodak x-ray film at −80 °C (19Wang X. Jiang K. Ren Q. Chen P. Wang W. Tong T. Gao J. Prog. Nat. Sci. 1999; 9: 432-439Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from cells by guanidinium isothiocyanate (20Liu Y. Tong T. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 445-449PubMed Google Scholar). 15-μg samples of total cellular RNA were electrophoresed on a denaturing agarose gel, blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond-N; Amersham Biosciences), and probed with p16INK4a cDNA. β-Actin was used as an internal control for normalization (19Wang X. Jiang K. Ren Q. Chen P. Wang W. Tong T. Gao J. Prog. Nat. Sci. 1999; 9: 432-439Google Scholar,20Liu Y. Tong T. Oncol. Rep. 1999; 6: 445-449PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blotting, 100 μg of cell lysates were run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and probed with anti-p16INK4a monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The signals were detected with alkaline phosphatase staining. Clones of transfected cells were obtained with G418 sustained selection. The PD number of a clone grown to about 106 cells (70–80% confluence of a 100-ml culture bottle) is about 20. Then we started to count the doubling number of transfected cells, the 2BS/ASp16 was counted as A0, the 2BS/p16 as P0, and the 2BS/neo as N0. However, the actual PD number of the transformants should be increased by 20 PD when they are compared with the untransfected cells. When cells reached 70–80% confluence, they were washed with PBS, detached with 0.25% trypsin, and fixed with 75% ethanol overnight. Samples were resuspended in 0.5 ml PBS and stained with propidium iodide in the dark for 30 min, and the DNA contents were measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan flow cytometry system. The data were analyzed using CellFIT software. Cells were washed twice in PBS, fixed for 3–5 min at room temperature in 3% formaldehyde, and washed with PBS again. Then cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C (without CO2) with freshly prepared SA-β-gal stain solution (1 mg/ml X-gal, 40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2) (21Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5651) Google Scholar). 30 μg of genomic DNA per sample was digested by restriction enzyme Eco RI, electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membrane. The membrane was baked at 80 °C and hybridized with a 5′-end [γ-32P]ATP-labeled telomeric (TTAGGG)4repeat probe. Hybridization and washing were carried out as described. The membrane was autoradiographed on Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film for 12–24 h at room temperature. The image was analyzed using NIH Image software. The mean telomere restriction fragment was defined as follows: Σ(ODi)/Σ(ODi/Li), where ODi is the densitometer output, and Li is the length of the DNA at positioni (22Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). The telomere repeat amplification protocol assay was performed with several modifications to the original protocols (23Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 92: 5147-5152Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar) to decrease false positives and effects of inhibitors of PCR amplification. Cells were lysed in CHAPS lysis buffer. The protein concentration of lysates was measured using the Bradford method. 6 μg of each cell extract were incubated initially in the presence of [γ-32P]CTP-labeled TS (5′-AATCCGTCGTCGAGCAGCAGAGAGTT-3′) oligonucleotide (0.1 μg),Taq DNA polymerase (5 units), and dNTPs (50 μmol/liter). After 2 h at 30 °C, the telomerase was inactivated at 90 °C. CX (5′-CCCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTAA-3′) oligonucleotide (0.1 μg) was then added to the reaction for 30 PCR cycles. The 6-bp ladder patterns of PCR products analyzed on 12% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gels and exposed to x-rays film indicate the telomerase activity. 105cells were inoculated into each cell culture dishes (35 mm; Costar). Monolayer cells were washed once with serum-free medium and incubated in the medium containing 0.5% serum for 3 days to reach quiescence. Cells were washed with serum-free medium containing 5 mmhydroxyurea (HU; Sigma) and incubated for 1 h. Then they were exposed to H2O2 by replacing the cultures with serum-free medium containing 200 μmH2O2 and 5 mm HU and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. H2O2-treated cells were washed once with serum-free medium containing 5 mm HU and then incubated in serum-free medium containing 5 mm HU and 1.0 mCi/ml [3H]thymidine for 10 h. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine was determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy (ls analyzer; Beckman Instruments). One of the advantages of a retroviral vector as a gene transfer vector is that it is capable of integrating into the genome of the host cells. In our study, the full length of p16INK4acDNA was inserted in both orientations into the retroviral vector. The constructs, pDOR-ASp16 and pDOR-p16, were transfected into early passage 2BS cells, respectively, and G418-resistant cell clones were obtained by sustained drug selection. Southern blot (Fig.1 A) showed neo bands in 2BS/neo (3.4 kb), 2BS/ASp16 (4.2 kb), and 2BS/p16 (4.2 kb) cells and exogenous p16INK4a bands (4.2 kb) only in 2BS/ASp16 and 2BS/p16 cells. These results suggest that the exogenous p16INK4a cDNA had integrated into the genome of 2BS cells. The mRNA expression of p16INK4a in 2BS/ASp16 (A5, PD45), 2BS/neo (N5, PD45), and middle-aged (PD40) cells are similar but higher than that in young (PD25) 2BS cells and significantly lower than that in senescent (PD58) cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1 B). Considering that the signal of p16INK4a mRNA in 2BS/ASp16 results from both wild-type p16 mRNA and ASp16 mRNA, these results indicate that the introduction of ASp16 cDNA significantly suppressed the high expression of p16INK4a in senescent cells. Western blot results (Fig. 1 C) also confirmed that the ASp16 significantly suppressed the expression of the wild-type p16INK4a in 2BS cells. Normal human diploid fibroblast 2BS cells enter a senescence state at about PD55–60. This state is characterized by irreversible growth arrest and morphologically enlarged, flattened cells with prominent lipofuscin granules. To determine the effects of the p16INK4a expression level on cell senescence, the clones of transfected cells were obtained by sustained selection with G418 after transfection of pDOR-p16 and pDOR-ASp16. They were analyzed for the relative senescence markers compared with the untransfected 2BS cell control and pDOR-neo vector-transfected cell control, all of which came from the same batch of early passage cells. The proliferative capacity declines significantly as cells senesce. To observe the proliferative changes after transfection, the growth of the transformants and the control cells were compared (Fig.2). The growth of 2BS/ASp16 (A5, PD45) cells are like young (PD24) cells, whereas the 2BS/p16 (P1, PD41) show nearly complete growth inhibition like senescent cells. As the control, transfection of pDOR-neo vector had no significant effect on the cell growth rate or the growth potential compared with the same batch of normal cells without transfection. p16INK4a can inhibit the activity of CDKs, thereby blocking the entry of proliferating cells from G1to S phase. To determine the mechanisms of the growth rate inhibition described above, the cell cycle profile was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3). In contrast to the irreversible G1 arrest imposed by pDOR-p16 transfection, pDOR-ASp16 transfection postponed the G1 irreversible arrest. Control, 2BS-neo cells had a similar percentage of cells in G1 phase as normal 2BS cells. Thus, ASp16 expression effectively delayed cell senescence by postponing the G1 arrest caused by p16INK4a accumulation. We monitored morphological changes after transfection. The 2BS/p16 cells showed increasing gross enlargement, flattening, and accumulation of granular cytoplasmic inclusions. However, no significant morphologic changes were observed in 2BS/ASp16 cells (A5, PD45), which retained a refractive cytoplasm with thin and long projections like young control cells (PD25) (Fig.4). The specific senescence-associated marker, pH 6.0 optimum β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal), was assayed by X-gal staining (Fig. 4). Only sporadic SA-β-gal-positive cells were seen in 2BS/ASp16 (A5, PD45) and young (PD29) cells, whereas almost all of 2BS/p16 (P3, PD43) cells were strongly stained, as were the senescent 2BS control cells (PD58). The replicative senescence of normal human diploid cells is directly correlated to their number of PD rather than to the growth and metabolic time (1Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5432) Google Scholar, 7Dai C.Y. Ender G.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 10Wadhwa R. Kaul S.C. Mitsui Y. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2000; 24: 191-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After completing a finite number of divisions, cells enter permanent growth arrest. We compared the PD number of the 2BS/ASp16 with 2BS/p16, 2BS/neo, and the normal control 2BS cells. The results indicate that the life span of 2BS/ASp16 (PD70–75) is about 15–20 PD greater than the 2BS/neo and normal 2BS cells (PD55–60). In contrast, 2BS/p16 ceased cell division of 10–15 PD (PD40–45) earlier than the control cells. In addition, we also found that the 2BS/ASp16 cells maintained a growth rate similar to that of young cells until they entered the growth arrest. All these results indicate that the introduction of ASp16 can enhance the replicative capacity, extend the proliferative life span, and finally delay the onset of senescence of 2BS cells. It is known that p16INK4a is one of the key components of the RB pathway (8Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar). p16INK4a can inhibit the activity of CDKs, thereby blocking the entry of the proliferating cells to S phase through the p16INK4a/CDK4/cyclin D/pRB pathway. The function of p16INK4a is to maintain pRB in its hypophosphorylated active state. Therefore, ASp16 expression is expected to increase phosphorylated pRB by inhibiting p16INK4a expression. As shown in Fig.5, pRB phosphorylation status in 2BS/ASp16 (A10, PD50) cells (lane 1) is similar to that in young cells (PD25) (lane 2), which is considerably higher than that of senescent cells (PD57) (lane 5) (p < 0.01). Thus, ASp16 likely inhibits the p16INK4a/CDK4/cyclin D/pRB pathway by inhibiting p16INK4a overexpression and by maintaining the hyperphosphorylation state of pRB. As the previous data show, although it inhibited the pRB pathway of senescence, ASp16 expression did not result in the immortality of the cells. This indicates there must be other pathways of cell senescence that could not be bypassed. Telomere shortening is considered to be a molecular clock of cell senescence (7Dai C.Y. Ender G.H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is another pathway that needs to be bypassed to escape senescence. As shown in Fig.6 A, the telomere-shortening process associated with cell senescence was significantly slowed down by ASp16 transfection whereas sustained overexpression of p16INK4a accelerated it (data not shown). This suggests that p16INK4a is involved in the telomere-shortening process. By inhibiting the p16 expression, ASp16 may slow down telomere shortening and delay the cell senescence process. Next, telomerase activity was determined for the 2BS/ASp16 cells using the telomere repeat amplification protocol assay (Fig.6 B). ASp16 did not activate observable telomerase activity. The 2BS/ASp16 cells also did not obtain the anchorage-independent growth ability, a common tumor cell phenotype (data not shown). These results indicate that 2BS/ASp16 cells did not result in the telomerase reactivation associated with immortalization or the tumor phenotypes and indicate that the delay of telomere shortening is not mediated by telomerase reactivation. Another reason for progressive shortening of telomeres is that breaks in telomere DNA induced by DNA damage cannot be repaired effectively in the absence of telomerase (22Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 27Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tried to determine whether there is any link between p16INK4a and the DNA damage and repair pathway. As shown in Fig. 7, UDS assays suggest that the DNA repair capacity of 2BS/ASp16 is similar to that of young cells but is higher than that of 2BS/neo and senescent cells (p < 0.01). This indicates that the introduction of ASp16 could enhance the DNA repair capacity of 2BS cells. A growing body of evidence suggests a role for p16INK4a in cell senescence. Its loss or inactivation is correlated to the cell immortality (28Huschtscha L.I. Reddel R.R. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Given this postulated importance of p16INK4a in cell senescence, it is expected that inhibition of p16INK4a would extend the proliferative life span of culture cells (11Brenner A.J. Stampfer M.R. Aldaz C.M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 29Noble J.R. Rogan E.M. Neumann A.A. Maclean K. Bryan T.M. Reddel R.R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1259-1268PubMed Google Scholar, 30Foster S.A. Wong D.J. Barrett M.T. Galloway D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 31Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Neumann A.A. Moy E.L. Barry P. Melki J.R. Clark S.J. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3508-3512PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, sense or antisense p16INK4a were introduced into early passage 2BS human diploid fibroblasts. Premature senescence, including irreversible cell growth arrest in G1 phase, irreversible senescent morphologic changes, and SA-β-gal expression, was imposed by overexpression of p16INK4a, whereas expression of the antisense p16INK4a delayed the onset of the cell senescence. The life span of 2BS/ASp16 is extended about 15–20 PDs compared with the untransfected 2BS or 2BS/neo control cells. The onset of many phenotypes associated with senescence, such as growth G1 arrest, accumulation of unphosphorylated pRB, SA-β-gal-positive, morphologic changes, telomere shortening, and the DNA repair capacity decline are all postponed. These data reinforce the important roles of p16INK4a in cell senescence and argue that the accumulation of p16INK4a is not a consequence of entry into senescence but rather it triggers the onset of senescence. What is the mechanism by which p16INK4a programs the cell senescence process, and why does ASp16 extend the life span of 2BS cells? Immortalization of normal human cells in vitro has been obtained by transforming genes of DNA tumor viruses such as the SV-40 large T-antigen gene (32Bryan T.M. Reddel R.R. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 331-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These genes induce immortalization indirectly via a two-stage process. The first stage (M1) is a brief extension of life span associated with inactivation of the protein products of negative regulatory genes, including the Rb and p53, after which cells cease dividing and enter “culture crisis.” The second stage (M2) is the escape of rare clones from crisis, presumably as a result of some genetic changes that might be related to the acquisition of telomerase activity (47Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Holbrook N.J. Martin G.R. Lockshin R.A. Cellular Aging and Cell Death. Wiley-Liss Inc., New York1996: 153-166Google Scholar). It is well known that p16INK4a acts as a negative regulator of cell cycle and cell proliferation. It is a key component of the p16INK4a/CDK4,6/cyclin D/pRB pathway. By inhibiting the CDK4,6·cyclin D complex, p16INK4a maintains pRB in its active state, which negatively regulates the cell cycle (8Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar, 28Huschtscha L.I. Reddel R.R. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 921-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In our studies, overexpression of p16INK4a enforced a durable block of cell proliferation whereas ASp16 inhibited the cell arrest, and pRB phosphorylation was inhibited. This suggests that pRB is required in the p16-mediated senescence and that the life span of 2BS/ASp16 cells was extended by escaping from M1 crisis, which is associated with inactivation of pRB. Beach and colleagues (49Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) used a similar strategy to express antisense p16INK4a or p19ARF (p14ARF in human) RNA in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The lifespan of MEFs was extremely extended, and a percentage of these cells eventually became immortal. Their studies suggest that p16INK4a acts through the Rb pathway whereas p19ARF acts through both the p53 and the Rb pathways. These results are consistent with our studies. The p14ARF (human counterpart of mouse p19ARF) is also encoded by the INK4a locus (overlapping in exon 2 and exon 3 with p16INK4a) and is probably also suppressed in our studies, because our constructs covered the full length of p16INK4acDNA. Therefore, both the Rb and the p53 pathways could have contributed to the bypass of the first stage (M1) of cell senescence in this study. The p14ARF status in 2BS/ASp16 cells is currently under investigation in our laboratory. However, in our studies, no immortalization was observed in 2BS cells by inactivation of p16INK4a whereas it was observed in MEFs (45Oshimura M. Barrett J.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 710-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Why is there a difference between human cells and mouse cells? Besides the genetic programming hypothesis of senescence, progressive telomere shortening has been regarded as a molecular “clock,” one of several pathways regulating cellular senescence in human cells (22Harley C.B. Futcher A.B. Greider C.W. Nature. 1990; 345: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar, 25Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 26Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Science. 2001; 291: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,48Sherr C.J. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 407-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Human cells use shortening of telomeres with each cell division to count the number of cell divisions they have undergone and stop dividing after 50 to 90 doublings. Rodent cells, however, do not seem to have a similar cell division-counting mechanism. The telomere length in mouse cells is 40–150 kb, which is much longer than human telomeres (5–20 kb). Their telomerase activity is less stringently repressed, and mouse somatic cells stop dividing after 10–15 population doublings, long before significant telomere erosion occurs (26Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Science. 2001; 291: 839-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This may explain why the inactivation of p16INK4a and/or p19ARF leads to immortalization in mouse (49Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) but not in human cells. Thus, the immortalization of MEFs by expressing antisense p16INK4a and/or p19ARF RNA (49Carnero A. Hudson J.D. Price C.M. Beach D.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) after bypassing M1 may not need to overcome the M2 barrier, whereas in human 2BS cells, overcoming of telomere shortening is required for the immortalization. Some studies suggest that the increasing levels of p16INK4amay be caused by progressive telomere shortening (8Serrano M. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (3364) Google Scholar, 33Palmero I. McConnell B. Parry D. Brookes S. Hara E. Bates S. Jat P. Peters G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but our data suggest p16INK4a may actually regulate the telomere-shortening process. Previous research in our lab suggested that p16INK4a introduction significantly induced telomere shortening. In this study, we also found that the introduction of ASp16 slowed telomere shortening, further supporting the role of p16INK4a in regulating telomere shortening. However, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Telomerase appears to be important for telomere maintenance in many immortal cell lines (23Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B.

To further explore the mechanisms by which ASp16 slows telomere shortening, we tested whether 2BS cells obtained telomerase activity after the introduction of ASp16, but no telomerase activity was detectable. Thus, the slow-down of telomere shortening is probably not achieved by activating telomerase even though some studies suggest a relationship between p16INK4a and telomerase (39Sawa H. Kamada H. Ohshima T.A. Noguchi A. Itoh N. Saruta K. Hara M. Saito I. J. Neurooncol. 1999; 42: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This may explain why 2BS/ASp16 cells were not immortal; the telomeres kept shortening progressively even though the process had been slowed down. Without sufficient telomerase activity, cells cannot escape the secondary stage of mortality (M2). Still, there may be other mechanisms to control the telomere shortening. How does p16INK4a affect telomere shortening? Our studies suggest that the introduction of ASp16 delayed the decrease of the DNA repair capacity of 2BS cells (Fig. 7). In addition, previous studies from our laboratory also showed that the introduction of p16INK4a induced a decrease of DNA repair capacity. All these results suggest that p16INK4a correlates with DNA damage and repair. Therefore, there might be links among the DNA repair, telomere shortening, and the control of p16INK4agene expression. p16INK4a may be a common mediator among several cell senescence models, such as DNA damage model, genetic model, and telomere model. However, it is worth emphasizing that the UDS assay is only a gross estimate of DNA-repair capacity. Some factors can affect the accuracy of the assay, including proliferative status. Further observations should be done, and assays that are more accurate need to be developed. In addition, it has been proposed that there may be more than one mitotic clock mechanism, and any of them may trigger the cell senescence. Some studies also show that there are alternative mechanisms such as gene recombination and transfer and retrotransposition for the maintenance and repair of telomeres (40Wang S.S. Zakian V.A.

Thus, p16 may also influence the telomere shortening through these mechanisms. In summary, there are several independent pathways that control the process of replicative senescence in human cells. The inactivation of one pathway can induce extension of cell life span but may not be sufficient to induce immortalization (45Oshimura M. Barrett J.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 1997; 33: 710-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 46Hard E. Tsurui H. Shinozaki A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cellular senescencein vitro may represent the aging process at the cellular level, and it is one possible mechanism of tumor suppression in vivo. Therefore, it may be possible to use ASp16 therapeutically in both aging and tumor suppression. Further insight into the molecular mechanisms by which ASp16 affects replicative senescence should greatly help in understanding and preventing aging and tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2161568820,"Chronic stimulation of cardiac beta1-adrenergic receptors contributes to disease progression and mortality in patients and animal models of heart failure. To search for the mechanism of adrenergic impairment of cardiac function in vivo, we studied transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of beta1-adrenergic receptors. Transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of beta1-adrenergic receptors showed progressive left ventricular fibrosis starting at 4 months of age. Left ventricular catheterization revealed a modest enhancement of contractility and relaxation at 2 months of age, followed by progressive dysfunction in both parameters and ultimately cardiac failure. When the effects of endogenous catecholamines were blocked by the b-receptor antagonist propranolol, maximal rate of contractility (dp/dtmax) and maximal rate of relaxation (dp/dtmin) were significantly blunted in 2-month-old beta1-receptor transgenic mice. Isolated cardiomyocytes from these animals displayed markedly altered calcium transients with significant prolongation of the intracellular calcium transient compared with nontransgenic littermates. We determined the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum proteins involved in calcium handling by RNase protection assay and by immunoblotting. Although the expression of calsequestrin, triadin, and phospholamban was not altered, we observed a progressive decrease in junctin abundance in beta1-receptor transgenic mice (Pbeta1-adrenergic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2096935244,"The regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, the universal chromophore of the vertebrate retina, is a complex process involving photoreceptors and adjacent retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). 11-cis-Retinal is coupled to opsins in both rod and cone photoreceptor cells and is photoisomerized to all-trans-retinal by light. Here, we show that RPE microsomes can catalyze the reverse isomerization of 11-cis-retinol to all-trans-retinol (and 13-cis-retinol), and membrane exposure to UV light further enhances the rate of this reaction. This conversion is inhibited when 11-cis-retinol is in a complex with cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP), providing a clear demonstration of the protective effect of retinoid-binding proteins in retinoid processes in the eye, a function that has been long suspected but never proven. The reverse isomerization is nonenzymatic and specific to alcohol forms of retinoids, and it displays stereospecific preference for 11-cis-retinol and 13-cis-retinol but is much less efficient for 9-cis-retinol. The mechanism of reverse isomerization was investigated using stable isotope-labeled retinoids and radioactive tracers to show that this reaction occurs with the retention of configuration of the C-15 carbon of retinol through a mechanism that does not eliminate the hydroxyl group, in contrast to the enzymatic all-trans-retinol to 11-cis-retinol reaction. The activation energy for the conversion of 11-cis-retinol to all-trans-retinol is 19.5 kcal/mol, and 20.1 kcal/mol for isomerization of 13-cis-retinol to all-trans-retinol. We also demonstrate that the reverse isomerization occurs in vivo using exogenous 11-cis- retinol injected into the intravitreal space of wild type and Rpe65−/− mice, which have defective forward isomerization. This study demonstrates an uncharacterized activity of RPE microsomes that could be important in the normal flow of retinoids in the eye in vivo during dark adaptation."
https://openalex.org/W2029372864,"It has long been assumed that iron regulates the turnover of ferritin, but evidence for or against this idea has been lacking. This issue was addressed using rat hepatoma cells with characteristics of hepatocytes subjected to a continuous influx of iron.

Radioactivity in ferritin/ferritin subunits of cell heat supernatants was determined by autoradiography of rockets obtained by immunoelectrophoresis or after precipitation with ferritin antibody and SDS-PAGE. Both methods gave similar results. During the +FAC chase, the concentration of ferritin in the cells increased linearly with time. Without FAC, the half-life of 35S-ferritin was 19–20 h; with FAC there was no turnover. Without FAC, the iron in ferritin had an apparent half-life of 20 h; in the presence of FAC there was no loss of 59Fe. Without FAC, concentrations of ferritin iron and protein also decreased in parallel.

Almost ubiquitous in living organisms, ferritins also provide a means of rapidly sequestering iron ions that might otherwise promote the formation of reactive oxygen species. Each ferritin molecule can hold thousands of iron atoms in innocuous form. In addition, iron influx stimulates the synthesis of ferritin protein, so that additional sites for non-toxic iron storage are available. The response of ferritin synthesis to iron influx is also exceptionally rapid, because it is mainly translational and utilizes existing mRNA for ferritin (rather than additional ferritin gene transcription, which would take more time) (1Drysdale J.W. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3630-3637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zahringer J. Baliga B.S. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism by which iron regulates ferritin mRNA translation, involving an iron-responsive element (IRE)1 in the 5′-untranslated region (4Leibold E.A. Munro H.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2171-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 5Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar), led to the further discovery of IREs in other proteins of iron metabolism and the identification of IRE-binding proteins (IRP1 and IRP2), which coordinately regulate iron metabolism in cells (5Klausner R.D. Rouault T.A. Harford J.B. Cell. 1993; 72: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 6Theil E.C. Biofactors. 1993; 4: 87-95PubMed Google Scholar, 7Leibold E.A. Guo B. Annu. Rev.

Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This opened a window of understanding into new (non-transcriptional) ways in which cellular processes can be regulated. The ferritin response to iron influx can thus be viewed as a protective rapid response system, allowing immediate formation of additional ferritin in which to store the additional iron. Elucidation of the mechanisms involved has (rightfully) preoccupied the field of ferritin research for some time. This may in part account for the dearth of information on turnover of ferritin, where much has remained unexamined. If ferritin is to function as a protective mechanism for storage of excess iron, it also would make sense for iron to reduce ferritin protein degradation, so that ferritin molecules would be preserved for iron binding. Accumulation of proteins can occur not just through stimulation of synthesis but also through inhibition of their degradation. Thus, for example, arginase (12Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3808-3815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tryptophan oxygenase (13Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 322-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) accumulate through stabilization when needed. In the latter case, substrate stabilization (by tryptophan) is involved (13Schimke R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 322-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So it would not be surprising to find that iron stabilizes ferritin. However, the matter has not been adequately studied, and the few reports that have examined the issue have given conflicting results. In the seminal original report of Drysdale and Munro (1Drysdale J.W. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3630-3637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who first alerted the field to translational regulation of ferritin by iron, some data on the turnover of ferritin were included but were difficult to interpret. In these studies, ferritin was followed in the livers of rats that were and were not treated with iron during the turnover phase of 3 days. Not only was there little or no information on the variability of the data, but assuming that they were not variable, one could draw the conclusion that iron treatment can both enhance and hinder ferritin protein turnover. Later studies by Treffrey et al. (14Treffry A. Lee P.J. Harrison P.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 165: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), also in rats that were and were not treated with iron (400 μg/100 g body weight) at 12-h intervals, suggested that iron treatment made no difference. Based upon data for groups of four rats at 3 time points, the half-life of [14C]HCO 3−-labeled liver ferritin, with and without iron, was about 70 h. The report of Khogo et al. (15Khogo Y. Tokota M. Drysdale J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5195-5200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which focused on the synthesis and turnover of different isoforms of liver ferritin, did include turnover data for a few rats given and not given two iron injections (over 70 h). They used the double radioisotope injection approach and found that ratios of 14C to 3H radioactivity in ferritin (derived from injection of radioactive leucine 2 and 67 h before sacrifice, respectively) were somewhat higher in the iron-treated rats, suggesting a faster rate of turnover. (However, the data were highly variable and could not be analyzed statistically.) Whole animal studies have the inherent difficulty of maintaining elevated intracellular labile iron pools, and it would seem logical that elevated pools would need to be maintained to demonstrate that iron is (or is not) influencing ferritin turnover. Thus, cultured cells might provide a better means of testing the possibility that iron plays such a role. In one report, cultured K562 cells were used to examine ferritin turnover (16Roberts S. Bomford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19181-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but in this case the effect of iron depletion rather than enhanced iron influx was tested. This study was not entirely satisfactory with regard to turnover in other ways as well. There was no information on the variability and replicability of the results, and the time period examined was so short that relatively little turnover of ferritin actually occurred. The data, however, suggested that iron deficiency, induced by deferoxamine, enhanced the rate of ferritin protein turnover, so that conversely one might surmise that iron inhibits turnover. Data on the effects of deferoxamine on ferritin concentrations in L-6 skeletal muscle myoblasts (17Rittling S.R. Woodworth R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5561-5566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were consistent with this concept. An enhancement of turnover by iron depletion was also implied by data from studies in which the concentrations of ferritin (H and L subunits), in developing erythroid cells in culture, were followed during the period of hemoglobin accumulation (which would use the ferritin iron). A reciprocal relationship was observed (18Vaisman B. Meyron-Holtz E.G. Fibach E. Krichevsky A.M. Konijn A. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In the studies presented here, a rat hepatoma cell line that we have verified has many of the characteristics of normal hepatocytes (19Tran T.N. Eubanks S. Linder M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to study ferritin protein turnover and the loss of ferritin iron in the presence and absence of ferric ammonium citrate in the culture medium. The results show unequivocally that iron can completely block turnover of ferritin and suggest that, at least in the case of the59Fe-labeled ferritin present in these cells (made in response to iron), the iron and protein portions of the ferritin may turn over together. Rat hepatoma H4-II-E-C3 cells purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% horse and 5% fetal bovine serum, as described previously (19Tran T.N. Eubanks S. Linder M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at 90% confluency were cultured overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% serum (horse/fetal bovine 3:1) containing iron (FAC, 180 μm) to stimulate ferritin synthesis, then pulsed for 60 min with [35S]Met (50 μCi/ml; ICN Nutritional Biochemicals; Costa Mesa, CA) in Met-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with FAC, and (after rinsing) then chased by culturing in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with no serum) containing either FAC or deferoxamine mesylate (100 μm; Sigma). The +FAC medium was changed after 12 h, or additional FAC was added, to make sure iron concentrations were maintained. Cells were harvested with trypsin, homogenized, and heated to 70 oC for 10 min, as described previously (19Tran T.N. Eubanks S. Linder M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), to obtain heat supernatants that were used to determine radioactivity in ferritin. Aliquots of homogenate were used to determine radioactivity in total protein, and the total protein content of each flask was assayed by the Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad), using bovine serum albumin as the standard, all as described previously (19Tran T.N. Eubanks S. Linder M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Values for radioactivity in ferritin and total protein are given as cpm/106 cells, based upon a cell protein content of 0.7 mg of protein/106 cells, determined previously (19Tran T.N. Eubanks S. Linder M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or as percent of control (first time point after the pulse) within the same experiment. Portions (5-μl duplicates) of cell homogenate were spotted on Whatman GF/C Glass Microfibre filters (Maidstone, UK), washed twice in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 65 °C, rinsed in 80% ethanol, dried, and counted for radioactivity with scintillation fluid, as described for samples of immunoprecipitates. This proceeded exactly as described for turnover of ferritin protein, except that the cells were labeled with 59Fe (1 μCi/ml as FeSO4; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) instead of [35S]Met, and this occurred during the overnight exposure of cells to FAC, prior to the turnover studies. Ferritin was precipitated from heat supernatants by two different procedures. (a) Rocket immunoelectrophoresis was performed on 6-μl aliquots, as described previously (19Tran T.N. Eubanks S. Linder M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using rabbit polyclonal anti-horse spleen ferritin (Sigma) in gels made with 1% low melting point analytical grade agarose (Promega, Madison, WI). Radioactivity in the tips of the rockets was determined by autoradiography and densitometry, using the Packard Cyclone Storage Phosphor Imager System (Meriden, CT), background densities subtracted being those obtained for equal areas directly above each rocket. Concentrations of ferritin in the cells were obtained from the areas of the rockets, as described previously (19Tran T.N. Eubanks S. Linder M.C. Blood. 1997; 90: 4979-4986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). (b) Direct immunoprecipitation was carried out on portions of heat supernatant corresponding to 67% of the cell homogenate, pretreating with protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h, followed by overnight incubation of supernatants with 30 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-human ferritin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and then tumbling with protein A beads (for 2 h), all at 4 °C. Protein in the twice-washed pellets (washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.14 m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.4, with HCl) was dissolved by heating to 100 °C with 15 μl of 4× sample buffer (40% glycerol, 8% SDS, 20% 2-mercaptoethanol, 4.6 mm bromphenol blue, 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), total volume of 60 μl, and centrifuged. A 10-μl aliquot was counted directly for radioactivity, using Ecoscint H scintillation fluid (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) and a Beckman scintillation counter (LS 6500; Fullerton, CA) for35S, and no scintillation fluid and a gamma counter (Packard Auto-gamma Cobra II; Meriden, CT) in the case of59Fe. Most of the remaining solution (39 μl) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, in 1.5-mm minigels, using the Bio-Rad Mini PROTEAN3 Cell electrophoresis system, as described previously (20Cerveza P.J. Cotton S.J. Mehrbod F. Hazegh-Azam M. Williams P. Fonda E.G. Wickler S.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Stained gels (Brilliant Blue R Staining solution; Sigma) were dried on a Bio-Rad gel dryer and subjected to autoradiography and densitometry, as described for the rocket immunoelectrophoresis plates. Densitometry was recorded in Digital-Light Units and expressed as per 106 cells, based on cell protein assays. This was determined with bathophenanthroline disulfonate (21James W. Zak B. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1958; 29: 590-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), using heat supernatants of cell homogenates, which contained only ferritin iron (established by immunoprecipitation). To study the turnover of ferritin protein and its subunits, and the effect of iron on this process, cells were pretreated overnight with FAC to stimulate ferritin synthesis and accumulation and then pulsed for 60 min with [35S]Met (in Met-free medium), after which radioactivity in ferritin was followed for 29–30 h. Two methods were employed to follow the loss of radioactivity in ferritin protein over time, which gave comparable results. In one case, the radioactivity in ferritin was separated from that in other proteins by subjecting samples of heat supernatants, obtained from cell homogenates, to rocket immunoelectrophoresis, with specific ferritin antibody in the gel, and measuring the radioactivity in the rockets by densitometry of autoradiographs (see “Experimental Procedures”). In the other case, heat supernatants were precipitated with ferritin antibody and protein A beads, and radioactivity in the washed solubilized precipitates was determined by direct counting and by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE. Examples of data obtained by both techniques are given in Fig.1. Fig. 1A shows a sample autoradiograph of ferritin immunoelectrophoresis rockets for sets of three different cultures obtained at two different time points (6 and 30 h) after incorporation of [35S]Met into ferritin. As shown here, radioactivity in the actual rockets (as opposed to residual activity in the wells) clearly decreased with time, and this was quantitated by densitometry in the PhosphorImager (see “Experimental Procedures”). (Radioactive iron in ferritin was also detectable and quantifiable by this method (Fig. 1B).) Fig. 1C shows an example of a portion of an autoradiograph and corresponding stained gel obtain with immunoprecipitates subjected to SDS-PAGE, again showing triplicate sets of samples from two different time points (6 and 30 h). The radioactive L and H subunits (left part of figure) are clearly visible and are virtually the only bands on the gel. (Note that radioactivity in the H subunits disappeared more rapidly (see below).) The stained gel (shown on the right) also shows the H and L subunits, along with the immunoglobulin subunits in the immunoprecipitate. Radioactivity in the immunoprecipitates was quantitated directly, as well as by autoradiography, to determine rates of ferritin turnover. As shown in Fig. 1D, rates of turnover were very similar when determined by the two methods. During a 27-h “chase,” after labeling the ferritin with [35S]Met, there was a substantial loss of radioactivity in ferritin. The upper curve was obtained from the rockets and the lower curvefrom direct counting of immunoprecipitates. The data fit first order curves, and the half-life values obtained by both procedures were about 20 h. By using both methods, the effects of having iron in the culture medium during the chase period was examined and compared with that for cells cultured in the absence of FAC during the chase. In the case of the iron-treated cultures, new FAC was added at about the half-way point (12–13 h after the [35S]Met pulse) to make certain there was excess iron available throughout. The data in Fig.2A show that iron was continuing to enter the cells throughout the treatment period, because there was a linear increase in cellular ferritin concentration with time. In contrast, the cells not “chased” with iron in the medium decreased their content of ferritin. (There was deferoxamine in the −FAC medium, which would remove extra iron.) Fig. 2B shows that the presence of iron during the chase phase (+FAC) completely prevented turnover of the ferritin protein. There was no loss of [35S]Met radioactivity that had been incorporated during the pulse. This contrasted with a loss of more than half of the radioactivity in cells cultured without FAC (Fig.2B, −FAC), as already described. Thus, iron had a marked stabilizing effect on ferritin protein. Fig. 2Cshows that iron had no significant effect on the turnover of cell protein as a whole. Radioactivity in total cell protein decreased 10–20% over the period examined, whether or not cells were cultured with added FAC. Thus, in the absence of added iron and presence of deferoxamine, ferritin was turning over faster than hepatoma cell protein as a whole. Radioactivity in ferritin represented from 0.4 to 0.8% of the total radioactivity in cell protein (0.6 ± 0.1%; mean ± S.D., n = 9). Based on examination of the SDS-PAGE autoradiographs (for example, Fig. 1C, showing data for 6 and 30 h), it appeared that ferritin rich in H subunits was turning over a bit faster than that rich in L subunits. Radioactivity in the two subunits was about equal soon after the pulse, but little remained in the H subunit at the end of the period examined. In separate experiments, the release of 59Fe from ferritin was also followed and compared with the turnover of ferritin protein measured in parallel cultures. The iron in ferritin was labeled by exposing cells to tracer 59Fe overnight, during the pretreatment with FAC. The data in Fig. 3 show that measured this way, turnover of 35S and 59Fe in the ferritin was the same. In cells cultured without added FAC, the59Fe in ferritin decreased markedly and exponentially during the period examined (Fig. 3A), with an apparent half-life of about 20 h. Data obtained on the same samples by the immunoprecipitation method confirmed there was a large difference in radioactivity in ferritin, with and without FAC, a 2.5-fold difference at 30 h. Fig. 3B shows that the pattern of decrease in35S-labeled ferritin was identical. The 35S half-life of 19 h calculated was the same as that described for the earlier experiments (Figs. 1D and 2B). Thus, the protein and iron portions of the ferritin appeared to be turning over at the same rate. The continuing presence of iron in the medium during the period in which turnover of ferritin was examined prevented not just the turnover of ferritin protein but also prevented the release of iron from ferritin. No 59Fe was lost from the ferritin in those cultures where iron continued to be present in the medium (+FAC, Fig. 3A). As before, there was no effect of iron treatment on 35S radioactivity in total cell protein (data not shown). The actual iron content of the ferritin and the rate of loss of actual ferritin iron and protein (not measured with 35S) in the absence of FAC were also measured and calculated. The iron content of the ferritin was constant during the turnover phase from 6 to 30 h. It averaged 0.15 μg of Fe/μg of protein (± 0.05; mean ± S.D.; n = 12), a typical value for intracellular liver ferritin (22Linder M.C. Moor J.R. Scott L.E. Munro H.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 297: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and was identical to that determined on ferritin isolated from these hepatoma cells in separate studies. 2P. Nguyen and M. C. Linder, unpublished data. The concentration of ferritin in the cells and the ferritin iron declined in parallel. In this set of experiments, a linear extrapolation of the data indicated that all of the ferritin would be gone by about 50 h. On the basis of an exponential decline, a half-life of 23 h was calculated. Thus, the rate of decline in actual ferritin concentration was almost the same as the rate of ferritin degradation determined with35S. This implies that without continued FAC and with deferoxamine, the cells were mainly degrading ferritin, and there was relatively little (if any) new synthesis of ferritin occurring. This also implies that the iron released from ferritin was being removed from the pool that would otherwise allow its reincorporation into ferritin (and other iron proteins), presumably by binding to deferoxamine. Our results show unequivocally that iron can completely inhibit the turnover of ferritin protein. In hepatic cells, which are important for iron storage and metabolism and where ferritin iron and protein turnover have been the most studied in vivo, we were able to block completely the loss of radioactive methionine from ferritin (indicative of degradation) by maintaining a high iron content in the cell medium. During their iron exposure, cells were continuing to produce extra ferritin because there was an ongoing increase in cellular ferritin. This verifies that iron was continuing to enter the cells at levels above the normal during the culture (chase) period examined, when ferritin turnover was blocked. In contrast, ferritin protein turned over fairly rapidly in cells where FAC was no longer in the medium, and deferoxamine was present to prevent further iron influx. (In those cells, ferritin levels did not rise and in fact fell over time.) The half-life values of 19–20 h obtained are not very different from the 12-h value reported previously for cultured K562 cells (16Roberts S. Bomford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19181-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The turnover was, however, considerably more rapid than that measured in vivo by us (18Vaisman B. Meyron-Holtz E.G. Fibach E. Krichevsky A.M. Konijn A. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and others (14Treffry A. Lee P.J. Harrison P.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 165: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 23Ove P. Obenrader M. Lansing A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 277: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) for livers of male and female rats, where half-lives ranged from 1.9 to 4 days. Our data indicating that H-rich ferritin was turning over more rapidly than L-rich ferritin agree with the earlier report of Khogoet al. (15Khogo Y. Tokota M. Drysdale J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5195-5200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who examined liver ferritin isoforms in rats. It contrasts with reports for erythroid cells (16Roberts S. Bomford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19181-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Vaisman B. Meyron-Holtz E.G. Fibach E. Krichevsky A.M. Konijn A. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), where L and H subunits appeared to be turning over at the same rate. Our additional finding that iron treatment also prevented release of ferritin iron has several implications as well. The observation that the iron in ferritin was being released (or not being released) in parallel with the turnover of the protein portion of ferritin suggests that these two parts of ferritin might be degraded together. In other words, degradation of the protein part of ferritin might accompany the release of its iron or vice versa. In the absence of continued iron influx (and presence of deferoxamine), 59Fe was released at the same rate as ferritin protein was being degraded. With additional iron influx, there was no release of iron or degradation of ferritin protein. Thus, the two phenomena appeared to be coordinated. This was also seen when the declines in cellular concentrations of ferritin iron and protein were determined and compared; they decreased in parallel. Moreover, the rate of decline (based on exponential calculations) was very close to that of actual ferritin protein turnover measured with35S, 23 versus 19–22 h. Most of the ferritin being degraded was that which had been synthesized during the overnight exposure to ferric ammonium citrate and59Fe. During that period, it seems that the59Fe in ferritin achieved a kind of “equilibration” with the non-radioactive iron in ferritin, so that it “turned over” in the same manner as ferritin protein during the degradative phase. Thus, we can imagine that during the overnight labeling, there was incorporation of 59Fe into ferritin molecules of a variety of “ages” and therefore stages of core formation. The loss of59Fe from this “mixed core” population was then followed and found to have the same half-life as that of ferritin protein. The 59Fe in ferritin iron cores did not leave more rapidly than the protein was degraded, implying that it was released in coordination with ferritin degradation (perhaps in lysosomes). In vivo as well as in vitro, the “last in” atoms of iron in the cores would have to be released first, but in vivo, dissolution of the whole cores could be very rapid. (Indeed, it is known that once proteins have entered lysosomes, their degradation is accomplished within minutes (24Mortimore G.E. Lardeux B.R. Adams C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2505-2512Google Scholar).) The rate of decline in actual ferritin iron and protein concentrations may have been a little slower than that of radiolabeled ferritin, although it seems unlikely that the difference in apparent half-life (23 versus 19–22 h) was really significant. Assuming that it was, the difference would indicate that, although degradation was clearly predominating, there was nevertheless also some continued synthesis of new ferritin. A slightly slower fall in ferritin iron (versus the release of 59Fe from prelabeled ferritin iron cores) cannot be explained on the basis that the59Fe in ferritin was actually “chased out” of the cores (because the last atoms in are the first out; see Ref. 25Treffry A. Harrison P.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 857-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, it might indicate that iron released from 59Fe-rich ferritin was preferentially lost from the cell, over less 59Fe-rich iron associated with other cell proteins, and that the latter was incorporated into the new ferritin still being made. Iron released from degradation of ferritin protein might thus preferentially be available for binding and sequestration by deferoxamine. Overall, the data seem most consistent with the concept that there is coordination of turnover of ferritin iron and protein and that release of ferritin iron may depend upon degradation of the protein, at least in this cell type under the conditions examined. If degradation of the ferritin protein “shell” is necessary for the release of iron from ferritin in vivo, ferritin degradation may be occurring in the lysosomes. Indeed, studies by two different research groups, with fibroblasts (26Radisky D.C. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and K562 cells (27Kahklon O. Gruenbaum Y. Cabantchik Z.I. Blood. 2001; 97: 2863-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), have implicated lysosomes in ferritin turnover. Although ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis has dominated more recent work on cellular protein degradation, it has long been known that lysosomes account for the bulk of cellular protein degradation (28Ahlberg J. Berkenstam A. Henell F. Glaumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5847-5854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Mortimore G.E. Poso A.R. Lardeux B.R. Diabetes Metab.

Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), including degradation of cytosolic proteins. Several pathways for entry of cytosolic proteins into lysosomes have been identified (28Ahlberg J. Berkenstam A. Henell F. Glaumann H. J. Biol.

Gerontol. 1998; 35: 119-131Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar), including a specific mechanism involving the recognition of KFERQ-like sequences in the protein target, plus cytosolic and lysosomal chaperones and a receptor (31Cuervo A.M.

Coordinate degradation of ferritin protein and release of its iron may, however, not occur in all cell types, as the turnover of ferritin iron in K562 cells appeared to be accelerated by deferoxamine treatment, whereas that of ferritin protein appeared to be unchanged (16Roberts S. Bomford A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19181-19187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (However, the changes reported in those studies were small and could not be evaluated statistically.) Regarding earlier reports of studies in whole animals in which iron treatment failed to inhibit ferritin turnover (14Treffry A. Lee P.J. Harrison P.M. FEBS Lett. 1984; 165: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) or provided evidence for both stimulation and stabilization of ferritin by iron (1Drysdale J.W. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3630-3637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the first was based on a single experiment with four rats at 3 time points, and the second on even fewer data points and no evidence on replicability. Nevertheless, the original study of Drysdale and Munro (1Drysdale J.W. Munro H.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3630-3637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) did conclude that iron stabilizes ferritin, and this is what we have now clearly demonstrated."

Family members are easily identified by amino acid sequence alignments due to their high degree of structural conservation. The serpin tertiary structure consists of three β-sheets, approximately nine α-helices, and several loops that are arranged into a metastable conformation. Serpins employ a unique suicide-substrate-like inhibitory mechanism to neutralize their target proteinases. The mobile reactive site loop (RSL), which is perched on the surface of the molecule, serves as the pseudo-substrate and binds to the active site of the proteinase. Upon RSL cleavage, the serpin undergoes a major conformational rearrangement that traps the proteinase in a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate (2Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar).

Unlike the canonical serpin α1-antitrypsin (SERPINA1), members of the ov-serpin subfamily lack both classic N-terminal signal peptides and long N- and C-terminal extensions.

By simple electronic hybridization using the BLAST algorithm, we identified two new human ov-serpin genes,SERPINB11 and SERPINB12, that were not detected by the available gene prediction programs. In this manuscript, we report the cloning and expression of SERPINB12. SERPINB12 encodes for a 405-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of ∼46 kDa. SERPINB12 is widely expressed in many human tissues and is a potent inhibitor of trypsin-like serine proteinases. The SERPINB12 cDNA containing the putative open reading frame was amplified as described previously (14Silverman G.A. Jockel J.I. Domer P.H. Mohr R.M. Taillon M.P. Korsmeyer S.J.

The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and analyzed using an PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (ABI, Foster City, CA) and the automated DNA sequencing facility of the Mental Retardation Research Center, Children's Hospital (Boston, MA). Sequences were analyzed using MacVector 6.0 (Accelrys Inc., Princeton, NJ), ClustalW 1.8 (15Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar) and BLAST programs (National Center For Biotechnology Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). cDNA prepared from 26 tissues (multiple tissue cDNA panels, CLONTECH) was assayed for SEPINB12 transcripts by nested PCR. Initially, samples were assayed using the SERPINB12-specific primers, forward 2 (5′-CAAGGAACTCTTCAGCAAGG-3′) and reverse 1. For added specificity, the resulting 721-bp fragment was re-amplified using internal primers (forward 3, 5′-GAGTGTGAAGATGATGACGC-3′; reverse 2, 5′-TTTGGGTTTTGTTGTGTCTAAT-3′). The size of the nested PCR product was 527 bp. To control for integrity of the starting cDNA templates, samples were assayed for a 616-bp β-actin (ACTB) fragment (forward primer, 5′-CCTCGCCTTTGCCGATCC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGATCTTCATGAGGTAGTCAGTC-3′) as described previously (16Cataltepe S.

SERPINB12 was re-amplified using primers (forward, 5′-TATATAGCATGCGACTCTCTTGTTACAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-TATAAAGCTTAGGAGAGCAGACCCTGCC-3′) that facilitated in-frame insertion into the pQE-30 6×His tag bacterial expression vector (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The PCR fragment was digested with HindIII and SphI and ligated 3′ of the 6×His tag DNA sequence. Recombinant clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing to verify that the coding sequence of SERPINB12 was intact and in-frame with the 5′ 6×His tag. The recombinant 6×His-tag-SERPINB12 fusion protein was selectively purified by metal chelate affinity chromatography using HiTrap, Ni2+-charged-agarose column, (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Briefly, recombinant plasmid was transformed into M15Escherichia coli and plated on LB agar containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The transformed cells were inoculated into 1 liter of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin and shaken at 37 °C untilA600 = 0.5–0.7. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mmfinal concentration) was added, and the cells were shaken another 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (7000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold Start buffer (1× phosphate buffer (20 mmphosphate, 0.5 m NaCl), pH 7.4, 10 mm imidazole pH 7.4) and disrupted by sonication. The cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was passed through a low protein binding 0.45-μm filter (Pall Gelman Laboratories, Ann Arbor, MI). The filtrate was loaded onto a HiTrap, Ni2+-charged-agarose column. The column was washed with 10 ml of Start buffer, and the bound protein was eluted in 5 ml of elution buffer (1× phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 500 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). The eluate was diluted in 1× phosphate buffer to reduce the imidazole concentration to 10 mm and then passed over a second Ni2+-charged-agarose column. SERPINB12 was eluted using a 1× phosphate buffer-imidazole step gradient that ranged in concentration from 10 to 500 mm. Aliquots of recombinant SERPINB12 were incubated for 5 min at temperatures ranging from 25 to 95 °C as described previously (17Luke C. Schick C. Tsu C. Whisstock J.C. Irving J.A. Bromme D. Juliano L.

The solution was centrifuged (12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see below). Human plasmin; human trypsin; human cathepsin (cat) G, B, K, and L; human chymotrypsin; human kallikrein; human neutrophil elastase (HNE); and subtilisin A were purchased from Athens Research & Technology, Inc. (Athens, GA). Bovine trypsin, papain, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) were purchased from Worthington Biochemical (Lakewood, NJ), Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN), and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), respectively. Thrombin and coagulation factor Xa were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Enzyme substrates were purchased from Sigma (succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide (Succ-AAPF-pNA), methoxy-Succ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-pNA (MeO-Succ-AAPV-pNA), andd-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA (VLK-pNA)); Bachem Bioscience, Inc.

PBS (137 mm NaCl, 27 mm KCl, 10 mmphosphate buffer; pH 7.4) was used in enzymatic reactions with trypsin, plasmin, catG, HNE, chymotrypsin, kallikrein, and thrombin. Cathepsin reaction buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) was used with papain and catB, K, and L. Unique reaction buffers were used with uPA (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 6000 and 20 mm d-mannitol), subtilisin A (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20), and coagulation factor Xa (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20). Trypsin and plasmin were calibrated using 4-methylumbelliferyl-para-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) (18Jameson G.W. Roberts D.V. Adams R.W. Kyle W.S. Elmore D.T. Biochem. J. 1973; 131: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Active site titrations were performed using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-3010, Hitachi Instruments, Inc., San Jose, CA) with a band pass of 10 nm and excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 450 nm, respectively. Assays were performed in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl), and the activity of the proteinase was determined by calibration with a standard curve of 4-methylumbelliferone (Sigma). The concentration of recombinant SERPINB12 was determined by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The screening for SERPINB12 inhibitory activity was determined initially by mixing enzyme and inhibitor in appropriate buffer, incubating for 30 min at 25 °C, and measuring residual enzyme activity as described (19Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M. Pemberton P.A. Silverman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1849-1855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Residual enzyme activity was determined by adding the appropriate substrate and measuring its hydrolysis over time (velocity) using either a THERMOmax (in the case of -pNA and -SBzl substrates) orfmax, (in the case of -R110 and -AFC substrates) microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). For the UV-visible substrates, -pNA and -SBzl, wavelengths of 405 and 340 nm were used, respectively. For the fluorescent substrates, -R110 and -AFC, the excitation and emission spectra were 485 nm/538 nm and 390 nm/510 nm, respectively. The concentrations of enzyme, inhibitor, and substrate are listed in Table I, and the buffers are listed above.

Assays for binding between SERPINB12 and either human trypsin (25 nm) or plasmin (50 nm) were performed in a volume of 100 μl in 96-well microtiter plates (Costar 9017, Costar, Cambridge, MA). The inhibitor (concentration range 0–50 nm) was incubated with enzyme for 30 min at 25 °C. The substrate was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The velocity of substrate hydrolysis was measured using the appropriate microplate reader. The partitioning ratio of the inhibitor-enzyme association was determined by plotting the fractional activity (velocity of the inhibited enzyme reaction/velocity of the uninhibited enzyme reaction) versusthe ratio of the inhibitor to enzyme ([I]0/[E]0) (20Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). Thex-intercept (i.e. the stoichiometry of inhibition (SI)) was determined by linear regression analysis. The interaction of SERPINB12 with human trypsin or plasmin was determined by the progress curve method (21Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Under these pseudo-first-order conditions, a constant amount of enzyme (either 25 nm human trypsin or 50 nm plasmin) was mixed with different concentrations of inhibitor (either 0–200 nm with trypsin or 0–700 nm with plasmin) and substrate (final concentration 1 mm). The rate of product formation was measured using the microplate reader. Because the inhibition of human trypsin is assumed to be irreversible over the course of the reaction, product formation is described as shown below, where the amount of product formation (P) proceeds at an initial velocity (vz) and is inhibited over time (t) at a rate (kobs), P=vzkobs×(1−e−kobst)Equation 1 For each combination of enzyme and inhibitor, akobs was calculated by nonlinear regression of the data using Equation 1. A second-order rate constant (k′) was determined by plotting a series of kobsversus the respective inhibitor concentration and measuring the slope of the line (k′ = Δkobs/Δ[I]). Because the inhibitor is in competition with substrate and the rate depends on the SI, the second-order rate constant (k′) was corrected for the substrate concentration, SI, of the enzyme and inhibitor and theKm of the enzyme for the substrate to calculate theka as follows,ka=k′×(1+[S]/Km)×SIEquation 2 The Km of human trypsin for EGR-pNA in PBS was 500 μm and that of plasmin for VLK-pNA in PBS was 1 mm . All kinetic studies were repeated at least three times. Proteins were mixed with 2× gel loading buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 120 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol), heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide, %T:%C = 19:1) according to the method of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The running buffer (pH 8.3) was 25 mm Tris-base, 250 mm glycine, and 0.1% SDS. Protein bands were visualized after staining in a solution containing 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, 45% methanol, and 10% acetic acid. For immunodetection, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were electroblotted at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C onto reinforced nitrocellulose (NitroPure, Osmonics Inc., Westborough, MA) as described (23Silverman G.A. Yang E. Proffitt J.H. Zutter M. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5469-5478Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The transfer buffer was 25 mm Tris-base, pH 8.0, and 190 mm glycine, pH 8.3. The immunodetection of SERPINB12 was performed using a monoclonal mouse anti-histidine-tag antibody (Sigma) diluted 1/2000 as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) diluted 1/2500 as secondary antibody. The immunoblot was visualized using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Human trypsin (0.7 μm) in PBS reaction buffer (20 μl) was mixed with SERPINB12 (7 μm) for 20 min at 25 °C and lyophilized. For plasmin, 0.5 μm of enzyme was mixed with 5 μm SERPINB12. The mixture components were separated by MALDI-MS at the Wistar Protein Microchemistry Facility (Philadelphia, PA). The presence of 11 human ov-serpin genes residing at either 6p25 or 18q21 prompted us to consider whether additional ov-serpin genes were present in the human genome.

Both the hinge region of the RSL and the serpin signature motif (PROSITE: PDOC00256 ([LIVMFY]-X-[LIVMFYAC]-[DNQ]-[RKHQS]-[PST]-F-[LIVMFY]-[LIVMFYC]-X-[LIVMFAH])) are highly conserved and reside in the terminal exon of all human ov-serpin genes. To identify novel ov-serpin genomic sequences, we screened the unfinished high throughput genomic sequence data base of GenBankTM using the BLAST2 algorithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) using the terminal exon (exon 8) of SERPINB4 (SCCA2) as the query sequence. A significant match was detected in DNA sequence from the overlapping BAC clones RP11–519E18, -851B10, and -1117D15. The sequence from these clones corresponds to GenBankTM accession numbers AC019355,AP001404, and AC015536, respectively. Because no new serpins were identified in the annotated DNA sequence of these clones (MapViewer (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)), we focused our gene-finding efforts to an ∼18-kb DNA segment from AC019355 that was 5′ and contiguous to the putative terminal exon of the new serpin. Using a combination of gene prediction programs (MetaGene (http://ares.ifrc.mcw.edu/MetaGene/)) and simple pairwise BLAST alignments between the 18-kb segment of AC019355 and individual exons from SERPINB4, a novel serpin gene containing at least seven exons was identified (Fig. 1). This gene was assigned the symbol, SERPINB12, by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (http://gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/). To determine whether a transcript for SERPINB12 could be identified, we designed oligonucleotide primers encompassing the putative start and stop codons. A fragment of ∼1200 bp was amplified by PCR from a human testis cDNA library. The fragment was subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced. The cDNA sequence was identical to that predicted by the genomic sequence (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence of 405 residues predicted a Mr = 46,276 and a pI = 5.36. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of SERPINB12 with those of the other B clade members confirmed that it was an ov-serpin (Fig. 2). Conserved ov-serpin features included 1) the absence of an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence and N- or C-terminal extensions, 2) a Ser rather then an Asn at the penultimate residue, and 3) a CD loop (Fig. 2) (5Remold-O'Donnell E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Other notable features of SERPINB12 were six potential N-linked glyco"

Its function was elucidated with cardiac transgenic (TG) expression of the receptor by using the myocardium-specific a-myosin heavy chain promoter. The presence of the transgene was determined by polymerase chain reaction by using primers specific to the receptor and the vector linker region, by Southern blotting of the genomic DNA, and by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry of both isolated cardiac myocytes and intact hearts. In intact heart study, the P2X4 receptor TG mouse exhibited significantly elevated basal cardiac contractility with greater rates of contraction and relaxation, left ventricular developed pressure, and cardiac output compared with nontransgenic (NTG) animals but showed no evidence of hypertrophy or heart failure. The TG heart also showed a greater increase of cardiac contractility in response to the P2X receptor agonist 2-methylthioATP, consistent with overexpression of a functional P2X4 receptor with consequent increase in the receptor-mediated response. In isolated cardiac cell study, the TG heart cell showed a similar level of basal contraction amplitude as the NTG heart cell while exhibiting a threefold greater increase in contractility during stimulation by 2-methylthioATP. Thus, an increased responsiveness of the overexpressed P2X4 receptor to endogenous ATP is responsible for the enhanced basal cardiac performance in the intact TG heart. The sustained enhanced contractile function with no associated heart pathology in the P2X4 receptor TG mouse suggests a novel physiologic role of the P2X4 receptor, that of stimulating the cardiac contractility."

To determine whether the specific ubiquinone-reacting site of GDH resides in the N-terminal transmembrane domain or in the large C-terminal periplasmic catalytic domain (cGDH), we constructed a fusion protein between the signal sequence of β-lactamase and cGDH. This truncated GDH was found to complement a GDH gene-disrupted strain in vivo. The signal sequence of the fused protein was shown to be cleaved off, and the remaining cGDH was shown to be recovered in the membrane fraction, suggesting that cGDH has a membrane-interacting site that is responsible for binding to membrane, like peripheral proteins. Kinetic analysis and reconstitution experiments revealed that cGDH has ubiquinone reductase activity nearly equivalent to that of the wild-type GDH.

The topological model of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of E. coli GDH has shown that the corresponding amino acid residues, Arg-93 and Asp-95, are located near the membrane surface of the periplasmic side (5Yamada M.

Thus, it seems reasonable that the ubiquinone-reacting site of GDH is located near the membrane surface. However, in quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase of acetic acid bacteria despite the absence of a transmembrane domain, subunit II appears to be embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane and contain the ubiquinone-reduction site (22Matsushita K.

Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the C-terminal periplasmic domain of GDH, named cGDH, contains the ubiquinone-reacting site.In efforts to clarify the role of the cGDH in reaction with ubiquinone, we constructed a fusion protein that was composed of the β-lactamase signal sequence (residues 1–25) and the cGDH (residues 142–796). The signal sequence was found to export the cGDH through the inner membrane to the periplasm, and the truncated GDH successfully complemented a GDH gene-disrupted strain in vivo and in vitro.

GDH is an 88-kDa monomeric protein with five transmembrane segments at the N-terminal portion (residues 1–140), which ensure a strong anchorage of the protein to the inner membrane (4Ameyama M.

The ubiquinone-reacting site in GDH has also been analyzed. Friedrichet al. (16Friedrich T. Strohdeicher M. Hofhaus G. Preis D. Sahm H. Weiss H. FEBS Lett. 1990; 265: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) proposed that the ubiquinone-reacting site may be located at the N-terminal transmembrane domain ofAcinetobacter calcoaceticus GDH in which Arg-91 and Asp-93 may be involved in interaction with ubiquinone. The topological model of the N-terminal transmembrane domain of E. coli GDH has shown that the corresponding amino acid residues, Arg-93 and Asp-95, are located near the membrane surface of the periplasmic side (5Yamada M. Sumi K. Matsushita K. Adachi O. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12812-12817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, using depth-dependent fluorescent ubiquinone analogues, Miyoshi et al. (17Miyoshi H. Niitome Y. Matsushita K. Yamada M. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the ubiquinone-reduction site of GDH is located close to the membrane surface rather than in the hydrophobic interior.

Thus, it seems reasonable that the ubiquinone-reacting site of GDH is located near the membrane surface. However, in quinohemoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase of acetic acid bacteria despite the absence of a transmembrane domain, subunit II appears to be embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane and contain the ubiquinone-reduction site (22Matsushita K. Yakushi T. Toyama H. Shinagawa E. Adachi O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4850-4857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar,23Frébortová J. Matsushita K. Arata H. Adachi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, in the case of E. coli GDH, the mutations in the possible ubiquinone-reacting sites, Arg-93 and Asp-95, in the transmembrane domain have been shown to have no effect on the ubiquinone reductase activity. 2MD. Elias, M. Tanaka, M. Sakai, H. Toyama, K. Matsushita, O. Adachi, and M. Yamada, unpublished data. 2MD. Elias, M. Tanaka, M. Sakai, H. Toyama, K. Matsushita, O. Adachi, and M. Yamada, unpublished data. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the C-terminal periplasmic domain of GDH, named cGDH, contains the ubiquinone-reacting site. In efforts to clarify the role of the cGDH in reaction with ubiquinone, we constructed a fusion protein that was composed of the β-lactamase signal sequence (residues 1–25) and the cGDH (residues 142–796). The signal sequence was found to export the cGDH through the inner membrane to the periplasm, and the truncated GDH successfully complemented a GDH gene-disrupted strain in vivo and in vitro. In this paper, we also discuss the evolutionary relationship between GDH in E. coli and SLDH in Gluconobacter suboxydans or MDH in M. extorquens."

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that key protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions are well conserved between the archaeal and RNAP II machineries (2Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J.

These elements, the TATA-box, and BRE elements are found in many higher eucaryal promoters where they are bound by eucaryal TBP and TFIIB. TFIIB and its archaeal homologue TFB contain two distinct domains, separated by a well conserved spacer or hinge region. The C-terminal core domain of TFB/IIB interacts with TBP and also with DNA, making sequence-specific contacts with the TFBresponsive element (BRE) found immediately upstream of the TATA-box (3Qureshi S.A.

The BRE is found in the majority of archaeal promoters and also on a significant proportion of higher eucaryal RNAP II promoters (9Lagrange T. Kapanidis A.N. Tang H. Reinberg D. Ebright R.H.

The N-terminal domain of TFB contains a zinc ribbon (14Zhu W.L. Zeng Q.D. Colangelo C.M. Lewis L.M. Summers M.F. Scott R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis has revealed that this region of TFB is dispensable for promoter binding (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Indeed, deletion of this region can stabilize formation of the TBP-TFB/IIB complex (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 16Malik S. Lee D.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6253-6259Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The N-terminally truncated TFB/IIB is, however, unable to recruit RNAP to the promoter (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Buratowski S. Zhou H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 5628-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In eucarya, there appears to be at least two interactions mediating this recruitment. A principal contact point of the N-terminal domain of TFIIB is the RNAP II-bound factor, TFIIF (19Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X.Q. Kim L.U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, it has also been observed that transcription can be reconstituted in vitro on some promoters under defined template topologies using just TBP, TFIIB, and purified RNAP II (20Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Therefore, there must be TFIIF-independent interaction(s) between the general transcription factors and the RNAP II enzyme. Although studies in budding yeast reveal genetic interactions between TFIIB and both Rpb1 and Rpb9, it is not known if these represent direct protein-protein interactions (21Berroteran R.W. Ware D.E. Hampsey M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 226-237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Sun Z.W. Tessmer A. Hampsey M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2560-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Archaea do not encode a homologue of TFIIF, and transcription can be reconstituted on a variety of promoters in vitro using just TBP, TFB, and RNAP (4Qureshi S.A. Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 5Hethke C. Geerling A.C.M. Hausner W. deVos W.M. Thomm M.

A. 1998; 95: 15218-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the recruitment of RNAP is, as in eucarya, dependent on the presence of the N-terminal 100 amino acid residues of TFB (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We were interested, therefore, to determine whether we could identify which subunit(s) of the RNAP interact with TFB and/or TBP. To this end, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system in a systematic approach to detect interactions between TBP or TFB and individual RNAP subunits. Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH and grown as described previously (33Schleper C. Zillig W. Robb F.T. Place A.R. Archaea: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 91-94Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was extracted (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the RNAP subunit, TBP, and TFB genes were amplified by PCR. Sequences of oligonucleotides and PCR conditions are available upon request. The PCR products for the TBP and TFB genes were cloned into pGBKT7 (CLONTECH) and pET30a (Novagen) and those for the RNAP subunits cloned into pGADT7 (CLONTECH). Subsequently, the RpoK open reading frame was cloned into pGex4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The identities of the inserts in the resultant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression of the mutant TFBs for use in transcription assays, site-directed mutations were introduced in the pET30a-TFB plasmid using the Quickchange system (Stratagene). Transformation of yeast strain AH109, two-hybrid analysis, and β-galactosidase assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). For use in transcription assays, TBP, TFB (and mutant derivatives), and RNAP were purified as described previously (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The GST-RpoK was expressed and purified on a 0.75-ml gluathione-Sepharose column. For thrombin-mediated cleavage of the GST-RpoK, the column was washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then 50 units of thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 2 ml of PBS were passed through the column. The column was then stoppered and incubated overnight at room temperature. RpoK was eluted in 1 ml of PBS, the volume reduced to ∼400 μl by vacuum drying, and 50 μl then chromatographed over a Superose 12 gel filtration column on a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS and 80-μl fractions collected. To express 35S-labeled proteins for use inin vitro interaction experiments, advantage was taken of the presence of a T7 promoter sequence upstream of the multple cloning site in pGBKT7 (CLONTECH). The full-length, truncated, and mutated TFB derivatives were expressed from the appropriate pGBKT7 fusion plasmid and radiolabeled using the TNT Quick system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 1 μg of the appropriate plasmid as template. Reactions contained 20 ng of TBP, 25 ng of TFB (or mutant derivative), and 70 ng of RNAP and 100 ng of template DNA. The template used in the assays was pT6, containing theT6 promoter from the SSV1 virus (4Qureshi S.A. Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in a volume of 50 μl in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm NTPs for 20 min at 70 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 250 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 750 mm NaCl, 1% SDS containing ∼1 ng of32P-5′-end-labeled T7 sequencing primer and 10 μg of glycogen. Following extraction with phenol/chloroform, nucleic acids were recovered by ethanol precipitation and resuspended in 20 μl of 1× AMV reverse transcriptase buffer containing 200 μmdNTPs. After addition of 5 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (Roche) and incubation at 42 °C for 30 min, 20 μl of 95% formamide with 0.05% bromphenol blue were added, the reaction boiled for 3 min, and 20 μl loaded on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea. The genes encoding the 12 subunits of the archaeal RNA polymerase were identified in the complete genome sequence of S. solfataricus P2. These were amplified by PCR and inserted into pGADT7 (CLONTECH). The resultant plasmids contain the RNAP subunits translationally fused to the transcription activation domain of GAL4 and an c-Myc epitope tag. Additionally, the S. solfataricus P2 homologues of TBP and TFB were identified and cloned into pGBKT7, generating translational fusions with the GAL4 DNA binding domain and a c-Myc epitope tag. Yeast strain AH109 (CLONTECH) was transformed first with PGBKT7, pGBKT7-TBP, or pGBKT7-TFB. These strains were subsequently transformed with pGAD-T7 or one of the 12 pGAD-RNAP subunit plasmids. Western blotting of whole cell extracts prepared from these strains with anti-HA and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies confirmed the expression of the various fusion proteins. The AH109 strain has theGAL4 gene deleted and is unable to grow on media lacking adenine or histidine; however, it contains the ADE2 andHIS3 genes under the control of Gal4-responsive promoters. Therefore, if proteins expressed from the pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors interact then yeast containing the appropriate plasmids will be able to grow on medium lacking adenine and histidine. Importantly, none of the RNAP subunits are able to confer His+ Ade+ phenotypes on their own (Fig. 1 a, top row,lower panel). Furthermore, neither TBP nor TFB, when fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, activate transcription on their own (Fig. 1 a, first column, lower panel). None of the pGBKT7-TBP fusion-containing strains were able to grow in the absence of His−,Ade− plates, indicating that there is no detectable interaction between TBP and any of the RNAP subunits (Fig. 1 a). By contrast, strains expressing the TFB and RpoK fusion proteins were able to grow in the absence of histidine and adenine. In addition there was extremely weak, but reproducible, growth of strains containing the TFB and RpoE fusion proteins (Fig. 1 a,lower panel). The TFB-RpoK interaction was significantly stronger than that between TFB and RpoE, therefore we chose to characterize that interaction in more detail. Previous work has revealed that the N-terminal domain of TFB is necessary for RNAP recruitment (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we generated two derivatives of the TFB fusion vector: one expressing TFB-(1–109) fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain, and the other with TFB-(110–309), separating TFB into N-terminal zinc ribbon and C-terminal core domains. These plasmids were introduced into yeast AH109 containing pGAD-RpoK. The results of the two-hybrid analyses using these constructs are shown in Fig. 1 b. While full-length TFB and the zinc ribbon containing TFB-(1–109) interact with RpoK, it is apparent that the TFB core domain does not. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain appears to interact more strongly with RpoK than does full-length TFB (Fig. 1 b). In light of the above we tested whether the RpoK-TFB interaction detected in the two-hybrid analysis could be detected by biochemical means. To this end, we cloned the RpoK into pGex4TC for expression inEscherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase (GST-RpoK). TFB, TFB-(1–109), and TFB-(110–309) were synthesized in vitro as [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. These proteins were then incubated with either GST or GST-RpoK in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were pelleted, washed extensively, and bound proteins eluted by boiling the beads in SDS-loading buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and35S-labeled species detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. Both TFB and TFB-(1–109) were selectively retained on the GST-RpoK beads, in contrast no significant retention of TFB-(110–309) was observed (Fig. 2 a). These results therefore verify the interaction detected in the two-hybrid analyses and indicate that the interaction between RpoK and TFB-(1–109) is likely to be direct. Next, we prepared recombinant RpoK protein and added this to whole cell extract prepared from S. solfataricus. Previous work has revealed that it is possible to co-immunoprecipitate TFB and RNAP from archaeal extracts (24Darcy T.J. Hausner W. Awery D.E. Edwards A.M. Thomm M. Reeve J.N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4424-4429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that if RpoK is a principal site of interaction with TFB, then the addition of free RpoK to the extract might compete with intact RNAP for TFB binding. We assayed the level of RNAP-TFB interaction by immunoprecipitation by antisera raised against the largest RNAP subunit, RpoB, followed by Western blotting with either anti-RpoB or anti-TFB sera. The result indicated that, although the ability to immunoprecipitate RpoB was not impaired by addition of RpoK, TFB was no longer co-immunoprecipitated with RNAP when high levels of recombinant RpoK were present (Fig. 2 b). Taken together, these data support a model in which there is a direct interaction between the N-terminal domain of TFB and the RpoK subunit of the RNAP. The principal structural motif in TFB-(1–109) is a zinc ribbon fold (Fig. 3 a). Previous work has demonstrated that mutagenesis of certain residues (Cys45 and Leu52) in the zinc ribbon of yeast TFIIB impair the direct interaction between TFIIB and RNAP II (25Pardee T.S. Bangur C.S. Ponticelli A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17859-17864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine the importance of the analogous residues in TFB (Cys31 and Leu38) we generated the equivalent mutations in TFB (C31A and L38P) by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenesis reactions were performed in the context of both pGBKT7-TFB-(1–109) plasmid and pET30-TFB. As seen in Fig. 3 b, transcription reactions containing the mutant TFBs reveal a reduction in yield of transcript when compared with reactions containing wild-type TFB. Quantitation of the intensity of the bands using a phosphorimager indicated that this reduction is ∼8–10-fold. To investigate the cause of this deficit in transcription we assayed the formation of TBP-TFB-DNA and TBP-TFB-RNAP-DNA complexes by electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) assays (Fig. 3, c andd). We found that the mutant TFBs form similar levels of TBP-TFB-DNA ternary complexes to wild-type TFB (Fig. 3 c). Importantly, however, ternary complexes containing mutant TFBs appear impaired in their ability to recruit RNAP (Fig. 3 d). We next tested the ability of these mutant TFBs to interact with RpoK in the two-hybrid assay and found that both mutant TFBs are significantly impaired in their ability to interact with RpoK as adjudged by the reduced growth of yeast strains containing mutant versuswild-type TFB on selective media (Fig. 3 e). A more quantitative evaluation of the reduced interaction was obtained by examining expression levels of a third reporter gene in AH109, that for β-galactosidase. The strains containing the mutant TFBs showed ∼10-fold reduced levels of β-galactosidase activity relative to the wild-type TFB-containing strain (Fig. 3 e). Thus, mutations that impair the ability of TFB to recruit RNAP to the promoter also reduce the interaction between TFB and RpoK. Taken together, these results support an important role for RpoK as a contact interface for the N-terminal domain of TFB, thereby facilitating recruitment of RNAP to archaeal promoters. In this work we searched for sites of interaction between the archaeal general transcription factors, TBP and TFB, and the RNA polymerase. We find no evidence for a direct interaction between TBP and the RNAP, in agreement with the generally accepted role of TBP as a factor involved in the binding of a core promoter element and that must recruit TFB to allow the subsequent recruitment of the RNAP. However, we do find that TFB interacts with RpoK and, to a much lesser extent, RpoE. We observe that the interaction of RpoK with the isolated zinc ribbon of TFB is considerably stronger than with full-length TFB. In light of this, it is noteworthy that the homologous TFIIB undergoes an intramolecular interaction in solution in which the N-terminal domain of TFIIB has been proposed to fold back and interact with the C-terminal region of the core domain (26Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 27Grossmann J.G. Sharff A.J. O'Hare P. Luisi B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6267-6274Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This interaction may be inhibitory to transcription, and there is evidence that some eucaryal transcriptional activators may specifically facilitate the isomerization of this closed form of TFIIB to a more open form (26Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 717-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This is proposed to facilitate promoter binding by TFIIB and consequent RNAP II recruitment. If similar interactions exist within TFB, this might explain the apparent higher affinity of the isolated zinc ribbon for RpoK. A possible corollary of this may lie in our previous observation that the stability of ternary TBP-TFB-DNA complex is enhanced in the absence of the zinc ribbon (15Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12934-12940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The observation that RpoK is the principle target for TFB is intriguing. RpoK has homologues in the ω-subunit of the bacterial RNAP and in Rpb6, a subunit shared by all three eucaryal nuclear RNAPs (28Minakhin L. Bhagat S. Brunning A. Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. Ebright R.H. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that RpoK represents an evolutionarily ancient component of the transcription systems of all three domains of life. To date, relatively little is known about the function of ω and Rpb6. However, a recent report has demonstrated that that ω and Rpb6 play an important role in stabilizing the RNA polymerase (28Minakhin L. Bhagat S. Brunning A. Campbell E.A. Darst S.A. Ebright R.H. Severinov K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 892-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional crystal structure of RNAP II determined by Kornberg and colleagues (29Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Fu J.H. Gnatt A.L. Maier-Davis B. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Edwards A.M. David P.R. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2000; 288: 640-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the bulk of Rpb6 is positioned on the outer face of the RNAP, facing toward the core promoter elements. This position is compatible with it playing a role in TF(II)B-RNAP interaction. A particularly interesting aspect of the interaction that we observe between TFB and RpoK lies in the implication that eucaryal TFIIB may interact with Rpb6. This is a subunit found in all three eucaryal RNAPs, and yet TFIIB is a RNAP II-specific transcription factor. Indeed, it appears that the major contact point of TFIIB is not RNAP II itself, but the polymerase-associated factor, TFIIF. It may be that as the three polymerase systems in eucarya diverged from a common, presumably archaeal-like, progenitor, specialized polymerase-specific recruitment modules were developed: in RNAP II, TFIIF (19Ha I. Roberts S. Maldonado E. Sun X.Q. Kim L.U. Green M. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); in RNAP III, the C34-containing subcomplex (30Khoo B. Brophy B. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2879-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); and Rrn3-A43 in the RNAP I system (31Peyroche G. Milkereit P. Bischler N. Tschochner H. Schultz P.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), thereby ensuring different promoter class usage by the three RNAPs. One prediction from our work is that the RNAP I- and RNAP III-specific modules may occlude access to Rpb6 in these two RNA polymerases. Ongoing studies of the interactions between the archaeal basal machinery and RNAP will shed further light on the evolution of both archaeal and eucaryal transcription systems.

https://openalex.org/W1512326682,"Cephalosporin acylase (CA) is a recently identified N-terminal hydrolase. It is also a commercially important enzyme in producing 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA), a backbone chemical in synthesizing semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotics. CA is translated as an inactive single chain precursor, being post-translationally modified into an active enzyme. The post-translational modification takes place in two steps. The first intramolecular autocatalytic proteolysis takes place at one end of the spacer peptide by a nucleophilic Ser or Thr, which in turn becomes a new N-terminal Ser or Thr. The second intermolecular modification cleaves off the other end of the spacer peptide by another CA. Two binary structures in complex with glutaryl-7-ACA (the most favored substrate of CAs) and glutarate (side chain of glutaryl-7-ACA) were determined, and they revealed the detailed interactions of glutaryl-7-ACA with the active site residues (Y. Kim and W. G. J. Hol (2001) Chem. Biol., in press). In this report: 1) we have mutated key active site residues into nonfunctional amino acids, and their roles in catalysis were further analyzed; 2) we performed mutagenesis studies indicating that secondary intermolecular modification is carried out in the same active site where deacylation reaction of CA occurs; and 3) the cleavage site of secondary intermolecular modification by another CA was identified in the spacer peptide using mutational analysis. Finally, a schematic model for intermolecular cleavage of CA is proposed."

Schulte H.D. Maier M. Osterziel K.J. Lange P.E. Morano I. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 99-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent PCR analysis could not detect the rat β2a subunit with the rat β2a-specific primers in rabbit heart, but it was present in brain (13Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Costantin J.L. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4690-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not yet clear which β subunits exist in heart and whether heart expresses certain β subunits specifically. Coexpression of the rat β2a subunit with various α1 subunits slowed the inactivation of the Ca2+ current (I Ca), although all the other β subunits accelerated it (5Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L.

Inactivation rates ofI Ca from native cardiac Ca2+channels are apparently fast, compared with those from L-type Ca2+ channels containing the rat β2a subunit in a heterologous expression system (15Wei S.K.

This fact, by itself, implies that other β subunits and/or regulators may function in rat heart. However, no evidence was found to show that the β1, β3, and/or β4 subunits existed in rat heart (4Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol.

These observations led us to speculate about the possible existence of unidentified β subunits and/or splice variants in heart. Indeed, rapid amplification of cDNA 5′ ends (5′-RACE)1 disclosed a β2 transcript in rat heart, which was only different from other β2 subunits in the N-terminal region. Here, we named it rat β2c subunit, because the sequence of this subunit was very similar to that of human β2c subunit, which was also cloned from human ventricular septum. When the β2c subunit was expressed in BHK cells along with a pore-forming α1c and other auxiliary α2δ subunits cloned from rat heart, the inactivation rate was comparable with that from native cardiac myocytes. Single ventricular myocytes were enzymatically isolated from the ventricle of rat hearts as described previously (16Tohse N. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: H1200-H1207PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the hearts were removed from rats, following anesthetic with pentobarbital, and perfused in a Langendorff apparatus with 0.02–0.04% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) dissolved in nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode solution. After 30 min of digestion, the left ventricle was rinsed with Kraftbrühe (KB) solution (17Isenberg G. Klöckner U. Pflügers Arch. 1982; 395: 6-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar), cut into small pieces, and shaken to separate cells. The composition of the nominally Ca2+-free Tyrode solution was (in mm): NaCl 143, KCl 5.4, MgCl2 0.5, NaH2PO40.33, glucose 5.5, and HEPES 5 (pH = 7.4, titrated by 1n NaOH). The KB solution was composed of (in mm): KCl 40, KOH 70, KH2PO4 20,l-glutamic acid 50, taurine 20, MgCl2 3, EGTA 1, glucose 10, and HEPES 10 (pH = 7.4, titrated by 1 nKOH). The cell suspension in the KB solution was stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C for later use. Rats weighing 250–350 g were anesthetized and killed with an excessive amount of pentobarbital, and the hearts and brains were removed as quickly as possible and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNAs and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were extracted using TRIzol® reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a FastTrack® 2.0 kit (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. When we had determined whether a certain mRNA was expressed or not in heart and/or brain, RNA samples were treated with DNase I (Life Technologies, Inc.) before cDNA synthesis to eliminate contamination of genomic DNA. However, we did not use DNase when our purpose was to clone α1c, β2a, β2c, and α2δ subunits that contained a full-length open reading frame (ORF). RNA was quantified by 260/280 ultraviolet (UV) spectrophotometries. Total RNAs (2 μg) of rat hearts and brains were reverse transcribed for 40 min at 42 °C with 200 units of Superscript™ II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), using oligo(dT) primers or random hexamers. RT was performed in a 20-μl mixture containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH8.4), 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 500 μm amounts of each dNTP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 nm oligo(dT) or random hexamer primers. PCR was performed by using 1 μl of each RT product as template DNA and primers (listed in Table I). PCR reactions (50 μl volume) contained: 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.1), 18 mm (NH4)2SO4, 200 μm amounts of each dNTP, 0.4 μm each of the primers (see Table I), and 1.6 mm MgCl2. The ELONGASE™ enzyme mix was added to each sample after denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min. Amplification was performed in a PCR Thermal Cycler MP (Takara) for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62–64 °C for 20–30 s, and 68–72 °C for 1–7 min. Each sample (1 μl) of the RT-PCR products was analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8–2% agarose gel and visualized by UV fluorescence, using a FluorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) after staining with ethidium bromide for 15 min or Vistra Green (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) for 1 h. The specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by their predicted lengths on agarose gels and DNA sequence (373 DNA Sequencing System, Applied Biosystems) after they had been subcloned into pGEM®-T Vector (Promega) or pCR®-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).Table IOligonucleotide primer sequencesNameDescription5′-Sequence-3′TotalPrimer1104fForward primer for a full-length α1cTGTGACATCAGCTGTTGGTCCTotalPrimer1104rReverse primer for a full-length α1cTAAAAAACACCCGCGTCTCGCα2primer909fForward primer for a full-length α2δTCGATCGCGAAGATGGCTGCTα2primer909rReverse primer for a full-length α2δGGGTTTAGAGGGTCACCATAGtotal-beta-2-primer414fForward primer for a full-length β2aTGCGTCCTGCCACCTCTTCATtotal-beta-2-primer414rReverse primer for a full-length β2aAGAGACACGCACGGTCATTGGβ2primer302fForward primer for β2aTAATGACTGGTGGATAGGACGβ2primer302rReverse primer for β2aAGATGCTCACAAGCATCCTCAβ2primer_for_5′-RACE604r1Reverse primer for 5′-RACE of β2 1GAACTGGGTACTATGTCACCCβ2primer_for_5′-RACE604r2Reverse primer for 5′-RACE of β2 2TCCCTTGCTTGGCTCTCTGTTβ2primer_for_5′-RACE604r3Reverse primer for 5′-RACE of β2 3CTCTAGTTTGACCGGGCTTGGbrain-beta-5′ G-1208fForward primer for β2a-specific probeGTTAGCAACAGCTCGGTCAGGbrain-beta-5′ G-1208rReverse primer for β2a-specific probeGCCACTGTCCATTTCTTCCCheart beta-5′ G-1208fForward primer for β2c-specific probeGACTTTTCGCCGATGGTCCheart beta-5′ G-1208rReverse primer for β2c-specific probeGGACAAAGCTGTTGGAGGTAGTGTtbeta2-p-308fForward primer for a full-length β2cCCGATGGTCCAAAGCGACACGTtbeta2-p-308RReverse primer for a full-length β2cGCAATGGAGCCCCAAAGATT Open table in a new tab When the β2c subunit was cloned, 5′-RACE was performed with 1 μg of total RNA from rat heart to obtain the unknown forward primer sequence, using a 5′-RACE System for Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (Life Technologies, Inc.). The first-strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with a β2-specific primer, β2primer_for_5′RACE604r1 (complementary to 459–479 bp from the translation start site, Table I). 5′cDNA ends of β2c were amplified using nested PCR with primers, β2primer_for_5′RACE604r2 and β2primer_for_5′RACE604r3 (complementary to 395–415 and 355–375 bp relative to the translation start site, respectively, Table I). PCR products were cloned into pGEM®-T vector, and the inserts were sequenced. α1c, β2c, and α2δ cDNA fragments containing a full-length ORF were prepared by RT-PCR from rat heart. Full-length β2acDNA was also isolated by RT-PCR from rat brain. The primers for α1c, β2a, and α2δ (Table I) were designed based on the published sequences of rat aorta α1c (GenBank™ accession number M59786) (18Koch W.J. Ellinor P.T. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17786-17791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat neuronal β2a (GenBank™ accession number M80545) (8Perez-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S. Bertrand P. Baggstrom E.

King R.G. Chin H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3251-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To design the primers for β2c, the sequence determined by 5′-RACE and that of rat neuronal β2a were used. The amplified α1c fragment was subcloned into pCR®-XL-TOPO vector according to the manufacturers' instructions and the β2a, β2c and α2δ fragments were ligated into pGEM®-T vector to form pCR-XL-TOPO-α1c, pGEM-β2a, pGEM-β2c, and pGEM-α2δ. Antisense riboprobes containing heart- and brain-specific N-terminal regions were constructed. Briefly, RT-PCR amplification of the β2a- and β2c-specific fragments was performed, using the primers listed in Table I. They were subcloned into pGEM®-T vectors to form plasmids pGEM-frβ2a and pGEM-frβ2c. Radiolabeled antisense riboprobes were synthesized from NotI-linearized pGEM-frβ2a and pGEM-frβ2c with T7 RNA polymerase and [32P]UTP using Strip-EZ RNA™ (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of poly(A) RNA samples from rat heart and brain were denatured, separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 7.4% formamide, and then transferred to Immobilon-N (Millipore). Northern blots were prehybridized for 30 min at 68 °C in the presence of Ultrahyb™ (Ambion). The blots were hybridized overnight at 68 °C in the same solution with the 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled riboprobes described above. The membrane was then washed at 68 °C with 2× SCC plus 0.1% SDS twice for 5 min and with 0.1× SCC plus 0.1% SDS twice for 15 min, and then autoradiographed for 7 days at −20 °C. To express functional cardiac Ca2+channels in BHK (subclone BHKtk-ts13) and COS-7 cells, the constructs reported hereafter were derived. As no appropriate restriction enzyme sites were found to excise a full-length cDNA encoding α1c, β2a, and β2c from pCR-XL-TOPO-α1c, pGEM-β2a, and pGEM-β2c, respectively, and subclone together them into pIRES (CLONTECH), XhoI sites of the inserts were mutated so as not to change amino acid sequences. pGEM-β2a and pGEM-β2c were then digested byEagI and SpeI. Each fragment was subcloned into pIRES digested by NotI and XbaI, yielding the plasmids pIRES-β2a and pIRES-β2c. To obtain the fragment encoding a full-length α1c, pCR-XL-TOPO-α1c was digested by MluI andXhoI. This fragment was subcloned into pIRES-β2a and pIRES-β2c digested by the same restriction enzymes, yielding pIRES-α1c-β2a and pIRES-α1c-β2c. pGEM-α2δ was digested by EagI and subcloned into pIRES-hrGFP-1a (Stratagene) digested with NotI to form pIRES-α2δ-hrGFP. The direction was confirmed by DNA sequence. BHK and COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pIRES-hrGFP-1a or pIRES-α2δ-hrGFP along with pIRES-α1c-β2a or pIRES-α1c-β2c using Effecten™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were subsequently maintained on collagen-coated coverslip fragments in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 30 μg/ml streptomycin, and 30 units/ml penicillin and assayed after 24–96 h. Coverslip fragments with attached cells or isolated cardiac myocytes were continually perfused on the stage of an inverted microscope. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made using pipettes with resistance of 2–4 megohms. Perfusate composition was as follows (in mm): choline chloride 140, CsCl 5.4, MgCl2 0.5, HEPES 5, andd-glucose 10 (pH 7.4, titrated by Tris-HCl), with Ba2+ 10, 0.5, or Ca2+ 1.8 as charge carrier. Pipette solution composition was as follows (in mm):l-glutamic acid 110, CsCl 20, CsOH 110, MgCl2 1, Na2ATP 5, creatine phosphate 5, EGTA 10, and HEPES 5 (pH = 7.4, titrated by 1 n CsOH). We chose BHK and COS-7 cells as heterologous expression systems because they were reported to lack any subunits of L-type Ca2+ channel (20Yamaguchi S. Okamura Y. Nagao T. Adachi-Akahane S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2001; 51: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All experiments were done at 37 °C. Transfected cells were identified by the expression of hrGFP. Cells were clamped at −80 mV, and whole-cell currents were evoked by 400-ms step depolarization to various test potentials (0.1Hz). Currents were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. Series resistance compensation was not applied. Analysis and voltage protocols were performed with the use of an Axopatch 1D amplifier/Digidata 1322A interface (Clampex software, pCLAMP 8.1, Axon Instruments Inc). The data were analyzed after leak subtraction. Inactivation characteristics of Ba2+ current (I Ba) were measured using a two-step voltage clamp protocol. A 3-s conditioning pre-pulse was applied from a holding potential of −80 mV (10-mV increments from −100 mV to 10 mV) followed by a 100-ms test pulse to 10 mV. The intervals between each cycle were 10 s. Recorded peak current amplitudes were normalized to the maximum value. Steady-state inactivation curves were fitted by a Bolzmann function: I Ba = 1/{1 + exp[(V −V h)/k]}, whereI Ba is the normalized peak current, Vis the conditioning pre-pulse voltage, V h is the voltage at half-maximum inactivation, and k is the slope factor. Inactivation time constants were obtained by fitting a current decay with a two-exponential equation: I(t) = I ∞ +A s·exp(−t/τslow) +A f·exp (−t/τfast), where I(t) is the time-dependent current, I ∞ is the steady-state amplitude of the current, A s and A fare the fractions of currents that are slow and fast inactivated, respectively, and τslow and τfast are the time constants that are slow and fast, respectively. The r400 value was calculated as the ratio of the current amplitude at the end of 400-ms depolarization pulse divided by the peak amplitude of the trace. All values are presented in terms of mean ± S.E. When I-V relationships and inactivation characteristics were compared, two-way repeated measures of ANOVA were first carried out to test for any differences among the mean values of multiple subgroups. When a significant F value was obtained by two-way ANOVA, intergroup comparisons were performed by contrast test. When the model with the interactions improved significantly, we interpreted it as indicating different voltage dependences of the groups. The voltages at half-maximum inactivation and the slope factors were compared by Student's t test. Significance was established at P values < 0.05. First, we performed RT-PCR to confirm that the β2subunit exists in rat heart, using total RNA extracted from rat heart as a template. As shown in lane 1 of Fig. 1 B, we were able to obtain a partial fragment of β2 subunit. Then, we attempted to isolate the reported β2a subunit including a full-length ORF. However, as shown in lane 2 of Fig. 1 B, we could not observe any PCR product using the β2a-specific primers. As the same primers detected the β2a subunit when total RNA from rat brain (Fig. 1 B, lane 5) was used as a template, we speculated that another splice variant of β2 was expressed in rat heart. The β2subunit is known to have splice variants in the N-terminal region. To prove that the forward primer was not suitable to obtain the β2 subunit in rat heart, we performed RT-PCR analysis using a primer pair of primer_1 and primer_4 and another pair, primer_3 and primer_2 (see Fig. 1 A). As shown in lanes 3and 4 of Fig. 1 B, only primer_3 and primer_2 detected the β2 subunit, which indicated that the N-terminal region of the β2 subunit expressed in rat heart was different from the reported β2a sequence cloned from rat brain. The upper lane of Fig. 2 A shows the partial sequence of the β2c subunit in rat heart that was determined by 5′-RACE (GenBank™ accession number AF394942). The sequence was completely different from the reported β2a sequence in the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and the first 199 nucleotides of ORF. We set the primers based on this result and succeeded in cloning the full-length β2c subunit (GenBank™ accession numberAF394941) expressed in rat heart (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). This β2c clone contains 656 amino acids, yielding a protein with a calculated molecular mass of 73.2 kDa. We could also amplify the β2c subunit in rat brain, using the same primers (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). Therefore, it was demonstrated that the β2c subunits were expressed in heart and brain.Figure 3A, RT-PCR detection of a full-length β2c subunit. RT-PCR was performed using tbeta2-p-308f as the forward and tbeta2-p-308r as the reverse primers (see also Table I). PCR products with an expected length of ∼ 2 kb were detected from adult rat brain (lane 1) and adult rat heart (lane 2). B, Northern blot analysis of β2a and β2c subunits. Northern blots of mRNA from adult rat brain (lanes 2 and 4) and heart (lanes 1 and 3) were hybridized with probes specific for β2a (lanes 1 and 2) and β2c (lanes 3 and 4), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Closed triangles indicate the 2-, 4-, and 6-kb transcripts hybridized with the probes.

The rat β2c subunit differs only in the N-terminal region from the rat β2a, the rabbit β2a, and β2b subunits except for some amino acids sequence, considered to be species differences. The N-terminal region of the rat β2c subunit has one potential protein kinase C site and two casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. No consensus site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase was found in this region. In contrast to other β2 subunits, the sequence for the N-terminal region of the human β2c subunit, which was also cloned from human ventricular septum (23Allen T.J. Mikala G. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 238-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), is almost identical to that for the rat β2c subunit. To confirm the PCR result further, Northern blot analysis was performed. The β2c-specific probe hybridized with three mRNA species of ∼6, 4, and 2 kb in rat heart (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). However, the β2a-specific probe hybridized only two transcripts of about 6 and 2 kb (Fig. 3 B, lane 1). In rat brain, both the β2a- and the β2c-specific probes cross-reacted with three transcripts of ∼6, 4, and 2 kb (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 4). Perez-Reyeset al. (8Perez-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S.

As the sequence of the β2aand the β2c subunits are the same except for the N-terminal region, it is highly possible that the probe used by Perez-Reyes et al. (8Perez-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S. Bertrand P. Baggstrom E. Lacerda A.E. Wei X.Y. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1792-1797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contained the common sequences that recognize both the β2a and the β2csubunits. Therefore, the 4-kb transcript, which was not recognized by the β2a-specific probe but by the probe of Perez-Reyeset al., may be the β2c subunit. These results, along with the PCR analysis, demonstrated that the β2csubunit was expressed abundantly in both heart and brain (see also “Discussion”). To test the functional effect of the β2c subunit and to compare the recombinant Ca2+ channel containing the β2c subunit with native one, we cloned a pore-forming subunit and other auxiliary subunits of L-type Ca2+channel, i.e. α1c and α2δ subunits from rat heart. We thought it important to reconstitute the L-type Ca2+ channel, which was composed of all four subunits cloned from heart of the same species. Otherwise, any different"

To elucidate how gp80 adhesion complexes assemble in the plasma membrane, gp80-gp80 and gp80-raft interactions were investigated. A low density raft-like membrane fraction was isolated using a detergent-free method. It was enriched in sterols, the phospholipid-anchored proteins gp80, gp138, and ponticulin, as well as DdCD36 and actin, corresponding to components found in the Triton X-100-insoluble floating fraction. Chemical cross-linking revealed that gp80 oligomers were enriched in the raft-like membrane fraction, implicating stable oligomer-raft interactions. However, gp80 oligomers resisted sterol sequestration and were partially dissociated with Triton X-100, suggesting that compartmentalization in rafts was not solely responsible for their formation. The <i>trans</i>-dimer known to mediate adhesion was identified, but <i>cis</i>-oligomerization predominated and displayed greater accumulation during development. In fact, oligomerization was dependent on the level of gp80 expression and occurred among isolated gp80 extracellular domains, indicating that it was mediated by direct gp80-gp80 interactions. Rafts existed in gp80-null cells and such pre-existent membrane domains may provide optimal microenvironments for gp80 <i>cis</i>-oligomerization and the assembly of adhesion complexes."

Stephenson M.L. Janeway C.M. Randerath K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1966; 24: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Since then, dinucleoside polyphosphates have been found intracellularly in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, and have been shown to be specific purinoreceptor ligands extracellularly in systems ranging from synaptic transmission to vasocontrol. The younger field of extracellular functioning has arguably proved more successful in defining a role for the diadenosine polyphosphates (2Pintor J. Diaz-Hernandez M. Gualix J. Gomez-Villafuertes R.

In particular, we have been interested in the role of Zn2+ in strongly augmenting the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase synthesis of adenyl dinucleoside polyphosphates (17Plateau P. Mayaux J.F. Blanquet S.

Most of the class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are stimulated by Zn2+ in ApnA synthesis, yet many do not have clear zinc-binding motifs. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases that do have zinc-binding motifs use the zinc for amino acid discrimination (20Sankaranarayanan R. Dock-Bregeon A.C. Romby P. Caillet J. Springer M. Rees B.

Furthermore, hydrolysis of the diadenosine polyphosphates has in general been shown to be inhibited by Zn2+, although stimulated by Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ca2+. A list of the effects of zinc on some ApnA-metabolizing enzymes is shown in Table I. Such considerations of the links between Zn2+ and ApnA have been examined before (21Grummt F. Weinmann-Dorsch C.

Generally, from these studies it has been shown that Ap4A can exist in three major conformations as follows: stacked, folded unstacked, and open. However, as the folded unstacked form is only stable below pH 5 and at high temperature (>80 °C), under physiological conditions it has been assumed that a two-state equilibrium exists between the open form and the base stacked form (37Kolodny N.H. Kisteneff E. Redfield C. Rapaport E. FEBS Lett. 1979; 107: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The structure is also affected by metal ions. NMR shows a single Mg2+ to stabilize the ring-stacked conformation by interacting symmetrically with both β-phosphates (38Kolodny N.H. Collins L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14571-14575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD studies have revealed that Zn2+ destabilizes the ring-stacked conformation (35Holler E. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Taneja K. Zamecnik P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4924-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and cis-platin has been reported to bind to Ap4A in the form of an N-7 to N-7 chelate (41Segal E. Girault J.P. Muzard G. Chottard G. Chottard J.C. le Pecq B. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although Zn2+ binding reduces base stacking, the conformational change has not been clearly defined by previous studies using CD nor has the strength of binding been resolved. As a new probe into the nature of the polyphosphate-metal interaction, we have used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to elucidate the binding of a range of metal ions to Ap3A, Ap4A, Ap5A, and to ATP. This technique has the advantage of being able to characterize fully the thermodynamics of the binding events and to clearly show the stoichiometry of the stronger binding events. We have also used NMR and CD to complement and confirm our calorimetric data. As such, ITC provides a powerful new handle on the understanding of metal ion control of dinucleoside polyphosphate conformation. Ammonium salts of dinucleoside polyphosphates were purchased from Sigma. Metal chloride salts were purchased from Sigma and were of spectral grade. Milli-Q water (Millipore) was used throughout. The sodium cations of the dinucleoside polyphosphates were exchanged for protons using a Dowex cation exchange column and then polyphosphates were freeze-dried. Purities of the compounds were checked on an anion exchange column (MonoQ, Amersham Biosciences) using a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, on a fast protein liquid chromatography system with an ultraviolet monitor (Amersham Biosciences) set at 260 nm. ATP was estimated by fast protein liquid chromatography peak integration to be 95% pure, Ap3A to be 95% pure, Ap4A to be 98% pure, and Ap5A to be 95% pure. Concentrations of polyphosphates were measured using the following extinction coefficients at 260 nm: Ap3A 25,100 m−1 cm−1, Ap4A 27,100 m−1 cm−1, and Ap5A 27,800 m−1cm−1 (35Holler E. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Taneja K. Zamecnik P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4924-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were carried out with a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA) interfaced with a computer. Stock solutions of nucleoside polyphosphates (50 mm) and of divalent metal ions with chloride counter ions (1 m) were prepared, and then solutions for ITC were prepared by dilution into 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, to the required concentration. All solutions were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and then thoroughly degassed under vacuum for 5 min with gentle stirring immediately before use. Each metal chloride solution (typically 10 mm) in a 250-μl injection syringe was titrated into a given polyphosphate solution (typically 0.5 mm) placed in the sample cell of 1.56-ml volume. The reference cell, which acts only as a thermal reference to the sample cell, was filled with water. Titrations typically consisted of a preliminary 1-μl injection followed by 25 10-μl injections of 20 s duration each, with 3 min spacing between injections. Other titrations consisted of a preliminary 1-μl injection followed by 50 5-μl injections of 10 s duration each, with 3 min spacing between injections. All experiments were performed at 20 °C. Data from the first 1-μl injection, which were unreliable due to diffusion between the syringe and cell solutions, were discarded before analysis. The raw data correspond to the power required to be supplied by the calorimeter to maintain a constant temperature during and following injection. Integration of power with respect to time gives the enthalpy change as a result of injection. Prior to analysis, data were corrected for the heat of dilution of the metal chlorides into the Tris buffer without polyphosphates. Binding isotherms thus obtained were fitted to the Origin models by Marquardt nonlinear least squares analysis (Origin 5.0, Microcal). 1H NMR spectra were measured at 400 MHz in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 20 °C in 80% D2O. CD scans were carried out on a Jasco J-715 CD spectrometer in a 0.5-cm path length cuvette between 320 and 220 nm, a 5 nm bandwidth, 10 mdeg sensitivity, and a 4-s response at 10 nm/min. Measurements were carried out in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 20 °C. Volume changes on titration were less than 1%. We carried out ITC experiments at pH 8.0, in 20 mm Tris buffer at 20 °C. The binding of divalent metal cations to nucleoside polyphosphates was generally found to be endothermic, the upward peaks indicating heat uptake on injection of divalent cation solution into a given polyphosphate solution. A typical binding profile is shown for Mg2+ binding to ATP (Fig. 1). The binding of Mn2+and Ca2+ to ATP gave similar results. Titration analyses of Ni2+, Cd2+, and Zn2+ binding to ATP showed not only this primary endothermic binding event but a second, weaker exothermic binding event (Fig. 2). We presume the stronger endothermic binding event correlates with the interaction between metal cations and phosphate chain, and the weaker exothermic event with the interaction between metal cations and the N-7 atom of the adenine ring. The exothermic association of metal ions with the N-7 atom of ATP has been reported previously (42Feder J. Top. Phosphorus Chem. 1983; 11: 1-18Google Scholar).Figure 2Binding of Cd2+ to ATP.

Titration experiments involving Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, and Cd2+ all showed a single endothermic binding event (Fig. 3). In contrast, Zn2+titrations revealed two binding events, both endothermic in character (Fig. 4). The strength of binding (Ka in range 105m−1) associated with the second event correlates with the interaction between metal cations and phosphate chain (as described above) (TableII). The strength of binding (Ka in range 107m−1) of the first event is altogether stronger and was thought to relate to Zn2+ binding to alternative sites such as the N-7 atoms of the two adenine rings.Figure 4Binding of Zn2+ toAp4A.

Open table in a new tab Metal cation binding to Ap3A was similar to Ap4A if generally weaker, and in the case of Ni2+ no appreciable binding was seen to Ap3A at all. The interaction of Zn2+ with Ap3A showed a very similar pattern to Ap4A. Titration with Zn2+ revealed two endothermic binding events, the first being stronger than the second. By extrapolation from Ap4A, the first event was thought to correlate with Zn2+/N-7 atom interactions and the second to Zn2+/phosphate chain interactions. Whereas a single metal cation was clearly shown to bind to the phosphate chain of Ap3A, Ap4A, and ATP, two such cations were found to associate with the phosphate chain of Ap5A. However, once again, titrations with Zn2+ revealed a very strong endothermic binding event preceding the second endothermic event characteristic of Zn2+ binding with the phosphate chain (Fig.5). All thermodynamic data for these titration experiments is shown in Table II. The effects of Mg2+ and Zn2+ on Ap4A were compared by 1H NMR and CD spectroscopy to obtain more evidence to support N-7 atom interactions. Fig. 6 shows the NMR spectrum of unliganded Ap4A between 5 and 8 ppm; the signal at 8.37 ppm corresponds to H-8, at 8.12 to H-2, and the doublet at 6.02 to H-1′ (37Kolodny N.H. Kisteneff E. Redfield C. Rapaport E. FEBS Lett. 1979; 107: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The effect of Zn2+ and Mg2+ on the chemical shifts of these signals is shown in TableIII. Both Mg2+ and Zn2+ caused small changes to the shifts of the H-2 and H-1′ protons, consistent with minor changes in proton environment as a result of metal cation binding to the phosphate chain. However, the presence of Zn2+, unlike Mg2+, also provoked a downfield shift of 0.08 ppm in the chemical shift of H-8. Such a shift may be caused by either the withdrawal of electron density from the purine ring and/or partial base destacking. Base stacking is well known to induce upfield chemical shifts of the H-8 proton relative to an unstacked ATP standard (43Plateau P. Gueron M. Blanquet S. Biochimie (Paris). 1981; 63: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In either event, both effects are consistent with Zn2+ forming an N-7 bridging interaction between two adenine rings analogous to the N-7 to N-7 chelate interaction reported for cis-platin (41Segal E. Girault J.P. Muzard G. Chottard G. Chottard J.C. le Pecq B. Biopolymers. 1984; 23: 1623-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The NMR spectrum of Ap4A suggested that the binding of metal cation occured without loss in molecular symmetry.Table IIIEffect of metal cations on 1H NMR chemical shifts of Ap4AMetal cationΔδ H-8Δδ H-2Δδ H-1′1 mmMgCl20−0.03+0.021 mmZnCl2+0.08−0.03+0.02Δδ represents the difference in chemical shifts relative to unliganded Ap4A. Errors on δ are ± 0.01. Open table in a new tab Δδ represents the difference in chemical shifts relative to unliganded Ap4A. Errors on δ are ± 0.01. The effects of Mg2+ and Zn2+ on the CD spectrum of Ap4A are shown in Fig. 7and are in agreement with previous work (35Holler E. Holmquist B. Vallee B.L. Taneja K. Zamecnik P. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4924-4933Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Unliganded Ap4A showed a reverse Cotton effect centered on 266 nm, with a peak at 254 nm and a trough at 279 nm. This is indicative of the reverse base-stacking characteristic of the diadenosine polyphosphates. The binding of Mg2+ caused an approximate 15% reduction in the Cotton effect, and a slight red shift in the center of absorption. The binding of Zn2+ caused a more radical change in the overall symmetry of the Cotton effect and a greater reduction in the trough at 279 nm, characteristic of partial base destacking, entirely consistent with the interpretation of the NMR data (see above). The potential reversibility (switch characteristics) of Zn2+ binding was investigated by a CD titration binding experiment. Ap4A was titrated with Zn2+, and changes in the depth of the trough at 279 nm were observed as a function of Zn2+ concentration (Fig.8). The concentration of the polyphosphate was significantly above the dissociation constant; therefore, simple saturation thermodynamics were observed. These titration results compare directly with the results of the ITC experiment with Zn2+ and Ap4A, shown in Fig. 4. The first 22% reduction in ellipticity appears to correlate well with the first endothermic binding event and the second 13% reduction with the second endothermic binding event. We have argued above that the first endothermic binding event corresponds to Zn2+ forming an N-7 bridging interaction between two adenine rings. Such an interaction should be accompanied by extensive base destacking (see above) consistent with the 22% reduction in ellipticity during the first stage of the CD titration. The second endothermic binding event has been ascribed to interactions between Zn2+ and phosphate chain, interactions that should disrupt base stacking less, therefore consistent with the much smaller 13% reduction in ellipticity during the second stage of the CD titration. The results of titrations with Mg2+ and Ap4A support this interpretation. ITC experiments showed a single endothermic binding event presumed to correlate with Mg2+/phosphate chain interactions, whereas a corresponding 13% reduction in Ap4A ellipticity at 279 nm was observed as a result of Mg2+in a CD titration experiment. Therefore, a 13% reduction in Ap4A ellipticity does indeed appear to correlate with binding interactions between metal cations and phosphate chain. The ellipticity changes induced by Zn2+ were completely reversed by EDTA titration (Fig. 8). Stepwise sequestration of Zn2+ occurred with complete recovery of ellipticity at titration end point, consistent with complete regeneration of unliganded Ap4A. Hence, the association of Zn2+with Ap4A, and by extrapolation with other diadenosine polyphosphates, is completely reversible as are the changes in the physical state of Ap4A, provided that Zn2+levels may be adequately controlled. We have characterized the binding of a variety of metal ions to Ap3A, Ap4A, Ap5A, and ATP by ITC. The advantage of this technique is that the enthalpy change ΔH, the binding constant, and the stoichiometry may be calculated in a single experiment. From these values, the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, and the entropy change, ΔS, may also be calculated, and hence all thermodynamic parameters may be defined. As a control, the binding of metal cations to ATP was studied by using titration calorimetry as reported previously (44Wilson J.E. Chin A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). All the divalent cations displayed a primary endothermic binding event, whereas the heavier cations also showed a secondary exothermic binding event. Such interactions are well documented with ATP (42Feder J. Top. Phosphorus Chem. 1983; 11: 1-18Google Scholar). The primary binding event may be attributed to binding of the divalent metal cation to the β-γ-phosphates, and the secondary event may be attributed to the interaction with N-7 of the adenine base. Titrations of diadenosine polyphosphates with most metal cations revealed one main endothermic binding event whose strength declined in the order Ap5A (strongest) > ATP > Ap4A > Ap3A (weakest). This appears to correlate with metal cation/phosphate chain interactions as seen with ATP. No secondary exothermic binding events were observed in contrast to ATP. Ap5A appears to bind two metal ions on the phosphate chain, unlike Ap4A, Ap3A, and ATP, which otherwise appear to bind only one. Zn2+ was found to bind exceptionally with all the diadenosine polyphosphates studied. In all cases, titrations of diadenosine polyphosphates with Zn2+ revealed two endothermic binding events, the first strong and the second weak. All the data interlock to support the view that the second binding event corresponds to routine Zn2+/phosphate chain interactions, whereas the first relates to some form of N-7 bridging interaction between two adenine rings, an interaction that leads to significant base destacking (Fig.9). Although this binding interaction is strong, it is also clearly reversible provided that strong Zn2+-chelating agents are available. Such a reversible, strong binding interaction between Zn2+ and the diadenosine polyphosphates may well explain many of the effects of Zn2+ on the ApnA-metabolizing enzymes shown in Table I. N-7–N-7 bridging interactions by Zn2+ involved in an enzyme-bound adenylate could easily provide the necessary means to lower the energy of the transition state leading to ApnA synthesis, thereby offering a clear explanation for the ability of Zn2+ to enhance the catalytic rate of these anabolic enzymes. Indeed, observation of the enzyme-bound structure of lysyl adenylate reveals the adenine N-7 directed toward a possible Zn2+-binding site that might bridge to a second adenine during Ap4A synthesis (45Desogus G. Todone F. Brick P. Onesti S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8418-8425Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Conversely, Zn2+ may well inhibit catabolic ApnA hydrolase enzymes because Zn2+-ApnA complexes are so stable as to be intractable substrates. For instance, base destacking and other conformational distortions caused by Zn2+ binding may render ApnAs unrecognizable as ApnA hydrolase substrates. Alternatively, ApnA hydrolases may be able to bind Zn2+-ApnA complexes in the active site but lack the necessary binding energy to overcome the conformational effects of the Zn2+ and achieve ApnA conformations appropriate for hydrolysis to take place. The total zinc concentration of Escherichia coli has recently been reported as 0.2 mm; however, there is no cytosolic pool of Zn2+ as all Zn2+ is bound to molecules within the cell (46Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Such over-capacity for the binding of Zn2+ suggests tight control of Zn2+ levels; it is unlikely that cellular zinc chemistry is under simple thermodynamic control. It may be possible that the diadenosine polyphosphates act in a protective role to sequester zinc under stress conditions. Metallothioneins, which act as the major intracellular store of Zn2+, have been implicated in the protection of cells from stress (47Ghoshal K. Wang Y. Sheridan J.F. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27904-27910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), yet the exact roles of this class of proteins remain unclear (48Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). It is possible that there is biochemical cross-talk between the metallothionein and diadenosine polyphosphate stress responses, whereby Zn2+ release from the metallothioneins under stress leads to diadenosine polyphosphate synthesis and concomitant inhibition of diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolysis. The resultant increased diadenosine polyphosphate concentrations may then be involved in adaptation to stress by binding to several heat shock proteins including GroEL, DnaK, and ClpB (49Johnstone D.B. Farr S.B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3897-3904Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 50Fuge E.K. Farr S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2321-2326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After stress has passed, diadenosine polyphosphate-accessible Zn2+ will return to normal levels, and the diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolases may be reactivated. Such biochemical cross-talk may also occur extracellularly with regard to the catabolic enzymes (51Aschner M. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In this regard, we propose Zn2+ as a conserved atomic switch controlling synthesis and biological activity of diadenosine polyphosphates.

Furthermore, regions within the N terminus region of MKK1 are important for determining catalytic activity, nuclear export, and interactions with ERK proteins (3Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Matsuura J.E.

An additional level for MKK1 regulation may occur through C-terminal phosphorylation sites at residues Thr-286, Thr-292, and Thr-386. Several known kinases, including ERKs and Cdc2, and possibly unknown kinases may be responsible for phosphorylation of MKK1 at these sites. The consequence of Thr-286, Thr-292, or Thr-386 phosphorylation is the subject of controversy. In some studies, Thr-292 phosphorylation has been shown to allow prolonged MKK1 activation in response to serum stimulation (7Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, phosphorylation at Thr-286, Thr-292, or Thr-386 by ERK or p34 Cdc2 kinase may also function in the negative regulation of MKK1 activity (8Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Rossomando A.J. Dent P. Sturgill T.W. Marshak D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1594-1602Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Thr-386 has been reported to regulate MKK1 interactions with the Grb2-like adaptor protein, Grb10, following insulin stimulation and may play a role in modulating ERK pathway signaling (10Nantel A. Mohammad-Ali K. Sherk J. Posner B.I. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10475-10484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, it is still not clear how phosphorylation of these residues modulates ERK pathway signaling. Both MKK1 and MKK2 contain a proline-rich region located in the C terminus between amino acids 262 and 307, which are reported to function in promoting interactions with Raf-1 (7Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, other studies indicate that, although the proline-rich region is important for obtaining full ERK activation following stimulation, removal of this region does not affect MKK and Raf-1 binding (11Dang A. Frost J.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19909-19913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both MKK1 and MKK2 isoforms can phosphorylate ERK proteins to a similar degree (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, some differences may exist between MKK1 and MKK2, in regard to both ERK activation and physiological function. For example, MP-1 has been identified as a MKK1-specific binding partner that facilitates sustained activation of MKK1 and ERK1 (12Schaeffer H.J. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Collier L.S. Krauss A. Weber M.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1668-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In addition, MKK1 and MKK2 may display some differences depending on the cellular response. In one example, MKK2, and not MKK1, has been reported to be necessary for cell cycle transitions through G2 and mitosis in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (13Abbott D.W. Holt J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2732-2742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In these studies, cells expressing a dominant negative MKK2 mutant failed to arrest in response to DNA damage, suggesting MKK2 activation is involved in maintaining a genotoxically induced G2 checkpoint. In addition, expression of a dominant negative MKK1 in 3T3 cells was reportedly sufficient to cause a delay in cell cycle progression through G2 phase and into mitosis (14Wright J.H. Munar E. Jameson D.R. Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11335-11340Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In both of these examples, a corresponding role for ERK protein activation in these responses could not be demonstrated, suggesting that MKK can function independent of ERK in some situations. Thus, MKK1 and MKK2 isoforms may function independently depending on the conditions and interact with novel unknown substrates. In the absence of structural data derived from x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance studies, the relationship between MKK protein structure and function has yet to be determined. However, studies using deuterium exchange methodology to estimate the flexibility of specific regions on the MKK1 protein have given some insight to its structure-function relationship (15Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Based on this study and the amino acid sequence, MKK1 is predicted to contain many of the structural features common to known kinases. For example, the N- and C-terminal regions represent opposing lobes that may show flexibility to allow exposure of substrate binding sites and phosphorylation of the activation lip. Furthermore, changes in flexibility in the C-terminal region of MKK1 opposite N-terminal substrate binding regions could potentially influence substrate binding and downstream activation (15Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In these studies, we examined several MKK1 C-terminal deletion mutants expressed in cells to further define how this region regulates MKK1 function. We present evidence that a C-terminal region outside of the proline-rich domain and not containing any of the known C-terminal phosphorylation sites is necessary for maintaining MKK1 protein in a soluble cytosolic localization. In addition, we show that this C-terminal region is important in allowing MKK1 to be activated by Raf-1 and cell proliferation. Thus, we have identified a novel C-terminal region on MKK1 that is necessary for ERK pathway activation and cell viability. Hela cells were maintained in complete medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + 10% fetal bovine serum), supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells were transfected using 1 μg of cDNA and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h. Transfection efficiencies were ∼30% as estimated by green fluorescent protein expression. Cells were typically harvested 18–24 h after transfections. Cell proliferation assays were done by seeding the same number of cells within an experiment on 35-mm culture dishes, transfecting with MKK1 constructs, and counting cells after 20–22 h of expression using trypan blue staining or MTS tetrazolium reduction to Formazan (CellTiter 96® AQueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay, Promega). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing α- or γ-tubulin and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (pT183, pY185) were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibody recognizing phosphorylated MKK1/2 (pS217, pS221) was purchased from New England Biolabs. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing MKK1 (C-18) and ERK2 (C-14) and the monoclonal antibody recognizing hemagglutinin tag (HA) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lysosome staining was performed on cells during the last 1 h in culture using 50 nm LysoTracker red reagent (Molecular Probes, L-7528) that was kindly provided by Dr. Carolyn Machamer (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). Following incubation with LysoTracker reagent, cells were processed for immunofluorescence and examined following fixation as described below. Raf-1 BXB cDNA construct was kindly provided by Dr. Ulf Rapp (University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany). Full-length MKK1, cloned into the Bam HI and Hin dIII sites C-terminal to the HA tag on the pMCL vector, was used as the template and kindly provided by Dr. Natalie Ahn (University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) (16Mansour S.J. Candia J.M. Gloor K.K. Ahn N.G. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 243-250PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal PCR primer containing the Bam HI site 5′-GGATCCATGCCCAAGAAGAAGCCG was used with the following C-terminal primers containing a stop codon and the Hin dIII site 5′-AAGCTTTTAAAGGGGCCTCCCGGG (MKK1 d296), 5′-AAGCTTTTAACTGAACACTCCACT (MKK1 d330), and 5′-AAGCTTTTAGCCGATGGTGGAGCA (MKK1 d379). The MKK1 PCR products were gel extracted and subcloned into the Bam HI and Hin dIII sites of pMCL. The MKK1 mutant with amino acids deleted between 330 and 379 (MKK1 d330–379) was generated from the full-length MKK1 template using the primers 5′-ACTGAACACTCCACTGGGCAGTTTTGGAGG and 5′-pCTTAACCAGCCCAGCACACCAACCCATGCT and the MKK1 product was religated. Untransfected and transfected cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with 300 μl of tissue lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine), and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to clarify lysates. In some experiments, a final concentration of 0.1% SDS was added to the lysis buffer to promote extraction of membrane proteins. Lysates (∼20 μg of protein) were diluted with an equal volume of 2× SDS-sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked for 1–2 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20), and incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBS + 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h to overnight. Membranes were washed several times in TBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, diluted 1:10,000). Protein immunoreactivity was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cytosolic and nuclear proteins were separated as described previously (17Shapiro P.S. Whalen A.M. Tolwinski N.S. Wilsbacher J. Froelich-Ammon S.J. Garcia M. Osheroff N. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by scraping into a microcentrifuge tube with extraction buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium ortho-vanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride followed by incubation on ice for 15 min. Passing cells through a 26-gauge needle 10 times was performed to isolate nuclei. The homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min to pellet the nuclei and generate a postnuclear supernatant. Nuclear proteins in the nuclei pellet were extracted by frequent vortexing in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The postnuclear supernatant fraction was further centrifuged for 1.5 h at 100,000 × g at 6 °C. The supernatant containing soluble cytosolic proteins and the pellet containing cytoplasmic membrane proteins were re-extracted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The expression of MKK1 proteins in the cytosolic and cytoplasmic membrane fractions was analyzed by immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE as described above. Cells were grown on round glass coverslips in 6-cm plates and transfected as described above. Coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 5 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Localization of MKK1 proteins was identified by immunostaining for the HA tag and counterstained for cellular DNA with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 0.2 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). Cells were identified using a Nikon E800 fluorescence microscope and Hamamatsu CCD camera and processed with IPlab software. The HA-MKK1 pattern of staining in cells was examined in more than 100 cells for MKK1 wild type, MKK d330–379, and MKK d296. Normal cells displayed a diffuse homogenous HA pattern throughout the cytoplasm and sometimes in nucleus. The punctate pattern of staining was characterized as many distinct spots located throughout the cytoplasm. The third pattern of HA-MKK1 staining consisted of large aggregates often localized in the perinuclear region. Abnormally shaped nuclei were determined by the appearance of invaginations of the nuclear envelope and a bilobed nuclear shape that has been described as an early indicator of apoptosis (19Johnson V.L. Ko S.C. Holmstrom T.H. Eriksson J.E. Chow S.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2941-2953PubMed Google Scholar, 20Krajci D. Mares V. Lisa V. Spanova A. Vorlicek J. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Abnormal nuclei were counted in cells transfected with MKK1 wild type, MKK d330–379, MKK d330, and MKK d296, and in adjacent nontransfected cells under each of these conditions. A total of 276, 255, and 225 adjacent untransfected cells were examined from three separate experiments following transfections with MKK1 wild type, MKK d330, and MKK d296, respectively. A total of 180, 92, and 102 cells were examined that were also transfected with MKK1 wild type, MKK d330, and MKK d296, respectively. In two separate experiments, 65 cells transfected with MKK d330–379 were examined along with 98 adjacent untransfected cells. Analysis of apoptosis was performed by immunofluorescence examining fragmented DNA labeled on the 3′-hydroxyl ends using rhodamine-conjugated dUTP (Apoptag, Intergen Co., S7165) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The number of cells that showed positive DNA fragmentation was calculated under each condition and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted with DAPI. A total of 200–826 cells were counted in each experiment with cells transfected with MKK1 wild type, MKK d330–379, MKK d330, and MKK d296, respectively. Statistical analysis was done using Student’s t test comparing each of the MKK1 C-terminal deletion mutants with MKK1 wild type. The C-terminal region of MKK1 has been proposed to regulate protein function through targeted phosphorylation and interactions with proteins possibly through a proline-rich domain (8Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Dang A. Frost J.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19909-19913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Jelinek T. Catling A.D. Reuter C.W. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To examine the function of the C-terminal region of MKK1, we generated HA-tagged MKK1 mutants containing deletions in this region. Fig.1 shows the MKK1 mutants used in these studies. Using MKK1 wild type (amino acids 1–393) as a template, C-terminal deletion mutants MKK 1–379 (MKK d379), MKK 1–330 (MKK d330), and MKK 1–296 (MKK d296) were generated (Fig. 1). MKK d379 and d330 mutants lack the Thr-386 phosphorylation site but retain the proline-rich region between amino acids 270 and 307 that has previously been identified to be important for MKK interactions with Raf-1 and ERK activation (7Catling A.D. Schaeffer H.J. Reuter C.W. Reddy G.R. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5214-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The expression of the MKK1 mutants was examined in cells following transient transfection and immunoblotting. Protein expression levels for MKK1 wild type and C-terminal deletion mutants was determined in protein lysates generated by solubilizing cells in 1% Triton X-100 or in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Immunoblot analysis showed lower levels of protein expression in MKK d330 and MKK d296 mutants as compared with MKK wild type or MKK d379 in cells extracted with 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 2 A). However, the addition of 0.1% SDS to the lysis buffer resulted in a similar extraction of all MKK1 proteins (Fig. 2 A). These data suggested that deletion of the C-terminal regions between amino acids 330 and 379 caused re-localization of MKK1 to a Triton X-100-insoluble cellular compartment. To confirm the importance of this region on MKK localization, the solubility of the MKK1 mutant with only these 49 amino acids deleted (MKK d330–379) was tested. Similar to MKK d330 and d296, the presence of 0.1% SDS was required to extract the MKK d330–379 protein (Fig. 2 B). Thus, these data indicated a C-terminal region that was important for maintaining MKK1 protein in a soluble cytoplasmic location. To further confirm the altered localization of MKK1 mutants lacking regions of the C terminus, we examined the expression of the MKK1 mutant proteins in cells by immunofluorescence. HeLa cells expressing HA-tagged MKK1 wild type or MKK d379 showed a typical diffuse staining pattern throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.3, A and B). The nuclear localization of MKK1 could be because of high protein expression levels as observed in other systems (22Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pages G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In contrast, MKK d330–379, MKK d330, and MKK d296 deletion mutants all showed a dramatic localization to varying sized punctate structures often located to the perinuclear region but also scattered throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, C–E). The percentage of transfected cells displaying a normal (Fig. 3, A and B), punctate (Fig. 3 E), or aggregate (Fig. 3, C and D) HA staining patterns was determined in cells expressing MKK1 wild type and the d296 mutant. Approximately 75–80% of the transfected cells expressing the MKK1 d296 mutant showed a punctate or aggregate HA staining pattern compared with none in cells transfected with MKK1 wild type (Fig. 3 F). Similar results were obtained with cells expressing d330 and d330–379 mutants (data not shown). To further demonstrate that deletion of a MKK1 C-terminal region between residues 330 and 379 targeted MKK1 to cellular membranes, cell lysates were partially fractionated into cytosolic, membrane, and nuclear proteins as described previously (18Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 G, the MKK d330–379 mutant was found exclusively in the membrane protein fraction compared with MKK1 wild type, which could be found in both cytosolic and membrane protein fractions. We further confirmed the validity of this method for generating cytosolic and membrane proteins by immunoblotting for endogenous MKK1 and ERK2, the Golgi complex protein GM130 as an intracellular membrane marker, and the nuclear protein topoisomerase IIα. As shown in Fig. 3 H, endogenous MKK1 is found primarily found in the cytosolic fractions, whereas endogenous ERK2 is found primarily in the cytosolic fraction but also in the membrane and nuclear fractions. In contrast, the intracellular membrane protein, GM130, and the nuclear protein, topoisomerase IIα, are found only in the membrane and nuclear fractions, respectively (Fig. 3 H). The irregular pattern of staining with the HA-MKK1 deletion mutants was similar to nonhomogenous size or distribution that is characteristic of lysosome organelles (23Dell'Angelica E.C. Mullins C. Caplan S. Bonifacino J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1265-1278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm localization of MKK1 mutants to lysosomes, transfected cells were incubated with a commercially available probe that is specific for acidic organelles, such as lysosomal compartments (LysoTracker dye, see “Experimental Procedures”). MKK1 wild type showed a typically diffuse HA staining pattern and no apparent overlap with the lysosome marker (Fig.4 A). In comparison, the aggregate and punctate staining pattern shown in two views of MKK d296 mutants displayed some degree of overlap with lysosome compartments (Fig. 4, B and C). The aggregate HA staining pattern showed higher levels of lysosome co-localization compared with the punctate HA staining pattern and could indicate different stages of MKK processing and targeting to lysosomal compartments (Fig. 4,B and C). These data indicate that the C-terminal region of MKK1 functions in maintaining the protein in a soluble cytoplasmic location and prevents targeting to lysosomes. In some cases, visual inspection of cells expressing MKK d330 or MKK d296 showed a greater numbers of detached floating cells compared with MKK1 wild type expressing cells and suggested these cells were susceptible to cell death (data not shown). To examine whether the C-terminal region is involved in cell viability, MKK1 expression levels were examined in adherent and floating cells lysed in the presence of 0.1% SDS. Immunoblot analysis for HA-MKK1 shows the expression levels for wild type and C-terminal mutants in the adherent cell lysates (Fig. 5,A and B, top panel). In Fig. 5 A, the expression of MKK1 wild type (lane 2) was found exclusively in the adherent cells, whereas high levels of expression for MKK d330 and MKK d296 were also apparent in the floating cell lysates (Fig. 5 A, top panel, lanes 4 and 5). MKK d379 also showed some expression in the floating cells, although at lower levels compared with the other C-terminal deletion mutants (Fig.5 A, lane 3). Similarly, high levels of MKK d330–379 expression were apparent in floating cells compared with MKK1 wild type (Fig. 5 B). The total number of floating cells was not apparently much different between any of the conditions, as evidenced by similar levels of α-tubulin, and suggested that the transfection conditions alone, not surprisingly, cause some cell toxicity (Fig. 5, A and B, lower panel). However, the high levels of MKK1 expression in the floating cells of the cells expressing C-terminal deletion mutants indicated these cells were more susceptible to cell death as compared with cells expressing MKK1 wild type. The role of the C-terminal region of MKK1 is supporting cell viability was further examined by evaluating changes in nuclear structure as an indicator of early apoptotic events (19Johnson V.L. Ko S.C. Holmstrom T.H. Eriksson J.E. Chow S.C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2941-2953PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclei from untransfected and transfected cells were examined for normal round appearance and abnormal shapes characterized by the bilobed appearance shown in the DAPI staining in Fig. 3 D. Cells transfected with MKK1 wild type showed less than 10% of the cells contained abnormally nuclei (Fig. 5 C). Similar results were obtained with cells expressing MKK d379 (data not shown). In contrast, expression of MKK d330–379, d330, and d296 mutants resulted in a significantly higher percentage of transfected cells that contained abnormal nuclei structure (Fig. 5 C). Adjacent untransfected cells under these conditions also showed increased number of cells containing abnormally shaped nuclei as compared with untransfected cells adjacent to cells transfected with MKK1 wild type (Fig. 5 C). The previous data indicated that expression of MKK1 lacking C-terminal amino acid residues from 330 to 379 was toxic to cells. To further establish the effects of MKK1 mutants on cells, DNA fragmentation as a marker of apoptosis was examined. Fragmented DNA was fluorescently labeled (see “Experimental Procedures”) in cells expressing MKK1 wild type, d330–379, d330, or d296, and the percentage of positively labeled cells were calculated. Fig. 5 D shows an image of apoptotic cells found in cells transfected with MKK d296 (bottom right panel) or MKK1 wild type (upper right panel). Cells expressing MKK d330–379, d330, or d296 showed ∼2–2.5 times more apoptotic cells as compared with cells expressing MKK1 wild type (Fig.5 E). These findings indicate that the C-terminal region of MKK1 spanning amino acids 330–379 functions in promoting cell viability and protects against cell death. The effects of the MKK1 C-terminal region on cell proliferation was examined in cells transiently transfected with MKK1 wild type and MKK1 C-terminal deletion mutants. In agreement with the data presented above, the proliferation of cells expressing the MKK1 C-terminal deletions d330–379 or d330 for 20 h was inhibited as measured by direct cell counting (Fig.6 A) or by the conversion of MTS tetrazolium to formazan as an indicator of cell viability (Fig.6 B). Thus, these data point to an integral role for the C-terminal region of MKK1 in promoting cell viability. To examine a possible mechanism to explain the loss of cell viability with the MKK1 C-terminal deletion mutants, MKK1 and ERK activation was tested in transfected cells following growth factor treatment or co-expression of constitutively active Raf-1. First, cells expressing HA-MKK1 and HA-ERK2 were stimulated with phorbol ester (PMA) or with epidermal growth factor (EGF) to activate the MKK/ERK pathway. Both PMA and EGF activated ERK in cells transfected with MKK1 wild type or d379 (Fig. 7 A). In contrast, cells expressing MKK d330 or d296 showed marked attenuation of PMA or EGF-induced ERK activation (Fig. 7 A). The higher basal activity of MKK d379 compared with MKK1 wild type is consistent with the previously reported phosphorylation of threonine 386 acting as a negative inhibitor of MKK1 activity (8Brunet A. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similarly, cells expressing the MKK d330–379 mutant were also defective in ERK activation in response to EGF stimulation (Fig. 7 C). To test whether the diminished ERK activation was the result of defects in MKK interactions with the upstream Raf-1 kinase, cells were transfected with MKK1 wild type or MKK1 deletion mutants in the absence or presence of constitutively active Raf-1 and MKK activity was determined by immunoblotting for phosphorylated MKK. The phosphorylation of MKK1 wild type and d379 was significantly enhanced by the expression of Raf-BXB (Fig. 7 B). However, MKK d330–379, d330, and d296 mutants were unable to be significantly phosphorylated by active Raf-1 (Fig. 7 B). These data indicate that C-terminal amino acid residues between 330 and 379 on MKK1 regulate coupling of MKK with upstream activators possibly through changes in cellular location. In addition, C terminus-dependent disruption of MKK activation and ERK pathway signaling may account for the observed decrease in cell proliferation and viability. In these studies, we demonstrate that the amino acids sequence between residues 330 and 379 in C terminus of MKK1 is important for maintaining MKK1 as a soluble cytoplasmic protein. Importantly, this region appears to protect the viability of cells by protecting the integrity of the Raf/MKK/ERK signaling pathway. Other studies have reported that the proline-rich region located between amino acids 262 and 307 of MKK1 and MKK2 may function in regulating interactions with c-Raf-1 (21Jelinek T. Catling A.D. Reuter C.W. Moodie S.A. Wolfman A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8212-8218Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although our studies did not attempt to reproduce these findings, we provide evidence that C-terminal amino acid residues from 330 to 379, which are outside of the proline-rich domain of MKK1, are also important for Raf-1 coupling. In addition, this region between residues 330 and 379 does not contain any of the putative C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation sites. Thus, the C terminus of MKK1 may use multiple mechanisms for regulating protein interactions and ERK signaling necessary for cell growth and survival. Based on the requirement for SDS to extract MKK1 mutant proteins and immunofluorescence data (Figs. 2 and 3), our findings indicate that MKK1 proteins lacking amino acids 330–379 cannot be activated by Raf-1 because of the inability for the two proteins to physically interact. The punctate MKK1 staining pattern shown in Fig. 3 with the C-terminal deletion mutants is likely a form of MKK1 that is inaccessible to interactions with Raf-1. Further evidence to support these findings is presented by the attenuated phosphorylation of MKK d330–379, d330, and d296 deletion mutants in response to constitutively active Raf-1 as compared with MKK1 wild type or d379 mutant (Fig. 7 B). The amino acid residues between 330 and 379 on MKK1 may also function in facilitating a proper structural conformational on MKK1 that allows the proper protein-protein interactions between Raf-1 and subsequent phosphorylation. Thus, MKK1 activity may be regulated through mechanisms that involve both changes in intracellular localization and structural constraints. In the absence of a crystallographic structure for MKK1, it remains to be determined how the C-terminal region could function in regulating interactions with upstream activators or substrates. Nonetheless, preliminary predictions of the structure of MKK1 indicate that the C-terminal region between residues 330 and 379 contains two putative α-helices that may be in contact with N-terminal regions that are important for activity (15Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, changes in the flexibility of the C-terminal region of MKK1 during activation, as determined by deuterium exchange experiments, may affect N-terminal interactions with ERK substrate or ATP binding (15Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Future studies aimed at characterizing the structural components of MKK proteins will be necessary for determining the functional significance of the C-terminal region in regulating MKK1 activity. The targeting of MKK1 C-terminal deletion mutants to lysosomal compartments and the enhanced stringency required for protein extraction suggest a unique function for this region in maintaining MKK1 proteins as soluble cytoplasmic proteins. One potential role for the C-terminal region of MKK1 is to mask a lysosomal targeting sequence that functions in regulating MKK1 stability and turnover. Two sequences that are recognized to target proteins to lysosome, endosome, or trans-Golgi compartments include the YXX O motif (where Y is tyrosine, X is any amino acid, and O is a bulky hydrophobic residue) or dileucine (LL) signals (24Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MKK1 contains such a sequence Y130GAF133 in a putative N-terminal β-sheet within the ATP binding region. Whether this sequence functions in directing the intracellular MKK1 localization and is regulated by interactions with C-terminal sequences is currently under investigation. Other examples exist that demonstrate a role for ERK pathway proteins in regulating substrate protein localization. The ERK substrate p90Rsk has been shown to regulate NF-κB nuclear targeting by phosphorylating IκB-α, stimulating IκB-α degradation, and allowing the exposure of a NF-κB nuclear localization signal (25Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Similarly, the C-terminal region of MKK1 could function in coordinating protein interactions that direct MKK1 to the lysosome for degradation. Protein aggregation has been postulated as a mechanism for targeting proteins to the lysosome (26Wolins N. Bosshart H. Kuster H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1735-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of MKK1 may also function in preventing protein aggregation and lysosomal degradation. This is supported by our immunofluorescence data, which show a high level of co-localization between aggregated MKK1 C-terminal deletion mutant proteins and lysosomal compartments (Fig. 4). The mechanisms responsible for targeting MKK1 proteins lacking amino acids 330–379 to intracellular membranes and determining whether MKK1 mutants are packaged within lysosome/endosome vesicles or are in tight association with the cytoplasmic face of the lysosomal/endosomal membrane are not known. Recently, it has been suggested that ERK and MKK proteins may be targeted to the cytoplasmic face of endosomal/lysosomal compartments through the MKK1-binding protein, MP1, and a novel p14 scaffolding protein (27Wunderlich W. Fialka I. Teis D. Alpi A. Pfeifer A. Parton R.G. Lottspeich F. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This targeting of MKK/ERK components to lysosome or other intracellular membranes is suggested to be another mechanism for regulating compartmentalized ERK pathway activity. Another example of compartmentalized activation of the MKK/ERK pathway is suggested by MKK1’s involvement in regulating mitotic Golgi fragmentation through a process involving proteolytic processing (28Colanzi A. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These studies reported that MKK1 activity is required for mitotic Golgi fragmentation and suggested that the phosphorylated active form of MKK1 undergoes a conformational change during mitosis that makes MKK1 susceptible to limited proteolysis. Although a corresponding ERK activity was not shown to be required in these studies, work from our laboratory has recently reported that ERK proteins phosphorylated only on the tyrosine within the threonine-glutamate-tyrosine tripeptide activation motif associate with the Golgi complex during G2/M transitions and regulate Golgi structure through a kinase-independent mechanism (18Cha H. Shapiro P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1355-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Whether limited proteolysis of MKK proteins directs active MKK1 to membranes to generate partially phosphorylated ERK proteins on the Golgi complex during mitotic transition remains to be determined. Finally, MKK proteolysis may also function in response to apoptotic signals. A recent report describes the generation of a caspase-dependent 33-kDa fragment from MKK1 or MKK2, which may function in down-regulating ERK activity and cell survival, in cells treated with vitamin D3 to induce apoptosis (29McGuire T.F. Trump D.L. Johnson C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26365-26373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The protease that targets MKK proteins and cleavage site under these conditions has yet to determined. Thus, mitotic and apoptotic pathways may use similar mechanisms of regulated MKK proteolysis as a means of modulating ERK activity and signaling pathways required for cell viability.

In this study, we localized the DnaX-binding domain of δ′ to its carboxyl-terminal domain III by quantifying protein-protein interactions using a series of δ′ fusion proteins lacking specific domains. The fusion protein corresponding to domain III of δ′ bound to DnaX with an affinity approaching that of full-length δ′. In contrast, a construct bearing δ′ domains I-II did not bind DnaX at detectable levels. The presence of δ and χψ strengthened the interaction of DnaX with full-length δ′ and δ′ domain III. Thus, domain III of δ′ not only contains the DnaX-binding site, but also contains the elements required for positive cooperative assembly of the DnaX complex.

The δ′ subunit is a C-shaped molecule comprised of three structural domains determined by x-ray crystallography (9Guenther B.D.

Understanding the mechanism of clamp loading requires a detailed structure-function study of the prototypical E. coli DnaX complex. Among the DnaX complex subunits, δ′ provides a representative example to achieve insight into the architecture and possible mechanisms of action of the basic components of these molecular machines.

The bound and unbound fractions of δ′ to DnaX were quantified using the method of Kim and McHenry (31Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20699-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) except that δ and χψ were also included when indicated. The amount of δ′ bound to DnaX was determined by comparing the shift in the elution position of δ′ in the presence and absence of DnaX. Although δ′ can associate equally well with either of the two DnaX proteins in vitro (16Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4447-4453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we recently discovered that it binds to γ, but not τ, within the DnaX complex of the native holoenzyme (11Glover B.P. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3017-3020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Many of the experiments presented in this report use the τ subunit; these studies were conducted before we learned of the exclusive δ′-γ interaction within the native holoenzyme. However, we have confirmed that thein vitro interactions between δ′ and either of the two different DnaX proteins are similar (experiments reported in Fig. 3 and other data that are not shown). Thus, these data may be taken as reflective of general DnaX binding properties. Molar excesses of δ and χψ were used in all binding experiments. The interaction of DnaX and δ′ in the absence or presence of molar excesses δ and χψ, was modeled as δ′ + DnaX = δ′·DnaX, where the apparent KD of δ′-DnaX interaction was defined as KD = [δ′f][DnaXf]/[δ′·DnaX]. The molar concentration of δ′ bound to DnaX was determined from the equation: [δ′·DnaX] = (Iδ′·DnaX/Iδ′T)[δ′T], where [δ′T] is the total molar concentration of δ′ loaded onto the column, Iδ′T is the total intensity from all the δ′ bands (bound plus unbound), and Iδ′·DnaX is the total intensity of bands corresponding to δ′ bound to DnaX from the stained gel. The amounts of free DnaX (τf) and free δ′ (δ′f) were then determined from mass conversion: [DnaXf] = [DnaXT] − [δ′·DnaX] (DnaXT is the total initial molar concentration of DnaX) and [δ′f] = [δ′T] − [δ′·DnaX]. Subsaturating amounts of δ′ relative to DnaX4 were applied to gel filtration for the KD quantification; at least two different concentrations of δ′ were used in these experiments. Protein concentrations were not constant during these binding studies because significant dilution occurs during gel filtration. For this reason, KD values were also calculated as a range varying from the concentration of components in the applied sample (300 μl) to the diluted elution volume (1.2–1.6 ml) (31Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20699-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The calculated ranges represent lower and upper limits, enabling a comparison of the relative affinity between DnaX and δ′ derivatives since all gel filtration were performed under the same conditions. The effect of monoclonal antibodies on the δ′-DnaX interaction and cooperative DnaX complex assembly were assessed using Biacore technology. To immobilize anti-δ′ mAb, anti-mouse Fc was chemically coupled to the CM5 sensor chip using an amine coupling reaction ofN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide followed by ethanolamine inactivation as described (14Song M.-S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40668-40679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and then anti-δ′ mAb was captured by the immobilized anti-mouse Fc in HBS buffer. Unoccupied binding sites were blocked by injecting the nonspecific mouse IgG. Native δ′ was then injected repeatedly to saturate the immobilized anti-δ′ mAb-binding sites. In separate experiments, samples containing 2 μm δ, τ4, δ + τ4, or δ + τ4 + χψ, were injected over the immobilized δ′·mAb complex at 20 °C in HBS buffer at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For a control experiment, each of δ, τ4, δ + τ4, or δ + τ4 + χψ, was injected over δ′ in the absence of mAb, where δ′ was immobilized directly without using mAb on the sensor chip via amine coupling methods as described (14Song M.-S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40668-40679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).KD values were calculated from the determined kinetic parameters (KD =koff/kon; wherekon is association rate constant andkoff is dissociation rate constant) obtained from binding association and dissociation phases of Biacore sensorgram using the BIAevaluation 2.1 software (Biacore). After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred onto the transfer membranes and developed as described (14Song M.-S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40668-40679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We have reported the construction of a series of plasmids that produce proteins lacking specific domains of δ′ (14Song M.-S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40668-40679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Either the amino or carboxyl terminus of each of these δ′ derivatives is fused with a hexahistidine sequence and a short sequence that is biotinylatedin vivo to facilitate purification, detection, and immobilization (14Song M.-S. Dallmann H.G. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40668-40679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We assessed the ability of δ′ fusion proteins to interact with DnaX using gel filtration. Different concentrations (0.83, 2.3, and 5.0 μm) of full-length δ′ tagged at its COOH-terminal end, δ′C, were incubated with τ followed by gel filtration, and binding was monitored by evaluating Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels of Superose 6 gel filtration fractions (Fig. 1). The τ subunit by itself eluted earlier (Fig. 1A, fractions 31–33) due to its higher molecular weight (τ4, 280 kDa), and a lower molecular weight δ′C (40.8 kDa) by itself eluted in later fractions (Fig. 1B, fractions 44–45). When δ′C was incubated with τ prior to gel filtration, its elution position was shifted to a higher molecular weight (Fig.1C, from fractions 41–47 to 29–33), indicating an interaction. The densitometric scan of the protein bands in the gel permitted estimation an δ′C-τ KDbetween 1.9 and 3.8 μm indicating a relatively weak interaction (Table I). TheKD determined by gel filtration was comparable to the value obtained using a Biacore for the binding of native δ′ and immobilized, tagged DnaX (KD = ∼0.5–1 μm) (16Gao D. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4447-4453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unlike full-length δ′ fusion protein with either an amino- or carboxyl-terminal tag, IC, II + IIIN, or I + IIC at concentrations up to 9–11 μm, did not co-elute with τ in gel filtration (Table I) (Fig. 1). This indicates that the δ′ fusion proteins lacking domain I or domain III did not form a gel filterable complex with DnaX at least a detectable level. However, due to the relatively weak interaction of δ′ with DnaX alone, even a modest decrease in KDwould result in undetectable complex formation under our experimental conditions. To overcome this obstacle to binding determination, we exploited the ability of δ and χ-ψ to enhance the apparent affinity of δ′ and DnaX.Table IRelative affinities of the interaction of δ′ proteins lacking specific domains with DnaX in the absence or presence of molar excesses of δ and χΨ as determined by Superose 6 gel filtration analysisProteinsKD1-aThe KD of δ′ fusion protein-τ interaction in the absence of δ and χΨ.− δ, χΨApparentKD1-bThe KD of δ′ fusion protein-τ interaction in the presence of molar excess of δ + χΨ. 6.6 μm δ + χΨ and 2.3 μm τ4 were used unless otherwise stated.

https://openalex.org/W1786644298,"The receptor for the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) associates the low affinity binding component gp190 and the high affinity converter gp130, both of which are members of the family of hematopoietic receptors characterized by the cytokine receptor homology (CRH) domain. The gp190 is among the very few members of this large family to contain two CRH domains. The membrane-distal one (herein called D1) is followed by an Ig-like domain, a membrane-proximal CRH domain called D2, and three type III fibronectin repeats. We raised a series of monoclonal antibodies specific for the human gp190. Among them was the blocking antibody 1C7, which was directed against the D1Ig region and which impaired the binding of LIF to gp190. Another blocking antibody, called 12D3, was directed against domain D2 and interfered with the reconstitution of the high affinity receptor complex, independently of the interaction between LIF and gp190. The blocking effect of these two antibodies concerned four cytokines known to use gp190, i.e. LIF, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1. Among 23 antibodies tested alone or in combination (two anti-D2 and 21 anti-D1Ig), only the mixture of the two anti-D2 antibodies displayed agonistic activity in the absence of the cytokine.

The amino-terminal one contains several conserved disulfide bonds, whereas the carboxyl-terminal one comprises the consensus WSX WS amino acid sequence. The extracellular region of gp190 is unusual in that it has two CRH domains, which we called D1 for the amino-terminal membrane distal one and D2 for the membrane proximal one. D1 and D2 are separated by an Ig-like module of around 100 amino acids, and D2 is followed by three 100-amino acid-long type III fibronectin modules, the FN region (1Gearing D.P. Thut C.J.

Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), namely LIF, oncostatin M (OSM), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), and the very recently discovered neurotrophin-1/B cell-stimulating factor 3 (3Senaldi G. Varnum B.C. Sarmiento U. Starnes C. Lile J. Scully S. Guo J. Elliott G. McNich J. Shaklee C.L. Freeman D. Manu F. Simonet W.S. Boone T. Chang M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11458-11463Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Given the structural complexity of gp190, very few data relative to the function of each module are available to date. Other receptor chains in humans also have two CRH domains, such as the common β-chain for IL-3, IL-5, and GM-CSF (the β-common), the thrombopoeitin receptor, the leptin receptor, and the OSM-specific receptor that lacks the amino-terminal half of the first CRH. In the β-common and the thrombopoeitin receptor, the two CRH are adjacent to each other. In these cases, the available data suggest that only the membrane proximal one for the β-common (4D'Andrea R.J. Barry S.C. Moretti P.A.B. Jones K. Ellis S. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J.

Blood. 1999; 94: 365-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is involved in ligand interactions. In the case of gp190, OSM-specific receptor, and leptin receptor, an Ig-like module is intercalated between the two CRH, with potentially important consequences on receptor function. The Ig-like module could act as a spacer or a hinge between the two CRH, giving flexibility for both of them either to participate to ligand binding or to interact with each other, as we recently suggested for human gp190 in a recent work (7Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it could also directly participate in ligand binding, and we recently described a ligand-binding site for human LIF at its carboxyl terminus (7Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V.

Taking advantage of the finding that murine gp190 displays a 30–100 times higher affinity for human LIF than human gp190 does (8Layton M.J. Lock P. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17048-17055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has been demonstrated using human-murine chimeric gp190 that the Ig-like module was responsible for the species specificity of gp190 for LIF. In this study, a human gp190 where the Ig-like module was replaced with its murine homolog also displayed a high affinity for human LIF (9Owczarek C.M. Zhang Y. Layton M.J. Metcalf D. Robertes B. Nicola N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23976-23985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the LIF-binding site we identified also belonged to the Ig-like module as defined in the chimeras made by these authors. Therefore, the complex modular architecture of gp190 most probably reflects specific functions for the Ig-like module as well as for each of the CRH domains. In addition, there could be important differences with respect to gp190 engagement between the cytokines that share gp190. We previously obtained a series of mAbs specific for human gp190 (10Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). One of them (1C7) displayed a LIF blocking activity via impairment of LIF/gp190 interaction and was directed against a conformation-dependent epitope localized within D1Ig (7Taupin J.L. Miossec V.

In this report, we describe the functional properties of another blocking antibody, called 12D3, which is directed against the D2 domain. Comparison of these two anti-gp190 mAbs between each other and with the available data on gp190 gives new insight into gp190 structure-function relationships. The anti-gp190 mAb 12D3 was produced in the laboratory according to the protocol described in Ref. 10Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K.

The obtaining and the mapping of mAbs 1C7, 10B2, and 8C2 have already been described (10Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y.

The lack of anti-gp130 cross-reactivity of the anti-gp190 mAbs was ascertained by testing them on a CHO cell line stably expressing human gp130 but not gp190. In all of the assays performed in this study, the mAbs were used after purification from mouse ascites by affinity chromatography on a protein A column followed by extensive dialysis against PBS buffer and sterilization by filtration, as described (10Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The anti-gp130 mAb B-R3 was purchased from Diaclone (Besançon, France). Obtaining the secreted Myc-tagged gp190 deletion mutants (D1IgD2myc and D2FNmyc) from stably transfected CHO cells has been described elsewhere (7Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F.

These cell lines were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 ng/ml CHO-derived recombinant human LIF. The Ba/F3 cell line expressing gp130 and the IL-6 low affinity receptor gp80 was obtained in a similar fashion, with a selection of transfected cells in the presence of recombinant COS-derived human IL-6. For the cell culture experiments, the following cytokines were used: murine IL-3 was in the form of a transfected COS cell supernatant, human LIF was in the form of a transfected CHO cell supernatant (11Taupin J.L. Gualde N. Moreau J.F. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and human Escherichia coli-derived OSM, CNTF, and CT-1 were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Metabolic labeling of the recombinant secreted Myc-tagged gp190 deletion mutants D1IgD2myc and D2FNmyc or of LIF was performed on confluent monolayers of CHO cells, 3–4 weeks after transfection (around 107 cells/dish). The cells were starved for 2 h in 4 ml of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium without methionine and cysteine supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. 200 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Translabel, ICN, Orsay, France) were added per dish for 12 h. Then, supernatants were harvested, centrifuged to remove debris, and stored at 4 °C until used. To analyze the region of gp190 recognized by mAb 12D3, 1 ml of CHO supernatant containing the soluble receptor was precleared with 0.05 ml of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Affi-Gel protein A, Bio-Rad, Ivry-sur-Seine, France) for 1 h at 4 °C under continuous rolling. The beads were eliminated by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated with 20 μg of the indicated mAb for 2 h under similar conditions. Immune complexes bound to protein A were sedimented by rapid centrifugation, and beads were washed three times with 1 ml of washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0). The bead pellets were resuspended in 0.025 ml of sample loading buffer containing 0.1 m dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and visualized by fluorography. To study the formation of the LIF-gp190 ligand-receptor low affinity complex in the presence of the anti-gp190 monoclonal antibodies, 0.65 ml of a CHO cell supernatant containing the nonlabeled receptor was first incubated for 1 h with 0.35 ml of35S-labeled CHO-derived LIF. Then the indicated mAbs were added (20 μg) for another 2 h in a 0.05-ml volume. The complexes were immunoprecipitated with protein A, as described above. For the proliferation assays, we used the following Ba/F3 transfectants: Ba/F3 gp190 + gp130, Ba/F3 gp190/130 + gp130, Ba/F3 gp190/130, and Ba/F3 gp130 + gp80 cell lines. The proliferation assays were conducted as follows. Cultured Ba/F3 cells were washed three times with RPMI to remove the cytokine used routinely to sustain proliferation, and then cells (5 × 103/well in 50 μl, in duplicate) were incubated in the presence of 50 μl of 2- or 3-fold dilutions of cytokines and/or monoclonal antibody(ies), as indicated. After 3 days at 37 °C, 0.015 ml of a 5 mg/ml solution of MTT (Sigma) in PBS was added to each well. After 4 h at 37 °C, 0.11 ml of a mixture of 95% isopropanol and 5% formic acid was added to the wells, and the absorbance values were read in a Titertek Multiskan microplate reader (Labsystems, Les Ullis, France) at 570 nm. The blank consisted of eight wells containing the cells incubated with culture medium without any added cytokine. For the proliferation experiments of Ba/F3 cell lines in response to the cytokines sharing gp190, the cytokines LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1 or IL-3 as a control were 3-fold serially diluted and directly added to the washed cells. For the blocking experiments conducted with anti-gp190 mAbs, 2-fold dilutions of mAb were preincubated (20 μl/well) with the washed Ba/F3 cells (70 μl/well) for 30 min at 37 °C to saturate the receptors before the addition of 10 μl/well of a subsaturating concentration of cytokine (final concentrations, 100 pg/ml for LIF, 5 ng/ml for OSM, 5 ng/ml for CT-1, 1 μg/ml for CNTF, or 2 units/ml for murine IL-3). For the proliferation experiments involving the agonistic mAb combination, the washed Ba/F3 cells were directly incubated with the antibodies alone or in combination by pairs, at fixed concentration and/or 2-fold serially diluted, as indicated. For each staining, 2×105 cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with saturating concentrations (10 μg/ml) of the indicated antibody in 0.1 ml of PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% human polyclonal IgG (w/v, both from Sigma). The cells were then washed twice with the same buffer and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. After washing with PBS, the cells were resuspended in 0.14 ml of PBS containing 1% formaldehyde (v/v) and analyzed by flow cytometry with a three color FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) equipped with the CellQuest software. E. coli-derived human LIF (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) was iodinated according to the chloramine T method as described (12Godard A. Heymann D. Raher S. Anegon I. Peyrat M.A. Le Mauff B. Mouray E.

The plastic-adherent human choriocarcinoma JAR cell line was cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, harvested by treatment with trypsin, then washed three times, and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cells (106/well in 96-well round bottom plates) were incubated with increasing concentrations of iodinated LIF in the presence or in the absence of a constant and saturating concentration of the nonlabeled competitor mAb (100 nm for 9E10, 8C2, B-R3, 12D3, and 667 nm for 1C7) in a final volume of 50 μl/well. Because of its very low affinity for gp190, a higher concentration of 1C7 was required (13Blanchard F. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Raher S. Hallet M.M. Moreau J.F. Godard A. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was evaluated by including a 100-fold excess of unlabeled LIF. Incubation was carried out under agitation for 90 min at 4 °C. Cell bound and unbound fractions were separated by centrifugation through a dibutylphtalate cushion at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The binding data were subjected to regression analysis using a one-site equilibrium-binding equation (Grafit, Erathicus Software, Staines, UK). To measure the affinity of mAbs 12D3 and 8C2 for human gp190, CHO cells stably expressing gp190 (14Heymann D. Godard A. Raher S. Bentouimou N. Blanchard F. Cherel M. Hallet M.M. Jacques Y. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were used. The mAbs were labeled with iodine, and the experiments were conducted essentially as previously described (13Blanchard F. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Raher S. Hallet M.M. Moreau J.F. Godard A. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We have generated 35 monoclonal antibodies specific for the human gp190 cytokine receptor, some of them having already been described (10Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Only two, the previously described 1C7 (10Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Blanchard F. Cransac M. Jollet I. Vernallis A. Hudson K. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 205: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and the recently generated 12D3, could inhibit the LIF-induced proliferation of transfected Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type gp190 and gp130 in a MTT assay. When incubated in the presence of subsaturating concentrations of each of four cytokines sharing gp190 for their high affinity receptors (LIF, OSM, CNTF, and CT-1), both antibodies were able to block in a dose-dependent manner their proliferative effects (Fig.1, middle and right panels). In contrast, none of them did affect IL-3-induced proliferation, and the control anti-gp190 mAb 8C2 (Fig. 1, left panel) had no effect on the proliferation induced by any of these five cytokines. Therefore, the blocking effects of 1C7 and 12D3 were specific to gp190 receptor function. The inhibitory activities of mAbs 1C7 and 12D3 were roughly similar toward all cytokines tested: CHO-derived LIF (molecular mass, 43 kDa), E. coli-derived OSM (molecular mass, 26 kDa), and E. coli-derived CNTF (molecular mass, 23 kDa), with IC50 values of around 2–4 and 0.5–1 μg/ml for mAbs 1C7 and 12D3, respectively. In comparison, both mAbs displayed a approximately six times better blocking efficiency toward E. coli-derived CT-1 (molecular mass, 22 kDa), because its IC50 was around 0.5 and 0.1 μg/ml for 1C7 and 12D3, respectively. This discrepancy could not be explained by a difference in molarity of the cytokines used in the assay, because the molecular mass of CT-1 was very close to that of OSM or CNTF. Using Myc-tagged soluble deletion mutants of gp190, we previously established that 1C7 recognized an epitope localized within the D1Ig region of gp190 (7Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A similar approach was undertaken to map the region recognized by 12D3. The two deletion mutants, D1IgD2myc and D2FNmyc, were stably expressed in CHO cells and metabolically labeled. The supernatants were harvested and immunoprecipitated with 1C7, 12D3, or the anti-c-Myc 9E10 mAb as a positive control, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2). As expected, the 9E10 antibody could immunoprecipitate both tagged receptor fragments, whereas the 1C7 antibody could immunoprecipitate D1IgD2myc but not D2FNmyc. mAb 12D3 was found to immunoprecipitate both fragments, demonstrating that it recognized an epitope within D2, the only domain shared by the two receptor mutants. Therefore, the two blocking antibodies, 1C7 and 12D3, recognized distinct domains within the extracellular region of gp190. We previously demonstrated that mAb 1C7 competed with LIF for the binding to gp190 in an immunoprecipitation assay (7Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this assay, supernatants of CHO cells producing a secreted Myc-tagged form of the extracellular part of gp190 (herein called sgp190myc) were coincubated with metabolically radiolabeled CHO-derived LIF to allow for the ligand-receptor complex to form. The complexes were then immunoprecipitated by the antibodies under test and electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of LIF was revealed by autoradiography. In the presence of 1C7, no LIF could be coimmunoprecipitated (7Taupin J.L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate whether mAb 12D3 exerted its blocking effects via a similar mechanism, the same assay was carried out with 12D3, and the results were compared with those obtained with the blocking mAb 1C7, the nonblocking mAb 10B2 and the anti-c-Myc mAb 9E10 (Fig.3). As expected, LIF could be immunoprecipitated by the positive control antibodies anti-c-Myc 9E10 and the nonblocking anti-gp190 10B2, demonstrating that the low affinity ligand-receptor complex was efficiently formed under these experimental conditions. Also as expected, the anti-D1Ig mAb 1C7 did not precipitate at all of the LIF-gp190 complexes because of a competition between the ligand and the antibody. In contrast to mAb 1C7, the blocking anti-D2 mAb 12D3 did precipitate LIF as efficiently as mAbs 10B2 or 9E10. Immunoprecipitation of LIF by 9E10, 10B2, and 12D3 mAbs required gp190, because no LIF was detected in the absence of the receptor. Therefore, the blocking anti-D2 mAb 12D3 exerted its inhibitory activity without impairing the formation of the ligand-receptor low affinity complex, contrary to the anti-D1Ig mAb 1C7. The mode of action of mAb 12D3 was further examined by studying its effect on the binding of iodinatedE. coli-derived LIF to the surface of the human choriocarcinoma JAR cell line, which constitutively expresses natural gp190 and gp130 receptor subunits (Fig. 4and Table I). The effect of 12D3 was compared with that of nonblocking mAbs (anti-D2 8C2 and irrelevant antibody) and of other blocking mAbs (1C7 and anti-gp130 B-R3 mAbs). B-R3 inhibits the formation of the high affinity LIF receptor via impairment of LIF-induced heterodimerization of gp130 with gp190 (15Chevalier S. Fourcin M. Robledo O. Wijdenes J. Pouplard-Barthelaix A. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14764-14772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the presence of the control irrelevant antibody, JAR cells only displayed high affinity LIF receptors (2074 ± 106 sites/cell,K d = 95 ± 9 pm), because of equivalent numbers of surface gp130 and gp190 molecules (13Blanchard F. Pitard V. Taupin J.L. Raher S. Hallet M.M. Moreau J.F. Godard A. Jacques Y. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1775-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As expected, the anti-D2 nonblocking mAb 8C2 did not alter LIF binding (2290 ± 217 sites/cell, K d = 93 ± 40 pm), and the anti-gp130 B-R3 mAb only allowed low affinity gp190 receptors to be detected (2770 ± 367 sites/cell,K d = 968 ± 278 pm). In the presence of 1C7, no binding at all could be proven because of inhibition of the interaction between LIF and gp190. In the presence of mAb 12D3, the number of LIF binding sites did not change significantly (2271 ± 253 sites/cell), but their affinity for LIF decreased to values close to the low affinity component (K d = 583 ± 171 pm). Therefore, as suggested by the immunoprecipitation experiments, 12D3 did not impair LIF binding to gp190, but like the anti-gp130 mAb B-R3, it inhibited the recruitment of gp130 to the LIF-gp190 complex.Table IBinding affinity of iodinated LIF for gp190 in the presence of indicated anti-gp190 mAbs (8C2, 1C7, and 12D3), anti-gp130 mAb B-R3, or an irrelevant antibody (control)Competitor mAbNumber of LIF binding sitesK d for LIFKind of affinity of LIF for gp190pmControl2074 ± 10695 ± 9High8C22290 ± 21793 ± 40High1C700No affinityB-R32770 ± 367968 ± 278Low12D32271 ± 253583 ± 171Low Open table in a new tab It has recently been reported, using chimeras consisting of the GM-CSF receptor ectodomain linked to the transmembrane and intracellular region of either gp190 and gp130, that the gp190 intracellular domain, in contrast to the gp130 intracellular domain, was not able to transduce a proliferative signal in Ba/F3 cells upon GM-CSF addition (16Starr R. Novak U. Willson T.A. Inglese M. Murphy V. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J. Ernst M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19982-19986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, to set up a cellular system enabling the detection of anti-gp190 antibodies able to stimulate cell growth, we generated a gp190/130 chimera in which the transmembrane and intracellular region of gp190 was replaced by the corresponding region of gp130. Following transfection in Ba/F3 cells in combination with wild-type gp130, we obtained a cell line that became dependent for its survival and proliferation of LIF, OSM, CNTF or CT-1. Preliminary experiments showed that there was no significant difference in the sensitivity of this cell line to these cytokines as well as to IL-3, as compared with a Ba/F3 cell line that expressed wild-type gp190 together with gp130 (results not shown). This demonstrated that the chimeric gp190/130 receptor behaved identically to the wild-type full-length gp190. The gp190/130 + gp130 Ba/F3 cell line was therefore used to test the functional activity of 23 anti-gp190 mAbs (21 directed against D1Ig and two directed against D2) covering the major epitopes recognized by our set of anti-gp190 antibodies. These mAbs were tested alone or in pair combinations. Of the 253 possible combinations tested, only one displayed an agonistic effect, which strikingly consisted of the association of the two anti-D2 mAbs, 8C2 (nonblocking), and 12D3 (blocking). Fig. 5 displays a few of the combinations tested, especially those including the anti-D1Ig 1C7 blocking antibody, which was never found to be able to trigger an agonistic signal, regardless of the combination tested. When used alone, neither 8C2 nor 12D3 by itself exerted any stimulatory effect on these cells, in a range of concentrations extending from 60 to 0.009 μg/ml (results not shown and Fig.6 B).Figure 6The agonistic activity of mAb combination 8C2 + 12D3 is dose-dependent and specific for Ba/F3 cells expressing the chimeric gp190/130 receptor. In A, Ba/F3 gp190/130 + gp130 cells were washed and incubated with dilutions of LIF (filled circles, stock solution at 50 ng/ml) or of mAb combinations 8C2 + 12D3 (empty circles), 8C2 + 1C7 (empty triangles), or 12D3 + 1C7 (empty squares) from stock solutions at 100 μg/ml each antibody. Proliferation was expressed as percentages of maximal proliferation as defined by the plateau obtained with the highest LIF concentrations (means ± S.D. from three distinct experiments). In B, the Ba/F3 gp190/130 + gp130 cells were washed and incubated with 2-fold dilutions of mAb 8C2 (empty triangles) or 12D3 (filled triangles) from stock solutions at 100 μg/ml, with mAb combination 8C2 + 12D3, with either 8C2 at a fixed 20 μg/ml and 12D3 serially diluted as above (filled circles), or with 12D3 at a fixed 20 μg/ml and 8C2 serially diluted as above (empty circles). In C, the agonistic potential of mAb combination 8C2 + 12D3 was tested as in A with the cell lines Ba/F3 gp190/130 + gp130 (empty circles), Ba/F3 gp130 + gp80 (empty triangles), and Ba/F3 gp190 + gp130 (empty squares).

Reoxygenation after several hours of hypoxia results in new initiations followed by a nearly synchronous round of SV40 replication. In this communication, we examined the effect of glucose on inhibition of viral DNA replication under hypoxia. We found that glucose stimulated SV40 DNA replication under hypoxia in two different ways. First, the rate of DNA synthesis,i.e. the fork propagation rate, increased. This effect seemed to be mediated by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by glucose (Crabtree effect). Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration probably resulted in a higher intracellular oxygen concentration and an activation of oxygen-dependent ribonucleotide reductase, which provides the precursors for DNA synthesis. This glucose effect was consequently strongly dependent on the strength of hypoxia and the extent of intracellular respiration; hypoxic gassing with 10 ppm instead of 200–400 ppm O2 or treatment of hypoxic cells with a mitochondrial uncoupler (carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone) reduced the glucose effect on replication, whereas antimycin A, an inhibitor of respiration, increased it. The second effect of glucose concerned initiation,i.e. stimulation of unwinding of the viral origin. This effect was not influenced by the strength of hypoxia or the extent of cellular respiration and seemed, therefore, not to be mediated through a Crabtree effect. No evidence for a direct correlation between the cellular ATP concentration and the extent of SV40 replication under hypoxia was found. The effect of glucose on replication under hypoxia was not restricted to SV40-infected CV1 cells but was also detectable in HeLa cells. This suggests it to be a mechanism of more general validity.

This regulation results in inhibition of cellular replication when the concentration of O2 falls below 0.1%. Regulation of cellular replication by O2 has first been demonstrated for Ehrlich ascites cells (1Probst H. Gekeler V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Probst H. Gekeler V. Acker H. Oxygen Sensing in Tissues. Springer Verlag, Heidelberg1988: 77-92Google Scholar, 3Probst H.

Cell Res. 1984; 154: 327-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that it is also valid for HeLa and CCRF cells (5Probst G. Riedinger H.-J. Martin P. Engelcke M. Probst H. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1371-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting it to be a mechanism of general importance that adapts the cellular DNA replication to the supply of O2 and other nutrients. This seems to be of particular significance during embryonic growth, wound healing, or tumor cell propagation. Inhibition of replication under hypoxia primarily affects replicon initiation. Additionally, the rate of DNA chain growth is frequently reduced. Readmission of O2 after several hours of hypoxia reverses the suppression of DNA replication within a few minutes. This remarkably fast response suggests that the O2-dependent replication control acts very directly on the replication apparatus. The molecular mechanism of the oxygen-dependent replication control is largely obscure. A reduction of the intracellular concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates, especially of dCTP, has been observed under hypoxia (6Brischwein K. Engelcke M. Riedinger H.-J. Probst H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This may be explained by the inhibition of the O2-dependent action of ribonucleotide reductase (3Probst H. Schiffer H.

Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As inhibition of mammalian replicon initiation and elongation under hypoxia is relieved by addition of deoxycytidine even without reoxygenation, it is possible that ribonucleotide reductase acts as a sensor of O2-dependent replication control transmitting its signal through alterations in the deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool. O2-dependent regulation of replicon initiation was also demonstrated for viral DNA replication in simian virus 40 (SV40)1-infected CV1 cells (8Dreier T. Scheidtmann K.H. Probst H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Riedinger H.-J. van Betteraey M. Probst H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like in HeLa or CCRF cells, replicon initiation as well as elongation of SV40 replication are inhibited under hypoxia. Upon reoxygenation, elongation of DNA strands resumes a normal rate within 2 min. New initiations, indicated by the appearance of a highly negatively supercoiled topoisomer of SV40 DNA (form U), are detectable 3 min after reoxygenation. SV40 form U has been shown to be the product of unwinding of the viral origin (9Riedinger H.-J. van Betteraey M. Probst H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dean F.B.

The new initiations are followed by a nearly synchronous round of SV40 replication. Besides inhibition of replication, hypoxia induces numerous other molecular responses in the cell, some of which are also inducible by hypoglycemia. This was demonstrated, for example, for induction of glucose/oxygen-related proteins (11Roll D.E. Murphy B.J. Laderoute K.R. Sutherland R.M. Smith H.C. Mol. Cell.

On the other hand, glucose is able to prevent some hypoxia-induced cellular effects. This was shown for inhibition of hypoxia-induced apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells (19Malhotra R. Brosius III, F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12567-12575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and reversion of hypoxia-mediated reduction of radiosensitivity in Ehrlich ascites cells (20Shmakova N.L. Laser K. Iarmonenko S.P. Veksler A.M. Eidus L.K. Med. Radiol. (Mosk). 1984; 29: 17-20PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the influence of glucose on hypoxia-induced inhibition of SV40 replication in CV1 cells. We show that glucose partially prevents the effects of hypoxia on replication. First, addition of glucose to hypoxic and hypoglycemic SV40-infected cells stimulates new viral initiations. Second, glucose increases the rate of viral DNA chain growth under hypoxia. The second effect may be explained by a better intracellular availability of oxygen, due to partial inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by glucose (Crabtree effect). The better availability of oxygen in the cell in turn may lead to a higher activity of oxygen-dependent ribonucleotide reductase, which provides the precursors for DNA synthesis. We further show that the effect of glucose on replication is not restricted to SV40-infected cells but is also valid for HeLa cells. Monkey CV1 cells (ATCC CCL 70) were grown and infected with SV40 as described previously (21Stahl H. Knippers R. J. Virol. 1983; 47: 65-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient hypoxia experiments were performed under different conditions. When formation of SV40 form U was examined, experiments were done 24 h post-infection (p.i.) for 10 h at 0.02% (200 ppm) O2, 5% CO2, argon to 100%. All other experiments were performed 36 h p.i. for 6 h at 400 ppm O2, 5% CO2, argon to 100% (8Dreier T. Scheidtmann K.H. Probst H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), if not otherwise stated. Glucose was adjusted to a defined concentration before start of incubation. The respective concentration of each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. For reoxygenation, 0.25 volumes of medium equilibrated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 was added to hypoxic cell cultures, and gassing was continued with artificial air (8Dreier T. Scheidtmann K.H. Probst H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Glucose, bromodeoxyuridine, and [methyl-3H]deoxythymidine were either added directly to the cells or, under hypoxic culture conditions, by plunging a spatula carrying the appropriate quantity in dried form into the culture medium. Aphidicolin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), antimycin A (Sigma), and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) (Sigma), dissolved in Me2SO, were applied to hypoxic cell cultures on a spatula after gassing in a hypoxic chamber for 15 min. To stop incubations, the culture medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaHPO4, (pH 7.0)). Determination of acid-insoluble radioactivity was described previously (22Probst H. Hofstaetter T. Jenke H.-S. Gentner P.R. Müller-Scholz D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 740: 200-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For determination of relative [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine incorporation, cell cultures were prelabeled with 2.5 nCi of [2-14C]deoxythymidine/ml 1.5 h p.i.

SV40-infected cells were pulse-labeled for 6 min before or after reoxygenation and respective glucose addition with 20 μCi of [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine/ml. Incubation was then stopped, and cells were lysed in 0.25 m NaOH for 1 h at room temperature. The lysate was loaded on top of a 5–40% linear sucrose gradient in 0.25 m NaOH, 0.6 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate. After centrifugation in a Beckman SW40 rotor at 36,000 rpm and 23 °C for 16 h, 0.6-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed for acid-insoluble radioactivity (22Probst H.

For analyzing the length distribution of pulse-labeled growing HeLa cell DNA by alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation, cultures on 35-mm dishes were incubated with 20 μCi of [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine/ml. After labeling, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaHPO4 (pH 7.0)) and trypsinized for 10 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the cells were layered onto the top of 10–30% alkaline sucrose gradients (1Probst H. Gekeler V. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Thereafter, 1.2-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed for acid-precipitable radioactivity (22Probst H. Hofstaetter T. Jenke H.-S. Gentner P.R. Müller-Scholz D.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Washed cells were lysed and digested in 0.25 m EDTA (pH 8.0), 1% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, 100 μg of proteinase K/ml at 55 °C for 3 h. The lysate was then extracted twice with phenol/CHCl3 and dialyzed against 1 mm Tris/HCL, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) at 4 °C overnight. After digestion with RNase A (100 μg/ml at 37 °C for 1 h), 100 ng of isolated DNA per slot was loaded onto a 25- by 20-cm agarose gel containing 20 μg of chloroquine per ml of gel buffer (30 mm NaH2PO4, 36 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA). Electrophoresis was carried out at 2 V/cm and 4 °C for 20 h. Southern blotting was performed under alkaline conditions (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 45-46Google Scholar). SV40 DNA was detected by hybridization against a 32P-labeled full-length SV40 probe (24Diddens H. Gekeler V. Neumann M. Niethammer D. Int. J. Cancer. 1987; 40: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Glucose concentration in the cell culture supernatant was determined using an enzymatic glucose assay (Sigma). ATP was determined luminometrically after boiling of the stopped SV40-infected cells in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, 4 mm EDTA (pH 7.8) for 5 min using the ATP Bioluminescence CLC assay (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). SV40-infected cell cultures were simultaneously labeled with BrdUrd (5 or 20 μm) and [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine (10 μCi/ml). After incubation, the labeled cells were processed essentially as described (25Probst H. Riedinger H.-J. Gekeler V. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 180: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0,5% sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, 100 μg/ml proteinase K (Merck) (pH 8.0)) for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, a lysate of reference cells, prepared in the same way from about 60,000 SV40-infected CV1 cells labeled under normoxic conditions with [2-14C]deoxythymidine (200 nCi/ml) for 6 h, was added; the combined lysates were sheared by 10 passages through a 25-gauge injection needle followed by 5 passages through a 27-gauge injection needle. The lysates were then diluted with 10 mmTris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) to 6 ml, mixed with 8.0 or 8.5 g of solid CsCl (resulting density ∼1.72 and 1.74 g/ml), and then, after being overlaid with paraffin oil, centrifuged in the Beckman 70 Ti rotor at 20 °C and 37,000 rpm for 50–60 h. The gradients were fractionated from below into 40 fractions of 200 μl which were analyzed for acid-precipitable 14C and3H radioactivity according to Ref. 22Probst H. Hofstaetter T. Jenke H.-S.

For determination of cellular O2 consumption, SV40-infected cells were trypsinized for 2 min at 37 °C and resuspended in glucose-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1 ml of the cell suspension was put in the electrode chamber of a Clark-type oxygen electrode, and respiration was recorded before and after addition of glucose. Viral replication in SV40-infected cells is inhibited under hypoxic culture conditions. This is demonstrated by a decrease of [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine incorporation into viral DNA (8Dreier T. Scheidtmann K.H. Probst H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After reoxygenation, incorporation increases again and exceeds incorporation levels of normoxically cultivated cell cultures within a few minutes (8Dreier T. Scheidtmann K.H. Probst H.

(Mosk). 1984; 29: 17-20PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether SV40 DNA replication is also influenced by variations of the glucose concentration in the cell culture medium of virus-infected CV1 cells. To answer this question, we compared the effects of two different glucose concentrations on SV40 DNA replication as follows: 0.5 mg/ml, which is about the concentration we have used in previously published communications (8Dreier T. Scheidtmann K.H. Probst H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 9Riedinger H.-J. van Betteraey M. Probst H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1.5 mg/ml. We further term these two concentrations as “low glucose” or “high glucose.” The glucose concentrations were adjusted at the beginning of each experiment (24 or 36 h p.i.) and fell to below 0.2 mg/ml (low glucose, see Fig. 8) or to about 0.9 mg/ml (high glucose, data not shown) at the end of a 6-h lasting hypoxic or normoxic incubation. In a first experiment, we examined the incorporation of [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine into SV40 DNA at the two glucose concentrations by pulse labeling of SV40-infected cells at different times after start of hypoxic or normoxic incubation. After labeling, the cells were processed for determination of radioactivity incorporation into viral DNA (Fig. 1). Under normoxic culture conditions incorporation rates remained more or less constant, regardless of whether the glucose concentration in the cell culture supernatant was low or high. In hypoxically cultivated cell cultures, the course of [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine incorporation depended on the glucose concentration in the cell culture medium. At low glucose, the incorporation decreased to about 5% within 4 h and then remained constant. Upon reoxygenation, incorporation rapidly reincreased and exceeded the rates at the start of hypoxia severalfold. At high glucose concentration, [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine incorporation remained more or less constant during hypoxic incubation and was also not significantly changed by reoxygenation after 6 h of hypoxia. As we have demonstrated previously, hypoxic incubation of SV40-infected cells leads to accumulation of initiation-competent SV40 replicons, which, upon reoxygenation, are released into a synchronous round of viral replication. In alkaline sedimentation gradients, this synchronous replication round is indicated by a shift of labeled DNA chains to higher S values with increasing reoxygenation times (Refs. 8Dreier T. Scheidtmann K.H. Probst H. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 445-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholarand 9Riedinger H.-J. van Betteraey M. Probst H. J.

Thereafter, two cultures were treated with antimycin A (0.2 μm) or CCCP (10 μm). 5 min later, the cultures were supplied with glucose (1 mg/ml) or reoxygenated and pulse-labeled with [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine for 6 min until the indicated times. SV40 DNA was separated on an alkaline sucrose gradient. Glucose concentration at the start of incubation was 0.5 mg/ml.

As Fig. 2 shows, high glucose concentrations under hypoxia resulted in almost identical sedimentation profiles, regardless of whether the cell cultures were pulse-labeled before or after reoxygenation. This indicates that no accumulation of initiation-competent SV40 replicons takes place under these conditions. Moreover, the sedimentation profiles shown in Fig. 2 closely resembled those of normoxically incubated cells (data not shown), suggesting that SV40 DNA replication proceeds asynchronously under hypoxia and high glucose. The oxygen dependence of ribonucleotide reductase allows only residual activity under the hypoxic culture conditions used in the experiments described here (6Brischwein K. Engelcke M. Riedinger H.-J. Probst H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 286-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Probst H. Schiffer H. Gekeler V. Scheffler K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results shown in Figs. 1 and 2, on the other hand, suggest that SV40 DNA replication is not significantly obstructed under hypoxia and high glucose. To clarify this apparent contradiction, we tested whether SV40-infected cells grown under hypoxia/glucose use more of the externally supplied thymidine analogue 5′-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for DNA synthesis than normoxically cultivated control cells. As BrdUrd (-triphosphate) is incorporated instead of dTTP into DNA, a higher degree of substitution would indicate a reduced supply of intracellularly generated dTTP. BrdUrd (5 μm) and [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine (20 μCi) were simultaneously added to the cells, and incubation was continued for a further 30 min under hypoxic or normoxic conditions. The cell cultures were then processed for CsCl density gradient centrifugation. As a control, each gradient contained a 14C-labeled DNA, which was not substituted with BrdUrd. As Fig. 3 shows, DNA isolated from virus-infected CV1 cultures, which were cultivated under hypoxic conditions in presence of high glucose, appeared at higher densities than DNA from normoxic cell cultures in the CsCl gradients. This indicates an increased usage of extracellularly supplied BrdUrd into DNA, most probably as a consequence of the reduced activity of ribonucleotide reductase under hypoxia. Incorporation of [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine into SV40 DNA was shown to be the same under normoxic culture conditions as well as under hypoxia/glucose (Fig. 1). As the usage of externally supplied thymidine analogues is, however, increased under hypoxia/glucose (Fig. 3), it follows that the rate of DNA synthesis must have been reduced in comparison to normoxic culture conditions. In a further experiment, we compared the times necessary to obtain new semiconservatively synthesized SV40 DNA under hypoxia and glucose and under normoxia. We simultaneously labeled SV40-infected CV1 cells with [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine (10 μCi/ml) and BrdUrd (20 μm) for increasing times under both culture conditions. This successively led to SV40 DNA labeled with BrdUrd in one strand (hemi-substituted DNA) and, after a second round of replication, to DNA labeled in both strands (double-substituted DNA). After separation in a CsCl density gradient, we compared the times, which were necessary to get the same ratios of radioactivity of hemi- and double-substituted DNA for hypoxic and normoxic culture conditions. Fig. 4 shows that about 7 h were necessary to get the same amount of radioactivity in hemi- and double-substituted DNA under normoxia, but more than 8 h were taken to reach the same ratio under hypoxic conditions. This indicates that the rate of SV40 DNA replication is reduced under hypoxia/glucose compared with the rate under normoxia. The effect is, however, not very pronounced. The results presented above show that high glucose partially prevents the hypoxia-induced inhibition of SV40 replication. In principle, addition of glucose to hypoxic, virus-infected cells containing little glucose should therefore allow SV40 replication even without reoxygenation. We tested this hypothesis by addition of 1 mg of glucose/ml to SV40-infected CV1 cells, which were cultivated hypoxically at low glucose for 6 h. After glucose addition, hypoxic gassing was continued, and cells were labeled with [methyl- 3H]deoxythymidine (20 μCi/ml) for 6 min at different times. After labeling, the cells were lysed, and DNA was analyzed by alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation. Fig. 5 shows that glucose triggered a new round of viral replication under hypoxia. This was indicated by the increasing shift of labeled DNA molecules to higher S values with increasing incubation times. The course of the viral replication round after glucose addition proved to be nearly identical to that observed after reoxygenation (9Riedinger H.-J. van Betteraey M. Probst H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparing the sizes of the growing SV40 daughter strands at identical time points after glucose addition or reoxygenation, respectively, revealed, however, that the propagation rate of replication forks was diminished, when initiation of SV40 replication was triggered with glucose instead of oxygen (see also below). We also tested the effect of glucose addition to hypoxic cells concerning the formation of SV40 form U, which was shown to be a product of the unwinding of the viral origin region (9Riedinger H.-J. van Betteraey M. Probst H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Dean F.B. Bullock P. Murakami Y. Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). SV40-infected cells (24 h p.i.) were subjected to 10 h of hypoxia at 200 ppm O2 at low glucose. Then 1 mg of glucose/ml was added, and cells were further incubated hypoxically for various times and then stopped. Form U was detected after chloroquine gel electrophoresis of whole cell DNA and blotting by hybridization against a SV40-specific probe. Form U was detectable between 3 and 10 min after glucose addition (Fig. 6). Again, this result closely resembled those obtained in earlier experiments, when hypoxic SV40-infected cells were reoxygenated (9Riedinger H.-J. van Betteraey M. Probst H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2243-2252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, elevation of the glucose concentration under hypoxia relieves the hypoxia-induced block of SV40 replication and leads to new initiations and a synchronous round of viral replication. In a further experiment, we determined the glucose concentration necessary to induce formation of form U in hypoxic cells by adding different amounts of glucose to SV40-infected cells incubated for 10 h under hypoxia. 6 min after glucose addition, hypoxic incubation was stopped. The results obtained show that form U was induced when the concentration of glucose in the cell cultur"

In living cells, these protein catalysts could accomplish a variety of reactions to modify cell behavior or generate reporter molecules for biological assays. Because these antibodies are protein catalysts, the timing and level of expression of such antibodies could be placed under genetic control, making the antibodies potentially valuable markers for studies of cell fate in any situation where single cells must be manipulated in complex multicellular environments. Here we explore whether catalytic antibody reactions can occur within living cells and test their ability to generate sufficient reaction products to be useful in tracing the behavior of individual cells. A retro-Aldol antibody previously shown to efficiently catalyze numerous reactions was an excellent candidate for the generation of fluorescence in vivo (8List B. Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15351-15355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Previous work had indicated that fluorescein could be derivatized with side chains, which would both confer membrane permeability and abolish fluorescence (8List B. Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15351-15355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We describe a novel fluorogenic substrate bearing side chains that can be cleaved by the antibody-catalyzed reaction to generate fluorescein. The side chains enable the substrate to enter the cell from the extracellular medium. Within the cell, the fluorescein generated by the antibody-catalyzed reaction can no longer pass readily through the membrane, causing a buildup of fluorescence within the cell. We describe the generation of this useful new substrate, test the ability of antibodies to generate fluorescence within living cytoplasm under various conditions, and demonstrate the applicability of the reaction by quantifying the transport of antibody-generated fluorescent tracers through gap junctions.

Hybridoma cells expressing aldolase antibody 38C2 and OKT4 hybridoma cells were incubated with fluorogenic substrate at a concentration of 20 μm for 8 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Prior to the experiment, cells were washed and media was changed to phenol-free RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. CHO cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum. These cells were coinjected with 10,000 molecular weight rhodamine-dextran (Molecular Probes; Eugene, OR) and aldolase antibody 38C2 (10 mg/ml), then incubated with the fluorogenic substrate (20 μm), and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 8 or 12 h prior to the experiment. Immediately prior to the experiment, cells were washed, and the media was changed to phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal bovine serum. For oleamide treatments, a stock of oleamide (Calbiochem; La Jolla, CA) in pure ethanol was added to the cell medium to 1:1000 dilution, producing a final concentration of 100 μm. Glass coverslips of cells were mounted in a sealed Dvorak Chamber (Nicholson Instruments; Gaithersburg, MD) held in a temperature-controlled stage (20/20 Technologies). Microscopy was performed using an Axiovert 100 TV microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.; Thornwood, NY) modified with automated stage and filter wheels (LEP Ltd.; Hawthorne, NY) and a Zeiss 40× NA1.3 oil immersion objective with differential interference contrast optics. Fluorescence images were obtained with an exposure time of 0.5 s using a Photometrics PXL cooled CCD camera (Photometrics; Tucson, AZ). Images were taken using 2 × 2 binning as a 12 bit, 658 × 517-pixel array. Images were background-subtracted and analyzed for fluorescence intensity (9Castleman K.R. Digital Image Processing. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey1996Google Scholar) using Inovision ISEE software (Inovision Co.; Raleigh, NC). Fluorescence signals produced by the aldolase antibody reaction and rhodamine-dextran were imaged using HQ filter sets from the Chromatech Co. Fluorescence images were contrast-stretched and sharpened for clarity of display using Inovision ISEE and Adobe Photoshop software. This procedure was performed as previously described (10Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These cells have been previously shown to contain gap junctions and connexin 43 (10–12). These results were confirmed for our cells through both Western blotting and immunofluorescence (data not shown). The catalytic antibody 38C2 was previously shown to efficiently catalyze retro-Michael reactions (8List B. Barbas III, C.F. Lerner R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15351-15355Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and was therefore tested for its ability to convert a cell-permeable, fluorogenic substrate into fluorescein, a bright fluorophore with valuable properties for detection within living cells. The nonfluorescent fluorogenic substrate, compound 7 in Fig.1, was synthesized from fluorescein and linker 2. Hydrophobic side chains conferred membrane permeability without completely eliminating water solubility. As shown in Fig. 2, the aldolase antibody 38C2 catalyzed the retro-Michael reaction of 7 to give a cyclic urea derivative, CO2, and mesitoxylide, which spontaneously rearranged to produce fluorescein. Thekcat of the antibody-catalyzed step was ∼1.8 × 10−5s−1(Km = 7 μm), and the catalytic proficiency (kcat/ kuncatKm) was 1.4 × 1010m−1. We examined whether the reaction between antibody and substrate could occur within the complex environment inside living cells and whether the amount of fluorescence generated was sufficient for practical application in biological assays. For this, we compared fluorescence generated when the fluorogenic substrate was loaded into hybridoma cells, which did or did not express the antibody. The substrate was incubated in the extracellular medium, cells were then washed with fresh medium free of substrate, and the fluorescence of individual cells was determined through quantitative image analysis. Results from more than 50 cells of each type are shown in Fig.3. It was clear that the antibody reaction could proceed within living cells. The mean level of fluorescence was more than 12 times higher in the aldolase 38C2 antibody-expressing cells than in the control cells, so fluorescence due to the antibody reaction could be clearly differentiated from autofluorescence or from spontaneous reaction of the substrate to form fluorescent dye. These experiments demonstrated that the substrate could be taken up from the extracellular medium in sufficient concentrations to produce a good fluorescent signal. Finally, both cell lines showed no apparent toxic effects after the 8 h incubation. It was important to determine whether fluorescence could be produced only by cells continuously generating antibody, such as hybridomas, or whether cells briefly expressing the antibody or loaded through introduction of extracellular antibody (i.e. through microinjection, electroporation, signal sequences, etc.) might also be able to generate fluorescence. Only the hybridoma cells might be able to generate sufficient intracellular concentrations of antibody, or the half-life of the antibody might be so short that constant expression was required. We examined the ability of microinjected antibody to generate fluorescent dye. For these experiments, CHO cells, a cell line commonly used for a wide range of biological experiments, were microinjected with the catalytic antibody, and the cells were then incubated with extracellular substrate for 8 or 12 h. Fig. 4shows that the injected cells were also capable of generating bright, stable fluorescence easily detectable above background. Fluorescence was significantly increased at 12 h, indicating that the reaction was ongoing more than 8 h after injection and that the dye could accumulate within the cells. Here the mean fluorescence of the cells containing antibody was more than 13-fold greater than that of controls. The intracellular antibody reaction would be more useful if the antibody not only generated a good mean fluorescence in a population of cells but also generated detectable fluorescence in a large percentage of cells injected. In the antibody injection experiments, fluorescence above background was seen in 87 and 93% of the injected cells at 8 and 12 h, respectively. (Cells were deemed fluorescent if they were more than one standard deviation brighter than the mean intensity of noninjected cells.) Previous studies have demonstrated that CHO cells form gap junctions (10Laing J.G. Beyer E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26399-26403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 11Lampe B.D. Nguyen B.P. Gil S. Usui M. Olerud J. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1735-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 12Musil L.S. Le A.C. Van Slyke J.K. Roberts L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25207-25215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether the aldolase antibody reaction could be used to study gap junctions in these cells. By injecting the antibody into only one cell in a population of cells connected by gap junctions, the spread of fluorescence from the injected cell could be used to quantify gap junction activity. The transfer of lucifer yellow tracer dye through CHO cells is shown in Fig. 5. This finding demonstrates the functional activity of gap junctions in this cell line. Thus, these cells were suitable for testing the ability of the antibody reaction to quantify gap junction communication. CHO cells were grown as a subconfluent monolayer on glass coverslips, such that cells were in clearly separate groups of ∼5–10 adjoining cells. The catalytic antibody was mixed with a 10,000-kDa rhodamine-dextran. This dextran, too large to pass through gap junctions, served to mark the injected cells. The mixture of antibody and dextran was injected into only one cell within each group of adjoining cells. After 8 and 12 h, the number of noninjected cells that had become fluorescent was counted. Results are shown in Figs. 6and 7. These experiments demonstrated that the substrate could be taken up from the extracellular medium in sufficient concentrations to produce a uniform cytoplasmic fluorescent signal in the cells injected with the 38C2 aldolase antibody. Furthermore, cells surrounding the antibody-injected cells readily took up fluorescent substrate, while the fluorescent dextran marker remained in the injected cell only. Uptake was dependent on the time of incubation with substrate, consistent with the kinetics of fluorescent product formation seen in the antibody-injected cells (Fig. 4). Treatment with oleamide, a potent inhibitor of gap junction communication (13Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Ehring G.R. Hall J.E. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), greatly reduced the number of fluorescent noninjected cells. Together, these experiments demonstrated that the antibody reaction can be used to effectively trace gap junction communication.Figure 7Intracellular antibody catalysis used to trace gap junction communication. CHO cells were injected with a mixture of rhodamine-dextran marker and catalytic antibody, as shown in Fig. 7. Each bar shows the number of fluorescent noninjected cells divided by the number of injected, antibody-containing cells in each experiment after incubation with substrate for 8 h (left) or 12 h (center). Treatment with 100 μm oleamide greatly reduced the appearance of fluorescence in noninjected cells (right), indicating that dye formed by the antibody reaction was passing into noninjected cells through gap junctions. Division of fluorescent noninjected cells by injected cells normalizes for the different numbers of injected cells in each experiment. The results shown are the mean of three separate experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The studies reported here demonstrated that a catalytic antibody, 38C2, generated bright and stable fluorescence within individual, living cells. This reaction was characterized to demonstrate that it is a practical tool with many potential applications. The novel substrate used here was delivered to the intracellular antibody simply by placing it in the extracellular medium. The level of fluorescence generated in cells was more than 10-fold greater than background fluorescence, enabling ready discrimination of antibody-containing cells. Fluorescence was generated both in cells constitutively expressing antibody and when antibody was loaded through microinjection. This demonstrated that constitutive expression was not required to achieve the required intracellular antibody concentrations or to overcome intracellular degradation of antibody. For marking cells, intracellular antibody reactions have clear advantages over marker dyes used currently for long term tracing of cell fate. Constitutive expression of the antibody leads to continual regeneration of fluorescence, unlike the marker dyes that are diluted by cell division or interactions with other cells and decompose due to photobleaching. Perhaps most importantly, the antibody could be expressed transiently to generate fluorescence. Thus, it could be placed under the control of specific promoters to generate fluorescence only after activation of a regulated gene to correlate cell behavior with gene expression during development. Importantly, fluorescence was produced in greater than 85% of the cells injected, indicating that the reaction can be used reliably to determine which cells express antibody. We used the antibody reaction to develop a new assay of gap junction activity. One cell within a population of adjoining cells was injected with antibody and the entire population was incubated with substrate. After the injected cell became fluorescent, dye was transferred into neighboring noninjected cells, which were in contact with the cell containing antibody. This dye transfer was demonstrated to be mediated by gap junctions by blocking it with oleamide, a specific inhibitor of gap junction activity (13Guan X. Cravatt B.F. Ehring G.R. Hall J.E. Boger D.L. Lerner R.A. Gilula N.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). There are currently no practical markers that can be used to quantify gap junction activity in living tissues or whole animals (14Simon A.M. Goodenough D.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 477-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We hope to use this new tool to investigate gap junction activity from specific metastatic cells during tumorigenesis, as the interactions of invading cells with surrounding tissue are thought to be mediated in part by gap junction transfer (15Saunders M.M. Seraj M.J. Li Z. Zhou Z. Winter C.R. Welch D.R. Donahue H.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1765-1767PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ito A. Katoh F. Kataoka T.R. Okada M. Tsubota N. Asada H. Yoshikawa K. Maeda S.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1535-1542PubMed Google Scholar). There is also evidence that immune mediators are transferred via gap junctions to specific tissues (18Krenacs T. van Dartel M. Lindhout E. Rosendaal M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1489-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Alves L.A. de Carvalho A.C. Savino W. Immunol.

Immunology. 2000; 99: 578-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This work has demonstrated the usefulness of catalytic antibody reactions within living cells. The reaction of antibody 38C2 with our novel substrate generated sufficiently bright and stable fluorescence for many potential applications. In the future, antibody-catalyzed reactions can be used not only to generate fluorescent dyes of multiple colors to simultaneously monitor different cells, but can generate other molecules that modulate cell activity. Appropriate substrates could generate inhibitors or other biologically active molecules. Alternately, the activity of native proteins could be modulated through binding of antibodies to alter conformation or accelerate natural reactions with natural modifying enzymes."
