https://openalex.org/W2058211467,"The photosynthetic basis for increasing the yield of major field crops is examined in terms of improving the interception of seasonal solar radiation by crop foliage, the efficiency of conversion of intercepted light to photosynthetic assimilates, and the partitioning of photoassimilates to organs of economic interest. It is concluded that, in practice, genetic and chemical manipulation of light interception over the season and of partitioning offer the most potential for achieving further increases in yield. During the history of improvement of genetic yield potential of crops, increase in the partitioning of photoassimilates to harvested organs has been of primary importance."

https://openalex.org/W1500119071,"The Chattanooga shale contains insoluble organic matter (kerogen) derived from terrestrial (humic) and from marine (sapropelic) sources. Kerogen from sapropelic sources contains more hydrogen than kerogen from humic sources. Thus the hydrogen content of the sapropelic contribution, and of the kerogen, increases toward that part of a shale most likely to be a source bed for petroleum. Uranium in the shale is derived from the adjoining land mass."

Under such drought conditions plant survival and vigor are increased. Prolonged closing of the stomata seems to be the principal mode of action of the chemical."
https://openalex.org/W2080602855,Treatment of Euglena gracilis with furadantin results in colorless cells which produce only white descendants. The treatment also prevents the greening of dark-grown euglena-which are exposed to light. This finding suggests that furadantin acts upon some stage of chloroplast synthesis subsequent to that blocked by darkness.

The neon and helium have probably diffused in from the atmosphere, while the oxygen may be atmospheric gas incorporated in the tektite during its formation."

Its magnetic field, carried into interplanetary space by the solar wind, produces observable changes in Earth's magnetosphere and variations in the flux of galactic cosmic-ray particles incident upon Earth's upper atmosphere. Centuries of observation have enabled solar scientists to recognize that the Sun's magnetism exists and varies in a globally organized pattern that is somehow coupled to the Sun's rotation. Within the past decade O. C. Wilson demonstrated that analogs of solar activity exist and can be studied in many other dwarf stars. From the continuing study, knowledge of the precise rates of rotation of the stars under investigation is being gained for the first time. The results are expected to increase our understanding of the origin of solar activity and stellar activity in general."

https://openalex.org/W2015791014,"Let us consider the present status and scope of geodesy and look at its problems with a view to making the best progress possible in the near future. The recent past to be brought under review should not be limited to a single year, but to a few years. Similarly our attempt to look into the future should not be limited to the one year until we meet here again.

In recent time there has been a continually increasing application of the results of geodetic surveys to the control of other less accurate surveying and to mapping. There has been a steady improvement in instruments and methods in spite of the fact that these were already very highly developed. Geodesy is once more internationally organized. The available store of fundamental data of geodesy is being increased rapidly. In North America the extension of the area over which there is continuous triangulation all reduced to one datum has been, and is now, very rapid. Geodesy is developing many contacts with other fields of science, by discussion and by action. The discussions of isostasy have been given new life by the realization on the part of many men that isostasy brings new tests to their hypotheses in other fields of thought than geodesy and that their observations in other fields shed light upon the probable mechanism of isostatic readjustment."
