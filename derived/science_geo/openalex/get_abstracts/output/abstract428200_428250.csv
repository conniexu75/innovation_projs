https://openalex.org/W2151832198,"Metastasis and chemoresistance in cancer are linked phenomena, but the molecular basis for this link is unknown. We uncovered a network of paracrine signals between carcinoma, myeloid, and endothelial cells that drives both processes in breast cancer. Cancer cells that overexpress CXCL1 and 2 by transcriptional hyperactivation or 4q21 amplification are primed for survival in metastatic sites. CXCL1/2 attract CD11b(+)Gr1(+) myeloid cells into the tumor, which produce chemokines including S100A8/9 that enhance cancer cell survival. Although chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells, these treatments trigger a parallel stromal reaction leading to TNF-α production by endothelial and other stromal cells. TNF-α via NF-kB heightens the CXCL1/2 expression in cancer cells, thus amplifying the CXCL1/2-S100A8/9 loop and causing chemoresistance. CXCR2 blockers break this cycle, augmenting the efficacy of chemotherapy against breast tumors and particularly against metastasis. This network of endothelial-carcinoma-myeloid signaling interactions provides a mechanism linking chemoresistance and metastasis, with opportunities for intervention."

Numerous mechanisms operating within the mammalian immune system cooperatively limit deleterious immune responses. A subset of CD4+ T cells known as regulatory T cells express the X chromosome-encoded transcription factor Foxp3 and suppress inflammatory immune responses against “self” and foreign antigens in a variety of physiological and pathological settings (Littman and Rudensky, 2010Littman D.R.

Loss-of-function mutations in Foxp3 result in congenital Treg cell deficiency and severe systemic immunopathology in both mice and humans, which reveal the vital role that these cells play in immune homeostasis (Chatila et al., 2000Chatila T.A.

Depletion of Treg cells in normal mice also results in a fatal lympho- and myeloproliferative disorder with widespread inflammatory lesions (Kim et al., 2007Kim J.M. Rasmussen J.P. Rudensky A.Y.

Analysis of CD4+ T cells expressing a functional Foxp3 reporter allele and a Foxp3 reporter null allele showed that Foxp3 is essential for suppressor function of Treg cells (Gavin et al., 2007Gavin M.A. Rasmussen J.P.

Recent studies implicated Treg cells in suppression of different types of inflammatory responses during infection, autoimmunity, metabolic inflammation, tissue injury, autoinflammatory responses at barrier sites, and tumor immunity (reviewed in Josefowicz et al., 2012Josefowicz S.Z.

In the thymus, some thymocytes expressing TCR with a heightened reactivity for “self” antigens upregulate Foxp3 and differentiate into tTreg cells, whereas pTreg cell generation in the periphery occurs upon stimulation of naive CD4+ T cells with high-affinity cognate TCR ligands in the presence of TGFβ and retinoic acid (Chen et al., 2003Chen W.

A recent observation that an intronic Foxp3 enhancer CNS1, which contains Smad3- and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-binding sites, facilitates TGF-β-dependent Foxp3 induction and pTreg cell differentiation but is dispensable for tTreg generation suggests that biological functions of these two Treg cell subsets are distinct (Zheng et al., 2010Zheng Y. Josefowicz S. Chaudhry A. Peng X.P. Forbush K. Rudensky A.Y. Role of conserved non-coding DNA elements in the Foxp3 gene in regulatory T-cell fate.Nature. 2010; 463: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Indeed, in contrast to fatal early-onset inflammatory lesions resulting from congenital Treg cell deficiency, selective pTreg cell paucity leads to a rather late onset allergic and asthma-like inflammation in the gut and lung (Josefowicz et al., 2012Josefowicz S.Z. Niec R.E. Kim H.Y. Treuting P. Chinen T. Zheng Y. Umetsu D.T. Rudensky A.Y. Extrathymically generated regulatory T cells control mucosal TH2 inflammation.Nature. 2012; 482: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Because the principal differences between these two Treg cell subsets are the location and type of antigen that facilitates their differentiation, tTreg cells are likely responsible for tolerance to self-antigens, whereas pTreg cells restrain immune responses to nonself antigens such as allergens, commensal microbiota, and food. Pregnancy represents a physiological situation in which tolerance to paternal alloantigens is critical for successful reproduction of placental mammals. Treg cells have been suggested to play a role in pregnancy based on their increased numbers in pregnant mice and humans (Somerset et al., 2004Somerset D.A. Zheng Y. Kilby M.D. Sansom D.M. Drayson M.T. Normal human pregnancy is associated with an elevation in the immune suppressive CD25+ CD4+ regulatory T-cell subset.Immunology. 2004; 112: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Antibody-mediated depletion of CD25+ Treg cells results in increased resorption of the embryos in allogeneic matings in mice (Aluvihare et al., 2004Aluvihare V.R. Kallikourdis M. Betz A.G.

Immunol. 2011; 66: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These studies left open a question as to whether a role for Treg cells during pregnancy is largely due to their general “housekeeping” role in immune homeostasis and the observed modulation in their numbers is secondary to altered immune balance or whether there is an evolutionary selected mechanism of Treg-cell-mediated maternal-fetal tolerance. We hypothesized that, given the capacity of pTreg cells to mediate tolerance against nonself antigens, mechanisms supporting their generation arose to mitigate maternal-fetal conflict caused by the immune response to paternal alloantigens in placental mammals. We reasoned that pTreg-cell-mediated suppression might represent such a mechanism. In support of this hypothesis, here we show that CNS1 enhancer is present only in eutherian mammals and that CNS1-dependent generation of pTreg cells during allogeneic pregnancy in mice plays an important role by preventing embryo resorption and associated defective spiral artery remodeling with accumulation of activated T cells in the placenta. Our results suggest that extrathymic generation of regulatory T cells emerged during evolution as a means of mitigation of maternal-fetal allogeneic conflict. Extrathymic induction of Foxp3 and pTreg differentiation is facilitated by Foxp3 CNS1 enhancer, which contains binding sites for transcription factors activated downstream of three major signaling pathways that have been implicated in this process (Tone et al., 2008Tone Y. Furuuchi K. Kojima Y. Tykocinski M.L. Greene M.I. Tone M. Smad3 and NFAT cooperate to induce Foxp3 expression through its enhancer.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, Xu et al., 2010Xu L. Kitani A. Stuelten C. McGrady G. Fuss I. Strober W. Positive and negative transcriptional regulation of the Foxp3 gene is mediated by access and binding of the Smad3 protein to enhancer I.Immunity. 2010; 33: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). Thus, to test the hypothesis that pTreg differentiation may have been gained during evolution to assist tolerance to the fetus, we examined the conservation of the CNS1 element in a variety of vertebrates for which annotated genome sequences are available. Though we observed that CNS1 is highly conserved throughout placental mammals, no evidence of a CNS1 sequence homolog was found within 100 kb of the transcription start site of any forkhead family member in the monotreme platypus, in marsupials wallaby and opossum, or in nonmammals such as zebrafish (Figure 1A) (Margulies et al., 2007Margulies E.H. Cooper G.M. Asimenos G. Thomas D.J. Dewey C.N. Siepel A. Birney E. Keefe D. Schwartz A.S. Hou M. et al.Analyses of deep mammalian sequence alignments and constraint predictions for 1% of the human genome.Genome Res. 2007; 17: 760-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Importantly, a Foxp3 homolog was previously identified in zebrafish, and its forced expression in mouse Foxp3− CD4+ T cells conferred suppressive capacity (Quintana et al., 2010Quintana F.J. Iglesias A.H. Farez M.F. Caccamo M. Burns E.J. Kassam N. Oukka M. Weiner H.L. Adaptive autoimmunity and Foxp3-based immunoregulation in zebrafish.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e9478Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These results led us to consider that species without identifiable Foxp3 CNS1 sequence homologs lack a proximal regulatory element conferring efficient TGF-β-mediated Foxp3 induction, a key factor in pTreg differentiation. To test this notion we cloned 4 kb regions downstream of the promoter of the zebrafish, opossum, and mouse Foxp3 genes (Foxp3-4kb) and evaluated their enhancer activities upon TCR- (PMA/ionomycin) and TGF-β induced activation of the Foxp3 promoter in EL-4 cells in a luciferase assay previously used for the assessment of CNS1 enhancer activity (Figure 1B) (Tone et al., 2008Tone Y. Furuuchi K. Kojima Y. Tykocinski M.L. Greene M.I. Tone M. Smad3 and NFAT cooperate to induce Foxp3 expression through its enhancer.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Indeed, only mouse, but not zebrafish or opossum, Foxp3-4kb sequence markedly augmented the Foxp3 promoter activity. Furthermore, mouse Foxp3-4kb sequence devoid of CNS1 was lacking enhancer activity, whereas incorporation of CNS1 into zebrafish or opossum Foxp3-4kb sequence reconstituted enhancer activity. Though the remote possibility remains that, in noneutherians, TGF-β can facilitate Foxp3 induction in a species-specific manner, these results support the idea that CNS1-like enhancer activity, a prerequisite for pTreg differentiation, arose in placental mammals. Interestingly, the majority of the CNS1 element sequence was contained within an annotated SINE retrotransposon of the mammalian-wide interspersed repeat (MIR) family (Figure 1A), suggesting a mechanism for the abrupt emergence of CNS1 in the Foxp3 locus, because the MIR family is thought to have been amplified during the Mesozoic era in the course of the radiation of placental mammals, marsupials, and monotremes (Jurka et al., 1995Jurka J. Zietkiewicz E. Labuda D. Ubiquitous mammalian-wide interspersed repeats (MIRs) are molecular fossils from the mesozoic era.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Smit and Riggs, 1995Smit A.F. Riggs A.D. MIRs are classic, tRNA-derived SINEs that amplified before the mammalian radiation.Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To test whether pTreg cells that are specific for paternal alloantigen are generated during pregnancy in a CNS1-dependent manner, we used CNS1-sufficient and -deficient Foxp3GFP mice expressing transgenic (tg) TEa TCR that recognizes Eα52–68 peptide derived from I-Ed molecule bound to MHC class II molecule I-Ab (Grubin et al., 1997Grubin C.E. Kovats S. deRoos P. Rudensky A.Y. Deficient positive selection of CD4 T cells in mice displaying altered repertoires of MHC class II-bound self-peptides.Immunity. 1997; 7: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This complex is highly expressed in H-2bxd (B6 × BALB/c) F1 mice yet is absent in either parental strains because B6 do not express antigenic peptide donor, whereas BALB/c mice lack the appropriate presenting molecule I-Ab. FACS-purified Foxp3− CD4+ T cells from CNS1-deficient and -sufficient TEa tg Foxp3GFP B6 mice were transferred into T-cell-deficient B6 recipients, which were subsequently mated with BALB/c (H-2d) or B6 (H-2b) male. In this experimental setup, TEa cells were able to recognize endogenous Eα52-68:I-Ab complex presented by antigen-presenting cells (APC) of the embryo (H-2dxb) or processed by maternal APC only when recipient B6 females were mated with a BALB/c male (Figure 2A ). Induction of Foxp3 in transferred CNS1-sufficient (WT) TEa T cells was observed primarily in the draining lymph node (DLN) and in decidua of females mated with BALB/c, but not B6 males. In contrast, no significant induction of Foxp3 was observed upon transfer of CNS1-deficient (KO) TEa T cells (Figure 2b). Although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that, under a particular condition, extrathymic Treg cells can be generated in the absence of CNS1, these results demonstrate that pTreg cells that are specific for fetal alloantigens are generated during pregnancy in a CNS1-dependent manner. A role for CNS1 and extrathymic generation of Treg cells in maternal-fetal tolerance and fertility was then directly assessed. CNS1-deficient (KO) and -sufficient (WT) B6 females were mated with allogeneic BALB/c males, and the embryo resorption was assessed on embryonic day 13.5–14.5 (E13.5–E14.5) (Figure 3A ). Increased resorption was observed in CNS1-deficient females compared with the wild-type littermate controls (Figure 3B). Incidence of resorption and its rate per pregnant female were also increased (Figures 3C and 3D). Consistent with evolutionary pressure for the emergence of CNS1-dependent pTreg cell differentiation, the number of nonresorbed fetuses was also significantly decreased in CNS1-deficient females (Figure S1 available online). Importantly, females impaired in pTreg cell generation did not show increased resorption of embryos sired by B6 males expressing syngeneic MHC allele (Figures 3E–3G). The latter observation indicates that CNS1-deficient females are not generally predisposed to spontaneous abortion but reject embryos expressing mismatched MHC alleles. CNS1-deficient females were always compared to their WT counterparts in identical breedings with syngeneic or allogeneic males to ensure that the genetic make-up of the embryos is the same in the two groups compared, as different strains of mice can vary in rates of embryo loss due to early fetal death unrelated to immunologic conflicts and because F1 embryos are frequently more robust and survive better.Figure S1CNS1 Deficiency Results in Decreased Numbers of Viable Embryos, Related to Figure 3Show full captionTotal number of nonresorbed embryos observed in CNS1-sufficient (WT) and –deficient (KO) pregnant mice sired by BALB/c males at day E13-14.5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Total number of nonresorbed embryos observed in CNS1-sufficient (WT) and –deficient (KO) pregnant mice sired by BALB/c males at day E13-14.5. To exclude potential effects of congenital pTreg cell deficiency, we generated heterozygous Foxp3CNS1KO/DTR females containing one CNS1 KO allele and one Foxp3DTR allele. Due to random X chromosome inactivation, half of the cells in a Foxp3CNS1KO/DTR mouse express each allele and are either susceptible to DT-mediated ablation (Foxp3DTR) or unable to induce Foxp3 in the periphery (Foxp3CNS1KO). Administration of DT allows for depletion of all CNS1-dependent pTreg cells while sparing a pool of CNS1-deficient tTreg cells (Figure S2). Treatment with DT before and during pregnancy in these mice resulted in increased resorption compared to control heterozygous Foxp3GFP/DTR females in which DT ablation leaves CNS1-sufficient Foxp3+ Treg cells (Figure 4A ). The observed increases were similar to those observed in intact CNS1-deficient females. Thus, acute pTreg ablation during allogeneic pregnancy results in increased embryo resorption comparable to that observed in CNS1-deficient females.Figure 4Acute Depletion of pTreg and All Treg Cells Results in Comparable Increase in Embryo ResorptionShow full caption(A) Percent of embryos resorbed in pregnant Foxp3GFP/DTR or Foxp3CNS1KO/DTR females treated with DT continuously starting 3 days prior to mating with BALB/c males; incidence of pregnancies with at least one resorption; percent resorption observed in individual mothers.

See also Figure S2. Although analysis of allogeneic pregnancy in CNS1-deficient and Foxp3CNS1KO/DTR females suggested that pTreg cells generated in a CNS1-dependent manner prevent “rejection” of MHC-mismatched fetuses, it was possible that their contribution to overall Treg cell-mediated suppression of maternal-fetal allogeneic conflict was relatively minor. To address this question, we assessed the effect of essentially complete ablation of Treg cells in pregnant Foxp3DTR B6 females expressing diphtheria toxin receptor under control of the endogenous Foxp3 locus (Kim et al., 2007Kim J.M. Rasmussen J.P. Rudensky A.Y. Regulatory T cells prevent catastrophic autoimmunity throughout the lifespan of mice.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Increased resorption of MHC-mismatched embryos was observed in Foxp3DTR B6 females, compared with control B6 mice, when mated with BALB/c males and treated with diphtheria toxin (DT) at days E5.5 and E7.5 (Figure 4B). In contrast to selective pTreg deficiency, DT-mediated combined ablation of pTreg and tTreg cells also increased resorption of syngeneic embryos, most likely due to a loss of restraint of T cell reactivity against self-antigens (data not shown). Despite widespread immune mediated inflammation and lympho- and myeloproliferative syndrome in pregnant Foxp3DTR females subjected to “wholesale” Treg ablation, the rates of resorption observed in these mice were similar to those in CNS1-deficient females and upon acute ablation of pTreg cells. These findings indicate that pTreg cells play a predominant role in maternal-fetal tolerance. Consistent with the impaired pTreg induction during allogeneic pregnancy in CNS1-deficient females, we observed markedly reduced Treg cell numbers in the decidua in these mice mated with BALB/c males (Figure 5A ). Proliferative activity assessed by Ki67 expression was not increased in Treg cell subsets in the decidua and DLN in CNS1-deficient mice in comparison to CNS1-sufficient controls (Figure S3). These results suggested that paucity of pTreg cells is not associated with compensatory expansion of tTreg cells, in agreement with our recent observation (Josefowicz et al., 2012Josefowicz S.Z. Niec R.E. Kim H.Y. Treuting P. Chinen T. Zheng Y. Umetsu D.T. Rudensky A.Y. Extrathymically generated regulatory T cells control mucosal TH2 inflammation.Nature. 2012; 482: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The observed decrease in the Treg cell population inversely correlated with the increased presence of activated effector CD62LloCD4+ T cells (Figure 5B); however, no significant changes in effector cytokine production were detected in the DLN or decidua (Figure S4). It must be noted that fluid composition and activation state of immune cells in a rapidly changing placental environment could mask potential differences. Histologic examination of the placentas of CNS1-deficient and -sufficient females performed in a blinded fashion showed that the genotype of the dams can be accurately predicted by the morphological status of the decidual spiral arteries; although there was some variability between individual placentas in any one uterus, CNS1-deficient placentas exhibited more prominent clusters of thickened blood vessels as compared to CNS1-sufficient littermate controls (Figure 5C). At day E13.5, placentas of surviving embryos of CNS1-deficient females exhibited early necrosis of spiral arteries and edema, whereas resorptions were characterized by embryo loss with necrotic labyrinths (Figure 5D). Presumptive early resorption sites exhibited necrosis or thrombosis of decidual vessels and edema in the placentas and embryos (Figure S5). Consistent with the immune-mediated pathology, more prominent T cell presence was noted in CNS1-deficient placentas, where single T cells were scattered within all layers of the placenta with clusters prominent in the decidua near spiral arteries (Figure 5E). In contrast, only rare single T cells were observed in CNS1-sufficient placentas, and no major changes in the numbers of B cells and macrophages were detected (Figure S5). These observations are indicative of an inflammatory pathology associated with allogeneic pregnancy in CNS1-deficient females resembling that of human pregnancy-associated disorders such as pre-eclampsia (Redman and Sargent, 2005Redman C.W.

Surprisingly, whereas U1 depletion terminated most nascent gene transcripts within ~1 kb, moderate functional U1 level decreases, insufficient to inhibit splicing, dose-dependently shifted PCPA downstream and elicited mRNA 3' UTR shortening and proximal 3' exon switching characteristic of activated immune and neuronal cells, stem cells, and cancer. Activated neurons' signature mRNA shortening could be recapitulated by U1 decrease and antagonized by U1 overexpression. Importantly, we show that rapid and transient transcriptional upregulation inherent to neuronal activation physiology creates U1 shortage relative to pre-mRNAs. Additional experiments suggest cotranscriptional PCPA counteracted by U1 association with nascent transcripts, a process we term telescripting, ensuring transcriptome integrity and regulating mRNA length."
https://openalex.org/W2128367294,"Although endogenous recruitment of adult neural stem cells has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy, clinical approaches for achieving this are lacking. Here, we show that metformin, a widely used drug, promotes neurogenesis and enhances spatial memory formation. Specifically, we show that an atypical PKC-CBP pathway is essential for the normal genesis of neurons from neural precursors and that metformin activates this pathway to promote rodent and human neurogenesis in culture. Metformin also enhances neurogenesis in the adult mouse brain in a CBP-dependent fashion, and in so doing enhances spatial reversal learning in the water maze. Thus, metformin, by activating an aPKC-CBP pathway, recruits neural stem cells and enhances neural function, thereby providing a candidate pharmacological approach for nervous system therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2054781132,"Loeys-Dietz syndrome (LDS) associates with a tissue signature for high transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling but is often caused by heterozygous mutations in genes encoding positive effectors of TGF-β signaling, including either subunit of the TGF-β receptor or SMAD3, thereby engendering controversy regarding the mechanism of disease. Here, we report heterozygous mutations or deletions in the gene encoding the TGF-β2 ligand for a phenotype within the LDS spectrum and show upregulation of TGF-β signaling in aortic tissue from affected individuals. Furthermore, haploinsufficient Tgfb2(+/-) mice have aortic root aneurysm and biochemical evidence of increased canonical and noncanonical TGF-β signaling. Mice that harbor both a mutant Marfan syndrome (MFS) allele (Fbn1(C1039G/+)) and Tgfb2 haploinsufficiency show increased TGF-β signaling and phenotypic worsening in association with normalization of TGF-β2 expression and high expression of TGF-β1. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that compensatory autocrine and/or paracrine events contribute to the pathogenesis of TGF-β-mediated vasculopathies."
https://openalex.org/W2117647921,"In this issue, Thomas Kupper and colleagues report that mice deficient for ROR-γ or interleukin-23 (IL-23) receptor showed impaired melanoma growth. Tumor growth inhibition was dependent in part on IL-9 and T helper type 9 (TH9) cells. Moreover, the authors showed that IL-9 acts on mast cells rather than T or B cells to mediate its antitumor effects and that TH9 cells are present in human blood and skin, suggesting that a role for TH9 cells in human tumor immunity should be explored. Interleukin-9 (IL-9) is a T cell cytokine that acts through a γC-family receptor on target cells and is associated with inflammation and allergy. We determined that T cells from mice deficient in the T helper type 17 (TH17) pathway genes encoding retinoid-related orphan receptor γ (ROR-γ) and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) produced abundant IL-9, and we found substantial growth inhibition of B16F10 melanoma in these mice. IL-9–blocking antibodies reversed this tumor growth inhibition and enhanced tumor growth in wild-type (WT) mice. Il9r−/− mice showed accelerated tumor growth, and administration of recombinant IL-9 (rIL-9) to tumor-bearing WT and Rag1−/− mice inhibited melanoma as well as lung carcinoma growth. Adoptive transfer of tumor-antigen–specific TH9 cells into both WT and Rag1−/− mice suppressed melanoma growth; this effect was abrogated by treatment with neutralizing antibodies to IL-9. Exogenous rIL-9 inhibited tumor growth in Rag1−/− mice but not in mast-cell–deficient mice, suggesting that the targets of IL-9 in this setting include mast cells but not T or B cells. In addition, we found higher numbers of TH9 cells in normal human skin and blood compared to metastatic lesions of subjects with progressive stage IV melanoma. These results suggest a role for IL-9 in tumor immunity and offer insight into potential therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2001634461,"The differentiation of follicular dendritic cells (FDC) is essential to the remarkable microanatomic plasticity of lymphoid follicles. Here we show that FDC arise from ubiquitous perivascular precursors (preFDC) expressing platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ). PDGFRβ-Cre-driven reporter gene recombination resulted in FDC labeling, whereas conditional ablation of PDGFRβ(+)-derived cells abolished FDC, indicating that FDC originate from PDGFRβ(+) cells. Lymphotoxin-α-overexpressing prion protein (PrP)(+) kidneys developed PrP(+) FDC after transplantation into PrP(-) mice, confirming that preFDC exist outside lymphoid organs. Adipose tissue-derived PDGFRβ(+) stromal-vascular cells responded to FDC maturation factors and, when transplanted into lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR)(-) kidney capsules, differentiated into Mfge8(+)CD21/35(+)FcγRIIβ(+)PrP(+) FDC capable of trapping immune complexes and recruiting B cells. Spleens of lymphocyte-deficient mice contained perivascular PDGFRβ(+) FDC precursors whose expansion required both lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and lymphotoxin. The ubiquity of preFDC and their strategic location at blood vessels may explain the de novo generation of organized lymphoid tissue at sites of lymphocytic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2070131223,"Exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation from the sun can result in sunburn, premature aging and carcinogenesis, but the mechanism responsible for acute inflammation of the skin is not well understood. Here we show that RNA is released from keratinocytes after UVB exposure and that this stimulates production of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) from nonirradiated keratinocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Whole-transcriptome sequencing revealed that UVB irradiation of keratinocytes induced alterations in the double-stranded domains of some noncoding RNAs. We found that this UVB-damaged RNA was sufficient to induce cytokine production from nonirradiated cells, as UVB irradiation of a purified noncoding RNA (U1 RNA) reproduced the same response as the one we observed to UVB-damaged keratinocytes. The responses to both UVB-damaged self-RNAs and UVB-damaged keratinocytes were dependent on Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1 (TRIF). In response to UVB exposure, Tlr3(-/-) mice did not upregulate TNF-α in the skin. Moreover, TLR3 was also necessary for UVB-radiation-induced immune suppression. These findings establish that UVB damage is detected by TLR3 and that self-RNA is a damage-associated molecular pattern that serves as an endogenous signal of solar injury."
https://openalex.org/W2025073474,"A predisposition for thoracic aortic aneurysms leading to acute aortic dissections can be inherited in families in an autosomal dominant manner. Genome-wide linkage analysis of two large unrelated families with thoracic aortic disease followed by whole-exome sequencing of affected relatives identified causative mutations in TGFB2. These mutations-a frameshift mutation in exon 6 and a nonsense mutation in exon 4-segregated with disease with a combined logarithm of odds (LOD) score of 7.7. Sanger sequencing of 276 probands from families with inherited thoracic aortic disease identified 2 additional TGFB2 mutations. TGFB2 encodes transforming growth factor (TGF)-β2, and the mutations are predicted to cause haploinsufficiency for TGFB2; however, aortic tissue from cases paradoxically shows increased TGF-β2 expression and immunostaining. Thus, haploinsufficiency for TGFB2 predisposes to thoracic aortic disease, suggesting that the initial pathway driving disease is decreased cellular TGF-β2 levels leading to a secondary increase in TGF-β2 production in the diseased aorta."
https://openalex.org/W1993085259,"Regeneration of adult tissues depends on stem cells that are primed to enter a differentiation program, while remaining quiescent. How these two characteristics can be reconciled is exemplified by skeletal muscle in which the majority of quiescent satellite cells transcribe the myogenic determination gene Myf5, without activating the myogenic program. We show that Myf5 mRNA, together with microRNA-31, which regulates its translation, is sequestered in mRNP granules present in the quiescent satellite cell. In activated satellite cells, mRNP granules are dissociated, relative levels of miR-31 are reduced, and Myf5 protein accumulates, which initially requires translation, but not transcription. Conditions that promote the continued presence of mRNP granules delay the onset of myogenesis. Manipulation of miR-31 levels affects satellite cell differentiation ex vivo and muscle regeneration in vivo. We therefore propose a model in which posttranscriptional mechanisms hold quiescent stem cells poised to enter a tissue-specific differentiation program."
https://openalex.org/W2046623240,"Activation-induced deaminase (AID)/APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases, known to function in diverse cellular processes from antibody diversification to mRNA editing, have also been implicated in DNA demethylation, a major process for transcriptional activation. Although oxidation-dependent pathways for demethylation have been described, pathways involving deamination of either 5-methylcytosine (5mC) or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) have emerged as alternatives. Here we address the biochemical plausibility of deamination-coupled demethylation. We found that purified AID/APOBECs have substantially reduced activity on 5mC relative to cytosine, their canonical substrate, and no detectable deamination of 5hmC. This finding was explained by the reactivity of a series of modified substrates, where steric bulk was increasingly detrimental to deamination. Further, upon AID/APOBEC overexpression, the deamination product of 5hmC was undetectable in genomic DNA, whereas oxidation intermediates remained detectable. Our results indicate that the steric requirements for cytosine deamination are one intrinsic barrier to the proposed function of deaminases in DNA demethylation."

Populations of unipotent stem cells maintain adult homeostasis in glabrous skin Depending on injury mode, each stem cell type responds differently but unipotently Sweat duct basal cells and gland myoepithelial cells are multipotent when engrafted Sweat and mammary gland stem cells differ in transcription and tissue regeneration Failure to regulate body temperature in hot climates or during exercise can lead to hyperthermia, stroke, and death. Eccrine sweat glands perform this vital function. In response to thermal (trunk skin) and/or emotional stimuli (palmoplantar skin), they produce and secrete salt-enriched sweat fluids (water, sodium, potassium, chloride, urea, lactate, and creatine) into small lumenal orifices that extend to the skin surface (Lobitz and Dobson, 1961Lobitz Jr., W.C. Dobson R.L. Dermatology: the eccrine sweat glands.Annu. Rev. Med. 1961; 12: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Reaching densities of 200–700/cm2 of skin surface, they are by far the most abundant glandular structures of the human body (Sato, 1993Sato K. Biology of the eccrine sweat gland.in: Fitzpatrick T.B. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Freedberg I.M. Austen K.F. Dermatology in Medicine. McGraw-Hill, New York1993: 221-241Google Scholar). In mice, sweat glands are restricted to foot pads, and much of what is known about them stems from observations on human sweat gland morphogenesis and from limited parallels drawn with their distant mammary gland relatives. In mouse, sweat buds emerge just before birth (embryonic day [E] 17.5), whereas mammary buds appear at E13.5. Both bud types are initiated by Ectodysplasin-A receptor-mediated signaling and begin as morphologically similar, undifferentiated invaginations from epidermis (Cui and Schlessinger, 2006Cui C.Y. Schlessinger D. EDA signaling and skin appendage development.Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2477-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, Mustonen et al., 2004Mustonen T. Ilmonen M. Pummila M.

Ectodysplasin A1 promotes placodal cell fate during early morphogenesis of ectodermal appendages.Development. 2004; 131: 4907-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). However, whereas the nascent mammary duct is relatively short and undergoes elaborate branching morphogenesis during development, sweat buds generate a single long duct that extends deep within the dermis. As the straight duct matures, it forms a coiled gland from its tip (Figure 1A ). Like the mammary gland, the secretory coil consists of an outer basal layer of keratin 5 and 14 (K5/K14)+, smooth muscle actin (SMA)+ myoepithelial cells, and an inner suprabasal layer of K8/K18/K19+ lumenal cells (Langbein et al., 2005Langbein L.

Human sweat gland myoepithelial cells express a unique set of cytokeratins and reveal the potential for alternative epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation states in culture.J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1925-1936PubMed Google Scholar). However, the coiled architecture of the sweat gland is highly divergent from the lobular structure of the mammary gland. Additionally, sweat glands have small lumens and show little or no signs of homeostatic change, whereas mammary glands have large lumens and undergo dramatic tissue expansion during pregnancy (Richert et al., 2000Richert M.M. Schwertfeger K.L. Ryder J.W. Anderson S.M. An atlas of mouse mammary gland development.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 2000; 5: 227-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). These natural differences in cellular proliferation and turnover may also explain why cancers are so rare in sweat glands but frequent in mammary tissue. Proliferation and tissue generation are features fueled by adult stem cells. Given the enormous tissue-regenerative capabilities of the mammary gland, it is not surprising that their glandular stem cells have been a long-standing topic of intense study and are now well-characterized. As suggested by earlier studies (Kordon and Smith, 1998Kordon E.C. Smith G.H. An entire functional mammary gland may comprise the progeny from a single cell.Development. 1998; 125: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then documented with purified (K14+α6-integrinhiCD24+) cells, individual myoepithelial progenitors can reconstitute functional mammary glands when introduced into a cleared fat pad (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E.

Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Based upon these results, it seemed likely that myoepithelial stem cells might give rise to lumenal cells within the mammary gland. However, recent lineage tracings show that during puberty and homeostasis, expansion and maintenance of the mammary gland are fueled largely if not solely by unipotent lumenal and myoepithelial progenitors (Van Keymeulen et al., 2011Van Keymeulen A. Rocha A.S. Ousset M. Beck B. Bouvencourt G. Rock J. Sharma N. Dekoninck S. Blanpain C. Distinct stem cells contribute to mammary gland development and maintenance.Nature. 2011; 479: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The experimental basis for this discrepancy is unknown. It has been speculated that the purified myoepithelial transplantation assays may reflect a wound healing state that does not occur in normal homeostasis. For the sweat gland, the paucity of massive hormonally induced fluctuations in tissue production raises the question as to whether sweat stem cells exist at all and, if they do, where they are and how they behave in morphogenesis, homeostasis, and wound repair. Moreover, the prominence of the straight duct in this epidermal appendage adds an additional level of complexity that has been largely ignored in the mammary stem cell field. Much of what is known about proliferative potential within the sweat duct and gland comes from histological studies dating back to the early 1950s. When researchers performed deep dermal injury to the backskin of adult human volunteers, signs of regenerative activity were observed in the damaged glands. In initial experiments, injury-provoked mitoses seemed largely confined to basal cells of the straight duct (Lobitz et al., 1954Lobitz Jr., W.C. Holyoke J.B. Montagna W. Responses of the human eccrine sweat duct to controlled injury: growth center of the epidermal sweat duct unit.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1954; 23: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, in subsequent experiments, occasional mitoses were observed in several morphologically distinct epithelial cells residing within closer proximity to the secretory coils, prompting speculation that perhaps these cells might be able to dedifferentiate to repair sweat glands, ducts, and epidermis (Lobitz et al., 1956Lobitz Jr., W.C. Holyoke J.B. Brophy D. Response of the human eccrine sweat duct to dermal injury.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1956; 26 (discussion, 259–262): 247-259PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Despite the tantalizing aspects of this hypothesis put forth so long ago, only a few follow-up reports in the past 55 years substantiate regenerative potential for sweat gland cells. Several of these were documented proliferation of dissociated sweat gland cells in culture; most of the in vivo studies focused on the contribution of sweat gland cells to epidermal repair after superficial skin injuries (Biedermann et al., 2010Biedermann T. Pontiggia L. Böttcher-Haberzeth S. Tharakan S. Braziulis E. Schiestl C. Meuli M. Reichmann E. Human eccrine sweat gland cells can reconstitute a stratified epidermis.J. Invest.

Re-epithelialization of porcine skin by the sweat apparatus.J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the precise cells involved were not identified in these studies, nor was the overall regenerative capacity of the sweat gland explored. Because mammary gland stem cells are the only glandular stem cells studied in detail, it remains unknown to what extent their features might establish a paradigm for glandular stem cells. Similarly, until other glandular stem cells are isolated and profiled, it remains unresolved whether stem cells from different adult glands are analogous and merely differentiate distinctly in response to unique microenvironments or whether defining molecular characteristics are established during morphogenesis. Given the paucity of knowledge about the most abundant gland of our body and the observation that sweat glands are much less dynamic than mammary glands, we've now used the sweat gland as a model to address these key questions in glandular stem cell biology. In addition, we also explore the constituents of the adult sweat duct and test for their stemness. Here, we report the identification, characterization, and regenerative potential of three types of adult progenitors within the sweat gland and its duct. Remarkably, each of these three populations responds distinctly to different types of skin injuries and to engraftments in a variety of foreign environments. Our findings provide concepts in glandular stem cell biology and reveal fundamental differences in the homeostatic dynamics and the molecular biology of stem cell lineages of glandular and ductal tissues and of other types of epidermal appendages. By illuminating how sweat glands form, are maintained, and differ from mammary glands and hair follicles (HFs), we provide a framework for understanding the roots of some genetic disorders in which sweat glands, and not other epidermal appendages, are specifically affected. To gain insights into how the sweat duct and gland develop, we began by monitoring proliferative activity by administering a short pulse (4 hr) of nucleotide analog ethynyldeoxyuridine (EdU) just prior to analysis. We used mice that express histone H2B-green fluorescent protein (H2BGFP) in all K5-expressing cells and analyzed EdU incorporation in pawskin during postnatal development. Because the K5 promoter is silenced as basal progenitors differentiate, we used fluorescence intensity as a predictor of potential precursor-product relation between basal and suprabasal populations. Representative immunofluorescence images and quantifications of the data are provided in Figures S1A (available online) and 1B. At postnatal day (P) 0, emerging sweat buds were uniformly GFPhi (K5-expressing). By P3, each bud had grown downward, producing a nascent straight duct. The developing duct was bilayered, with a K5+ GFPhi basal layer and a K5lo GFPdim suprabasal layer. Suprabasal cells within the lower nascent duct also expressed K18 and accounted for ∼30% of all EdU+ cells at this stage. Ductal proliferation and K18 expression were accompanied by the emergence of a nascent sweat gland from the tip (Figure S1A). K5+/K18− basal cells within developing glands were distinguished from their ductal counterparts by SMA expression and a paucity of EdU+ cells. By contrast, whether from the lower duct or the gland, K18+ cells still incorporated EdU over a 2 week developmental window. Once mature, proliferation was largely if not solely confined to K5+/K18− basal cells of the sweat duct and was not detected in the sweat gland (Figure 1B, P22). Moreover, whether in the sweat duct or gland, cells were either K5+ or K18+ at this stage, underscoring the transient nature of double-positive, proliferative suprabasal progenitors during morphogenesis. These results also highlighted early molecular and architectural similarities between proliferative tips of sweat ducts and emerging glands. To further evaluate cycling behavior within developing sweat ducts and glands, we conducted a series of pulse-chase experiments (Figure 1C). In the first experiment, EdU was administered from P0→P3 to mark proliferating nascent ductal cells and then analyzed at P3 and after 8 weeks of chase. Whether EdUhi or EdUlo, label-retaining cells (LRCs) were found exclusively within mature coiled secretory sweat glands and not straight ducts. Moreover, the majority of EdUhi and ∼80% of Edulo cells were myoepithelial. With EdU labelings of P0→P5, and P6→P10, more lumenal LRCs were detected (Figures 1C and S1B). That said, even at P6→P10, some myoepithelial LRCs were still seen, even though any that had formed by this time were not themselves proliferating (see Figure 1B). To further explore relative proliferation rates within ductal and glandular populations, we turned to pTREH2BGFP/K5tTA (Tet-off) mice (Tumbar et al., 2004Tumbar T. Guasch G. Greco V. Blanpain C. Lowry W.E. Rendl M. Fuchs E. Defining the epithelial stem cell niche in skin.Science. 2004; 303: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). This more sensitive method enabled us to express H2BGFP in all K5+ cells beginning in the embryo and then silence H2BGFP transcription by administering doxycycline. At P21, all K5+ basal cells from untreated pawskin epidermis, ducts, and sweat glands were marked by H2BGFP, but after 6 weeks, fluorescence was only retained within sweat gland coils (Figure 1D). Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy confirmed the myoepithelial identity of these H2BGFP-LRCs (Figure 1E). Together, our collective pulse and pulse-chase studies support the view that cells within the developing lumenal compartment undergo several more rounds of proliferation than myoepithelial cells, but that the entire sweat gland is largely static once it reaches maturity. By contrast, adult basal cells of the sweat duct remain proliferative. To test progenitor potential of cells within epidermis, sweat ducts, and glands in vivo, we employed lineage tracing with RosaLacZ or RosaYFP reporter mice, in which a stop codon excisable by Cre-recombinase exists between a ubiquitously expressed Rosa26 promoter and the reporter gene. We mated these lines with transgenic strains driving constitutive or inducible expression of Cre-recombinase in distinct cell populations. To assess the contribution of K5/K14-derived embryonic skin basal cells to sweat gland development, we used K14Cre mice and induced β-galactosidase in K14+ cells at E13.5–E15.5 (Vasioukhin et al., 1999Vasioukhin V. Degenstein L. Wise B. Fuchs E. The magical touch: genome targeting in epidermal stem cells induced by tamoxifen application to mouse skin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Similar to previous findings on HFs (Vasioukhin et al., 1999Vasioukhin V. Degenstein L. Wise B. Fuchs E. The magical touch: genome targeting in epidermal stem cells induced by tamoxifen application to mouse skin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and mammary glands (Van Keymeulen et al., 2011Van Keymeulen A. Rocha A.S. Ousset M. Beck B. Bouvencourt G. Rock J. Sharma N. Dekoninck S. Blanpain C. Distinct stem cells contribute to mammary gland development and maintenance.Nature. 2011; 479: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), this tracing established that sweat duct and gland develop from K5/K14-expressing multipotent basal progenitors (Figure 2A ). We shifted to K14rtta/TetO and K5CreER mice, which enabled us to induce RosaYFP in basal cells just after birth, when sweat buds are initiating. Four weeks after induction, two patterns of YFP-marked sweat glands were found: one had only YFP+ myoepithelial cells; the other displayed YFP in both lumenal and myoepithelial compartments. This was true for both of these Cre drivers (Figures 2B). One possibility consistent with these results is that multipotent K5/K14+ progenitors initiate sweat gland morphogenesis, but as development proceeds, the basal lineage becomes largely unipotent. We tested this directly by analyzing myoepithelial cells in mature sweat glands. When activated at P28→P30, both K5 and K14 Cre drivers selectively marked myoepithelial cells, and after 8–12 weeks of chase, no signs of YFP+ lumenal cells were detected (Figures 2B and S2C). The existence of multipotent and unipotent basal progenitors led us to wonder whether there might be equivalent types of suprabasal progenitors, or whether they derive solely from basal progenitors, analogous to what happens in skin epidermis. In searching for additional Cre drivers that might allow us to resolve this issue, we discovered that Sox9CreER (Krahl and Sellheyer, 2010Krahl D. Sellheyer K. Sox9, more than a marker of the outer root sheath: spatiotemporal expression pattern during human cutaneous embryogenesis.J. Cutan. Pathol. 2010; 37: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) is first activatable within suprabasal nascent ductal cells. Moreover, when induced from P1→P3 and examined at P6, signs of clonal expansion were evident (Figure 2C, RosaLacZ). Immunofluorescence microscopy of RosaYFP lineage-traced cells confirmed their suprabasal location within nascent ducts. These β1-integrin−, K18+ cells were also weakly positive for K14, in agreement with the temporal appearance of proliferative double-positive progenitors at this site. By P22, progeny of Sox9CreER-induced cells were found throughout sweat glands, straight ducts, and even sweat duct orifices. Within the gland, marked progeny were predominately lumenal (K18+), although occasional SMA+ myoepithelial cells were marked (Figure 2C, RosaYFP). To explore the potential of suprabasal progenitors, we conducted lineage tracings in K19CreER and K18CreER × RosaYFP mice. At P28, YFP-marked lumenal cells were prevalent (Figure 2D). Myoepithelial cells were negative for YFP, and this did not change after 8–12 weeks of chase (Figures S1D and S1E). These findings suggested that K19 and K18 promoters had been activated selectively in unipotent lumenal progenitors. We confirmed the existence of unipotent lumenal progenitors by using K15CrePGR mice, whose Cre is inducible by the progesterone analog RU486 (Morris et al., 2004Morris R.J. Liu Y. Marles L. Yang Z.

In pawskin, K15 promoter activity was not detectable until P5, and it was restricted to lumenal cells of emerging secretory coils (Figure 2E). When lineage traced to P22, signs of clonal expansion were apparent, but again, only lumenal cells were marked. The lineage-restricted unipotent behavior of these glandular progenitors was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses (introduced later in the text). Similar signs of maturation-associated fate restrictions were seen within sweat ducts, where proliferative activity became restricted to basal cells (Figure S2A ). Moreover, given the overall quiescence of the sweat gland, the lack of label retention within adult ductal basal cells (Figures 1C and 1D) appeared to reflect frequent basal to suprabasal turnover within the duct, analogous to what happens in epidermis. Taken together, our data pointed to the emergence of three distinct types of unipotent progenitors within mature sweat ducts and glands. Our data further showed that these unipotent progenitors all derive from a common multipotent K14+ sweat bud progenitor. This progenitor then generates a nascent duct replete with distinct K14+ basal and K18/K14 double-positive suprabasal progenitors, both of which transiently maintain multipotency: they expand within their respective layers during sweat duct maturation, and they also form the sweat gland. At this point, progenitors of gland and duct become restricted in potential. The relatively static state of mature sweat glands led us to wonder whether they have long-lived stem cells. To address this question, we focused on how cells within sweat duct and gland respond to injury. For this study, we used Sox9CreER/RosaLacZ mice, which when induced in adults activated Cre throughout most of these cells (Figure 3A ). Two days after induction, pawskin epidermis was scraped to induce re-epithelialization (t = 0 hr). Within 3 days post-wounding, β-gal+ cells and/or their progeny appeared within regenerating epidermis under the scab. By 2 weeks, the narrow column of β-gal+ cells that surrounded sweat duct orifices at t = 0 had broadened considerably (Figure 3A). However, many regenerated cells were unlabeled and hence appeared to come from neighboring epidermis. To gain further insights, we repeated the assay, this time with a YFP reporter and administering EdU pulses prior to analyses (Figure 3B). As seen by a short (4 hr) EdU pulse (left), pawskin epidermis adjacent to the wound was highly proliferative. Sox9YFP+ ductal cells were also proliferative. In a longer (3 day) pulse, EdU+ ductal cells rose from ∼30% to ∼70% (right). Sweat glands, however, appeared to remain quiescent throughout wound healing. Their lack of contribution was unambiguously documented with wound studies on K15CrePGR/RosaLacZ mice (Figure S3). We next addressed whether adult sweat gland cells are refractory to wound repair, or whether their regenerative potential is only unleashed when wounds are in closer proximity. To generate more localized tissue damage, we mated K15CrePGR and K14CreER mice to RosaiDTR mice and then induced diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) expression specifically in either adult lumenal (K15CrePGR) or myoepithelial (K14CreER) cells. After 4 days of DT, apoptosis (as determined by caspase 3 activation) was selectively induced within a fraction of DTR+ cells (Figure 4A ). Few apoptotic cells were detected without DT. In K15CrePGR/iDTR DT-treated mice, myoepithelial cells were spared, not only validating targeting selectivity but also demonstrating that cell death was not a global indirect effect but rather a direct consequence of DT/DTR action on lumenal epithelial cells. As evidenced by EdU pulses given prior to analysis, robust proliferation was induced selectively within K18+ lumenal cells of secretory coils (Figure 4B). Ultrastructural analyses confirmed that apoptotic and mitotic cells were restricted to the lumenal population, whereas neighboring myoepithelial cells remained unaffected (Figure S4). Further reflecting the selective damage were signs of lumen collapse within affected glands. When similar experiments were performed with K14CreER/RosaiDTR mice, the reverse was observed. Although K14CreER-mediated targeting of DTR to adult myoepithelial cells was inefficient, it was selective. Moreover, the proliferative response that ensued after DT treatment appeared to be confined to myoepithelial and not lumenal cells (Figure 4C). To determine whether these proliferative responses were reflective of actual glandular tissue repair, we performed an iodine/starch-based sweat test on paw pads of our animals (Figure 4A, bottom). This procedure detects sweat, reflective of a functional gland. Prior to DT, paws of K15CrePGR/iDTR mice responded to the assay by displaying indigo-black dots, indicative of sweat production. After 4 days of DT, indigo dots had decreased in number and intensity, suggesting that sweat production was impaired. Most importantly, 7 days after DT treatment was terminated, dots resurfaced, indicating that sweat gland function had been restored. Together, these results establish the existence of two distinct types of resident unipotent stem cells. Moreover, both lumenal and myoepithelial stem cells of adult sweat glands possess regenerative potential that can be tapped in response to localized injury. Progenitor activation was reflected by the enhanced proliferation seen within the gland following injury; regenerative potential was reflected by subsequent restoration of secretory functions following activation and repair. To delve more deeply into the molecular properties and differences of sweat gland progenitors, we devised methods to purify them. We first showed that (1) similar to the HF infundibulum (Jensen et al., 2008Jensen U.B. Yan X. Triel C. Woo S.H. Christensen R. Owens D.M. A distinct population of clonogenic and multipotent murine follicular keratinocytes residing in the upper isthmus.J.

Our purification scheme employed K14-H2BGFP transgenic mice in which epidermis, sweat ducts, and glands were brightly fluorescent. After separating pawskin epidermal and dermal (containing sweat ducts and glands) fractions, we used FACS on cells from the dermal fraction to isolate GFPhiα6hi and GFPloα6med populations, which were further subfractionated to generate straight duct cells (basal: GFPhiα6hiβ1medSca1pos; suprabasal: GFPloα6medβ1medSca1pos) and glandular cells (myoepithelial: GFPhiα6hiβ1hiSca1neg; lumenal GFPloα6medβ1medSca1neg) (Figures 5B and 5C). We validated the sorting strategy by applying it to several transgenic lines expressing GFP or YFP in selective glandular compartments, which enabled us to match FACS with immunofluorescence (Figure S5). The identity and dramatic enrichment of our purified populations was further revealed by cytospin analysis (Figure 5D). Interestingly, both myoepithelial cells and basal straight duct populations were enriched (1/200–1/750) for cells forming large colonies (holoclones) (Figures 5E–5G). Cells within these colonies were small, tightly packed, and morphologically uniform, with little or no signs of terminal differentiation. Moreover, many colonies could be passaged lo"

Here we report that enzymatically generated hydrogen sulfide anion (HS(-)) regulates the metabolism and signaling actions of various electrophiles. HS(-) reacts with electrophiles, best represented by 8-nitro-cGMP, via direct sulfhydration and modulates cellular redox signaling. The relevance of this reaction is reinforced by the significant 8-nitro-cGMP formation in mouse cardiac tissue after myocardial infarction that is modulated by alterations in HS(-) biosynthesis. Cardiac HS(-), in turn, suppresses electrophile-mediated H-Ras activation and cardiac cell senescence, contributing to the beneficial effects of HS(-) on myocardial infarction-associated heart failure. Thus, this study reveals HS(-)-induced electrophile sulfhydration as a unique mechanism for regulating electrophile-mediated redox signaling."

Among these, uropathogenic Escherichia coli often coexpress the virulence-associated siderophore yersiniabactin (Ybt) with catecholate siderophores. Here we used a new MS screening approach to reveal that Ybt is also a physiologically favorable Cu(II) ligand. Direct MS detection of the resulting Cu(II)-Ybt complex in mice and humans with E. coli urinary tract infections demonstrates copper binding to be a physiologically relevant in vivo interaction during infection. Ybt expression corresponded to higher copper resistance among human urinary tract isolates, suggesting a protective role for this interaction. Chemical and genetic characterization showed that Ybt helps bacteria resist copper toxicity by sequestering host-derived Cu(II) and preventing its catechol-mediated reduction to Cu(I). Together, these studies reveal a new virulence-associated function for Ybt that is distinct from iron binding."

However, it is unclear how AFs are displaced from maturing 40S ribosomes, if or how maturing subunits are assessed for fidelity, and what prevents premature translation initiation once AFs dissociate. Here we show that maturation involves a translation-like cycle whereby the translation factor eIF5B, a GTPase, promotes joining of large (60S) subunits with pre-40S subunits to give 80S-like complexes, which are subsequently disassembled by the termination factor Rli1, an ATPase. The AFs Tsr1 and Rio2 block the mRNA channel and initiator tRNA binding site, and therefore 80S-like ribosomes lack mRNA or initiator tRNA. After Tsr1 and Rio2 dissociate from 80S-like complexes Rli1-directed displacement of 60S subunits allows for translation initiation.

In eukaryotes, this process is facilitated by a large machinery of mostly essential assembly factors (AFs) and occurs in two phases: an early nucleolar/nuclear phase followed by cytoplasmic maturation steps (Karbstein, 2011Karbstein K. Inside the 40S ribosome assembly machinery.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2011; 15: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, Strunk and Karbstein, 2009Strunk B.S. Karbstein K. Powering through ribosome assembly.RNA. 2009; 15: 2083-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). For assembly of the small (40S) subunit, ribosomal proteins (Rps) from the “body” and the “platform” regions of the subunit bind during transcription (Ferreira-Cerca et al., 2005Ferreira-Cerca S. Pöll G. Gleizes P.E. Tschochner H. Milkereit P. Roles of eukaryotic ribosomal proteins in maturation and transport of pre-18S rRNA and ribosome function.Mol.

Biol. 2011; 15: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Most of the remaining proteins, which bind to the “head” region, bind prior to the export of the small subunit to the cytoplasm to produce a 40S assembly intermediate that contains all Rps except Rps10 and Rps26, and which thus substantially resembles mature 40S subunits (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition to pre-18S rRNA (20S rRNA) and most Rps, the cytoplasmic pre-40S precursor is stably bound to seven AFs: the nuclease Nob1, which produces the mature 18S rRNA 3′-end, and its regulator Pno1; the methylase Dim1; the kinase Rio2; the export adaptor Ltv1 and its binding partner Enp1; and the GTPase-like Tsr1. These AFs copurify with pre-40S subunits over two columns and remain bound for days (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As this assembly intermediate resides in the cytoplasm, where mRNAs, tRNAs, and translation factors are abundant, premature translation initiation may present a problem as incompletely assembled ribosomes could be prone to translational errors, and stalled ribosomes and their bound mRNAs are rapidly degraded (Cole et al., 2009Cole S.E. LaRiviere F.J. Merrikh C.N. Moore M.J. A convergence of rRNA and mRNA quality control pathways revealed by mechanistic analysis of nonfunctional rRNA decay.Mol.

Immature small ribosomal subunits can engage in translation initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A major function of AFs bound to late cytoplasmic 40S assembly intermediates is to prevent premature translation initiation (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). AFs sterically block the binding of translation initiation factors to the 40S subunit and prevent mRNA recruitment. Additionally, Tsr1 impedes the spontaneous joining of 40S and 60S subunits, and the decoding site is deformed. Although the positioning of these AFs explains how premature translation initiation is blocked, their presence raises new questions: How is dissociation of assembly factors promoted without leading to translation initiation in the process? Does this conversion of inactive assembly intermediates to mature 40S ribosomes require any checkpoints to assure that subunits are functional? Furthermore, purified cytoplasmic 40S ribosome assembly intermediates are stable for days, whereas maturation, and thus dissociation of AFs, takes only minutes in vivo (Granneman et al., 2005Granneman S. Nandineni M.R. Baserga S.J. The putative NTPase Fap7 mediates cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing through a direct interaction with Rps14.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10352-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, Kos and Tollervey, 2010Kos M. Tollervey D. Yeast pre-rRNA processing and modification occur cotranscriptionally.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 809-820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that extrinsic factors are required to promote dissociation of AFs. Taking advantage of the sequential dissociation of AFs from pre-40S subunits, and using yeast strains deleted or depleted for factors promoting progress in this dissociation cascade, we have dissected individual late steps in 40S ribosome maturation. These data reveal the surprising finding that 40S maturation involves a translation-like cycle, whereby mature large (60S) subunits join pre-40S subunits in an eIF5B-dependent manner. However, the resulting 80S-like ribosomes are not translation initiation intermediates as they do not contain mRNA or initiator tRNA. Thus, mRNA recruitment and translation initiation require dissociation of 60S subunits, mediated by the termination factor Rli1. Collectively, these findings define this translation-like cycle as a final quality control step in which major functions of the maturing small subunit, such as binding to 60S subunits and binding to translation factors are inspected. Pre-40S ribosomes that accumulate in the cytoplasm contain seven stably bound AFs, which are strategically positioned to prevent the premature initiation of translation on pre-40S subunits (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). When purified from cells, these pre-40S subunits are stable, suggesting that dissociation of AFs is extrinsically controlled and perhaps even requires energy input in the form of ATP or GTP. However, how this is accomplished and how this occurs without triggering premature translation initiation is unknown. We reasoned that AFs were likely to dissociate sequentially and not all together and that depletion of a protein required for AF removal would lead to accumulation of pre-40S subunits containing only a subset of the seven stably bound AFs: those whose dissociation occurs after or dependent upon the depleted protein. The binding of AFs to pre-40S subunits can be conveniently monitored by sucrose gradient sedimentation followed by western blotting for AFs. Several proteins that are required for the maturation of cytoplasmic pre-40S subunits are not stably associated with these subunits. One of these is Fap7, which contains an ATPase motif (Granneman et al., 2005Granneman S. Nandineni M.R. Baserga S.J. The putative NTPase Fap7 mediates cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing through a direct interaction with Rps14.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10352-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and has ATPase activity (B.S.S. and K.K., unpublished data). To assess if Fap7 is required for displacement of AFs from late pre-40S subunits, we prepared extracts from yeast depleted of Fap7 and analyzed them by sucrose gradient centrifugation (see Table S1, available online, for all yeast strains used in this work). Depletion of Fap7 triggers the accumulation of 80S ribosomes (Figure 1B ), a highly unusual phenotype for cells depleted for 40S assembly factors (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar; data not shown). Immunoblot analyses demonstrate that, in the absence of Fap7, nearly all AFs except for Ltv1 and Rio2 are found within these 80S-like ribosomes (Figure 1D), while they are mostly found in 40S-like fractions in wild type cells (Figure 1C). Moreover, these 80S-like complexes comprise 60S subunits and pre-40S subunits, as they contain 25S rRNA and 20S pre-rRNA (Figure 1F) and lack hallmarks of ∼90S early nucleolar precursors, such as pre-18S rRNA intermediates (21/22/23S or 35S) (Figure 1F; data not shown). Additionally, no evidence for 25.5S rRNA, the precursor for 25S rRNA, was found in these 80S-like ribosomes (data not shown). These data are consistent with the previously reported accumulation of 20S rRNA in the cytoplasm upon Fap7 depletion (Granneman et al., 2005Granneman S. Nandineni M.R. Baserga S.J. The putative NTPase Fap7 mediates cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing through a direct interaction with Rps14.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10352-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and indicate that the substrates for Fap7 during 40S maturation are not free pre-40S ribosomes but instead 80S-like complexes, which contain large ribosomal subunits in addition to pre-40S subunits. Thus, 40S maturation occurs within 80S-like ribosomes. Furthermore, the data also strongly suggest that Fap7 acts after Rio2 and Ltv1 have already dissociated from pre-40S subunits, as these two AFs are not found in 80S-like ribosomes that accumulate upon depletion of Fap7 (Figure 1D). Notably, yeast expressing the Fap7 mutant D82AH84A, mutated in its predicted Walker B motif, show an identical phenotype (Figure S1A ), indicating that ATP hydrolysis is required for progression of the 40S maturation pathway as previously suggested (Granneman et al., 2005Granneman S. Nandineni M.R. Baserga S.J. The putative NTPase Fap7 mediates cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing through a direct interaction with Rps14.Mol. Cell.

To test if Fap7 binds to 80S-like ribosomes during small subunit maturation and to confirm that 80S-like ribosomes are formed as an on-pathway intermediate rather than as a dead-end product that manifests only in the absence of functional Fap7, we tested if Fap7 binds to 80S ribosomes. Fap7 only transiently interacts with preribosomes (Granneman et al., 2005Granneman S. Nandineni M.R. Baserga S.J. The putative NTPase Fap7 mediates cytoplasmic 20S pre-rRNA processing through a direct interaction with Rps14.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10352-10364Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, to stabilize possible interactions between Fap7 and its substrate, formaldehyde crosslinking was performed as previously described (Valásek et al., 2007Valásek L. Szamecz B. Hinnebusch A.G. Nielsen K.H. In vivo stabilization of preinitiation complexes by formaldehyde cross-linking.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 429: 163-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteins associated with Fap7 were purified via TAP purification from a strain expressing TAP-tagged Fap7 and analyzed by mass spectrometry after reversal of the crosslink. Notably, the majority of proteins that copurify with Fap7 are ribosomal proteins from both subunits as well as translation factors (Table 1), strongly supporting the notion that 80S-like ribosomes are bona fide substrates for Fap7. Mass spectrometry also identified some ribosome-associated chaperones, which might copurify via their association with 60S subunits. These findings are consistent with previous gradient centrifugation experiments (Granneman et al., 2005Granneman S. Nandineni M.R. Baserga S.J.

These experiments showed most of Fap7 to be free, consistent with transient binding interactions, whereas a small fraction of Fap7 was associated with 80S ribosomes (Granneman et al., 2005Granneman S.

Gélugne J.P. Belhabich-Baumas K. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Mougin A. Immature small ribosomal subunits can engage in translation initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To determine if the 80S-like ribosomes observed in yeast lacking Fap7 are intermediates in the translation initiation pathway, northern blotting was performed to assess if initiator tRNA (Met-tRNAiMet) was present in these complexes. Notably, the levels of Met-tRNAiMet found in 80S-like ribosomes from yeast lacking Fap7 are strongly reduced relative to those associated with 80S ribosomes in wild-type cells (Figures 2A and 2B ; tRNA levels relative to 5S rRNA levels are 1 ± 0.21 and 0.24 ± 0.22 in wild-type and Fap7-depleted cells, respectively). Furthermore, the levels of Met-tRNAiMet in the 80S-like complexes from Fap7-depleted yeast correlate with levels of remaining mature 40S subunits but not with the highly increased levels of 20S rRNA (Figure 2B), indicating that the remaining Met-tRNAiMet is only associated with remaining mature 80S complexes (containing mature 40S and 60S subunits) in these cells. Therefore, the 80S-like ribosomes that accumulate in Fap7-depleted yeast do not contain initiator tRNA. Furthermore, mass spectrometry indicates that only the 80S peak from wild-type cells, not the 80S-like peak from D82H84A cells, contains eIF2, the initiation factor that delivers initiator tRNA to the ribosome (data not shown). These findings are consistent with the overlap of the binding site for Rio2 (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with that predicted for eIF2·tRNAiMet based on recent footprinting experiments (Shin et al., 2011Shin B.S. Kim J.R. Walker S.E. Dong J. Lorsch J.R. Dever T.E. Initiation factor eIF2γ promotes eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNAi(Met) ternary complex binding to the 40S ribosome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This overlap suggests that Rio2 blocks binding of eIF2·tRNAiMet. Purified 40S assembly intermediates that accumulate in the cytoplasm contain all seven AFs, as well the 18S precursor 20S pre-rRNA, and all 40S ribosomal proteins (Rps), except Rps10 and Rps26, whose binding sites overlap with those for the AFs Ltv1/Enp1 and Pno1, respectively (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The 80S-like ribosomes that accumulate in the absence of Fap7 lack Ltv1, but retain Pno1 (Figure 1D). Accordingly, the pre-40S subunits in these complexes contain Rps10, as demonstrated by mass spectrometry (Figure 2C). In contrast, Rps26 is underrepresented relative to mature 40S subunits (Figure 2C), and its level reflects that of the remaining mature 40S ribosomes in these cells (the ratio of Rps26 in 80S cells from mutant and wild-type cells is 0.25 ± 0.06). These data indicate that ribosomes that accumulate in the absence of functional Fap7 lack Rps26, consistent with their binding to Pno1. Mass spectrometry also suggests that Rps1 and Rps14 are underrepresented (ratiogal:Fap7/wt of Rps1 and Rps14 is 0.43 ± 0.08 and 0.28 ± 0.10, respectively; Figure 2C). These proteins are at least partially bound in stable cytoplasmic ribosomes (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Perhaps their association is weak in cells depleted of Fap7 and lost during centrifugation. Consistent with this idea, Rps1, Rps14, and Rps26 directly interact on the platform when bound to ribosomes (Rabl et al., 2011Rabl J. Leibundgut M. Ataide S.F. Haag A. Ban N. Crystal structure of the eukaryotic 40S ribosomal subunit in complex with initiation factor 1.Science. 2011; 331: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interactions between the C-terminal tail of Rps14 and rRNA are not made until the very last stages of 40S maturation (Jakovljevic et al., 2004Jakovljevic J. de Mayolo P.A. Miles T.D. Nguyen T.M. Léger-Silvestre I. Gas N. Woolford Jr., J.L. The carboxy-terminal extension of yeast ribosomal protein S14 is necessary for maturation of 43S preribosomes.Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, the data herein indicate that final incorporation of Rps14 and Rps26 occurs after Fap7 acts, whereas Rps10 is incorporated previously, possibly in response to dissociation of Ltv1. Asc1 is the yeast homolog of RACK1, a receptor for protein kinase C that mediates translation regulation, and is stoichiometrically bound to 40S subunits. Asc1/RACK1 is also fully bound to 40S subunits in these 80S-like ribosomes but is not present in steady-state pre-40S subunits purified from yeast (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Thus, its incorporation into maturing 40S subunits occurs prior to steps dependent on Fap7. Collectively, these data indicate that the 40S subunits within the 80S-like ribosomes are immature as they contain the 18S-precursor 20S rRNA and lack the essential ribosomal protein Rps26. More important, however, the data suggest that the 80S-like ribosomes that accumulate in the absence of Fap7 do not represent translation initiation intermediates, as they do not contain initiator tRNA. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the pre-40S subunits are found in 80S-like ribosomes and not in polysomes. This finding suggests that the 80S-like ribosomes do not contain mRNA, as it is unlikely that pre-40S subunits should only bind mRNAs not already bound to at least one mature 80S ribosome. Binding of pre-40S subunits to an mRNA would shift 80S complexes into the polysomes, as observed for Pno1 in wild-type cells (Figure 1C). We do note, however, that it is possible that all 80S-like ribosomes are associated with a special class of mRNAs not found in polysomes (e.g., due to size). We do not think this is likely, as only a few such mRNAs are known, and these are not abundant enough to explain the large accumulation of 80S ribosomes (Arava et al., 2003Arava Y. Wang Y. Storey J.D. Liu C.L. Brown P.O. Herschlag D. Genome-wide analysis of mRNA translation profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 3889-3894Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, Wang et al., 2002Wang Y. Liu C.L. Storey J.D. Tibshirani R.J. Herschlag D. Brown P.O. Precision and functional specificity in mRNA decay.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 5860-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, this possibility cannot be formally excluded. The conclusion that 80S-like ribosomes that accumulate in the absence of functional Fap7 do not contain mRNA and are thus not translation initiation intermediates is also consistent with the previous observation that eIF1A, an initiation factor required for opening of the mRNA channel (Passmore et al., 2007Passmore L.A. Schmeing T.M. Maag D. Applefield D.J. Acker M.G. Algire M.A. Lorsch J.R. Ramakrishnan V. The eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF1 and eIF1A induce an open conformation of the 40S ribosome.Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), is not required for 40S maturation (Soudet et al., 2010Soudet J. Gélugne J.P. Belhabich-Baumas K. Caizergues-Ferrer M. Mougin A. Immature small ribosomal subunits can engage in translation initiation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 80-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Tsr1 and Rio2 on pre-40S assembly intermediates block access to the mRNA channel (Strunk et al., 2011Strunk B.S. Loucks C.R. Su M. Vashisth H. Cheng S. Schilling J. Brooks III, C.L. Karbstein K. Skiniotis G. Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Collectively, the data show that the 80S-like ribosomes that accumulate in the absence of Fap7 are not intermediates in the translation initiation pathway. Finally, in wild-type cells, strong polysome association is observed for Pno1 (Figure 1C), indicating that Pno1 does not dissociate until mRNA is bound to pre-40S subunits. The data indicate that 60S subunits join pre-40S subunits during their maturation to give 80S-like complexes that are not translation initiation intermediates. This model, although surprising, rationalizes the previously unexplained finding of a genome-wide survey showing that eIF5B, the GTPase that promotes 60S subunit joining during translation initiation, is involved in 40S maturation (Li et al., 2009Li Z. Lee I. Moradi E. Hung N.J. Johnson A.W. Marcotte E.M. Rational extension of the ribosome biogenesis pathway using network-guided genetics.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e1000213Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar; data not shown). Together, these data suggest that the role of the GTPase eIF5B in 40S maturation might be to promote the formation of 80S-like ribosomes that are the substrate for Fap7. This model predicts that in a strain deleted or depleted for both eIF5B and Fap7, pre-40S ribosomes should no longer accumulate in 80S-like complexes but rather as free 40S subunits, as formation of 80S-like complexes is slowed in the absence of eIF5B. Indeed, sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis demonstrates that codepleting eIF5B and Fap7 shifts the AFs bound to pre-40S subunits from an 80S peak (observed in the absence of Fap7 alone) into a 40S peak (Figure 3), where all AFs, as well as 20S rRNA, accumulate. This result strongly supports the model that, during 40S maturation, 80S-like ribosomes are formed from 60S subunits and pre-40S subunits in an eIF5B-dependent manner. The sucrose gradient profile of the cells depleted for eIF5B and Fap7 together is also highly similar to that manifest following the deletion of eIF5B alone (Figures S2B and S2C). In the absence of eIF5B alone, the sedimentation profile for Rio2 is subtly shifted to the 40S ribosome peak, whereas the assembly factor Ltv1 is subtly shifted toward the free fraction. This suggests that Ltv1 dissociates before eIF5B-mediated subunit joining (such that more is free without eIF5B), whereas Rio2 remains bound until after subunit joining (leading to a stronger peak in 40S subunits without eIF5B). Confirming this finding will require us to identify the factor(s) leading to Rio2 dissociation in the future.Figure S2Depletion of eIF5B Accumulates Rio2 in 40S Particles, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) BY4741 wild-type control (A) and eIF5B::KanMX6 (B) cells.

The model where formation of 80S-like ribosomes is necessary for the maturation of 40S subunits also implies that these 80S-like ribosomes have to be broken apart again to allow for translation initiation on mature 40S subunits, as mRNA cannot bind to preformed 80S"
https://openalex.org/W1985577088,"Giant congenital naevi are pigmented childhood lesions that frequently lead to melanoma, the most aggressive skin cancer. The mechanisms underlying this malignancy are largely unknown, and there are no effective therapies. Here we describe a mouse model for giant congenital naevi and show that naevi and melanoma prominently express Sox10, a transcription factor crucial for the formation of melanocytes from the neural crest. Strikingly, Sox10 haploinsufficiency counteracts Nras(Q61K)-driven congenital naevus and melanoma formation without affecting the physiological functions of neural crest derivatives in the skin. Moreover, Sox10 is also crucial for the maintenance of neoplastic cells in vivo. In human patients, virtually all congenital naevi and melanomas are SOX10 positive. Furthermore, SOX10 silencing in human melanoma cells suppresses neural crest stem cell properties, counteracts proliferation and cell survival, and completely abolishes in vivo tumour formation. Thus, SOX10 represents a promising target for the treatment of congenital naevi and melanoma in human patients."
https://openalex.org/W1971977144,"Exome sequencing has become a powerful and effective strategy for the discovery of genes underlying Mendelian disorders1. However, use of exome sequencing to identify variants associated with complex traits has been more challenging, partly because the sample sizes needed for adequate power may be very large2. One strategy to increase efficiency is to sequence individuals who are at both ends of a phenotype distribution (those with extreme phenotypes). Because the frequency of alleles that contribute to the trait are enriched in one or both phenotype extremes, a modest sample size can potentially be used to identify novel candidate genes and/or alleles3. As part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), we used an extreme phenotype study design to discover that variants in DCTN4, encoding a dynactin protein, are associated with time to first P. aeruginosa airway infection, chronic P. aeruginosa infection and mucoid P. aeruginosa in individuals with cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1991069902,"Friedhelm Hildebrandt, Agata Smogorzewska and colleagues show that mutations in the DNA repair gene FAN1 cause karyomegalic interstitial nephritis. These findings implicate deficient DNA damage response signaling in the pathophysiology of renal fibrosis. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) represents a major health burden1. Its central feature of renal fibrosis is not well understood. By exome sequencing, we identified mutations in FAN1 as a cause of karyomegalic interstitial nephritis (KIN), a disorder that serves as a model for renal fibrosis. Renal histology in KIN is indistinguishable from that of nephronophthisis, except for the presence of karyomegaly2. The FAN1 protein has nuclease activity and acts in DNA interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair within the Fanconi anemia DNA damage response (DDR) pathway3,4,5,6. We show that cells from individuals with FAN1 mutations have sensitivity to the ICL-inducing agent mitomycin C but do not exhibit chromosome breakage or cell cycle arrest after diepoxybutane treatment, unlike cells from individuals with Fanconi anemia. We complemented ICL sensitivity with wild-type FAN1 but not with cDNA having mutations found in individuals with KIN. Depletion of fan1 in zebrafish caused increased DDR, apoptosis and kidney cysts. Our findings implicate susceptibility to environmental genotoxins and inadequate DNA repair as novel mechanisms contributing to renal fibrosis and CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2011540184,"Aberrant Skp2 signaling has been implicated as a driving event in tumorigenesis. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive, cytoplasmic Skp2 correlates with more aggressive forms of breast and prostate cancers. Here, we report that Skp2 is acetylated by p300 at K68 and K71, which is a process that can be antagonized by the SIRT3 deacetylase. Inactivation of SIRT3 leads to elevated Skp2 acetylation, which leads to increased Skp2 stability through impairment of the Cdh1-mediated proteolysis pathway. As a result, Skp2 oncogenic function is increased, whereby cells expressing an acetylation-mimetic mutant display enhanced cellular proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. Moreover, acetylation of Skp2 in the nuclear localization signal (NLS) promotes its cytoplasmic retention, and cytoplasmic Skp2 enhances cellular migration through ubiquitination and destruction of E-cadherin. Thus, our study identifies an acetylation-dependent regulatory mechanism governing Skp2 oncogenic function and provides insight into how cytoplasmic Skp2 controls cellular migration."
https://openalex.org/W2014042333,"Long-lasting changes in synaptic efficacy, such as those underlying long-term memory, require transcription. Activity-dependent transport of synaptically localized transcriptional regulators provides a direct means of coupling synaptic stimulation with changes in transcription. The CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivator (CRTC1), which is required for long-term hippocampal plasticity, binds CREB to potently promote transcription. We show that CRTC1 localizes to synapses in silenced hippocampal neurons but translocates to the nucleus in response to localized synaptic stimulation. Regulated nuclear translocation occurs only in excitatory neurons and requires calcium influx and calcineurin activation. CRTC1 is controlled in a dual fashion with activity regulating CRTC1 nuclear translocation and cAMP modulating its persistence in the nucleus. Neuronal activity triggers a complex change in CRTC1 phosphorylation, suggesting that CRTC1 may link specific types of stimuli to specific changes in gene expression. Together, our results indicate that synapse-to-nuclear transport of CRTC1 dynamically informs the nucleus about synaptic activity."

Mitotic phosphorylation of the protein BAF reduces its affinity for chromatin and the LEM family of inner nuclear membrane proteins; loss of this BAF-mediated chromatin-NE link contributes to NE disassembly. BAF must reassociate with chromatin and LEM proteins at mitotic exit to reform the NE; however, how its dephosphorylation is regulated is unknown. Here, we show that the C. elegans protein LEM-4L and its human ortholog Lem4 (also called ANKLE2) are both required for BAF dephosphorylation.

Walther T.C. Mattaj I.W. Pushing the envelope: structure, function, and dynamics of the nuclear periphery.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 347-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The ONM is continuous with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), whereas the INM harbors a discrete set of transmembrane proteins; in metazoa, many of these contact the nuclear lamina, an intermediate filament meshwork that underlies the NE (Burke and Ellenberg, 2002Burke B. Ellenberg J. Remodelling the walls of the nucleus.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In metazoa, the NE is broken down upon entry into mitosis and is reformed upon mitotic exit; how this happens is not fully understood (Güttinger et al., 2009Güttinger S. Laurell E. Kutay U. Orchestrating nuclear envelope disassembly and reassembly during mitosis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 178-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The LEM domain protein family shares an ∼40 amino acid domain first identified in the proteins Lap2, Emerin, and Man1 (Lin et al., 2000Lin F. Blake D.L. Callebaut I. Skerjanc I.S. Holmer L. McBurney M.W. Paulin-Levasseur M. Worman H.J. MAN1, an inner nuclear membrane protein that shares the LEM domain with lamina-associated polypeptide 2 and emerin.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4840-4847Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Most LEM proteins contain transmembrane domains, reside in the INM, and interact with the nuclear lamina (Wagner and Krohne, 2007Wagner N. Krohne G. LEM-Domain proteins: new insights into lamin-interacting proteins.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 261: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One described function of the LEM domain is to interact with the highly conserved chromatin-binding protein barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF) (Wagner and Krohne, 2007Wagner N. Krohne G. LEM-Domain proteins: new insights into lamin-interacting proteins.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 261: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). During interphase, the localization of LEM proteins Lamin A and BAF is mutually dependent; depletion of BAF or overexpression of a BAF mutant deficient in DNA binding results in the mislocalization of LEM proteins and Lamin A, whereas depletion of Lamin A leads to mislocalization of BAF and LEM proteins, and depletion of LEM proteins causes mislocalization of BAF (Ulbert et al., 2006Ulbert S.

Krohne G. LEM-Domain proteins: new insights into lamin-interacting proteins.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 261: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and it is essential for postmitotic NE reformation in C. elegans (Gorjánácz et al., 2007Gorjánácz M. Klerkx E.P.F. Galy V. Santarella R. López-Iglesias C. Askjaer P. Mattaj I.W.

Cullen C.F. Ohkura H. NHK-1 phosphorylates BAF to allow karyosome formation in the Drosophila oocyte nucleus.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 179: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). BAF-LEM interactions are thus an important link between chromatin and the NE, both through the maintaining nuclear organization and during postmitotic NE reassembly. The localization of BAF changes during the cell cycle. In interphase, BAF is concentrated at the nuclear periphery and interacts with LEM proteins (Haraguchi et al., 2001Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y. BAF is required for emerin assembly into the reforming nuclear envelope.J.

USA. 2005; 102: 3290-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). During early mitosis, BAF is distributed uniformly throughout the cell. After the metaphase-anaphase transition, BAF associates with chromatin and becomes concentrated at the “core” region of chromosomes surrounding the centromeres where its mobility, and the mobility of LEM proteins, significantly decreases (Haraguchi et al., 2008Haraguchi T. Kojidani T. Koujin T. Shimi T. Osakada H. Mori C. Yamamoto A. Hiraoka Y. Live cell imaging and electron microscopy reveal dynamic processes of BAF-directed nuclear envelope assembly.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2540-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). NE breakdown (NEBD) and reformation are controlled by protein phosphorylation. Members of the vaccinia-related kinase (VRK) family of mitotic kinases phosphorylate BAF in mitosis and meiosis; this modification strongly reduces the affinity of BAF for chromatin and slightly weakens its affinity for LEM proteins (Margalit et al., 2007Margalit A. Brachner A. Gotzmann J. Foisner R. Gruenbaum Y. Barrier-to-autointegration factor—a BAFfling little protein.Trends Cell Biol. 2007; 17: 202-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Overexpression of VRK-1 releases BAF from chromatin in human cells (Nichols et al., 2006Nichols R.J. Wiebe M.S. Traktman P. The vaccinia-related kinases phosphorylate the N′ terminus of BAF, regulating its interaction with DNA and its retention in the nucleus.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2451-2464Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), whereas depletion of VRK-1 in C. elegans prevents the release of BAF from chromatin upon mitotic entry and leads to defects in chromosome segregation (Gorjánácz et al., 2007Gorjánácz M. Klerkx E.P.F. Galy V. Santarella R. López-Iglesias C. Askjaer P. Mattaj I.W. Caenorhabditis elegans BAF-1 and its kinase VRK-1 participate directly in post-mitotic nuclear envelope assembly.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of BAF by VRK-1 upon entry into mitosis is therefore proposed to break the link between chromatin, BAF, and LEM proteins. The mechanism that permits BAF to reassociate with chromatin at mitotic exit is unclear. Protein phosphatases regulate numerous processes during mitotic progression, but their roles in mitotic exit are mostly uncharacterized (Bollen et al., 2009Bollen M. Gerlich D.W. Lesage B. Mitotic phosphatases: from entry guards to exit guides.Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 531-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Wurzenberger and Gerlich, 2011Wurzenberger C. Gerlich D.W. Phosphatases: providing safe passage through mitotic exit.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 12: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A PP1/Repo-Man complex dephosphorylates histone H3 and potentially other substrates and, by a mechanism that is not yet completely understood, influences mitotic exit (Vagnarelli et al., 2011Vagnarelli P. Ribeiro S. Sennels L. Sanchez-Pulido L. de Lima Alves F. Verheyen T. Kelly D.A. Ponting C.P. Rappsilber J. Earnshaw W.C. Repo-Man coordinates chromosomal reorganization with nuclear envelope reassembly during mitotic exit.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21: 328-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Also, a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex comprising PP2A-CA, PP2A-R1A, and PP2A-B55α regulates mitotic exit in human cells, although the target or targets of this complex are unknown (Schmitz et al., 2010Schmitz M.H.A. Held M. Janssens V. Hutchins J.R.A. Hudecz O. Ivanova E. Goris J. Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Lamond A.I. Poser I. et al.Live-cell imaging RNAi screen identifies PP2A-B55alpha and importin-beta1 as key mitotic exit regulators in human cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 886-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Here, we show that PP2A regulates BAF chromatin recruitment during mitotic exit and is required to enable BAF's essential function in NE assembly. In addition, we show that Lem4 is essential for BAF recruitment to chromatin upon mitotic exit in C. elegans and human cells. Lem4 depletion or mutation causes NE morphology defects and BAF hyperphosphorylation. In vivo and in vitro data show that BAF phosphorylation is dependent on VRK-1 and is counteracted by PP2A. We propose an evolutionarily conserved model whereby Lem4 coordinates the control of BAF dephosphorylation by interacting with and inhibiting VRK-1 and by supporting PP2A action on BAF. This results in BAF dephosphorylation and chromatin recruitment, thereby facilitating NE assembly. Such coordination may be more generally employed during mitotic exit because a recent kinome analysis revealed that many kinases and phosphatases reside in cocomplexes (Breitkreutz et al., 2010Breitkreutz A. Choi H. Sharom J.R. Boucher L. Neduva V. Larsen B. Lin Z.-Y. Breitkreutz B.-J. Stark C.

To study postmitotic NE formation, we screened C. elegans strains harboring temperature-sensitive maternal effect embryonic lethal mutations (Golden et al., 2000Golden A. Sadler P.L. Wallenfang M.R.

SNP mapping and sequencing revealed that three lines, ax146, ax545, and ax640, were mutated in three genes previously implicated in nuclear assembly, npp-8, ima-2, and mel-28, respectively (Galy et al., 2003Galy V.

Bidirectional BLAST-P analysis revealed Lem4 (also known as ANKLE2) as the closest human gene, with 33% sequence identity and 49% sequence similarity over a 364 amino acid region (Figure S1F). The Lem4 protein has a predicted transmembrane region at its N terminus, followed by an LEM domain and ankyrin repeats. Y55F3BR.8 is similar in organization and predicted secondary structure, but we were unable to identify a LEM domain in the C. elegans protein. We therefore refer to Y55F3BR.8 as LEM-4Like (LEM-4L) and to the homozygous mutant ax475 embryos as lem-4L(ax475). The lem-4L(ax475) mutant carries an Ala to Val missense mutation at the conserved position 229 (Figure S1F). Homozygous mutant lem-4L(ax475) worms were 93% ± 4% (n = 407) viable at 16°C and had normal nuclei (Figures S1A and S1C). At 25°C, lem-4L(ax475) embryos (n = 454) died early during development and displayed severe nuclear appearance defects (Figure S1C, arrows). In lem-4L(ax475) embryos at 16°C, Lamin (LMN-1) and nucleoporins (mAb414, NUP96, and NUP107) formed a sharp NE rim, like wild-type (Figures 1A , S2A , and S2B). At 25°C, the NE proteins were abnormally distributed (Figures 1A, S2A, and S2B, third columns). LEM-4L protein levels in lem-4L(ax475) embryos at 16°C and 25°C were 26.8% ± 8.4% and 5.2% ± 3.9% (n = 3) of wild-type (Figure 1B). To confirm that the defects were due to lem-4L mutation, lem-4L(ax475) worms were transformed with the wild-type lem-4L gene. The transformed embryos were viable at restrictive temperature with wild-type nuclei (Figure 1A, fourth column).Figure S2Characterization of C. elegans LEM-4L and H. sapiens Lem4, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A and B) Wild-type and lem-4-4L(ax475) embryos grown at 16 or 25°C were stained with anti-NUP96 (A) or anti-NUP107 (B), mAb414 and Hoechst.

Numbers denote amino acid positions. Depletion of lem-4L from embryos by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in less severe NE defects than those observed in the lem-4L(ax475) mutant at 25°C (Figures 1C and S1G). Western blotting showed that the LEM-4L protein level in lem-4L(RNAi) embryos was 20.2% ± 4.2% (n = 3) of wild-type (Figure 1B). Immunostaining of control embryos with anti-LEM-4L antibodies and expression of a LEM-4L-GFP fusion construct revealed that the protein is enriched at the NE (Figures 1C and S2C); reduction of the anti-LEM-4L signal in lem-4L(RNAi) or lem-4L(ax475) embryos (Figure 1C) confirmed the specificity of the antibodies. We next characterized human Lem4. Anti-Lem4 antibodies recognized a protein of ∼100 kDa (Figure S2D). Endogenous Lem4 and overexpressed GFP-tagged Lem4 (Figures S2E and S2F) localized to the ER in HeLa cells fixed by several methods, which is a surprising finding given that all previously characterized transmembrane LEM domain proteins localize to the INM (Wagner and Krohne, 2007Wagner N. Krohne G. LEM-Domain proteins: new insights into lamin-interacting proteins.Int. Rev. Cytol. 2007; 261: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Differential permeabilization followed by immunostaining revealed that the C terminus of Lem4 is cytoplasmic (Figure S2E). Lem4 protein levels in human cells were efficiently reduced by using two small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligos (Figure S2G). Cells depleted of Lem4 showed normal recruitment of NPCs and NE proteins, but 20%–30% showed nuclear shape defects (Figure 1D; data not shown) similar to those observed upon Lem2 depletion (Ulbert et al., 2006Ulbert S. Antonin W. Platani M. Mattaj I.W. The inner nuclear membrane protein Lem2 is critical for normal nuclear envelope morphology.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 6435-6441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To determine the specificity of the depletion phenotype, we generated a HeLa H2B-mCherry cell line that stably expressed an myc-tagged RNAi-insensitive version of Lem4 (H2B-mCherry/Lem4-myc). H2B-mCherry cells depleted of Lem4 displayed abnormal nuclear shape (Figure 1E, top), whereas H2B-mCherry/Lem4-myc expressing cells did not (Figure 1E, bottom; quantification Figure 1F). Lem4-myc expression was confirmed by using Lem4 and myc antibodies (Figures 1E and 1G; data not shown). Western blotting confirmed that endogenous Lem4 was depleted from both cell lines and that exogenous Lem4-myc is resistant to RNAi treatment (Figure 1G). Interestingly, Lem4-myc migrated faster than endogenous Lem4 upon SDS-PAGE (Figure 1G). Lem4-myc complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned and sequenced; Lem4-myc was found to lack aa 256–646, a deletion that might be due to alternative splicing or rearrangement of the transfected DNA (Figure S2H). We were unable to isolate stable cell lines that efficiently and homogenously express full-length Lem4, suggesting that its overexpression is deleterious. However, the truncated form of Lem4 rescued the NE shape defects. This deletion removes the bulk of the amino acid sequence most highly conserved between Lem4 and LEM-4L, raising the possibility that Lem4 and LEM-4L may affect nuclear shape through regions dissimilar in amino acid sequence. Thus, efficient reduction or loss of human Lem4 or C. elegans LEM-4L results in defects in the NE. A function of the LEM domain is to interact with BAF. To investigate a potential link between LEM-4L and BAF-1, we compared nuclei in lem-4L(ax475) and baf-1(t1639) (Gorjánácz et al., 2007Gorjánácz M. Klerkx E.P.F. Galy V. Santarella R. López-Iglesias C. Askjaer P. Mattaj I.W. Caenorhabditis elegans BAF-1 and its kinase VRK-1 participate directly in post-mitotic nuclear envelope assembly.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) mutant embryos by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Wild-type and lem-4L(ax475) mutant nuclei at 16°C were enclosed by a continuous NE membrane (Figures 2A and 2B ). At 16°C, lem-4L(ax475) mutant embryos displayed minor defects in INM-ONM spacing, whereas at 25°C, the NE of both lem-4L(ax475) and baf-1(t1639) mutant embryos was similarly disorganized (Figures 2C–2E; Gorjánácz et al., 2007Gorjánácz M. Klerkx E.P.F. Galy V. Santarella R. López-Iglesias C. Askjaer P. Mattaj I.W. Caenorhabditis elegans BAF-1 and its kinase VRK-1 participate directly in post-mitotic nuclear envelope assembly.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Their nuclei were multilobed, and, although the NE membranes were adjacent to the chromatin, they were not organized into a closed NE. BAF-1 is required during anaphase to organize membranes into a closed NE (Gorjánácz et al., 2007Gorjánácz M. Klerkx E.P.F. Galy V. Santarella R. López-Iglesias C. Askjaer P. Mattaj I.W. Caenorhabditis elegans BAF-1 and its kinase VRK-1 participate directly in post-mitotic nuclear envelope assembly.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the localization of GFP-BAF-1 during the cell cycle in the absence of LEM-4L (Figures 2G, S3A, and S3B). In control embryos (n = 18), GFP-BAF-1 left chromatin during mitosis and was recruited back 60 s after anaphase onset. GFP-BAF-1 recruitment at the nuclear periphery peaked 80–100 s after anaphase onset (Figures 2G and S3A). On completion of NE assembly, 140 s after anaphase onset, GFP-BAF-1 intensity dropped to a level that was constant during interphase. The early strong recruitment of GFP-BAF-1 did not occur after LEM-4L RNAi (n = 16); instead, BAF-1 was recruited gradually for 120–140 s after anaphase onset (Figures 2G and S3B). The interphase NE level of GFP-BAF-1 was unaffected. Downregulation of LEM-3 (n = 8), LEM-2 (n = 8), and EMR-1 (n = 10) LEM proteins (Figures S3C–S3E ) did not decrease anaphase recruitment of BAF-1, although LEM-2 and EMR-1 downregulation decreased interphase NE levels of BAF-1 (Figures 2H–2J and S3C–S3E). Thus, LEM proteins are differentially required to regulate BAF-1 localization during the cell cycle. To examine human cells, we generated a cell line that stably expressed GFP-BAF and H2B-mCherry, depleted Lem4 by RNAi, and followed GFP-BAF chromatin recruitment in anaphase by time-lapse microscopy. Control depletions allowed typical BAF recruitment (Haraguchi et al., 2001Haraguchi T. Koujin T. Segura-Totten M. Lee K.K. Matsuoka Y. Yoneda Y. Wilson K.L. Hiraoka Y.

Biol. 2004; 147: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar;), with strong recruitment of BAF to chromatin ∼6 min after anaphase onset, gradual NE relocalization during telophase, and maintenance of nuclear and cytoplasmic pools (Figures 2K and S3F). Lem4-depleted cells, but not Lem2- or Emerin-depleted cells, showed decreased and delayed GFP-BAF recruitment during mitotic exit (Figures 2K, 2L, S3G, and S3H). Thus, both Lem4 and LEM4-L, but not other Lem proteins, are required for BAF recruitment to chromatin during mitotic exit. To further study lem-4L function during NE assembly, we performed a suppressor screen. We mutagenized lem-4L(ax475) worms and identified a lem-4L(ax475) mutant line that grew and reproduced at 25°C (72.5% ± 9.5% fertile [n = 40]). Wild-type, lem-4L(ax475), and suppressor embryos were grown at 25°C and EMR-1 and nucleoporins were immunostained. Nuclei in the suppressor strain were indistinguishable from wild-type (Figure 3A , third column; data not shown). In addition, TEM of the suppressed lem-4L(ax475) embryos confirmed that NE structure was wild-type (Figure 2F). The suppressor mutation caused a C to T transition in nucleotide 206 of the vrk-1 gene, changing amino acid 69 in the kinase domain of VRK-1 from Pro to Leu. The allele is named vrk-1(x1). To confirm that vrk-1(x1) is responsible for lem-4L(ax475) suppression, we downregulated VRK-1 by RNAi in wild-type and lem-4L(ax475) mutants grown at 16°C and 25°C and monitored embryonic lethality. vrk-1 RNAi resulted in almost complete embryonic lethality in wild-type worms but in suppression of lethality in lem-4L(ax475) mutants at 25°C (Figure 3B, middle). Silencing of vrk-1 in lem-4L(ax475) worms at 16°C resulted in intermediate lethality (Figure 3B, right). This confirms that vrk-1(x1) suppresses lem-4L(ax475). To analyze the effect of vrk-1(x1), we immunostained VRK-1 and nucleoporins in wild-type, lem-4L(ax475), and suppressor embryos. The vrk-1 mutation did not affect either VRK-1 expression or localization to the NE during prophase (Figures 3C and 3D). These results, together with the observed reduced embryonic lethality (87.5% ± 5.7%; n = 442) compared to vrk-1(RNAi), suggest that vrk-1(x1) is not null. Phosphorylation of BAF-1 by VRK-1 is necessary for its removal from chromatin during mitosis. BAF-1 dephosphorylation might therefore be required for chromatin rebinding during mitotic exit. To determine whether LEM-4L might affect BAF-1 phosphorylation, we performed 2D western blots. In control embryonic extracts, four spots were recognized by BAF-1 antibodies (Gorjánácz et al., 2007Gorjánácz M. Klerkx E.P.F. Galy V. Santarella R. López-Iglesias C. Askjaer P. Mattaj I.W.

https://openalex.org/W2121539520,"Although human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have enormous potential in regenerative medicine, their epigenetic variability suggests that some lines may not be suitable for human therapy. There are currently few benchmarks for assessing quality. Here we show that X-inactivation markers can be used to separate hiPSC lines into distinct epigenetic classes and that the classes are phenotypically distinct. Loss of XIST expression is strongly correlated with upregulation of X-linked oncogenes, accelerated growth rate in vitro, and poorer differentiation in vivo. Whereas differences in X-inactivation potential result in epigenetic variability of female hiPSC lines, male hiPSC lines generally resemble each other and do not overexpress the oncogenes. Neither physiological oxygen levels nor HDAC inhibitors offer advantages to culturing female hiPSC lines. We conclude that female hiPSCs may be epigenetically less stable in culture and caution that loss of XIST may result in qualitatively less desirable stem cell lines."

L3mbtl2 regulates genes by recruiting a Polycomb Repressive Complex1 (PRC1)-related complex, resembling the previously described E2F6-complex, and including G9A, Hdac1, and Ring1b. The presence of L3mbtl2 at target genes is associated with H3K9 dimethylation, low histone acetylation, and H2AK119 ubiquitination, but the latter is neither dependent on L3mbtl2 nor sufficient for repression.

The pluripotent state can be maintained in blastocyst-derived embryonic stem (ES) cells ex vivo and can be reprogrammed in somatic cells, generating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells (Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011Orkin S.H. Hochedlinger K. Chromatin connections to pluripotency and cellular reprogramming.Cell. 2011; 145: 835-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In pluripotent cells, the expression of differentiation-related genes is suppressed despite a globally open chromatin that allows for access to genes required for rapid self-renewal and for the subsequent initiation of differentiation programs (Orkin and Hochedlinger, 2011Orkin S.H. Hochedlinger K. Chromatin connections to pluripotency and cellular reprogramming.Cell. 2011; 145: 835-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The stem cell program is orchestrated by three core transcription factors, Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2. These factors cooperate with a network of molecules that includes other transcription factors, noncoding RNAs, transcriptional coactivators, corepressors, and chromatin regulators (Young, 2011Young R.A. Control of the embryonic stem cell state.Cell. 2011; 144: 940-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). However, despite important progress, the molecular mechanisms underlying early development and pluripotency remain incompletely understood. Gene regulation in pluripotent stem cells is dependent on the activity of several multiprotein complexes that influence transcription by modifying chromatin, including Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs) (Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing: knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PRCs regulate patterning by repressing Hox genes in Drosophila development and also control developmental genes in mammalian ES cells (Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing: knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of mammalian Polycomb complexes are known, PRC1 and PCR2. The composition of these complexes varies in different contexts, and, recently, distinct PRC1-family complexes have been defined (Gao et al., 2012Gao Z. Zhang J. Bonasio R. Strino F. Sawai A. Parisi F. Kluger Y. Reinberg D. PCGF homologs, CBX proteins, and RYBP define functionally distinct PRC1 family complexes.Mol. Cell. 2012; 45: 344-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Germline disruption of components of PRC2 is invariably associated with early embryonic lethality, while Ring1b and Rybp are the only PRC1 components with essential early embryonic roles (Table S1, available online). PRC1 and PRC2 act coordinately in ES cells, and disruption of components of either complex leads to derepression of lineage-specific genes. The PRC2 component EZH2 mediates trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). H3K27me3 serves as a docking site for a PRC1 chromodomain protein (Drosophila: polycomb; mammalian CBX2/4/6/7/8) at a large proportion of PRC2 target genes. Ring1b, the catalytic PRC1 subunit, then mediates mono-ubiquitination of histone 2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub1). It is unresolved how these modifications mediate gene repression, and Ring1b has the potential to repress genes and compact chromatin independent of histone ubiquitination (Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing: knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both mammalian PRCs can also act independently. Repression of some genes is maintained by the remaining complex after selective disruption of either PRC1 or PRC2 (Leeb et al., 2010Leeb M. Pasini D. Novatchkova M. Jaritz M. Helin K. Wutz A. Polycomb complexes act redundantly to repress genomic repeats and genes.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and PRC1 can be recruited to PRC2 target genes in PRC2's absence (Tavares et al., 2012Tavares L. Dimitrova E. Oxley D. Webster J. Poot R. Demmers J. Bezstarosti K. Taylor S. Ura H.

L3mbtl2 has been implicated as a component of the repressive E2F6-complex that contains Polycomb group proteins also linked to PRC1 in several independent studies (Ogawa et al., 2002Ogawa H.

Characteristically, they display a strong preference for binding to mono- and dimethylated lysine residues in histone tails. MBT domains were first recognized in a family of three genes in Drosophila comprised of l(3)mbt, scm, and sfmbt, all of which are essential for development. Scm and sfmbt strongly repress Hox genes in Drosophila and bind Polycomb responsive elements (Klymenko et al., 2006Klymenko T. Papp B. Fischle W. Köcher T. Schelder M. Fritsch C. Wild B. Wilm M.

Biol. 2010; 30: 2584-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In mammals, the family of MBT domain proteins has expanded to nine members and their functions are less well defined (Qin et al., 2010Qin J. Van Buren D. Huang H.S. Zhong L. Mostoslavsky R. Akbarian S. Hock H. Chromatin protein L3MBTL1 is dispensable for development and tumor suppression in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27767-27775Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that mice lacking L3mbtl1 are viable (Qin et al., 2010Qin J. Van Buren D. Huang H.S. Zhong L. Mostoslavsky R. Akbarian S. Hock H. Chromatin protein L3MBTL1 is dispensable for development and tumor suppression in mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 27767-27775Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similarly, Scmh1−/− mice display only mild phenotypes with variable penetrance (Takada et al., 2007Takada Y. Isono K. Shinga J. Turner J.M. Kitamura H. Ohara O. Watanabe G. Singh P.B. Kamijo T.

Mice lacking L3mbtl3 and Mbtd1 die at birth with skeletal defects and compromised hematopoiesis (Arai and Miyazaki, 2005Arai S. Miyazaki T.

However, none of these knockout models have revealed cell types for which MBT domain proteins are strictly essential, and no requirement in embryonic development has been described. Here we examine the function of L3mbtl2, an ortholog of Drosophila sfmbt also known as h-l(3)mbt-like or m4mbt (Guo et al., 2009Guo Y. Nady N. Qi C. Allali-Hassani A. Zhu H. Pan P. Adams-Cioaba M.A. Amaya M.F. Dong A. Vedadi M. et al.Methylation-state-specific recognition of histones by the MBT repeat protein L3MBTL2.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2204-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). L3mbtl2 is widely expressed (Figure 1A ). We disrupted L3mbtl2 in ES cells and mice by flanking the exons encoding its three C-terminal MBT domains (residues 315–308) with loxP sites and removing them by Cre-mediated recombination (Figure 1B, Figure S1). This strategy probably resulted in a true “null” allele because we could not detect mutant mRNA (Figure 1C) or mutant protein (Figure 2A ). Mice heterozygous for the disrupted L3mbtl2 allele appeared normal and were fertile. However after intercrossing heterozygotes, no homozygous pups were born (Figures 1D and 1E). At embryonic day (E) 6.5, L3mbtl2−/− embryos were present at the expected frequency, and their genotype could not be predicted by inspection (Figures 1D and 1E). In contrast, at and after E7.5, mutant embryos showed growth retardation (Figures 1D and 1E).Figure 2L3mbtl2 Is a Critical Regulator of ES Cell Self-RenewalShow full caption(A) Cre-mediated disruption of L3mbtl2 results in loss of protein expression.

(B–M) Significance: two-tailed Student's t tests; means were derived from three biologically independent samples; errors are standard deviations (SD). See Figure S3 for analysis of L3mbtl2−/− MEFs. Immunohistological analysis of blastocysts at embryonic day (E) 3.5 revealed no differences of trophectoderm (Cdx2+) and inner cell mass (Nanog+) (Figure 1F). To investigate later effects of L3mbtl2 loss, we analyzed serial histological sections of whole uteri (Figures 1G and 1H, Figure S2). At E6.5, mutant embryos were surrounded by mural trophectoderm and a normal outer epithelial layer of primitive endoderm (Figures S2C and S2D). However, the core of the mutant embryos consisted of an abnormal, unstructured mass of irregular cells (Figure 1H, Figure S2D). Normal embryos at the egg cylinder stage (E5.5) harbor an inner ectodermal layer surrounding the proamniotic cavity. The latter becomes divided as the chorion and amnion develop (Figure 1G, Figure S2C). At E6.5, L3mbtl2 mutants did not show a distinct ectodermal epithelial layer, proamniotic cavity, chorion, or amnion (Figure 1H, Figure S2D). While wild-type E8.5 embryos had progressed in establishing the basic body plan as a result of gastrulation, mutant embryos showed little growth or development (Figure S2E–S2H). Thus, L3mbtl2 is not required for implantation or formation of trophectoderm, primitive endoderm, and the inner cell mass. However in its absence, the inner cells mass fails to form a normal primitive ectoderm capable of gastrulation. This knockout phenotype bears similarity with those associated with other Polycomb group proteins (Table S1). The embryonic phenotype suggested that L3mbtl2 might be required for the function of pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass, which give rise to ES cells ex vivo. Therefore, we disrupted both alleles of L3mbtl2 in ES cells (Figure S1E). This resulted in complete loss of L3mbtl2 protein (Figure 2A). Upon loss of L3mbtl2, ES cell colony size was drastically reduced (Figure 2B), and we observed a severe proliferation defect (Figure 2C, doubling time increased from ∼13 hr to ∼33 hr). Remarkably, however, lentiviral expression of FLAG-tagged L3mbtl2 entirely restored normal ES cell growth and protein expression (Figures 2A–2C). Importantly, despite expression of L3mbtl2 in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, E13.5), its disruption did not alter their growth (Figure S3). Thus, L3mbtl2 selectively regulates proliferation in the context of ES cells. Despite these growth abnormalities, L3mbtl2−/− ES cells retained characteristics of pluripotent cells. Stat3 phosphorylation in response to LIF was not altered (Figure 2D), and L3mbtl2−/− ES cells expressed Alkaline Phosphatase (Figure 2E) as well as the pluripotency factors Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 at normal levels (Figure 2F). The pluripotency marker SSEA1 was expressed by L3mbtl2−/− ES cells, but its levels were reduced in a proportion of cells (Figure 2G). L3mbtl2−/− ES cells with diminished SSEA1 expression had a significantly reduced capacity to give rise to ES cell colonies, but L3mbtl2−/− ES cells with high SSEA1 levels gave rise to colonies almost as efficiently as wild-type ES cells (Figure 2H). Moreover, we were able to stably maintain L3mbtl2−/− ES cells in culture for > 36 passages (not shown). Thus, L3mbtl2−/− ES cells are subject to a higher propensity for spontaneous differentiation, but unlimited self-renewal is preserved, albeit at a drastically reduced rate. The impaired growth of L3mbtl2−/− ES cells was not due to increased apoptosis (Figure 2I), but correlated with an altered cell cycle profile (Figure 2J). This was associated with markedly increased proportions of cells in the G0/1 phases of the cell cycle and a reduction of cells in S phase. Consistently, expression of cyclin E, which promotes transition from the G1 to the S phase, was reduced (Figures 2K and 2L) and its inhibitors p21cip1/waf1 and Lats2 were increased (Figures 2K and 2L). Expression levels of p53, a transcriptional activator of p21cip1/waf1, were not altered. Intriguingly, Oct4 loss results in a similar G1/S block with p53-independent upregulation of p21cip1/waf1 (Lee et al., 2010Lee J. Go Y. Kang I. Han Y.M. Kim J. Oct-4 controls cell-cycle progression of embryonic stem cells.Biochem. J. 2010; 426: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Remarkably, ChIP analysis revealed binding of L3mbtl2 to the proximal promoter p21cip1/waf1, but not Lats2 or cyclin E (Figure 2M, confirmed by ChIP-seq, Table S4). Thus, p21cip1/waf1 is a direct transcriptional target of L3mbtl2 in ES cells. We utilized EBs as a model system of early development (Figure 3A ). L3mbtl2−/− ES cells did form EBs, but these were smaller and failed to develop cystic structures (Figure 3B, day 12). L3mbtl2−/− EBs expressed markers for definitive ectoderm (Figure 3C, left, top), mesoderm (Figure 3C, left, middle), and endoderm (Figure 3C, bottom) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for references), However, the expression of markers for all germ layers was abnormal (Figure 3C, left). Strikingly, we detected increased expression of Sox17, Gata6, Gata4, and Foxa2 in undifferentiated L3mbtl2−/− ES cells and throughout EB culture, indicating that L3mbtl2 suppresses endoderm (Figure 3C, bottom). In normal EB maturation, early populations (mesoendoderm and primitive ectoderm) fade as more mature tissues are formed (Shen et al., 2009Shen X. Kim W. Fujiwara Y. Simon M.D. Liu Y. Mysliwiec M.R. Yuan G.C. Lee Y. Orkin S.H. Jumonji modulates polycomb activity and self-renewal versus differentiation of stem cells.Cell. 2009; 139: 1303-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Accordingly, brachyury (mesoendoderm marker, left middle) and Fgf5 (primitive ectoderm marker, Figure 3C, right, top), as well as Oct4 and Nanog (pluripotent cell markers, Figure 3C, right, top), were highly expressed in wild-type day 7 EBs, but strikingly reduced at day 12. In contrast, these markers persisted abnormally in L3mbtl2−/− EBs, suggesting that primitive ectoderm and meso-endoderm cells did not efficiently progress in maturation. Finally, we observed increased expression of Eomes, Cdx2, and Hand1 (Figure 3C, right, bottom, particularly at day 12), suggesting that L3mbtl2 also suppresses the trophectoderm. To assess whether L3mbtl2−/− ES cells give rise to more differentiated cells, we assayed teratoma formation (Figures 3D–3K). Remarkably, growth of L3mbtl2−/− teratomas was delayed for several weeks (Figure 3E). By comparison, teratomas lacking Eed or Ring1b form after a normal interval, even though they were 50% smaller (Leeb et al., 2010Leeb M. Pasini D. Novatchkova M. Jaritz M. Helin K. Wutz A. Polycomb complexes act redundantly to repress genomic repeats and genes.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In histologic analysis, L3mbtl2−/− teratomas featured a striking paucity of mature elements (Figures 3F, 3G, and S4). Yet rare examples of differentiation into tissues from all three germlayers could be found (mesoderm: cartilage, smooth muscle, Figures 3I, S4G, and S4H; ectoderm: skin, nervous system tissue, Figures 3H, S4E, and S4F; endoderm: gut, Figures 3J, S4I, and S4J). Thus, L3mbtl2 is not required for the later development of many diverse cell types. However, the most abundant components of L3mbtl2−/− teratomas were undifferentiated areas, containing cells of (likely) epithelial origin (Figure 3G left, and Figures S4B, S4C, and S4I–S4L), and areas resembling mature neural tissue (Figure 3G right, and Figures S4B and S4C). L3mbtl2−/− teratomas also exhibited trophectoderm differentiation (Figures 3K and S4M–S4O), which is never seen in control teratomas. Together, these data reveal a complex role for L3mbtl2 in early development. It is not essential for the potential to give rise to derivatives of all three germlayers (pluripotency) (Figure 3C). However, it is required for suppressing endodermal and trophectodermal genes in ES cells and EBs. Moreover, L3mbtl2 promotes differentiation programs: early cell populations, expressing Oct4, Fgf5, and Brachyury, persist in late-stage L3mbtl2−/− EBs (Figure 3C) and both L3mbtl2−/− teratomas and EBs lack abundant differentiated elements (Figures 3B, 3F, and 3G). To investigate the molecular basis of L3mbtl2's role in ES cells, we searched for proteins interacting with lentiviral vector-expressed, FLAG-tagged L3mbtl2 in rescued knockout ES cells by mass spectrometry (Figures 4A and 4B ). We identified peptides representative of 39 proteins involved in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization (listed in Figure 4C). Surprisingly, 23 of these (Figure 4C, last column, Table S2) have previously been shown to interact with pluripotency factors or have been implicated in self-renewal and/or differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. The list included Oct4 and we could verify this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation (CoIP) (Figure 4D), by reverse CoIP in rescued ES cells (Figure 4G), and by CoIP of the endogenous proteins in wild-type ES cells (Figure 4H). The interactions of L3mbtl2 with Oct4 and other pluripotency factors may explain its selective role in ES cells. Our analysis also identified proteins that participate in several multiprotein complexes. These included ten constituents of the E2F6-complex (blue in Figure 4C), known to interact with L3mbtl2 (Ogawa et al., 2002Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. A complex with chromatin modifiers that occupies E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in G0 cells.Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Three E2F6-complex components (Ring1a, Yaf2, and GLP) were not detected. We also detected all components of the NuRD-complex (red in Figure 4C) and multiple Swi/Snf-complex components (Figure 4C). We confirmed the interaction of L3mbtl2-F with seven members of the NuRD-complex and five members of the E2F6-complex by CoIP (Figures 4D and 4E). However, the CoIP with Mi2β, a central NuRD component, was weak (Figure 4E). The interactions with members of complexes do not necessarily implicate L3mbtl2 as part of these complexes as they may be indirect. Nevertheless, we showed that key interactions (Ring1b, Mbd3, Hdac1, and Oct4) are not the result of proximity at promoters, as they were stable in the presence of ethidium bromide, which d"
https://openalex.org/W2128028466,"Orthologous proteins often harbor numerous substitutions, but whether these differences result from neutral or adaptive processes is usually unclear. To tackle this challenge, we examined the divergent evolution of a model bacterial signaling pathway comprising the kinase PhoR and its cognate substrate PhoB. We show that the specificity-determining residues of these proteins are typically under purifying selection but have, in α-proteobacteria, undergone a burst of diversification followed by extended stasis. By reversing mutations that accumulated in an α-proteobacterial PhoR, we demonstrate that these substitutions were adaptive, enabling PhoR to avoid crosstalk with a paralogous pathway that arose specifically in α-proteobacteria. Our findings demonstrate that duplication and the subsequent need to avoid crosstalk strongly influence signaling protein evolution. These results provide a concrete example of how system-wide insulation can be achieved postduplication through a surprisingly limited number of mutations. Our work may help explain the apparent ease with which paralogous protein families expanded in all organisms."

https://openalex.org/W2085884630,"Female human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines exhibit variability in X-inactivation status. The majority of hiPSC lines maintain one transcriptionally active X (Xa) and one inactive X (Xi) chromosome from donor cells. However, at low frequency, hiPSC lines with two Xas are produced, suggesting that epigenetic alterations of the Xi occur sporadically during reprogramming. We show here that X-inactivation status in female hiPSC lines depends on derivation conditions. hiPSC lines generated by the Kyoto method (retroviral or episomal reprogramming), which uses leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-expressing SNL feeders, frequently had two Xas. Early passage Xa/Xi hiPSC lines generated on non-SNL feeders were converted into Xa/Xa hiPSC lines after several passages on SNL feeders, and supplementation with recombinant LIF caused reactivation of some of X-linked genes. Thus, feeders are a significant factor affecting X-inactivation status. The efficient production of Xa/Xa hiPSC lines provides unprecedented opportunities to understand human X-reactivation and -inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2001964103,"Resisting Arsenic The discovery of a bacterium living in the extreme conditions of Mono Lake, California, created a major controversy because it was claimed to be able to grow solely on arsenic and could substitute arsenate for phosphate in its key macromolecules, including DNA. Working with the same Halomonas spp. bacterium, known as GFAJ-1, and ultrapure reagents, Erb et al. (p. 467 ) found that the bacterium needed a low level of phosphate (1.6 µM) to grow at all. Rather than significant specific arsenic incorporation, when the organism was grown in 40 mM arsenic, its nucleic acids acquired a trace of arsenic. Similarly, Reaves et al. (p. 470 ) found that GFAJ-1 could not grow in the absence of phosphate and, moreover, that its growth was not stimulated by the addition of arsenate, although a trace amount of arsenic was also detected in DNA. Thus, GFAJ-1 shows no particular facility to substitute arsenic for phosphate, when phosphate is limiting, but it can tolerate high concentrations of the poison while efficiently scavenging phosphate."

We show that mu-opioid receptors (MORs) present in nerves in the portal vein walls respond to peptides to regulate a gut-brain neural circuit that controls intestinal gluconeogenesis and satiety. In vitro, peptides and protein digests behave as MOR antagonists in competition experiments. In vivo, they stimulate MOR-dependent induction of intestinal gluconeogenesis via activation of brain areas receiving inputs from gastrointestinal ascending nerves. MOR-knockout mice do not carry out intestinal gluconeogenesis in response to peptides and are insensitive to the satiety effect induced by protein-enriched diets. Portal infusions of MOR modulators have no effect on food intake in mice deficient for intestinal gluconeogenesis. Thus, the regulation of portal MORs by peptides triggering signals to and from the brain to induce intestinal gluconeogenesis are links in the satiety phenomenon associated with alimentary protein assimilation."

How this is done is not well understood. Here, we report that the human exosome maintains progenitor cell function. The expression of several subunits of the exosome were found to be enriched in epidermal progenitor cells, which were required to retain proliferative capacity and to prevent premature differentiation. Loss of PM/Scl-75 also known as EXOSC9, a key subunit of the exosome complex, resulted in loss of cells from the progenitor cell compartment, premature differentiation, and loss of epidermal tissue. EXOSC9 promotes self-renewal and prevents premature differentiation by maintaining transcript levels of a transcription factor necessary for epidermal differentiation, GRHL3, at low levels through mRNA degradation. These data demonstrate that control of differentiation specific transcription factors through mRNA degradation is required for progenitor cell maintenance in mammalian tissue."

For organs and tissues that maintain stem cells throughout life, one strategy for the treatment of injury or disease is to enhance the therapeutic potential of such endogenous stem cell populations. The adult hippocampus—a brain structure critical for learning and memory—harbors a population of neural stem cells (NSCs) that produce new neurons throughout life (Ming and Song, 2011Ming G.-L. Song H. Neuron. 2011; 70: 687-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar), and this adult neurogenesis is important for certain forms of memory (Deng et al., 2010Deng W. Aimone J.B. Gage F.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Adult brain NSCs respond to a wide range of neurological disorders, including stroke, seizure, and Alzheimer's disease; thus, the prospect of enhancing their regenerative potential is tantalizing (Emsley et al., 2005Emsley J.G. Mitchell B.D. Kempermann G. Macklis J.D. Prog. Neurobiol. 2005; 75: 321-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Miller and colleagues (Wang et al., 2012Wang J. Gallagher D. Devito L.M. Cancino G.I. Tsui D. He L. Keller G.M. Frankland P.W. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11 (this issue): 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) make advances in this translational direction with their study of metformin, a commonly used diabetes medication, describing its proneurogenic effects on NSCs and enhancement of one form of hippocampal-dependent memory in mice. Metformin was first synthesized in the 1920s; however, it was not until 1957 that its use for the treatment of diabetes was clinically appreciated. Metformin ameliorates high blood sugar without stimulating insulin secretion or causing low blood sugar levels, and its long history of efficacy and safety have made this small molecule drug the most commonly prescribed medication for type II diabetes worldwide. Though its therapeutic mechanisms have not been fully elucidated, metformin activates AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), which reduces the production of glucose in the liver. In hepatocytes, metformin-activated AMPK phosphorylates atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), which stimulates phosphorylation of CREB binding protein (CBP), resulting in decreased gene expression for hepatic gluconeogenesis (He et al., 2009He L. Sabet A. Djedjos S. Miller R. Sun X. Hussain M.A. Radovick S. Wondisford F.E. Cell. 2009; 137: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). CBP is a ubiquitously expressed histone acetyltransferase and transcriptional coactivator. Recently, Miller and colleagues studied the role of CBP in the developing murine cortex, showing that CBP haploinsufficiency results in cognitive deficits (Wang et al., 2010Wang J. Weaver I.C.G. Gauthier-Fisher A. Wang H. He L. Yeomans J. Wondisford F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Dev. Cell. 2010; 18: 114-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Given that phosphorylation of CBP by aPKC isoform ζ (aPKCζ) is required for CBP-mediated differentiation of cortical precursors, the authors hypothesized that metformin might activate aPKCs in NSCs as well, thereby increasing neurogenesis. In their report, Wang et al. first demonstrate that the aPKC-CBP pathway regulates neuronal differentiation from embryonic neural precursor cells. While shRNA knockdown of either aPKCζ or aPKCι isoforms reduced the number of βIII-tubulin-positive neurons, cotransfection of a plasmid encoding an activated form of CBP with a phosphomimic mutation (serine to aspartic acid) at the aPKC site rescued aPKCζ knockdown, but not aPKCι knockdown. Taken together, these data suggest that CBP is downstream of aPKCζ (Figure 1B). Next, the authors investigated whether metformin can activate the aPKC-CBP pathway in NSCs and promote neurogenesis. aPKC phosphorylation at threonine 403 is important for its kinase activity, and metformin treatment appeared to modestly increase this modification of aPKC in NSCs. More importantly, metformin increased the number of βIII-tubulin-positive cells in culture by up to 50% while decreasing the proportion of Pax6- and Sox2-positive precursor cells. This proneurogenic effect was blocked by aPKCζ/ι shRNAs as well as CBP siRNA. When administered to wild-type adult mice, metformin increased the number of neurons generated from NSCs in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus; however, when administered to mice haploinsufficient for CBP, metformin did not stimulate neurogenesis, suggesting that this effect of metformin is CBP dependent. Intriguingly, Wang et al. show that metformin also improves the ability to update new spatial memories, a task related to hippocampal neurogenesis (Deng et al., 2010Deng W. Aimone J.B. Gage F.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar). Mice were given daily metformin injections for 38 days and were evaluated in the Morris water maze to assess their learning and spatial memory (Figure 1C). Metformin-treated and control mice learned and remembered the initial position of a submerged platform in the water maze equally well. When the platform was moved to the opposite quadrant, both groups were also able to learn the second position with equal proficiency. When the platform was removed, however, metformin-treated mice spent more time in the second quadrant compared to controls, indicating that they were better able to remember the second platform position. This finding suggests that metformin enhanced the ability of mice to update their spatial memory. In mice treated with temozolomide, a potent DNA alkylating agent that kills dividing cells, neurogenesis was reduced, and metformin administration did not enhance spatial memory. Although our understanding of the functional role of adult neurogenesis is limited, the notion of modulating this endogenous process with oral medications for the treatment of neurological disorders has garnered much interest. McKnight and colleagues recently screened 1,000 small molecules for in vivo enhancement of murine dentate gyrus neurogenesis and identified one candidate, P7C3, with significant efficacy and favorable pharmacological properties (Pieper et al., 2010Pieper A.A. Xie S. Capota E. Estill S.J. Zhong J. Long J.M. Becker G.L. Huntington P. Goldman S.E. Shen C.-H. et al.Cell. 2010; 142: 39-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to compare the therapeutic efficacy of metformin with that of P7C3 in animal models of Alzheimer's disease, aging, and other neurological disorders. Compared to a novel compound such as P7C3, clinical trials with metformin would be relatively easy to establish, as this diabetes medication has been FDA-approved since 1995. Such repurposing of drugs has recently been announced as a major initiative by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences because it provides a speedy and relatively low-cost strategy for developing new therapies to treat human disease. How else might metformin enhance spatial learning and have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cognitive problems? While the data in this report support a mechanism that involves hippocampal neurogenesis, it is also possible that other mechanisms contribute. For instance, activated AMPK increases glucose uptake by neurons (Amato and Man, 2011Amato S. Man H.-Y. Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 3452-3460Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); thus, metformin may affect neural metabolism more globally. CBP is a histone acetyltransferase, and as such, its activation by metformin may facilitate memory formation via synapse plasticity in a manner similar to the clinically approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Intriguingly, SAHA rescues certain memory deficits observed in CBP haploinsufficient mice (Alarcón et al., 2004Alarcón J.M. Malleret G. Touzani K. Vronskaya S. Ishii S. Kandel E.R. Barco A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 947-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HDAC inhibitors enhance neurogenesis from adult NSC populations (Hsieh et al., 2004Hsieh J. Nakashima K. Kuwabara T. Mejia E. Gage F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 16659-16664Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Perhaps metformin in combination with SAHA will have additive or even synergistic effects on hippocampal-dependent learning. These studies by Wang et al. demonstrate that drug repurposing may be an effective strategy for translational research aimed at treating diseases of the brain. There are relatively few drugs developed specifically for neurological conditions and even fewer engineered for stem-cell-based regenerative medicine. Perhaps it will be well worth opening up the medicine cabinet of the past to look for unexpected cellular effects and potential therapeutic benefits using the modern tools and lessons learned from stem cell biology.

We excluded from the denominator admissions of patients with a diagnosis of diabetes or prescribed diabetic medication. Case notes of patients identified were reviewed. We used capture-recapture methods to establish the likely frequency of hypoglycemia in non-diabetic in-patients outside intensive care unit at different cut-off points for hypoglycemia. We also recorded co-morbidities that might have given rise to hypoglycemia.Among the 37,898 admissions, the triggers identified 71 hypoglycaemic episodes at a cut-off of 3.3 mmol/l. Estimated frequency at 3.3 mmol/l was 50(CI 33-93), at 3.0 mmol/l, 36(CI 24-64), at 2.7 mmol/l, 13(CI 11-19), at 2.5 mmol/l, 11(CI 9-15) and at 2.2 mmol/l, 8(CI 7-11) per 10,000 admissions. Admissions of patients aged above 65 years were approximately 50% more likely to have an episode of hypoglycemia. Most were associated with important co-morbidities.Significant non-diabetic hypoglycemia in hospital in-patients (at or below 2.7 mmol/l) outside critical care is rare. It is sufficiently rare for occurrences to merit case-note review and diagnostic blood tests, unless an obvious explanation is found."

All structural pilus subunits are homologous proteins sharing an invariant disulfide bridge. Here we show that disulfide bond formation in the unfolded subunits, catalyzed by the periplasmic oxidoreductase DsbA, is required for subunit recognition by the assembly chaperone FimC and for FimC-catalyzed subunit folding. FimC thus guarantees quantitative disulfide bond formation in each of the up to 3,000 subunits of the pilus. The X-ray structure of the complex between FimC and the main pilus subunit FimA and the kinetics of FimC-catalyzed FimA folding indicate that FimC accelerates folding of pilus subunits by lowering their topological complexity. The kinetic data, together with the measured in vivo concentrations of DsbA and FimC, predict an in vivo half-life of 2 s for oxidative folding of FimA in the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1974559272,"Dendritic cells (DC) can achieve cross-presentation of naturally-occurring tumor-associated antigens after phagocytosis and processing of dying tumor cells. They have been used in different clinical settings to vaccinate cancer patients. We have previously used gamma-irradiated MART-1 expressing melanoma cells as a source of antigens to vaccinate melanoma patients by injecting irradiated cells with BCG and GM-CSF or to load immature DC and use them as a vaccine. Other clinical trials have used IFN-gamma activated macrophage killer cells (MAK) to treat cancer patients. However, the clinical use of MAK has been based on their direct tumoricidal activity rather than on their ability to act as antigen-presenting cells to stimulate an adaptive antitumor response. Thus, in the present work, we compared the fate of MART-1 after phagocytosis of gamma-irradiated cells by clinical grade DC or MAK as well as the ability of these cells to cross present MART-1 to CD8+ T cells. Using a high affinity antibody against MART-1, 2A9, which specifically stains melanoma tumors, melanoma cell lines and normal melanocytes, the expression level of MART-1 in melanoma cell lines could be related to their ability to stimulate IFN-gamma production by a MART-1 specific HLA-A*0201-restricted CD8+ T cell clone. Confocal microscopy with Alexa Fluor®647-labelled 2A9 also showed that MART-1 could be detected in tumor cells attached and/or fused to phagocytes and even inside these cells as early as 1 h and up to 24 h or 48 h after initiation of co-cultures between gamma-irradiated melanoma cells and MAK or DC, respectively. Interestingly, MART-1 was cross-presented to MART-1 specific T cells by both MAK and DC co-cultured with melanoma gamma-irradiated cells for different time-points. Thus, naturally occurring MART-1 melanoma antigen can be taken-up from dying melanoma cells into DC or MAK and both cell types can induce specific CD8+ T cell cross-presentation thereafter."

https://openalex.org/W2027234123,"This study describes burst-dependent protection from synaptic depression, which maintains responsiveness to behaviorally important stimuli in Aplysia. In this attention-like mechanism, PKC at sensory neuron synapses discriminates the precise pattern of firing, preventing these release sites from becoming silenced during repeated tactile stimuli when these stimuli are salient. Habituation of a behavioral response to a repetitive stimulus enables animals to ignore irrelevant stimuli and focus on behaviorally important events. In Aplysia, habituation is mediated by rapid depression of sensory synapses, which could leave an animal unresponsive to important repetitive stimuli, making it vulnerable to injury. We identified a form of plasticity that prevents synaptic depression depending on the precise stimulus strength. Burst-dependent protection from depression is initiated by trains of 2–4 action potentials and is distinct from previously described forms of synaptic enhancement. The blockade of depression is mediated by presynaptic Ca2+ influx and protein kinase C (PKC) and requires localization of PKC via a PDZ domain interaction with Aplysia PICK1. During protection from depression, PKC acts as a highly sensitive detector of the precise pattern of sensory neuron firing. Behaviorally, burst-dependent protection reduces habituation, enabling animals to maintain responsiveness to stimuli that are functionally important."

Pregnancy is the greatest physiological challenge facing women, and those born small are at increased risk of gestational hypertension and diabetes and delivering smaller babies. Increased maternal age is associated with exacerbated pregnancy complications. We hypothesized that pregnancy in aged, growth-restricted females unmasks an underlying predisposition to cardiorenal and metabolic dysfunction and compromises fetal growth. Uteroplacental insufficiency was induced by bilateral uterine vessel ligation (restricted group) or sham surgery (control group) on d 18 of gestation in Wistar Kyoto rats. At 12 mo, growth-restricted F1 female offspring were mated with a normal male. F1 restricted females had elevated systolic blood pressure, before and during pregnancy (+10 mmHg) but normal renal and metabolic pregnancy adaptations. F2 fetal weight was not different between groups. In control and restricted females, advanced maternal age (12 vs. 4 mo) was associated with a reduction in the hypoglycemic response to pregnancy and reduced F2 fetal litter size and body weight. Aged rats born small exhibited mostly normal pregnancy adaptations, although they had elevated blood pressure. Advanced maternal age was associated with poorer fetal outcomes that were not exacerbated by low maternal birth weight.—Gallo, L. A., Tran, M., Moritz, K. M., Jefferies, A. J., Wlodek, M. E.

https://openalex.org/W1982778683,"In the Caenorhabditis elegans nematode, the oocyte nucleolus disappears prior to fertilization. We have now investigated the re-formation of the nucleolus in the early embryo of this model organism by immunostaining for fibrillarin and DAO-5, a putative NOLC1/Nopp140 homolog involved in ribosome assembly. We find that labeled nucleoli first appear in somatic cells at around the 8-cell stage, at a time when transcription of the embryonic genome begins. Quantitative analysis of radial positioning showed the nucleolus to be localized at the nuclear periphery in a majority of early embryonic nuclei. At the ultrastructural level, the embryonic nucleolus appears to be composed of a relatively homogenous core surrounded by a crescent-shaped granular structure. Prior to embryonic genome activation, fibrillarin and DAO-5 staining is seen in numerous small nucleoplasmic foci. This staining pattern persists in the germline up to the ∼100-cell stage, until the P4 germ cell divides to give rise to the Z2/Z3 primordial germ cells and embryonic transcription is activated in this lineage. In the ncl-1 mutant, which is characterized by increased transcription of rDNA, DAO-5-labeled nucleoli are already present at the 2-cell stage. Our results suggest a link between the activation of transcription and the initial formation of nucleoli in the C. elegans embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2087023786,"Blimp1 (Prdm1), the key determinant of primordial germ cells (PGCs), plays a combinatorial role with Prdm14 during PGC specification from postimplantation epiblast cells. They together initiate epigenetic reprogramming in early germ cells toward an underlying pluripotent state, which is equivalent to embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Whereas Prdm14 alone can promote reprogramming and is important for the propagation of the pluripotent state, it is not known whether Blimp1 is similarly involved. By using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that Blimp1 is dispensable for the derivation and maintenance of ESCs and postimplantation epiblast stem cells (epiSCs). Notably, Blimp1 is also dispensable for reprogramming epiSCs to ESCs. Thus, although Blimp1 is obligatory for PGC specification, it is not required for the reversion of epiSCs to ESCs and for their maintenance thereafter. This study suggests that reprogramming, including that of somatic cells to ESCs, may not entail an obligatory route through a Blimp1-positive PGC-like state."

Information about the function of essential nematode-specific genes provides insight to key nematode-specific processes that could be targeted with drugs. We have characterized the function of a novel, nematode-specific Caenorhabditis elegans protein, VHA-19, and show that VHA-19 is essential in the germline and, specifically, the oocytes, for the completion of embryogenesis. VHA-19 is also involved in trafficking the oocyte receptor RME-2 to the oocyte plasma membrane and is essential for osmoregulation in the embryo, probably because VHA-19 is required for proper eggshell formation via exocytosis of cortical granules or other essential components of the eggshell. VHA-19 may also have a role in cytokinesis, either directly or as an indirect effect of its role in osmoregulation. Critically, VHA-19 is expressed in the excretory cell in both larvae and adults, suggesting that it may have a role in osmoregulation in C. elegans more generally, probably in trafficking or secretion pathways. This is the first time a role for VHA-19 has been described."
https://openalex.org/W2037665643,"Despite having well-characterized disease-associated mutations, the mechanisms underlying the progressive bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility of Fanconi anemia have been unclear. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Ceccaldi et al. identify an overactive p53/p21 stress response and cell cycle arrest as an underlying cause that starts during fetal development. Despite having well-characterized disease-associated mutations, the mechanisms underlying the progressive bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility of Fanconi anemia have been unclear. In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Ceccaldi et al. identify an overactive p53/p21 stress response and cell cycle arrest as an underlying cause that starts during fetal development. Guido Fanconi originally described “pernicious anemia” in three siblings who had large red blood cells, progressively declining blood counts, and physical anomalies (Fanconi, 1927Fanconi G. Jahrbuch fur Kinderheilkunde und physische Erziehung (Wien). 1927; 117: 257-280Google Scholar). Fanconi anemia (FA) is the paradigmatic constitutional aplastic anemia and is characterized functionally by decreased production of all circulating blood cells and pathologically by a marrow devoid of hematopoietic precursor cells. The stereotypical clinical presentation is an infant or young child with short stature, skin hyperpigmentation, hypoplastic thumbs, reduced blood cell counts, and a fatty, unregenerative bone marrow. The diagnosis is established by observing chromosomal abnormalities in cells exposed to DNA crosslinking agents (Shimamura and Alter, 2010Shimamura A. Alter B.P. Blood Rev. 2010; 24: 101-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). FA patients die of the complications from low blood counts or from leukemia and solid cancers. This pattern of bone marrow failure (BMF) combined with late myeloid malignancies occurs in other inherited syndromes and in acquired immune-mediated aplastic anemia, making FA a useful model for studying several conditions. The FA genes (there were 15 at the most recent count) were first identified using the chromosomal phenotype apparent in cell culture along with cell line complementation, and more recently by sequencing strategies. The FA gene products have been shown to constitute a nuclear protein complex (but not yet an enzymatic activity) and to define a pathway of DNA repair that includes homologous recombination, nucleotide excision repair, and mutagenic translation synthesis (Moldovan and D'Andrea, 2009Moldovan G.L. D'Andrea A.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2009; 43: 223-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). In this issue of Cell Stem Cell, Soulier and colleagues reveal a link between unresolved DNA damage, an overactive p53/p21 response, and the progressive BMF that occurs in FA patients (Ceccaldi et al., 2012Ceccaldi R. Parmar K. Mouly E. Delord M. Kim J.M. Regairaz M. Pla M. Vasquez N. Zhang Q.S. Pondarre C. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11 (this issue): 36-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although the p53 pathway had been previously reported to promote leukemogenesis in FA patients (Ceccaldi et al., 2011Ceccaldi R. Briot D. Larghero J. Vasquez N. Dubois d'Enghien C. Chamousset D. Noguera M.E. Waisfisz Q. Hermine O. Pondarre C. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), in this study the authors reveal that overactive p53 also promotes a decrease in the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) pool of FA patients and support their claims using primitive murine bone marrow cells. Studies of FA are encumbered by the difficulty in obtaining patient samples of a rare disorder and because mouse models do not accurately recapitulate much of the human disease. Ceccaldi et al. use a combination of in vitro methods with FA CD34+ bone marrow cells and in vivo assays using their mouse bone marrow counterparts. First, they observed a reduction in CD34+ HSPCs in FA patients that worsened with age. Given the role of the FA proteins in DNA repair, they hypothesized that progressive accumulation of DNA damage contributed to their bone marrow failure. Indeed, p53 activation was elevated in primary blood cells from FA patients as well as in bone marrow of Fanc-deficient mice. To model the endogenous DNA damage that accumulates in patients over time, the authors next treated immortalized HSPCs from FA patients with mitomycin C, a DNA crosslinking reagent known to induce the damage response. FA cells, but not control cells, arrested in G2 phase due to unresolved DNA damage during S phase. G2 arrest was resolved in mitomycin C treated HPSCs, and the cells instead underwent G0/G1 cell cycle arrest along with strong induction of p53 and p21. Silencing of p53 in FA cells resulted in increase DNA breaks in cells arrested in G0/G1 after treatment with mitomycin C. They next tested whether inhibiting the overactive p53 response rescued the HSPC defect. Knockdown of p53 rescued cell proliferation in both primary cells from patients and the mouse model. Likewise, depletion of p53 or p21 increased the number of clonogenic progenitors in CD34+ cells. Although marrow failure does not occur until after birth, FA fetal liver cells obtained from medical abortions also had high levels of CDKN1A/p21. Taken together, these data show that an exaggerated physiologic stress response results in the accumulation of DNA damage, that this cellular stress underlies progressive HSC depletion in FA patients, and that genomic instability may result if critical checks like p53 induction should fail. That HSPC depletion starts during fetal development and the fact that its circumvention later in life, as by p53 mutation or deletion, creates genomic instability and malignant hematopoietic cells is consistent with the poor outcome of FA in the clinic. Occasional FA patients do show spontaneous improvement in blood counts (Ceccaldi et al., 2011Ceccaldi R. Briot D. Larghero J. Vasquez N. Dubois d'Enghien C. Chamousset D. Noguera M.E. Waisfisz Q. Hermine O. Pondarre C. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Bone marrow function may be rescued by a somatic reverse mutation or mitotic recombination, generating a chimeric HSPC compartment, and allowing repopulation of the depleted marrow. A second mechanism of rescue involves abrogation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint by lower levels or inhibition of CHK1, permitting cells to progress through the cell cycle despite accumulated, unrepaired DNA damage—but while blood counts may improve, escape of the checkpoint would also increase the probability of malignant transformation. In the current study, inhibition of p53/p21 signaling rescued cells from mitotic cycle arrest and, as in previous CHK1 experiments, allowed progression through cell cycle of cells with increasing numbers of chromosomal abnormalities. These findings have several broader implications for patients with several different types of aplastic anemia. The etiologies of constitutional and acquired aplastic anemia are different, but morphologically they are indistinguishable, and the pathophysiology in all types involves a drastic reduction in HSC number and a risk of malignant evolution with the emergence of leukemic clones. In FA, DNA repair pathways are implicated. In Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) and in Schwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS), ribosome assembly is defective due to specific genetic lesions. In DBA, as in FA, p53 activation occurs in response to stress signals and appears critical in the reduction in HSPC number (Narla and Ebert, 2010Narla A. Ebert B.L. Blood. 2010; 115: 3196-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In the telomeropathies, dyskeratosis congenita (DKC) and a variety of subtle mutations in the telomerase complex genes (TERT and TERC), HSC loss occurs as senescence or apoptosis is triggered by critical telomere shortening (Calado and Young, 2009Calado R.T. Young N.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Progression to leukemia is frequent in FA, DKC (the most severe of the telomere diseases), SBDS, and, to a lesser extent, DBA. AML that evolves in these constitutional syndromes is almost invariably associated with aneuploidy and structural rearrangements, with a high prevalence of stereotypical cytogenetic abnormalities (Rochowski et al., 2012Rochowski A. Olson S.B. Alonzo T.A. Gerbing R.B. Lange B.J. Alter B.P. Pediatr. Blood. Cancer. 2012; (Published online April 19, 2012)https://doi.org/10.1002/pbc.24168Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Why specific chromosomal patterns dominate, whether chromosomal abnormalities initiate the oncogenic process, and the relationship of chromosome aberrations to genetic mutations, especially of p53 and similarly protective genes, are not understood. Moving forward, much will be learned from sophisticated assays of telomere length in cell populations and single cells, as well as from genomic sequencing of serial samples of HSCs and their progeny in patients followed over time. It is tempting to speculate that the genetic alterations will reflect the selective pressures under which defective cells struggle, as, for example, in circumventing specific cell-cycle blocks (p53 in FA and DKC) and telomere loss (telomerase upregulation in leukemia and many cancer cells). As highlighted in the current work in this issue, the balance between the appropriate triggering of cell death due to stress signals and its suppression by inactivation of p53, either through manipulation in the laboratory or mutations in patients, is delicate. Furthermore, these new data reveal that in constitutional BMF, much or most HSC loss may occur very early in life, during fetal development or infancy. Targeting these pathways molecularly is appealing but not realistic. Gene therapy in homozygous genetic disorders has many technical obstacles, and even if successful, would not target the entire pool of premalignant cells. A less elegant approach that has nonetheless been proven in practice would be HSC transplantation, which replaces defective cells. Moreover, the utility of transplant is increasing with the use of unrelated and mismatched donors and improvements in the management of complications. The newly defined relationship between mechanisms underlying BMF and the development of cancer should provide important insights into treating FA and similar diseases.
