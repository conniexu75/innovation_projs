https://openalex.org/W1675086682,"Treatment of cells with various growth factors and mitogens results in the rapid hyperphosphorylation and activation of the Raf-1 kinase. To determine if phosphorylation events affect Raf-1 activity, we have initiated experiments to identify the phosphorylation sites of Raf-1. In this report, we find that Ser43, Ser259, and Ser621 are the major sites of Raf-1 which are phosphorylated in mammalian cells and in Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding human Raf-1. Mutant Raf-1 proteins lacking kinase activity are also phosphorylated on these sites in vivo, indicating that these phosphorylation events are not a consequence of autophosphorylation. Furthermore, we find that Thr268 is the predominant Raf-1 residue phosphorylated in in vitro autokinase assays. In addition, we have examined the biochemical activity of baculovirus-expressed Raf-1 proteins containing mutations at these phosphorylation sites. In in vitro protein kinase assays Ser259 mutant proteins were 2-fold more active than wild-type Raf-1 and Ser621 mutant proteins were inactive as kinases. Analysis of the residues surrounding Ser259 and Ser621 indicates that RSXSXP may be a consensus sequence for the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Raf-1 at these sites. Interestingly, these RSXSXP sequences are completely conserved throughout evolution in all Raf family members."
https://openalex.org/W1497352192,"Mutant strains of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 that are resistant to the herbicides norflurazon and fluridone were analyzed. These herbicides inhibit phytoene desaturase, a key enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway. In three mutants the phenotype was related to specific point mutations in pds, the gene encoding phytoene desaturase. Since the resistance was manifested in a cell-free carotenogenic assay, it is evident that the predicted amino acid changes in the target protein alter the enzyme-herbicide interactions. In addition, the mutations also reduced the in vitro activity of phytoene desaturase. Increased levels of the substrate phytoene, accompanied by a reduction in colored carotenoids, were detected in cells of each of the mutant strains. A correlation was established between the degree of increase in the steady-state levels of phytoene and the extent of reduction in total carotenoid content in the cells. These two phenomena in turn are correlated with the rate of enzymatic activity of phytoene desaturase that was measured in vitro. Hence we deduce that phytoene desaturation is a rate-limiting step in carotenogenesis in cyanobacteria. Support for this conclusion is obtained from analysis of cells of an additional mutant strain, which overexpress phytoene desaturase due to a deletion mutation in the promoter region of pds. Cells of this mutant contained more colored carotenoids than the wild-type and were resistant to herbicides that inhibit phytoene desaturase."
https://openalex.org/W1496520030,"Laminin, a four-arm glycoprotein, polymerizes in vitro into networks similar to those found in basement membranes. We have dissected this calcium-dependent assembly by analyzing proteolytic fragment binding using equilibrium gel filtration, ultracentrifugation, and electron microscopy. The cathepsin G fragment C1-4 (three short arms) was found to aggregate with a critical concentration similar to that for laminin. Like laminin polymerization, this assembly was inhibited by the smaller elastase short arm fragments E4 (B1 domains VI and V) and E1' (A-B2 short arm complex). Fragment E4 bound directly to E1' in a calcium-dependent manner (KD = 1.4 microM). In contrast, homologous self-interactions of short arm fragments and all interactions of long arm fragments were considerably weaker or nonexistent. While electron micrographs of E1' or E4 alone contained mostly monomers, those of E1'/E4 mixtures contained dimers and oligomers with E1' dimers connected to each other through their A and B2 arms, often with visible E4 molecules at their junctions. 45Ca2+ bound principally to fragment E1' with localization to the end of the B2 chain. These data support a model in which polymerization requires the interaction of all three ligands, one from each short arm, with calcium activating assembly by binding to the B2 short arm."
https://openalex.org/W1491611834,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) exerts pleiotropic biologic effects. Although TNF-alpha appears to activate a number of signal transduction pathways, the role of second messengers in mediating the different effects of TNF-alpha are not well defined. In this study, we investigated the role of ceramide as an intracellular mediator of TNF-alpha action. In Jurkat T cells, TNF-alpha caused early activation of the sphingomyelin cycle with peak hydrolysis of sphingomyelin observed at 30 min following addition of TNF-alpha. In this cell line, TNF-alpha caused potent activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and exerted potent cytostatic/cytocidal activity. C2-ceramide mimicked the effects of TNF-alpha on cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, but C2-ceramide was unable to induce activation of NF-kappa B under multiple conditions investigated. C2-ceramide, however, enhanced activation of NF-kappa B in response to TNF-alpha with peak effects observed at a concentration of C2-ceramide of 5 microM. Thus, ceramide functions as a selective mediator of the cytostatic/cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha and plays a positive feedback role in activation of NF-kappa B. TNF-alpha signaling, therefore, involves multiple second-messenger pathways that function independently or coordinately to transduce distinct functions of TNF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1565998937,"The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is sequestered in the cytoplasm of most cell types where it is complexed with its inhibitor (I kappa B). A large variety of agents, including growth factors, the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha, initiate signal transduction pathways that converge upon the NF-kappa B-I kappa B complex, resulting in the dissociation of I kappa B and the translocation of NF-kappa B to the nucleus. It has been demonstrated that the phosphorylation of I kappa B is associated with NF-kappa B activation, although the kinase(s) responsible for this process in vivo remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that expression of activated forms of the GTP-binding protein Ras or of the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 results in the activation of transcription specifically through kappa B sites. This activation appears to be dependent on NF-kappa B, since co-expression of I kappa B alpha eliminates both Ras- and Raf-1-induced transcription. In addition, through the use of a dominant negative form of Raf-1, we show that Raf-1 is a common component utilized by multiple inducers in kappa B site-driven gene expression. These results illuminate a signal transduction pathway in which NF-kappa B/Rel family members participate and also implicate a pathway responsible for kappa B site-dependent gene expression during cell growth and in immune and inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W1656075393,"Dynamin is a GTPase thought to play a role in endocytosis based on genetic analysis of its homolog in Drosophila melanogaster shibire. Previous studies have stressed an in vitro association with microtubules, though additional evidence suggests that dynamin associates with membranous organelles. In an analysis of the enzymatic and membrane binding properties of dynamin, we have found that the acidic phospholipids, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol, are able to stimulate GTP hydrolysis in a manner similar to activation previously shown with microtubules. A neutral phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine, had no effect on dynamin GTPase. Activation of dynamin was biphasic, with a decrease in activity back to basal levels with increased concentrations of either microtubules or liposomes. A comparison between GTPase stimulation induced by microtubules and that by phospholipids suggests that ionic interactions between the basic C-terminal domain of dynamin and the negatively charged microtubule or phospholipid head group are important. In support of this, GTPase stimulation by these agents in combination was not additive. A salt-extracted membrane fraction from brain tissue also activated dynamin GTPase, though to a lower extent than pure phospholipids. These results suggest that membrane components could be responsible for some aspects of the regulation of dynamin function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1776144016,"Elevated plasma levels of cytokines have been demonstrated in inflammatory, malignant, and infectious diseases. These disease states are often associated with abnormal lipid metabolism and reductions in plasma cholesterol levels. To determine if inflammatory cytokines could influence hepatic lipid metabolism, we evaluated low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor function and gene expression in cytokine stimulated HepG2 cells, a hepatoblastoma-derived cell line which shares many functional similarities with normal hepatocytes. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) increased LDL binding to HepG2 cells in a dose-responsive manner. Other cytokines including macrophage-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and gamma-interferon had no significant effects on LDL binding. Increased binding in response to TNF or IL-1 was paralleled by increased steady-state levels of LDL receptor mRNA. Evaluation of LDL receptor mRNA half-life revealed no significant change in mRNA stability between control and TNF- or IL-1-stimulated cells. A fusion gene construct consisting of 1563 base pairs of the 5'-flanking DNA of the human LDL receptor gene was coupled to a luciferase reporter gene, transfected into HepG2 cells, and promoter activity was assayed after TNF and IL-1 challenge to the cells. TNF and IL-1 increased promoter activity 200-400%, while treatment with LDL inhibited promoter activity by 70-85%. TNF or IL-1 co-incubation with LDL could not override transcriptional inhibition by LDL. Pretreatment with cycloheximide prevented induction of LDL receptor mRNA by TNF, but not by IL-1, suggesting stimulation of LDL receptor transcription by TNF requires protein synthesis. We propose that TNF and IL-1, acting via distinct signal transduction pathways, increase surface LDL receptors by increasing gene transcription. Our findings suggest that cytokine-induced hypocholesterolemia may be related to TNF and/or IL-1 stimulation of hepatic LDL receptor gene expression and function."
https://openalex.org/W1508168356,"Components required for the splicing of nuclear messenger RNA precursors in vitro have been isolated from HeLa cells. Here we describe the separation of splicing factor SF3 into two components, SF3a and SF3b. Both activities are required together with several other protein factors and U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins for the assembly of a presplicing complex which represents the first ATP-dependent step in the assembly of the active spliceosome. SF3a has been purified to homogeneity by a combination of ion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. It consists of a complex of three polypeptides of 60, 66, and 120 kDa. The association of SF3a activity with these polypeptides has been confirmed by immunoprecipitation and depletion experiments using a monoclonal antibody directed against the 66-kDa subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1496347561,"Exposure of Clone 9 cells to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation results in a rapid and striking stimulation of facilitated glucose transport (7.5-fold at 2 h) that is mediated by the GLUT-1 transporter. We have previously shown that this rapid stimulation of glucose transport occurs in the absence of any detectable increase in cell GLUT-1 or GLUT-1 mRNA content. To determine whether this early enhancement of transport is attributable to a translocation of glucose transporters to the plasma membrane, or instead to an activation of transporters already present in the plasma membrane, we have employed four different approaches to determine whether the stimulation of transport is accompanied by a corresponding increase in plasma membrane GLUT-1 sites: 1) immunofluorescence microscopy; 2) quantitation of GLUT-1 sites in plasma membrane fractions isolated by differential centrifugation and subsequent Western blotting; 3) cell surface biotinylated followed by isolation of plasma membranes and quantitation of GLUT-1 sites by Western blotting; and 4) quantitation of GLUT-1 sites in plasma membrane fractions by [3H]cytochalasin B binding. Each of these experimental approaches led to the same conclusion, namely that the large stimulation of glucose transport observed during the early phase of the response to azide is associated with only a slight increase in the abundance of GLUT-1 sites in the plasma membrane. These results strongly suggest that activation of GLUT-1 sites pre-existing in the plasma membrane is the dominant mechanism mediating the early glucose transport response to inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1626591090,"The iron-responsive element-binding protein (IRE-BP) binds to specific RNA stem-loop structures called iron-responsive elements (IREs), which mediate the post-transcriptional regulation of a variety of genes involved in iron metabolism. The IRE-BP is cytosolic aconitase, and a [4Fe-4S] cubane cluster is required for aconitase activity but is associated with loss of IRE binding affinity. Chemical modification of the IRE-BP can abrogate RNA binding and the 3 cysteines predicted to coordinate the Fe-S cluster in the IRE-BP could be targets for modification. We report the expression of recombinant IRE-BP in which the three putative cluster cysteines (Cys-437, Cys-503, and Cys-506) have been mutated to serine residues. Replacement of any or all of these cysteine residues results in a complete loss of aconitase activity. While all of the mutants bind RNA, substitution of Cys-437 specifically renders the IRE-BP resistant to inactivation by low concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide or diamide. These results identify Cys-437 as the target of in vitro regulation of RNA binding in the IRE-BP and suggest that, in the RNA-binding form of the protein, Cys-437 is free and therefore available for modifications that inhibit RNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1576384803,"The equilibrium between the two substrate-reduced forms of pea seedling amine oxidase, one containing Cu(II) and reduced 3-(2,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine (topa) cofactor and one containing Cu(I) and topa semi-quinone, was investigated by visible spectroscopy as a function of temperature. To determine the rate of interconversion between the two species, temperature jump relaxation studies were performed on the substrate-reduced enzyme near room temperature. The yellow radical species was found to approach its equilibrium concentration with a maximum rate constant of 43,000 +/- 3,000 s-1. This rapid equilibration is attributed to intramolecular electron transfer between copper and topa. The data indicate that the Cu(I)/topaSQ species is a kinetically competent intermediate in the reaction of amine oxidases with substrates. Furthermore, the extremely rapid electron transfer rate (kET congruent to 20,000 s-1) suggests that the topa cofactor is in close proximity to the copper atom."
https://openalex.org/W2146327114,"A clofibrate-induced mouse liver cDNA library was prepared and used to isolate the coding sequence for soluble epoxide hydrolase. A 1668-base pair (bp) clone was isolated and found to contain a 1269-bp open reading frame coding for 423 amino acids. Subsequent RNA polymerase chain reaction resulted in the isolation of 396 bp of additional 5'-sequence. Translation of the resulting 1659-bp open reading frame produced a 553-residue protein (62,527 Da) containing deduced peptide segments that matched the amino acid sequences of six peptide fragments isolated previously from CNBr digests of pure murine soluble epoxide hydrolase. Neither the DNA nor the protein sequence showed significant similarity to other currently published sequences. Structural analysis of the soluble epoxide hydrolase coding region suggested at least one potential regulatory motif. Expression of the composite cDNA in COS-7 cells resulted in a 5-10-fold increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase activity and a similar increase in soluble epoxide hydrolase protein amount compared to mock-transfected or vector control-transfected cells. Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with clofibrate led to an approximately 4-fold increase in both soluble epoxide hydrolase enzyme activity and steady-state mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W1606525046,"Abstract The stromelysin-2 (SL-2) gene is transcriptionally active in normal human keratinocytes and encodes a secreted, catalytically competent but latent matrix metalloproteinase. Phorbolester induction resulted in the emergence of SL-2 (but not SL-1 transcripts), whereas the opposite was true for human mucosal fibroblasts. Expression of keratinocyte SL-2 was also induced by the two keratinocyte growth factors, transforming growth factor-alpha and epidermal growth factor, by the proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, but, somewhat surprisingly, not by interleukin-1 beta. The latent SL-2 proenzyme was isolated from 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced keratinocytes by immunoaffinity chromatography using a cross-reactive antibody raised against human SL-1. This procedure led to the recovery of a single M(r) 54,000 molecular species at a level of approximately 0.2 microgram/ml of culture medium. Amino-terminal sequencing identified the protein as SL-2 and verified the predicted signal sequence cleavage site. Conformational activation of latent SL-2 precursor by SDS gave rise to a full-length, uncleaved (M(r) 54,000) active form and at the same time exposed a cryptic thiol group. By contrast, organomercurial activation resulted in autolytic truncation of the molecule with loss of M(r) approximately 10,000 propeptide. SL-2 shared with (human fibroblast) SL-1 the ability to cleave casein, to superactivate fibroblast type procollagenase, and to form apparently binary, SDS-resistant complexes with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1."
https://openalex.org/W1596486131,"Protein kinase C (PKC) appears to require phosphorylation in order to function as an effector-dependent kinase (Pears, C., Stabel, S., Cazaubon, S., and Parker, P. J. (1992) Biochem. J. 283, 515-518). By site-directed mutagenesis of the PKC alpha cDNA, it has been shown that a region including 3 threonine residues (Thr-494, Thr-495, and Thr-497), present in the catalytic domain, is involved in controlling PKC activity. Substitution of these 3 threonine residues by alanine residues leads to the expression, in COS-1 cells, of an unphosphorylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 76 kDa, similar to that determined for the primary translation product. The biochemical characterization of this PKC alpha mutant reveals that it is a functional phorbol ester-binding protein but retains no kinase activity. Coexpression of this PKC alpha mutant and wild type PKC beta demonstrates that the mutant has a dominant effect upon PKC beta phosphorylation. The location of this region and its phosphorylation in relation to PKC function are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520884728,"Murine cytotoxic cell proteinase-1 (granzyme B) is a member of a family of novel serine proteinases that have been implicated to participate in destruction of target cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Comparison of the sequence of the cDNA with the sequence of the protein isolated from cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes suggested that this protein may be synthesized as a preproenzyme containing an amino-terminal activation dipeptide. Here we show that this activation dipeptide regulates the activity of the enzyme in hydrolysis of its preferred substrate tert-butyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Ala-Asp-thiobenzyl ester. Lysates of COS cells transfected with a vector expressing the unmodified cytotoxic cell proteinase-1 cDNA were unable to hydrolyze this substrate, whereas lysates of cells transfected with a construct in which the activation dipeptide codons has been deleted were able to hydrolyze the substrate. In each case Western blotting of the lysates revealed a form of the proteinase with an apparent molecular weight of 27,000. We conclude that the activation dipeptide regulates activity of the enzyme. This is the first report of production of an enzymatically active recombinant cytotoxic T cell serine proteinase. The strategy for successful expression of an activated form of cytotoxic cell proteinase-1 may be applicable to other members of this proteinase family."
https://openalex.org/W1607569982,"A number of mutants with pleiotropic effects on mitochondrial metabolism have been isolated in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and for many the biochemical function that is impaired is not yet known. We report here the isolation and characterization of the LIP5 gene involved in lipoic acid metabolism which complements the g189 mutant (Tzagoloff, A., and Dieckmann, C. L. (1990) Microbiol. Rev. 54, 211-225). DNA sequence analysis of complementing yeast genomic DNA revealed an open reading frame predicting a protein of 414 amino acids. The protein sequence deduced from the gene shares 43% identical residues with the product of the Escherichia coli lip gene, which codes an enzyme involved in lipoic acid synthesis. The LIP5 mutant is not capable of synthesizing lipoic acid but still possesses the activity necessary for attachment of lipoic acid to protein. Relative to the E. coli lip gene product, the LIP5 protein has an amino-terminal extension with characteristics of mitochondrial targeting signals. Cells carrying a disrupted copy of the LIP5 gene show slow growth on ethanol-rich media and barely detectable growth on glycerol-rich media. Unlike other strains with defects in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, LIP5 mutants undergo a high frequency of mitochondrial DNA deletions."
https://openalex.org/W1489703979,"We have cloned the cDNA encoding the human homologue of S mu bp-2, which binds to single-stranded DNA with 5'-phosphorylated guanine-rich sequences related to the immunoglobulin mu chain switch (S mu) region. The deduced amino acid sequences of the mouse and human S mu bp-2 are 76.5% homologous and contain motifs conserved among helicases. We have identified a domain essential for DNA binding at residues 638-786. The binding domain is less conserved (63% homologous) than the putative catalytic domain of N-terminal half containing most of the helicase motifs (85% homologous). The human and mouse S mu bp-2 have similar, although slightly different, binding specificities. Although the mouse S mu bp-2 preferentially binds to the mouse S mu motif (GGGGT), the human S mu bp-2 binds equally well to the human (GGGCT) and mouse S mu motifs. The human S mu bp-2 gene was mapped to chromosome 11 q13.2-q13.4 by in situ hybridization."
https://openalex.org/W1594157538,"The 20 S proteasome is a multicatalytic protease that has been implicated in several processes including ATP/ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. However, the ATP requirement(s) related to proteasome function is undefined. We demonstrate that a protein kinase activity copurifies through multiple steps utilized to isolate latent 20 S proteasomes from human erythrocytes. The kinase phosphorylates serine residues within a single 30-kDa proteasome subunit. The activity is not sensitive to cyclic AMP or protein kinase inhibitor, indicating that it is not a cyclic AMP-dependent kinase. It is sensitive to nanomolar levels of heparin and is able to utilize both ATP and GTP as phosphodonors, similar to casein kinase II activity. Moreover, a polyclonal antibody specific for casein kinase II recognizes the alpha' subunit of casein kinase II in the 20 S preparation and specifically immunoprecipitates the proteasome-phosphorylating activity. These characteristics suggest that the proteasome kinase is similar or identical to casein kinase II. It is suggested that phosphorylation of the 30-kDa proteasome subunit by casein kinase II may be involved in regulating the activity and/or assembly of proteasome complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1495394226,"We have shown previously that thromboxane A2 stimulates hypertrophy of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells defined as protooncogene expression and protein synthesis without DNA synthesis or cellular proliferation (Dorn, G.W., II, Becker, M.W., Davis, M.G. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 24897-24905). Since endogenous growth modulators could possibly regulate vascular smooth muscle growth to this vasoconstrictor, we tested the hypothesis that thromboxane-stimulated vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy was due to increased expression of endogenously produced basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The thromboxane mimetic (15S)-hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5Z,13E-dienoic acid (U46619) (1 microM) increased cultured rat aorta derived smooth muscle cell immunoreactive bFGF content by 331 +/- 40% over untreated controls after 24 h. Co-incubation of vascular smooth muscle cells with a specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS) against codon 60 of bFGF coding sequence reduced thromboxane-stimulated bFGF expression by 72 +/- 5% and prevented thromboxane-stimulated hypertrophy (nonsense oligonucleotide had no effects). Addition of exogenous bFGF (20 ng/ml) restored growth to AS-treated/thromboxane-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, addition to the culture medium of neutralizing antibody against bFGF inhibited U46619-stimulated vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy by 69 +/- 17%, whereas nonimmune IgG had no effect. Since protein tyrosine phosphorylation is a cell signal associated with growth, thromboxane-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation was also examined. Exposure to 1 microM U46619 for 10 min increased vascular smooth muscle immunoreactive phosphotyrosine content of 130-144-, 86-, 80-, 75-, and 58-kDa proteins. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A (5 microM) prevented thromboxane-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation, but not thromboxane-stimulated hypertrophy, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation was not required for thromboxane-stimulated vascular smooth muscle growth. These results indicate that increased expression and release of endogenous bFGF, but not direct tyrosine phosphorylation, mediates the hypertrophic vascular smooth muscle response to thromboxane."
https://openalex.org/W1556697438,"Differential screening of cDNA libraries from chemically induced malignant mouse skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) identified sequences, including one called mal1, that were up-regulated in their expression at both the benign papilloma and the malignant SCC stages during tumor development. The mal1 plasmid cDNA clone was used to screen lambda phage cDNA libraries made from chemically induced papillomas and SCCs. Two size classes (655 and 933 nucleotides excluding the poly(A) tail) of full-length cDNAs were isolated. The corresponding mRNAs differ in their 3'-untranslated region by 278 nucleotides as a result of utilizing two alternative polyadenylation signals. Both transcripts were expressed simultaneously, showing the same expression patterns, with the smaller one being the predominant species. Most tissues examined showed a weak expression of mal1 mRNA. High levels of mal1 transcripts could be detected in adipose and mammary tissues and tongue epithelia and predominantly in epidermis. The expression observed in epidermis was up-regulated dramatically during tumor formation. Computer-assisted sequence analysis revealed one open reading frame that encoded a protein of 135 amino acid residues with extensive homology to members of the lipid-binding protein family. Residues determining the proposed beta-clam structure of these proteins and the structure of the lipid-binding region were shown to be conserved in the mal1 gene. In vitro translation of mal1 RNA yielded a polypeptide of the predicted size of 15 kDa that was immunoprecipitable with an anti-rat liver fatty acid-binding protein antiserum. Based on the sequence analysis and antigenic properties of mal1, we conclude that it encodes a novel member of the lipid-binding protein family."
https://openalex.org/W1570745597,"After Zn2+ finger-mediated binding to a DNA break, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase becomes automodified with long polymers of ADP-ribose. These nucleic acid-like polymers may facilitate DNA repair by noncovalently interacting with neighboring proteins. Using a novel screening technique, we have identified histones as the predominant poly(ADP-ribose)-binding species in human keratinocytes, rat hepatocytes, frog eggs, and yeast. Polymer binding is confined specifically to the histone domains responsible for DNA condensation, i.e. histone tails. Our results indicate that polymers of ADP-ribose are targeted to sites of DNA strand breaks by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and subsequently function to alter chromatin conformation through noncovalent interactions with histone tails."
https://openalex.org/W1523384705,"Numerous leukocyte functions depend on adhesive intercellular interactions. The leukocyte-specific integrins CD11a/CD18 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1)) and CD11b/CD18 (complement type 3 receptor (Mac-1)), which bind to the intercellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, play a key role in adhesion. Little is known about the binding in molecular detail. We have now defined a peptide region from the first immunoglobulin domain of ICAM-2 that is specifically involved in binding to CD11a/CD18. A synthetic peptide from this part of ICAM-2, covering residues 21-42, bound to purified CD11a/CD18 and inhibited the adhesion of endothelial cells to this integrin. It also inhibited the binding of B lymphoblastoid cells to endothelial cells. Leukocytes bound to the peptide coated on plastic. Several shorter peptides from the same region showed less or no activity."
https://openalex.org/W1604175000,"Protein-protein interactions are common among transcriptional activators and may have important consequences for gene regulation. Using the mobility shift assay, we have identified a factor that enhances specific DNA binding of truncated rat androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors by 25- and 6-fold, respectively, through the formation of heteromeric complexes. This factor, designated receptor accessory factor, or RAF, also potentiates DNA binding of full-length human GR. RAF is temperature and trypsin sensitive and is present in a variety of cultured mammalian cells. By gel filtration RAF has a predicted molecular mass of 130 kDa. RAF enhancement of AR-DNA binding is optimal with androgen response element DNA. RAF appears to interact directly with AR because 1) deoxycholate, which interferes with protein-protein but not protein-DNA interactions, prevents RAF.AR.DNA complex formation, 2) RAF activity is recovered from an androgen response element DNA affinity column only in the presence of AR, and 3) RAF increases the size of an AR.DNA complex by gel filtration. Mutagenesis of truncated AR fragments indicates that a region in the NH2-terminal domain is required for RAF to enhance AR-DNA binding. The interaction of RAF with AR and GR suggests that RAF might influence the ability of these nuclear receptors to activate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1607076866,"The subcellular localization of the enzymes involved in the glycosylation of proteoglycans was studied in rat ovarian granulosa cells by interfering with the normal traffic in the Golgi apparatus using brefeldin A. Cell cultures were metabolically labeled with [35S] sulfate and [3H]glucosamine, and the radiolabeled macromolecules were analyzed by ion-exchange and gel chromatography in combination with chondroitinase or heparitinase treatment. In the absence of brefeldin A, the cells synthesized both dermatan sulfate proteoglycans (DSPGs) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) which were isolated from the culture medium, the plasma membrane, and intracellular compartments. However, in the presence of brefeldin A, the synthesized proteoglycans were almost exclusively HSPGs and were found only in the intracellular compartment. Analyses of HSPGs synthesized in the presence of brefeldin A indicated that: (i) the HS chains are synthesized on the same core protein as for the normal HSPGs, (ii) the chains are two to three times the normal molecular size; and (iii) a significant proportion of the HS chains are normally sulfated. Brefeldin A induces a disassembly of the proximal part of the Golgi complex, resulting in a redistribution of cis-, medial-, and trans-Golgi resident enzymes back to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and blocks the transport of proteins to the trans-Golgi network. Our results indicate that the complete set of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of HS chains are localized in the ER/proximal part of the Golgi complex, whereas the enzymes involved in the elongation/sulfation of DS chains are exclusively located in the trans-Golgi network. Furthermore, our results indicate that the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of HS chains are specific to HS core proteins, since no DS core proteins were substituted with HS chains in the presence of brefeldin A."
https://openalex.org/W1588868156,"Employing reporter gene/CYP1A1 chimeric plasmids, we previously identified a 275-base pair (bp) cis-element (-833 to -558; NRE275) that down-regulated the CYP1A1 promoter. In the present study, this negative regulatory activity was further localized to two subfragments of 105 bp (-833 to -728; NRE105) and 170 bp (-728 to -558; NRE170), each of which exhibited activity with a heterologous promoter/enhancer. Co-transfection studies demonstrated a dependence on cellular trans-acting factors present at limiting concentrations. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the presence of protein(s) that specifically bound to NRE275, NRE105, and NRE170. Based upon competition studies, the protein(s) that bound to NRE105 appeared to recognize sites similar to those recognized by the NRE170-binding proteins. DNase I footprint analysis of NRE105 demonstrated nuclear protein binding to a 21-bp palindrome (-794 to -774). Protection was also observed along conserved guanine/cytosine-rich sequences that flank the palindrome, but in a strand-specific manner. Guanine residues involved in protein binding were identified by methylation interference experiments. Based on transient expression assays with each of the three NRE105 components, all three appear to be necessary for complete negative regulatory activity. However, it is clear the palindrome is the most important sequence with the guanine/cytosine-rich elements playing an ancillary role."
https://openalex.org/W1594018090,"A cDNA of 1992 base pairs encoding the complete rat liver cytosolic epoxide hydrolase has been isolated using a polymerase chain reaction-derived DNA fragment (Arand, M., Knehr, M., Thomas, H., Zeller, H. D., and Oesch, F. (1991) FEBS Lett. 294, 19-22) known to represent the 3'-end of the cytosolic epoxide hydrolase mRNA. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1662 nucleotides corresponding to 554 amino acids (M(r) = 62,268). The DNA sequence obtained did not display significant homology to the sequences of microsomal epoxide hydrolase or leukotriene A4 hydrolase or to any other DNA included in the EMBL Data Bank (release 32). On Northern blotting of rat liver RNA, a single mRNA species was detected that was strongly induced on treatment of the animal with fenofibrate, a potent peroxisome proliferator. The most significant structure of the deduced protein is a modified peroxisomal targeting signal (Ser-Lys-Ile) at the carboxyl terminus that is regarded to be responsible for the unusual dual localization of the cytosolic epoxide hydrolase in peroxisomes as well as in the cytosol. In addition, a leucine zipper-like motif was identified at the amino terminus. Its possible implication for the observed dimeric structure of cytosolic epoxide hydrolase is discussed. The isolated cDNA was expressed in bacteria to yield a catalytically active enzyme. Specific activity of the crude lysate obtained exceeded that of rat liver cytosols from maximally induced animals by a factor of 8."
https://openalex.org/W1581190406,"The carboxyl-terminal globular domain of human aggrecan has been shown previously to contain an alternatively spliced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like module. We have used reverse transcription/polymerase chain reactions on cartilage-derived RNAs to investigate the heterogeneity in the EGF-like domain content of aggrecans from five species (mouse, rat, dog, bovine, and human). A novel alternatively spliced EGF-like module was detected in human aggrecan, establishing the presence of two of these domains. Highly homologous domains are present in aggrecans of other species, and the expression of these modules is identical (4-8%). They share significant homology with EGF-like domains of differentiation proteins and coagulation factors and have a putative calcium binding site. In contrast to this novel domain (EGF2), the previously described EGF-like module (EGF1) is expressed at a high level exclusively in human aggrecan. The expression of the two EGF-like domains in human aggrecan appears to be independent. Although the function of these domains is not understood, the uniform expression of the EGF2 domain may indicate a general role of this aggrecan module, while the expression of the EGF1 domain may reflect species specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1583267779,"Naturally occurring anti-band 3 antibodies appear to have tissue homeostatic functions in the clearance of senescent red cells and in eliciting selective phagocytosis of oxidatively stressed red cells by mediating C3b deposition under conditions that favor the alternative complement pathway (Lutz, H. U., Bussolino, F., Flepp, R., Fasler, S., Stammler, P., Kazatchkine, M. D., and Arese, P. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 7368-7372). They overcome the notoriously low affinities of naturally occurring antibodies by having affinity for C3 which renders these antibodies preferred targets of nascent C3b. Anti-band 3 antibodies preferentially formed covalently linked C3b-IgG complexes, when C3 was activated randomly by trypsin. IgG depleted of anti-band 3 antibodies had almost lost the ability to form C3b-IgG complexes. Likewise, anti-band 3 antibodies, but not anti-spectrin antibodies, preferentially formed C3b-IgG complexes on oxidatively stressed red cells in the presence of a 10(3)-fold excess of other serum IgG, when complement deposition was initiated by antibody binding in diluted serum. Moreover, anti-band 3 antibodies preferentially formed C3b-IgG complexes at a 10(5)-fold excess of other IgG on in vivo aging red cells, since C3b-IgG complexes from senescent red cells contained exclusively anti-band 3 antibodies with an affinity for C3. Thus, the low titer, low affinity naturally occurring antibody became functionally relevant by preferred generation of C3b-IgG complexes that can nucleate alternative complement pathway C3 convertases and represent the most effective opsonins (Fries, L. F., Siwik, S. A., Malbran, A., and Frank, M. M. (1987) Immunology 62, 45-51)."
https://openalex.org/W1595120221,"Novel protein kinases that may participate in the signal transduction pathways of neutrophils were sought by a procedure based on the ability of these enzymes to undergo renaturation and catalyze the phosphorylation of a peptide substrate fixed in a gel. We report that neutrophils contain four uncharacterized protein kinases with molecular masses of about 69, 63, 49, and 40 kDa, which are rapidly activated upon stimulation of these cells with the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe. These kinases can catalyze the phosphorylation of a peptide that corresponds to residues 297-331 of the 47-kDa subunit of the NADPH oxidase system (p47-phox). A peptide that corresponds to residues 153-178 of the human myristolyated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein was also a substrate for the 69- and 63-kDa kinases. The time course for the activation of these enzymes was similar to the phosphorylation of p47-phox and MARCKS in intact neutrophils. In contrast, stimulation of these cells with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, the calcium ionophore A23187, or the combination of these agonists did not activate these enzymes. Activation of the 63- and 40-kDa protein kinases was blocked by pertussis toxin, calyculin A, and staurosporine. Several other unidentified protein kinases were also active with these peptides but did not exhibit enhanced activity after cell stimulation with this method."
https://openalex.org/W1525334014,"A TATA box-binding initiation factor, TFIID, plays a central role in the transcriptional regulation by activators. Using anti-TFIID tau (a TATA box-binding component of native TFIID) immunoaffinity chromatography, nine polypeptides (230, 110, 85, 62, 58, 42, 28, 22, and 21 kDa) were identified as native Drosophila TFIID components that are tightly associated with TFIID tau. To verify the functional activity of the purified TFIID complex, template DNA and other transcription factors were reconstituted with purified TFIID bound to the antibody-Sepharose matrix. Immobilized TFIID mediated not only basal transcription but transcriptional activation by upstream stimulatory factor (USF). On the other hand, recombinant TFIID tau immobilized on the same antibody-Sepharose matrix could not mediate activation by USF. These results suggest that one or more of these additional polypeptides are required as functional TFIID subunits for activator-dependent transcription in conjunction with TFIID tau. As further evidence of the relevance of the Drosophila TFIID components identified in this analysis, including the previously unrecognized p230 (Dynlacht, B. D., Hoey, T., and Tjian, R. (1991) Cell 66, 563-576), protein blot analysis showed that TFIID tau interacts specifically and exclusively with p230. This suggests that p230 is an integral subunit of TFIID and that it may play a major role in tethering other subunits to TFIID tau."
https://openalex.org/W1546966466,"We have evaluated the possibility that conserved cysteine residues are critical for the enzymatic function of p56lck. Through oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis, 5 Lck residues (cysteines 217, 224, 378, 464, and 475) were individually mutated to alanines, and the effects of these substitutions were tested in various in vitro and in vivo assays. We found that mutation of either of 2 cysteines located in the carboxyl portion of the kinase domain (cysteines 464 and 475) abolished the catalytic function of Lck. In addition, it was noted that alteration of cysteine 475 resulted in a dramatic reduction of the half-life of p56lck. These cysteine residues are highly conserved throughout the tyrosine protein kinase family, suggesting that they may play important functions in catalysis and/or substrate recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1582578280,"The active nucleophilic species in the strand cleavage and strand exchange steps of site-specific recombination by the Flp protein are the active site tyrosine (Tyr-343) of Flp and the 5'-hydroxyl of Flp-nicked DNA, respectively. The target phosphodiester, activated by Flp, can be cleaved by an exogenous nucleophile derived, for example, from H2O2. Flp variants that are defective in the phosphate activation step and cannot sustain Tyr-343-mediated cleavage also fail to elicit H2O2-mediated cleavage. An Flp mutant lacking Tyr-343, (Flp(Y343F)), can carry out both the strand cleavage and strand exchange reactions in the presence of a age and strand exchange reactions in the presence of a tyrosine analog. These results are consistent with a cis-activation/trans-nucleophilic attack paradigm for strand breakage and strand union. The proposed model conceptually unifies the chemistry and enzymology of the two partial reactions of recombination. The mechanism of Flp action has strong implications for phosphoryl transfer reactions in other site-specific DNA recombination systems and in RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1513280988,"To clarify the mechanism of the secretion defect of high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and low molecular weight kininogen (LK) by the liver of Brown Norway (B/N) Katholiek rats causing plasma kininogen deficiency, we cloned cDNAs for HK from cDNA libraries of the livers of B/N Katholiek and B/N Kitasato rats. A point mutation of G to A at nucleotide 487 was found in the cDNA of B/N Katholiek rats by sequence analysis of the cDNAs (including the entire HK-coding region) obtained from both strains. Both B/N Katholiek and B/N Kitasato rat cDNA fragments were introduced into a eukaryotic vector, pRc/CMV, to construct their respective expression plasmid, which was used to transfect COS-1 cells. At 24 h of incubation, the culture medium of COS-1 cells transfected with the B/N Katholiek rat cDNA contained only 10% of the HK antigen that was found in COS-1 cells transfected with the B/N Kitasato rat cDNA. More HK antigen was retained in the former cells. Moreover, cells transfected with B/N Katholiek rat cDNA, in which the A at nucleotide 487 was artificially replaced by G, secreted a significant amount of HK into the medium. These results suggest that a point mutation of G to A at nucleotide 487, which causes a substitution of Ala163 to Thr in the heavy chain of HK and LK, is responsible for the defective secretion of HK and LK by the liver of B/N Katholiek rats."
https://openalex.org/W1560110887,"Conantokins-T and -G are highly conserved polypeptides derived from Conus venoms. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist properties of these compounds have been attributed to a potent noncompetitive inhibition of polyamine responses. Substitution of the highly conserved gamma-carboxyglutamate residues as well as modification of the N and C termini of conantokin-G abolished the inhibition of polyamine responses at the NMDA receptor complex. However, several of these modified polypeptides closely mimicked the neurochemical profile of polyamines at the NMDA receptor complex. One of these derivatives, Tyr0-conantokin-G, was found to be the most potent compound exhibiting polyamine-like actions at the NMDA receptor complex described to date, approximately 7-fold more potent than spermine. Circular dichroism studies demonstrate a significant alpha-helical content in conantokin-G (27% in aqueous medium). However, this alpha-helicity is not sufficient for the NMDA antagonist action of the parent peptide and is neither necessary nor sufficient for the polyamine-like behavior of several conantokin-G analogs. The modified conantokin-G derivatives described in this report should be useful probes for examining the role of both polyamines and the polyamine recognition site in the operation of the NMDA receptor complex."
https://openalex.org/W1489224366,"To determine the effects of differences in glycosylation on the structure and functional properties of recombinant human antithrombin (rHAT), we have characterized the properties of the recombinant protein overexpressed by baby hamster kidney cells. Three forms of rHAT, I-III, were isolated which differed in affinity for heparin. Form I had the lowest affinity and contained a high proportion of highly branched complex carbohydrate. Form II had higher affinity and contained both complex and high mannose-type chains. Form III had the highest affinity and was similar to form II in the type of carbohydrate present, but had a lower level of glycosylation, consistent with the absence of carbohydrate at one of the four glycosylation sites. 1H NMR spectra of plasma HAT and rHAT forms I-III suggested very similar protein structures for all forms. Heparin pentasaccharide produced almost identical NMR perturbation difference spectra. The only functional difference found was in the rates of inactivation of factor Xa. Forms II and III gave second order rate constants similar to that of plasma HAT, whereas form I gave a biphasic inhibition, with the first phase having a rate about four times that of the other forms. We conclude that carbohydrate heterogeneity does not alter the structure of the HAT polypeptide or the heparin-induced conformational change, but does affect the heparin affinity and can alter the rate of proteinase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1567343187,"Syndecan-1 is an integral membrane proteoglycan, which binds several extracellular matrix components and growth factors. Its expression follows morphogenetic rather than histological patterns during embryonic development and is regulated by epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during organogenesis. Malignant transformation has been shown to suppress syndecan-1 expression. In order to understand better the regulation of syndecan-1 expression, we have determined the structural organization of mouse syndecan-1 gene. Several genomic clones were isolated, covering the entire 23-kilobase (kb) syndecan-1 gene. All five exons, four introns, and the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions were sequenced. The first intron was very long (17,582 base pairs (bp)) if compared with the others that were only a few hundred nucleotides in length. The first exon contained only the signal sequence and exons II-IV all the glycosaminoglycan binding sites. The fifth exon resided both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, which are known to be conserved among the members of the syndecan family. This genomic structure explains why these members could have heterologous extracellular domains and homologous transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Syndecan-1 gene was shown by primer extension analysis to have three transcription initiation sites which were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. These initiation sites were found to locate -217, -266, and -591 bp from described cDNA (Saunders, S., Jalkanen, M., O'Farrell, S., and Bernfield, M. (1989) J. Cell Biol. 108, 1547-1556). Within the 5'-end of the gene a 2000-bp-long CpG nucleotide-rich sequence resembling a CpG island was found, which started from the transcription initiation sites and ended in the first intron. At the 3'-end of the gene an other polyadenylation signal sequence was revealed 638 bp downstream from the first one. The two mRNAs (2.6 kb and 3.4 kb) were shown to be produced by alternative polyadenylation."
https://openalex.org/W1606972408,"Phosphorylase kinase is shown to be a dual specificity kinase. The specificity of phosphorylation is determined by divalent cation. Mg2+ causes seryl phosphorylation of phosphorylase b, but Mn2+ activates tyrosine phosphorylation of angiotensin II. In contrast to seryl phosphorylation, the tyrosine kinase activity of holoenzyme is not regulated by Ca2+. Preincubation of the holoenzyme with Ca2+, Mg2+ and ATP that causes autophosphorylation activates tyrosine kinase activity. The tyrosyl kinase activity is a property of the gamma subunit. Addition of varying amounts of Mn2+ to a truncated form of the gamma subunit of phosphorylase kinase containing MgATP inhibits serine kinase but activates tyrosine kinase activity. This result along with an oxidative reaction caused by Cu2+ and site-directed mutagenesis of the putative catalytic base inhibiting both serine and tyrosine kinase activity suggest that one active site is involved in both activities. Kinetic studies with Mn2+ and ATP show that Km for nucleotide is not changed with a seryl or tyrosyl substrate. The Vm values are different, and the value for tyrosyl phosphorylation is similar to other tyrosyl kinases. We propose two conformations for the active site; one favors seryl phosphorylation, and the second tyrosyl phosphorylation is caused by the binding of divalent cation at a second metal ion binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1537609642,"Nasal microsomal P450 form a (NMa), a major cytochrome P450 isozyme in rabbit olfactory and respiratory nasal mucosa with high activity toward a variety of odorants and environmental toxicants, was previously purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from rabbit nasal microsomes. In the present study, a cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA from rabbit respiratory nasal mucosa was screened with antibodies to P450 NMa, and five immunopositive clones were isolated and characterized. Sequence analysis indicated that the clones encode two highly similar P450s that contain 494 amino acid residues, with the first 20 corresponding to P450 NMa, and differ from each other in only 8 residues scattered throughout the polypeptide chains. On the basis of structural homology the two proteins are designated as CYP2A10 and CYP2A11 and are the first members of the P450 2A subfamily to be identified in nasal tissue. Genomic blot analysis indicated that 2A10 and 2A11 are apparently not allelic variants. Both genes are expressed in liver and lung as well as in nasal tissues, as judged by RNA blot analysis, but the relative levels of the two mRNAs differ. Both enzymes were partially purified after expression of the cDNAs in Escherichia coli and shown to catalyze the oxygenation of a variety of substrates, including ethanol and procarcinogens such as N-nitrosodiethylamine and phenacetin. P450 2A10 is generally more active than P450 2A11 and strikingly so in the conversion of testosterone to androstenedione."
https://openalex.org/W1603773585,"The Ascaris perienteric hemoglobin is 10(4) times more oxygen-avid than mammalian hemoglobins. Inspection of its primary structure fails to explain this extraordinary association with oxygen. The Ascaris hemoglobin gene encodes a 40-kDa, two-domain globin; the two domains (D1 and D2) are 63% identical, and each is capable of binding a single heme. The native protein is an octamer. At the end of D2 is a highly charged carboxyl-terminal extension containing four direct repeats of HKEE. We have expressed the two domains separately in E. coli. Both individual domains are extremely oxygen-avid. D2, with attached COOH-terminal tail, is capable of multimerization, whereas D1 remains a monomer. Recombinant D1 readily forms diffractable, red, prismatic crystals. We conclude that: 1) the basis of the hemoglobin's oxygen avidity rests in an isolated heme pocket and does not involve inter-domain interactions and 2) multimerization is mediated through sequences in the second domain, most probably via the charged COOH-terminal tail."
https://openalex.org/W1492297912,"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) is an important regulator of gene expression in cells of the immune system. One such gene, tumor necrosis factor, is induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in macrophages, and this induction has been shown to be mediated in part by NF-kappa B activation in murine macrophages. In this study, immunochemical analysis was used to follow LPS activation of the NF-kappa B 50-kDa subunit in the RAW264 macrophage-like cell line. The recombinant NF-kappa B 50-kDa subunit was used as an immunogen to produce a rabbit antiserum, which was then affinity-purified using a portion of the NF-kappa B 50-kDa subunit that does not have homology to other members of the c-rel gene family. Untreated macrophages had little NF-kappa B in the nucleus as detected by Western immunoblotting. The protein was predominantly localized in the cytoplasmic fraction. Interestingly, NF-kappa B was found as the 50-kDa mature protein and 105-kDa precursor. After LPS treatment, there was a rapid nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B as detected by immunoblot analysis. There was also a rapid decrease in the amount of the cytoplasmic 105-kDa protein. This may indicate that the 105-kDa protein is a reservoir for the 50-kDa protein and that one of the actions of LPS is to increase the rate of 105-kDa precursor processing."

Biol. 225, 155-175), the core domain (residues 62-323) of the bacterial regulatory protein lac repressor has been aligned to these sugar-binding proteins of known structure. Although the sequence identity is not striking, there is strong overall homology based on two separate matrix scoring systems (minimum base change per codon (MBC/C) and amino acid homology per residue (AAH/R)) (mean score: MBC/C 5.50; random sequences: MBC/C = 1.45, AAH/R = 4.46). Similarly, the predicted secondary structure of the repressor exhibits excellent agreement with the known secondary structures of the sugar-binding proteins. Using this primary sequence alignment, the tertiary structure of the core domain of the lac repressor has been modeled based on the known structures of the sugar-binding proteins as templates. While the structure deduced for the repressor is hypothetical, the model generated allows a comparison between the predicted tertiary arrangement and the wealth of genetic and chemical data elucidated for the repressor. Important residues involved in operator and sugar binding and in protein assembly have been identified using genetic methods, and placement of these residues in the model is consistent with their known function. This approach, therefore, provides a means to visualize the core domain of the lac repressor that allows interpretation of genetic and chemical data for specific residues and rational design of future experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1570051617,"The Tsx protein from the Escherichia coli outer membrane is a channel-forming protein containing a nucleoside-specific binding site. The antibiotic albicidin enters the cell via this substrate-specific channel. Because albicidin is toxic for E. coli at a very low external substrate concentration, the Tsx channel is likely to contain a binding site for this antibiotic. To identify residues involved in the Tsx substrate-specific channel activity, we devised a selection scheme to isolate albicidin-resistant tsx mutants synthesizing Tsx proteins with defects in their nucleoside uptake function. We recovered seven distinct albicidin-resistant tsx alleles, six point mutations and a 39-base pair duplication. The mutants with a duplication of residues 21-33 of Tsx or with single amino acid substitutions of residue Gly28 (to Arg) and Ser217 (to Arg) are completely deficient in nucleoside uptake at a low substrate concentration. Substitutions of Phe27 to Leu, Gly28 to Glu, Gly239 to Asp, and Gly240 to Asp result in a Tsx protein partially defective in nucleoside transport. These mutant proteins still permit nonspecific diffusion of serine indicating that the mutations do not result in a block of the Tsx channel. Our results are discussed in terms of a model for the topological organization of the Tsx protein within the outer membrane of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1550088392,"Abstract Mutations have been generated at the Lys84 site of the lac repressor to explore its predicted role in inducer binding and/or subunit interaction. Four single mutations, Lys84-->Ala, Lys84-->Leu, Lys84-->Arg, and Lys84-->Glu, have been generated by site-specific mutagenesis. In addition, the mutation Tyr282-->Asp, which results in a monomeric repressor, has been coupled with these four single mutants to generate the four corresponding double mutants. Unchanged inducer binding affinities in all Lys84 mutants except Lys84-->Arg suggest that Lys84 does not contribute energy to inducer binding and is not found in the inducer-binding site as previously proposed (Sams, C. F., Vyas, N. K., Quiocho, F. A., and Matthews, K. S. (1984) Nature 310, 429-430). Interestingly, the double mutants with hydrophobic side chains at the Lys84 site are tetramers, while those with charged side chains remain monomers. This result agrees with the recent model of the lac repressor (Nichols, J. C., Vyas, N. K., Quiocho, F. A., and Matthews, K. S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 17602-17612), in which Lys84 is mapped by sequence alignment to the same face of the subunit as Tyr282. More detailed inducer binding, operator binding, and immunoblotting studies show that all the mutations at Lys84 have quaternary structures that deviate from wild-type protein, providing supportive evidence for the model placing this residue on the surface of the monomer subunit. Substitution of Lys84 by Ala or Leu results in 100-200-fold decreased association and dissociation rate constants for inducer binding and biphasic character. This decrease can be rescued at least partially in the respective double mutants at elevated pH, at which wild-type repressor shows a 10-fold decrease in affinity and cooperativity in inducer binding. In all substitutions with Ala or Leu, immunoblotting patterns with monoclonal antibody, an assay sensitive to alterations in quaternary structure, are distinct from wild-type repressor. Although substitution with Arg at position 84 yields a protein with 10-fold lower inducer binding affinity, the mutant shows decreased pH dependence of inducer binding. Substitution at this site with Glu results in cooperativity at neutral pH with no change in inducer binding at elevated pH. In addition, operator binding affinity of this mutant is affected by elevated pH, a phenomenon not observed in wild-type repressor. These changes in inducer and operator binding properties appear to be related to the altered quaternary structure of these mutants at Lys84."
https://openalex.org/W1574139365,"Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that RecA protein can recognize a variety of perturbations in the DNA helix. Here, using a nitrocellulose filter binding assay, it was observed that RecA bound to bulge-containing DNAs more effectively than non-bulged DNA. The degree of binding of RecA protein to bulged DNA was dependent on the conformation of the bulged bases and the kinking angles produced by the bulges as determined by the type and number of bases in the bulge. Although a single base mismatch does not kink DNA, RecA protein showed preferential binding to DNAs containing certain single base mismatches. An A.C mismatch flanked by A.T base pairs in a 28-base pair (bp) DNA facilitated the binding of RecA protein to the same high level as when the 28-bp DNA contained a 4-base cytosine bulge. Chemical probing techniques were used to examine the structure of DNA within the RecA filament. It was found that upon binding of RecA protein, the DNA helix becomes accessible over at least 14 bp, and the degree of sensitivity agrees with the binding efficiency of RecA protein."
https://openalex.org/W1509096292,"Expression of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) A-chain gene is temporally and spatially restricted in development and highly regulated in selected normal and tumor cell lines. Because DNA methylation appears to be important in regulating tissue specific gene expression, we tested the influence of in vitro methylation of the human PDGF A-chain promotor on its activity in vivo in transient transfection assays. We now report that PDGF A-chain promoter activity is strongly repressed by DNA methylation in a DNA sequence-specific manner and that the repression of promoter activity by methylation requires a methyl CpG-binding protein(s). We also report that incubation of HeLa cells with 5-azacytidine sharply increases levels of endogenous PDGF A-chain gene transcripts. These results indicate that the promoter activity of the PDGF A-chain gene is sharply and selectively reduced by in vitro DNA methylation and that DNA methylation in vivo also may reduce its function in selected cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1551719463,"The pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) of the human placenta are a group of proteins that together with the carcinoembryonic antigens comprise a subfamily within the immunoglobulin superfamily. To study the control of PSG expression, we isolated and characterized PSG genes and identified cis-acting DNA elements in the 5'-flanking gene regions essential for PSG expression. Two overlapping PSG cosmid clones, which contain two allelic variants of a PSG gene (PSG12 and PSG12 psi), were isolated from an unamplified library made from a single individual. Cosmid 1 contains exons 1 (5'/L) and 2 (L/N) of the PSG12 gene located downstream of a previously identified PSG1-I gene. Cosmid 6 contains a portion of the PSG1-I gene lacking exons 1 and 2 upstream of a complete PSG12 psi transcription unit. Sequence comparison indicates that exons 5'/L and L/N in PSG12 and PSG12 psi are 99% identical, except that the L/N exon in the PSG12 psi gene contains a stop codon. Both PSG12 and PSG12 psi transcripts were detected in the human placenta, indicating that both genes are actively transcribed. However, the PSG12 psi gene may represent an allelic pseudogene variant of the PSG12 gene, because all identified PSGs contain a functional N-domain. Primer extension analysis showed that the PSG12 gene starts at a cluster of sites located at -106 to -104 base pairs with respect to the translation start site. In transient transfection assays using a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, we demonstrated that the -835 to -34 DNA region upstream of the translation start site of PSG12 or PSG12 psi contained both positive and negative elements that control PSG expression. Deletion analysis showed that nucleotides -172 to -34 in the PSG12 gene could function as a promoter. Gel retardation analysis showed that protein factors in human placental cell extract formed four complexes (I, II, IIa, and III) with the PSG12(-172/-34) DNA. Site-directed mutagenesis that prevents protein factor binding to the PSG12 promoter resulted in a marked reduction in transcription activation, locating the core enhancers at nucleotides -148 to -141 and -60 to -55. Mutagenesis studies also showed that the ACAGC repeats at nucleotides -84 to -68 in the PSG12 5'-flanking are essential for expression of the PSG12 gene in human placental cells."

Our previous N-terminal amino acid sequence analyses indicated that the gamma- and epsilon-subunits of the sweet potato mitochondrial F1 correspond to the gamma- and epsilon-subunits of animal mitochondrial F1, respectively (Kimura, T., Nakamura, K., Kajiura, H., Hattori, H., Nelson, N., and Asahi, T. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3183-3186). A cDNA clone for the gamma-subunit of the sweet potato mitochondrial F1 was identified by oligonucleotide hybridization selection of a cDNA library, and a cDNA clone for the epsilon-subunit was isolated by reverse polymerase chain reaction and hybridization selection of a cDNA library by the polymerase chain reaction product. The 1.4-kilobase long cDNA for the gamma-subunit contained a 978-base pair open reading frame coding for a precursor for the gamma-subunit. The mature gamma-subunit is composed of 281 amino acids, and its sequence showed significantly higher similarities with the gamma-subunit of animal mitochondrial F1 and bacterial F1 compared with the gamma-subunit of chloroplast CF1 from plants. The precursor for the gamma-subunit contained N-terminal presequence of 45 amino acid residues. By contrast, the 0.46-kilobase long cDNA for the epsilon-subunit contained a coding sequence of 207-base pairs for the mature epsilon-subunit of 69 amino acid residues that is preceded by an ATG codon suggesting that the epsilon-subunit is synthesized without the cleavable presequence for mitochondrial import. The amino acid sequence of the epsilon-subunit of sweet potato mitochondrial F1 showed similarities of 25 and 36% amino acid positional identity with the epsilon-subunits of mitochondrial F1 from yeast and bovine, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1669459348,"To understand alterations in the spatial organization of the crystallins, the major determinant of lens transparency, the x-ray scattering by intact normal human lenses from individuals 6-82 years of age was measured using synchrotron radiation. The angular dependence of the integrated scattering intensity is consistent with short-range order within the crystallin assemblies. A significant change in the scattering patterns of the lenses occurs after 55 years of age, in parallel with an increase of the fluorescence of the urea-insoluble crystallin fraction. This correlation suggests a gradual derangement of the short-range order as a result of cross-linking of the crystallin subunits by advanced Maillard reaction products that are generated by the continuous reaction of sugars, such as glucose or fructose, with proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1486072980,"Adenovirus DNA polymerase (AdPol) exists as a complex with the preterminal protein (pTP) and is essential for both initiation and elongation stages of viral DNA replication. Recent evidence from our laboratory indicates that AdPol is a phosphoprotein and that the major in vivo phosphorylation site, serine 67, occurs within the consensus substrate recognition sequence for cdc2 kinases. In this study, we found that a protein kinase which also exhibits histone H1 phosphorylation activity is stably associated with AdPol. AdPol forms a multimeric complex with this histone H1 kinase and pTP in HeLa cells infected with adenovirus or coinfected with recombinant vaccinia viruses encoding AdPol and pTP. The associated protein kinase and the p34cdc2 kinase phosphorylate AdPol at the same sites which are utilized in vivo, suggesting that the p34cdc2 kinase or a related kinase may be involved in the in vivo phosphorylation of AdPol. Serine 67 is also one of the major in vitro phosphorylation sites, and the substitution of alanine for serine at this position abolishes DNA replication initiation activity of AdPol."
https://openalex.org/W1535789938,"The melting of several serine proteases that had been reacted with different peptidylchloromethylketone (cmk) inhibitors was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and calorimetry. These inhibitors, which cross-link the two domains of the proteases, invariably increased the melting temperature by as much as 28.5 degrees C. The magnitude of the effect was dependent on the size and composition of the peptide moieties. The delta G of unfolding of tosyl-Phe-cmk-chymotrypsin was 13.5 kcal/mol compared to only 8.3 kcal/mol for chymotrypsin. Binding of cmk inhibitors also protected the two interacting domains of urokinase from acid-induced decooperation and caused them to merge into a highly cooperative structure upon refolding at low pH. Fluorescence-detected melting curves of Glu-Gly-Arg-cmk-urokinase indicated that unfolding/refolding at pH 4.5 is characterized by dramatic hysteresis; the cooling curves fell close to those obtained upon heating or cooling of the uninhibited enzyme. Upon second heating, the melting curves were similar to those of the original. The hysteresis effects are interpreted as follows. The tethered tripeptide binds to the active site, causing the protein to melt at much higher temperature in a single cooperative step, as if the two domains are merged into one cooperative unit. Upon cooling, the unfolded protein, with the inhibitor still attached, refolds at the same temperature as the underivatized protein. Only after the native structure is formed does the peptide moiety again bind and stabilize toward a second heating. At lower pH, second heating produced biphasic or triphasic melting curves that were attributed to differential protonation of acid-titratable groups on the enzyme and/or inhibitor at the time of refolding. Similar effects were observed with other trypsin-like proteases, indicating that the hysteresis and bi- and triphasic refolding at low pH are rather general for this class of enzyme."
