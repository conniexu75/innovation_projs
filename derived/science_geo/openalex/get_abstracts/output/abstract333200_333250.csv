https://openalex.org/W1987752174,"A network of geodetic lines spanning the San Andreas fault near the rupture zone of the 1966 Parkfield, California, earthquake (magnitude M = 6) has been repeatedly surveyed since 1959. In the study reported here the average rates of line-length change since 1966 were inverted to determine the distribution of interseismic slip rate on the fault. These results indicate that the Parkfield rupture surface has not slipped significantly since 1966. Comparison of the geodetically determined seismic moment of the 1966 earthquake with the interseismic slip-deficit rate suggests that the strain released by the latest shock will most likely be restored between 1984 and 1989, although this may not occur until 1995. These results lend independent support to the earlier forecast of an M = 6 earthquake near Parkfield within 5 years of 1988."

A chemical method of inducing male sterility would have great merit in certain cucurbits where daily hand removal of staminate flowers on a large scale is economically prohibitive and the maintenance of naturally occurring sterile lines is extremely difficult. This primarily monoecious family presents a special challenge in that flower sex expression has been reportedly altered by chemical treatment (1-3). The chemical suppression of all male flowers in cucurbits would be a means of producing purely female plants. Preliminary studies were conducted in the greenhouse with cucumbers (Cucumis sativus, vars., National Pickling and Burpee Hybrid) and squash (Cucurbita pepo, var. Table Queen). By spraying young cucumber plants after 2 to 3 true leaves had formed with 100 ppm of a-naphthaleneacetic acid (NA) or 25 ppm of 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid, the ratios of staminate to pistillate flowers were reduced from approximately 23: 1 to 8: 1 in National Pickling and from 14: 1 to 2: 1 in Burpee Hybrid. Results were comparable to those reported by Laibach and Kribben (1), in which the decreases in ratios were accompanied by both an increase in the number of pistillate flowers and a decrease in the number of staminate flowers. NA (100 ppm) applied to Table Queen squash when the first true leaf had fully expanded resulted in an average decrease in staminate-pistillate flower ratio from 1.47: 1 to 0.4: 1, with occasional plants producing no staminate flowers. Subsequent field studies (1953) with Table Queen squash revealed that NA (100 ppm) applied as a spray when the seedlings had 1 to 2 true leaves and the treatment repeated 10 days later (4 to 5 true leaves) delayed the appearance of staminate flowers, and treated plants produced exclusively pistillate flowers for 8 days prior to the opening of any staminate flowers. During the fall, winter, and spring months (195354), additional chemicals, including maleic hydrazide (4), were evaluated. Table Queen squash (Stock No. D0421, Ferry-Morse Seed Co.) was used as the test plant (2) and was grown in the greenhouse at 68Â°F night temperature and a photoperiod of 16 hr. Such an environment normally favored the early production of staminate flowers followed by the presence of both staminate and pistilate types, as described by Nitsch et al. (2). A remarkable suppression of staminate flower buds was obtained with maleic hydrazide (MH); the selective inhibition was comparable to that reported by Moore (5) and Naylor (6) for maize. Several spray patterns successfully induced male sterility during the 3to 4-wk interval that each crop was allowed to flower in the greenhouse. Dipping or spraying the plants in a solution containing 250 or 350 ppm of MH when the first true leaf was expanding and followed by a second treatment when 4 to 5 true leaves had developed resulted in plants that produced the usual number (8 to 10) of pistillate flowers in normal spatial arrangement, with no staminate flowers. Characteristic flowering patterns following treatment showed only rudimentary staminate flower buds or bud initials at the nodes in which they normally occurred. In other instances nonfunctional staminate male flower buds developed in which the sepals were abnormally enlarged (Fig. 1B) and some flowers eventually opened, but the androecia failed to develop (Fig. 1D), having aborted in a manner similar to that of the male-sterile mutant in winter squash described by Scott and Riner (7). It was further found that a single application of MH (250, 350, or 500 ppm), applied when 1 to 2 true leaves had developed, resulted in a high percentage of plants that produced only pistillate flowers."

https://openalex.org/W2031543657,"Studies of active galactic nuclei constitute one of the major efforts in astronomy. Massive black holes are the most likely source for the enormous energy radiated from such nuclei. Observations reviewed here suggest unusual activity and the possible existence of a massive black hole in the nucleus of our galaxy. Because of its proximity to Earth, our galactic nucleus can be observed in unsurpassed detail and may serve as the Rosetta stone both for deciphering active galactic nuclei and for confirming the existence of a massive black hole."
https://openalex.org/W2083604088,"Experiments were carried out in New Mexico to determine whether the electrification processes that lead to the formation of lightning in clouds are influenced by the polarity of the charges in the air from which the clouds grow. The normal, positive space charge in the sub-cloud air was reversed by negative charge released from an electrified wire, suspended across a 2-kilometer-wide canyon. On more than four occasions when the clouds over the wire grew and became electrified, they were of abnormal polarity with dominant positive charges instead of the usual negative charges in the lower part of the cloud. The formation of these abnormally electrified clouds suggests both that the electrification process in thunderclouds can be initiated and that its polarity may be determined by the small charges that are present in the atmosphere."

https://openalex.org/W2079810652,"In late July, about 150 astronomers gathered at the University of California, Santa Cruz, for a 2-week workshop on ""Nearly Normal Galaxies."" As the title suggests, the discussion was wide-ranging. Yet two issues stood out: dark matter and the large-scale structure. In itself this was hardly surprising, since these two issues have haunted extragalactic astronomy for nearly a decade. Indeed, they are central to an understanding of how galaxies formed. But some of the most dramatic findings have only been announced this year. Thus, the Santa Cruz workshop came at an especially opportune moment. In the following briefings, Research News draws on the workshop presentations to summarize astronomers' latest thinking on these subjects."
