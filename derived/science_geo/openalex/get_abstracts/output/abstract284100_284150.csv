https://openalex.org/W2059512534,Cosmic rays and meteorites are two classes of material bodies that reach the earth from outer space. The study of their interactions has helped to increase our understanding of both.

On the basis of its crystal structure, infrared spectrum, melting point, specific rotation, and chromatographic properties, this material has been identified as trehalose."

https://openalex.org/W2064662472,"The existence of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the researches already accomplished there are the result of the foresight and wisdom of United States scientists, the National Science Board, and the Congress, who joined forces to make possible this new national asset. Continued effort will be needed td insure that the observatory will always have the finest possible research instruments and that the site will be a haven of radio quiet. Visiting scientists in some instances may wish to bring equipment with them for studying special problems. Within its means, the observatory will provide supporting facilities, including receivers and other electronic devices, computers, laboratories and shops, and housing. Scientists interested in more details concerning arrangements for visitors should direct their inquiries to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, P. O. Box 2, Green Bank, West Virginia."

The inhibitor was present in large amounts in immature seeds and in seedlings sprayed with 2,4-D. The inhibitor acted as an ""uncoupler"" when applied to soybean root tips or mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2051147152,"Escape-level density is approximately inversely proportional to gravity and with decreasing mass will tend toward that of interplanetary gas. When this value is reached, dissipation must cease. The minimum possible ground density of lunar air is calculated to be 10â€“12 that of the air at normal temperature and pressure. Ionization creates a binding electrostatic charge at the escape level."
