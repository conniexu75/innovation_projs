The rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and the brainstem are implicated in opioid analgesia, suggesting a similar role for these structures in placebo analgesia. Using positron emission tomography, we confirmed that both opioid and placebo analgesia are associated with increased activity in the rACC. We also observed a covariation between the activity in the rACC and the brainstem during both opioid and placebo analgesia, but not during the pain-only condition. These findings indicate a related neural mechanism in placebo and opioid analgesia."

A consensus has not yet been reached regarding the size and distribution of regional carbon fluxes obtained using this approach, partly owing to the use of several different atmospheric transport models. Here we report estimates of surface-atmosphere CO2 fluxes from an intercomparison of atmospheric CO2 inversion models (the TransCom 3 project), which includes 16 transport models and model variants. We find an uptake of CO2 in the southern extratropical ocean less than that estimated from ocean measurements, a result that is not sensitive to transport models or methodological approaches. We also find a northern land carbon sink that is distributed relatively evenly among the continents of the Northern Hemisphere, but these results show some sensitivity to transport differences among models, especially in how they respond to seasonal terrestrial exchange of CO2. Overall, carbon fluxes integrated over latitudinal zones are strongly constrained by observations in the middle to high latitudes. Further significant constraints to our understanding of regional carbon fluxes will therefore require improvements in transport models and expansion of the CO2 observation network within the tropics."

These nanoarrays exhibit almost no detectable nonspecific binding of proteins to their passivated portions even in complex mixtures of proteins, and therefore provide the opportunity to study a variety of surface-mediated biological recognition processes. For example, reactions involving the protein features and antigens in complex solutions can be screened easily by atomic force microscopy. As further proof-of-concept, these arrays were used to study cellular adhesion at the submicrometer scale."

To investigate how gene-specific silencing information is transmitted between cells, we constructed a strain that permits visualization of systemic RNAi. We used this strain to identify systemic RNA interference-deficient (sid) loci required to spread gene-silencing information between tissues but not to initiate or maintain an RNAi response. One of these loci, sid-1, encodes a conserved protein with predicted transmembrane domains. SID-1 is expressed in cells sensitive to RNAi, is localized to the cell periphery, and is required cell-autonomously for systemic RNAi."

https://openalex.org/W2077845288,"At the heart of the canonical Wnt signaling cascade, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axin, and GSK3 constitute the so-called destruction complex, which controls the stability of β-catenin. It is generally believed that four conserved Ser/Thr residues in the N terminus of β-catenin are the pivotal targets for the constitutively active serine kinase GSK3. In cells that do not receive Wnt signals, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) is presumed to phosphorylate β-catenin, thus marking the latter for proteasomal degradation. Wnt signaling inhibits GSK3 activity. As a consequence, β-catenin would no longer be phosphorylated and accumulate to form nuclear complexes with TCF/LEF factors. Although mutations in or near the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues stabilize β-catenin in several types of cancer, the hypothesis that Wnt signaling controls phosphorylation of these residues remains unproven. We have generated a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an epitope containing two of the four residues when both are not phosphorylated. The epitope is generated upon Wnt signaling as well as upon pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 by lithium, providing formal proof for the regulated phosphorylation of the Ser/Thr residues of β-catenin by Wnt signaling.

As a consequence, β-catenin breakdown is suppressed (13Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Indeed, oncogenic mutations in β-catenin at putative GSK-3 phosphorylation sites stabilize β-catenin in colorectal cancer and melanoma (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar), causing aberrant activation of TCF (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H.

Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar). Interspecies sequence comparison of β-catenin as well as the oncogenic point mutations in β-catenin have implied four N-terminal residues as the targets of upstream kinases: Ser-33, Ser-37, Thr-41, and Ser-45 (for an overview see ana.ed.ac.uk/rnusse/pathway/bcatmut.html). To date however, no biochemical data exist to confirm the regulated phosphorylation of these residues. Such analyses are complicated by the fact that two separate pools of β-catenin co-exist in epithelial cells. Independent of the pool of labile, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-bound β-catenin, a much larger, highly stabile pool of β-catenin is tightly bound to the cytoplasmic tail of cadherin-type adhesion molecules. This second pool effectively links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (16Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 17Cowin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10759-10761Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18Gumbiner B.M. Neuron. 1993; 11: 551-564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). To provide formal biochemical proof for the regulated phosphorylation of β-catenin during Wnt signaling, we have developed a monoclonal antibody, αABC (“α-active β-catenin”), which recognizes non-phosphorylated Ser-37 and Thr-41. We show that the antibody visualizes the generation of active β-catenin by the canonical Wnt pathway during murine embryogenesis. To generate a monoclonal antibody against dephosphorylated β-catenin, recombinant protein consisting of the N-terminal 100 amino acids of β-catenin was produced in Escherichia coli and used for mouse immunizations. In two fusion experiments, a total of 16 hybridomas were isolated that recognized full-length human β-catenin when overexpressed in COS cells. To map the epitopes recognized by these relevant monoclonal antibodies, we made a series of Myc-tagged N-terminal deletion constructs (Δ26, Δ31, Δ35, Δ39, Δ43, Δ48, and Δ62; numbered for the first amino acid of β-catenin to be expressed). These constructs were transfected into COS cells. Immunohistochemical stainings revealed that two hybridomas recognized epitopes coinciding with the region harboring the regulatory Ser/Thr residues (data not shown). This region comprises the potentially phosphorylated residues Ser-33, Ser-37, Thr-41, and Ser-45. Pepscan analysis was independently performed utilizing sequentially overlapping 12-mer peptides covering amino acids 1–52 of β-catenin. This allowed the precise mapping of the epitopes recognized by all 16 antibodies (Fig. 1 A). The Pepscan data of the antibody 8E7, pertinent to this study, are depicted in Fig. 1 B. The minimal epitope of the antibody as determined by PepScan comprised HS GATT TAP (residues 36–44). The epitope identity was confirmed by transfecting COS cells with expression constructs encoding several point mutants of β-catenin. The antibody neither bound the S37A mutant nor the T41D mutant of β-catenin. Next, a phospho-peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate the influence of individual phosphorylation of the four Ser/Thr residues on antibody recognition. Interestingly, a phosphate group at either Ser-37 or Thr-41 prevented the binding of this monoclonal antibody to its epitope (Fig. 1 C). Upon dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated peptides with calf intestine phosphatase (CIP), the binding was restored. Amino acid substitutions at position Ser-33 or Ser-45 had no effect on antibody binding (Fig. 2). We tentatively named the antibody αABC and concluded that it recognizes an epitope containing Ser-37 and Thr-41 residues only when both are dephosphorylated. We then sought to address whether Wnt signaling could generate the αABC epitope. The accumulation of β-catenin levels was provoked in four different ways in 293T cells. Wnt-1 was transiently transfected into these cells, presumably activating Wnt signaling in an autocrine as well as a paracrine fashion. As a positive control, cells were transfected with a β-catenin construct encoding a dominant-positive mutant of β-catenin (Δ45-β-catenin), i.e. lacking one of the critical regulatory residues (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). Two different pharmacological treatments have been described to stabilize β-catenin. LiCl is presumed to mimic Wnt signaling by the inhibition of GSK3 activity (19Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LiCl is predicted to lead to the accumulation of non-phosphorylated, non-ubiquitinated β-catenin. The proteasomal inhibitor peptide N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) is predicted to induce the accumulation of phosphorylated, ubiquitinated β-catenin (12Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). 293T cells were treated for 6 h with these inhibitors. All samples were analyzed by Western blotting, stained with either the C-terminal pan-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories (TL)) or with αABC. The pan-β-catenin antibody showed an increase in β-catenin levels under all conditions (Fig. 3, top panel). Notably, treatment of the cells with ALLN led to an increase in overall β-catenin levels due to the appearance of higher molecular weight, ubiquitinated forms of β-catenin. The αABC antibody showed similarly increased levels of dephosphorylated β-catenin upon addition of Wnt-1, Δ45-β-catenin and LiCl. However, no increase of the αABC signal was observed upon addition of ALLN (Fig. 3,bottom panel). This indicated that the increased signal obtained with the other stimuli was not merely a result of quantitative affinity differences. Rather, the αABC antibody unequivocally visualized the presence of β-catenin that is not modified at the regulatory residues Ser-37 and Thr-41. Moreover, the ubiquitinated bands that appeared upon ALLN treatment did not stain with the αABC antibody. This proved the notion that phosphorylation of β-catenin precedes ubiquitination. To confirm that the N-terminal modification of β-catenin indeed represented a phosphorylation event, we performed the following experiment. 293T cells were treated with LiCl or ALLN for 6 h, after which the samples were split. Half of the samples were incubated with CIP. Subsequently, Western blotting was performed with the TL or αABC antibody. Significantly, the signal detected by the αABC antibody, but not the TL antibody, increased in the untreated control sample upon dephosphorylation with CIP (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 4). In addition, the ALLN-treated cells not only showed a specific increase of αABC signal upon dephosphorylation, but a higher, presumably ubiquitinated band appeared upon CIP treatment (lanes 3 and 6). The αABC signal from LiCl-treated samples were much less affected by CIP treatment, in concordance with the notion that LiCl should itself lead to an accumulation of non-phosphorylated β-catenin (lanes 2 and 5). Taken together, these experiments provide formal proof that Wnt signaling induces the accumulation of β-catenin not phosphorylated at the N-terminal regulatory residues Ser-37 and Thr-41. To further demonstrate the physiological function of β-catenin phosphorylation we examined the generation of Ser-37/Thr-41-dephosphorylated β-catenin at defined sites during murine embryonic development. Our insights into the role of the canonical Wnt cascade during mammalian development stem largely from phenotypic analyses of transgenic/knockout mouse models in which expression of various components of the cascade is manipulated. The canonical Wnt cascade activated by Wnt/Fz interactions involves the destruction complex, β-catenin and TCF. However, Wnt/Fz interactions can activate other parallel signaling pathways. In insects, Wnt signaling activates the planar polarity pathway, which deviates downstream of Dishevelled to a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (20Halfon M.S. Carmena A. Gisselbrecht S. Sackerson C.M. Jimenez F. Baylies M.K. Michelson A.M. Cell. 2000; 103: 63-74Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). No vertebrate counterpart of this pathway has been described as yet. Moon and co-workers have described a vertebrate Wnt/Fz-activated pathway that involves protein kinase C and Ca2+mobilization (21Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12701-12711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 22Kuhl M. Geis K. Sheldahl L.C. Pukrop T. Moon R.T. Wedlich D. Mech. Dev. 2001; 106: 61-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Genetic analyses of Wnt and Fz genes by gene disruption have generally yielded dramatic phenotypic abnormalities, yet do not reveal which downstream pathway is involved. Genetic manipulations of genes encoding downstream components of the canonical pathway, such as the TCFs, do provide such insights. Previous studies in Tcf-4−/− mice have indicated that the formation of the crypt progenitor compartment in the small intestine is fully dependent on the presence of Tcf-4. While the transition of intestinal endoderm into epithelium proceeds normally in the absence of Tcf-4, no proliferative compartments are maintained in the prospective crypt regions of the small intestine (23Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar). Thus, an epithelium results that is completely composed of differentiated, non-proliferating enterocytes and goblet cells. This phenotype indicates that a Wnt signal, most likely emanating from subepithelial stromal cells, activates a canonical Wnt cascade in crypt epithelial cells, culminating in the activation of TCF target genes by β-catenin/Tcf-4 complexes. Since the Tcf-4 phenotype first becomes visible at E16.5, we analyzed sections of E16.5 embryos by αABC staining and compared these to sections stained with the pan-β-catenin antibody (Fig. 5 A). While the latter antibody prominently stained the adhesion junctions of villus and crypt regions alike (left panel), αABC staining was weaker and restricted to the cytoplasm and nuclei of cells in the prospective crypts (right panel). This indicated that the canonical Wnt pathway was activated specifically in the prospective crypt cells as predicted and validated αABC staining as a tool to visualize activity of the canonical Wnt pathway. Gene disruption of another TCF family member, Lef-1, affects the late embryonic development of several structures including teeth, whiskers, hair, and mammary glands (24van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Farinas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In accordance with the activity of the canonical Wnt pathway in these structures, active β-catenin could readily be detected in the ectodermal parts of the prospective toothbuds on day 12.5 after gestation (Fig. 5 B). The same held for the follicles of the whiskers (from day 13.5 onward, Fig. 5 C) and the ectodermal sites of mammary gland formation (day 16.5, Fig. 5 D). In this study, we provide formal evidence for the notion that, in the absence of Wnt signaling, the N terminus of β-catenin is phosphorylated prior to its ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we show that Wnt signaling as well as the inhibition of GSK3 lead to the accumulation of dephosphorylated β-catenin. We specifically demonstrate these phosphorylation events with the use of a novel monoclonal antibody, which recognizes an epitope containing two of the four proposed regulatory residues in β-catenin when both are non-phosphorylated. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the antibody visualizes sites that transduce Wnt signals through the canonical Wnt cascade during embryogenesis. Since Wnt/Fz interactions have been demonstrated to activate several different signal transduction cascades, the antibody may be instrumental in outlining those signaling events that activate the canonical pathway. The 293T cell line was cultured in RPMI, complemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. ALLN was obtained from Sigma and LiCl was obtained from Riedel de Haen. A 300-bp PCR product encoding the first 100 amino acids of human β-catenin protein was cloned into pET21a prokaryote expression vector (Novagen) and used to generate His-tagged recombinant protein in BL21 E. coli. Six-week-old BALB/c mice were immunized with 200 μg of purified β-catenin1–100 fusion protein in Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco), with a second injection in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Difco) 14 days later. Following sacrifice of immunized mouse, the splenocytes were fused to SP2/0 mouse myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol. The fused cell population was resuspended in hypoxanthine aminotropterin thymidine selection medium (Invitrogen) and plated into 96-well flat bottom culture plates. Hybridoma supernatants were screened by immunochemical staining of methanol-fixed COS cells transfected with human β-catenin.

The construction of pCIneo-S33Yβ-catenin and pCIneo-Δ45β-catenin, encoding a β-catenin molecule with a Ser to Tyr substitution or a deletion of amino acid Ser-45, was described previously (14Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). 106 COS cells were transfected with 1 μg of the β-catenin constructs using DEAE-dextran and fixed in methanol after 2 days. After rinsing the plates, the cells were incubated with the supernatants of the hybridomas for 60 min, followed by the peroxidase-labeled rabbit-α-mouse 1:100 (DAKO) for 30 min and 2,9-aminoethylcarbonozol/H2O2. Pepscan analyses were performed by Pepscan BV., Lelystad, The Netherlands. Covalink enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nunc) were activated by incubating with 100 μl of 10 mm SPDP (3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. The peptides used, were S33P: C QQSYLD S(-P) GIHSG, S37P:C LDSGIH S(-P) AGTTT and T41P: C IHSGATT(-P) TAPSL. 10 μm peptides in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, were directly coupled to the bivalent linker via the N-terminal cysteine residue for 60 min at 37 °C. The coated plates were blocked with PBS/0.25% bovine serum albumin during 15 min. The monoclonal antibodies were allowed to bind for 45 min at 37 °C followed by the secondary antibody rabbit α-mouse peroxidase-labeled (DAKO) for 30 min at 37 °C. The staining was visualized by adding ABTS (2′,2′-azino-Bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium, (Boehringer) /H2O2 and measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. For detection of endogenous β-catenin protein, 106 sample cells were directly lysed in 200 μl of hot 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (15 mm 1 mTris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.005% bromophenol blue, 8% β-MeOH), vortexed vigorously, denatured by heating at 98 °C for 5 min, and cleared by centrifugation for 5 min at 21,000 ×g. 10 μl of protein extract was resolved on a 10% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). β-catenin protein was detected by probing the blot first with αABC or a commercially available (pan) α-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories, clone 14) followed by a horse-radish-peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG polyclonal antibody (Pierce) and finally visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse embryos were harvested between time points E10.5 and E16.5 days, and fixed in formalin at 4 °C. They were subsequently embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 μm thickness. After deparaffination, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubating the sections in 1.5% peroxide in methanol for 20 min. The sections were then boiled in 0.01 mol/liter citrate buffer, pH 6.0, for 20 min and cooled slowly. Before staining, the sections were blocked with rodent block (LabVision) for 60 min. The sections were washed in PBS and incubated with hybridoma culture supernatant of αABC or with the TL pan-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:100 in culture medium for 60 min. The sections were washed in PBS, and the primary antibody was detected with poly-HRP-goat-α-mouse IgG (Immunovision) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution.

https://openalex.org/W2072212611,"Aerobic, anoxygenic, phototrophic bacteria containing bacteriochlorophyll a (Bchla) require oxygen for both growth and Bchla synthesis. Recent reports suggest that these bacteria are widely distributed in marine plankton, and that they may account for up to 5% of surface ocean photosynthetic electron transport and 11% of the total microbial community. Known planktonic anoxygenic phototrophs belong to only a few restricted groups within the Proteobacteria alpha-subclass. Here we report genomic analyses of the photosynthetic gene content and operon organization in naturally occurring marine bacteria. These photosynthetic gene clusters included some that most closely resembled those of Proteobacteria from the beta-subclass, which have never before been observed in marine environments. Furthermore, these photosynthetic genes were broadly distributed in marine plankton, and actively expressed in neritic bacterioplankton assemblages, indicating that the newly identified phototrophs were photosynthetically competent. Our data demonstrate that planktonic bacterial assemblages are not simply composed of one uniform, widespread class of anoxygenic phototrophs, as previously proposed; rather, these assemblages contain multiple, distantly related, photosynthetically active bacterial groups, including some unrelated to known and cultivated types."
https://openalex.org/W1994248473,"Cryptically coloured animals commonly occur in several distinct pattern variants. Such phenotypic diversity may be promoted by frequency-dependent predation, in which more abundant variants are attacked disproportionately often, but the hypothesis has never been explicitly tested. Here we report the first controlled experiment on the effects of visual predators on prey crypticity and phenotypic variance, in which blue jays (Cyanocitta cristata) searched for digital moths on computer monitors. Moth phenotypes evolved via a genetic algorithm in which individuals detected by the jays were much less likely to reproduce. Jays often failed to detect atypical cryptic moths, confirming frequency-dependent selection and suggesting the use of searching images, which enhance the detection of common prey.

We postulated that flavonoids have a novel regulatory action of delaying or inhibiting absorption of vitamin C and glucose, which are structurally similar. From six structural classes of flavonoids, at least 12 compounds were chosen for studies. We investigated the effects of selected flavonoids on the intestinal vitamin C transporter SVCT1(h) by transfecting and overexpressing SVCT1(h) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Flavonoids reversibly inhibited vitamin C transport in transfected cells with IC50 values of 10–50 μm, concentrations expected to have physiologic consequences. The most potent inhibitor class was flavonols, of which quercetin is most abundant in foods. Because Chinese hamster ovary cells have endogenous vitamin C transport, we expressed SVCT1(h) inXenopus laevis oocytes to study the mechanism of transport inhibition. Quercetin was a reversible and non-competitive inhibitor of ascorbate transport; Ki 17.8 μm. Quercetin was a potent non-competitive inhibitor of GLUT2 expressed inXenopus oocytes; Ki 22.8 μm. When diabetic rats were administered glucose with quercetin, hyperglycemia was significantly decreased compared with administration of glucose alone. Quercetin also significantly decreased ascorbate absorption in normal rats given ascorbate plus quercetin compared with rats given ascorbate alone. Quercetin was a specific transport inhibitor, because it did not inhibit intestinal sugar transporters GLUT5 and SGLT1 that were injected and expressed inXenopus oocytes. Quercetin inhibited but was not transported by SVCT1(h). Considered together, these data show that flavonoids modulate vitamin C and glucose transport by their respective intestinal transporters and suggest a new function for flavonoids.

Flavonoids are subdivided into six structural classes, flavones, flavonols, flavanones, isoflavones, anthocyanidins, and catechins. Although some flavonoids have been proposed to be antioxidants, flavonoid function in vivo is uncertain (1Brown J.E. Khodr H. Hider R.C. C. A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 2Bravo L. Nutr. Rev. 1998; 56: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (3110) Google Scholar). The flavonoid-like compound phloretin was utilized more than four decades ago to inhibit sodium-independent glucose transport (3Lefevre P.G. Marshall J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 3022-3026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural analogs of phloretin from the flavonoid classes of flavanones and flavones inhibited sodium-independent glucose efflux from intestinal cells but not sodium-dependent glucose uptake (4Kimmich G.A. Randles J. Membr. Biochem. 1978; 1: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because glucose is structurally similar to ascorbic acid (ascorbate, vitamin C) and especially to its oxidized product dehydroascorbic acid (5Mann G.V. Newton P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1975; 258: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Washko P. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23568-23574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Washko P.W. Wang Y. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15531-15535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), more recent reports describe effects of flavonoids on ascorbate, dehydroascorbic acid, and glucose transport. The flavonol quercetin and the isoflavone genistein at relatively high concentrations of 100 μm decreased ascorbate transport in three intestinal cell lines (8Kuo S.M. Morehouse Jr., H.F. Lin C.P. Cancer Lett. 1997; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The isoflavone genistein but not the related isoflavone daidzein inhibited glucose and dehydroascorbic acid transport in leukemic (HL-60) cells (9Vera J.C. Reyes A.M. Carcamo J.G. Velasquez F.V. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Strobel P. Iribarren R. Scher H.I. Slebe J.C. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8719-8724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glucose transport by genistein was competitive and occurred in cells overexpressing GLUT1.1 In other experiments several flavonoid classes inhibited transport of glucose, dehydroascorbic acid, and ascorbate in three leukemic cell types, the most potent inhibition occurring with flavonols, and the effects could not be explained by ascorbate oxidation (10Park E. Wagenbichler P. Elmadfa I. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1999; 69: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Park J.B. Levine M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Glucose and dehydroascorbic acid transport were inhibited competitively, and ascorbate transport was inhibited non-competitively. Some aspects of the reported effects of flavonoids on transport inhibition are generally consistent given the structural similarities of glucose, dehydroascorbic acid, and ascorbic acid. However, some reported findings are surprising because of the distinct transport mechanisms for these substrates. Glucose is transported by facilitated sodium-independent glucose transporters GLUT1-GLUT4, GLUT6, GLUT8 and by sodium-dependent transporters SGLT1 and SGLT2 (12Mueckler M. Eur. J.

Dehydroascorbic acid transport is sodium-independent and is mediated by only GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 (19Vera J.C. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Farber C.M. Golde D.W.

Ascorbate transport is sodium-dependent and is mediated by ascorbate transporters SVCT1 and SVCT2, neither of which transport glucose and dehydroascorbic acid (22Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). By coupling these transport mechanisms and the observations that flavonoids inhibited several distinct cellular transport activities, new insights into flavonoid function become possible. The physiologic implications of the inhibitory effects of flavonoids on transport were not previously apparent. This is because inhibitory effects of flavonoids on cellular transport occurred at concentrations of 15–100 μm (8Kuo S.M. Morehouse Jr., H.F. Lin C.P. Cancer Lett. 1997; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Vera J.C. Reyes A.M. Carcamo J.G. Velasquez F.V. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Strobel P. Iribarren R. Scher H.I. Slebe J.C.

Nutr. 2000; 130: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but peak concentrations of flavonoids in human plasma are ∼1 μm after flavonoid ingestion (24Scalbert A. Williamson G. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 2073S-2085SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Conquer J.A. Maiani G. Azzini E. Raguzzini A. Holub B.J. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 593-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We recognized, however, that flavonoid concentrations that inhibit glucose, ascorbate, and dehydroascorbic acid transport are expected in the intestinal lumen (24Scalbert A. Williamson G. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 2073S-2085SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Walle T. Otake Y. Walle U.K. Wilson F.A. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 2658-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that novel functions of flavonoids may be to distribute nutrient absorption throughout small intestine or to frankly inhibit absorption (11Park J.B. Levine M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because flavonoids inhibited transport of ascorbate, dehydroascorbic acid, and glucose, the available data are consistent with the possibility that flavonoids modulate some intestinal transporters (10Park E. Wagenbichler P. Elmadfa I. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1999; 69: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar,11Park J.B. Levine M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, more compelling evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. For ascorbate, the intestinal ascorbate transporter is SVCT1, but some flavonoid effects were characterized using cells that express SVCT2(11). In experiments with intestinal cell lines, it was not certain whether flavonoid effects were because of inhibition of dehydroascorbic acid transport or ascorbate transport or simply to ascorbate loss (8Kuo S.M. Morehouse Jr., H.F. Lin C.P. Cancer Lett. 1997; 116: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For glucose the intestinal transporters are GLUT2 and SGLT1(12, 27), and the GLUT isoform GLUT5 transports fructose only (12Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), but these enteric transporters were not evaluated for flavonoid effects (9Vera J.C. Reyes A.M. Carcamo J.G. Velasquez F.V. Rivas C.I. Zhang R.H. Strobel P. Iribarren R. Scher H.I. Slebe J.C. Golde D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8719-8724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 10Park E. Wagenbichler P. Elmadfa I. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1999; 69: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To address our hypothesis, in this paper we tested the effects of flavonoids on the ascorbate intestinal transporter SVCT1(h) and the sugar intestinal transporters GLUT2, GLUT5, and SGLT1. The data indicate that flavonols, a flavonoid class abundant in plant foods consumed by humans, are potent non-competitive and reversible inhibitors of SVCT1(h) and GLUT2 at concentrations predicted from dietary ingestion. [14C]Ascorbic acid (8 mCi/mmol) 2-[3H]deoxyglucose (25.5 Ci/mmol), [14C]fructose (300 mCi/mmol), and [14C]glucose (265 mCi/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [14C]Quercetin (53 mCi/mmol) was purchased from ChemSyn Laboratories (Lenexa, KS). Quercetin, fisetin, myricetin, rutin, gossypin, apigenin, naringenin, naringin, hesperetin, genistein, luteolin, daidzein, epicatechin, and catechin were purchased from Sigma. Cyanidin, gossypetin, and delphinidin were obtained from Indofine Chemical Co., Inc. (Somerville, NJ). CHO cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The transfection construct was made by inserting 1797 base pairs of SVCT1(h) into pcDNA 6/V5-His C vector (Invitrogen) between HindIII and EcoRI cloning sites, in-frame with the C-terminal peptide. CHO cells were transfected with the construct using LipofectAMINE PLUS kit (Invitrogen). One day before transient transfection, CHO cells growing in Ham’s F-12 medium on 60-mm plates were incubated with 0.05% trypsin, EDTA (Invitrogen) for 5 min and counted. 107 cells were re-plated on 60-mm plates and achieved 50–90% confluency in 24 h in Ham’s F-12 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Cells were then washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 ml of Ham’s F-12 medium without serum were added to each 60-mm plate. To prepare transfection mixtures for each plate, 2 μg of DNA in 2 μl of H2O were diluted into 240 μl of medium without serum and 8 μl of AMINE PLUS reagent. In a second tube, 12 μl of LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent was diluted into 238 μl of medium without serum. The two tubes were incubated for 15 min at room temperature, combined, and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. The combined transfection mixture (500 μl) was added to each plate, which was gently swirled and then incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. After 3 h the medium was replaced with Ham’s F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transiently transfected cells were used in experiments in 24–48 h. The reporter gene V5 in the pcDNA 6/V5-His C vector was used to monitor transfection efficiency in transiently transfected cells. Plated cells 24 h after transfection were fixed for 15 min in 1% freshly prepared paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized for 5 min in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer). Cells were then incubated for 1 h with anti-V5 mouse antibody diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with secondary anti-mouse rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Cells were washed again three times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min with 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole and hydrogen peroxide (AEC + Chromogen System, DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Cells were rinsed for 5 min with H2O, and stained cells were counted by microscopy. Using the above conditions, transfection efficiency was 30–85%. Cells with the highest transfection efficiency were used for transport experiments. The blasticidin resistance site in the pcDNA 6/V5-His C vector was used to develop stably transfected cells. Plated CHO cells transiently transfected with SVCT1(h) as above were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum and the antibiotic blasticidin (10 μg/ml) for 48 h. Cells were trypsinized as above and diluted to 1.5 cells/ml medium containing blasticidin. 0.2 ml of this medium were added to each well of 96-well cluster plates. Wells with 1 cell were verified by microscopy, marked, and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 weeks in the continuous presence of blasticidin. Single cells that developed into clusters were trypsinized as above, transferred to 50-ml flasks, and grown in Ham’s F-12 medium with blasticidin. Cells were tested for ascorbic acid transport activity as described below, and cells with the highest activity were used. Transiently or stably transfected CHO cells in 24-well plates were washed once and incubated with Krebs buffer 30 mmol/liter HEPES, 130 mmol/liter NaCl, 4 mmol/liter KH2PO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 1 mmol/liter CaCl2, pH 7.4). Transport was initiated by adding [14C]ascorbic acid and flavonoids together at the indicated concentrations for the times specified. Flavonoids were diluted 1:100 from concentrated stock solutions prepared fresh by dissolving flavonoids in Me2SO. Control cells were incubated with [14C]ascorbic acid and 1% Me2SO without flavonoids. After incubation at 37 °C, uptake was stopped by washing cells in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were solubilized in PBS containing NaOH (0.1 mol/liter) and CHAPS (10 g/liter; J. T. Baker Inc.) and analyzed by scintillation spectrometry or HPLC as described (28Washko P.W. Rotrosen D. Levine M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Levine M. Wang Y. Rumsey S.C. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 299: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Data displayed represent mean values ± S.D. of 3 replicates, and each experiment was repeated a minimum of 3 times with similar results. Error bars were omitted when the S.D. was less than symbol size. X. laevis oocytes were isolated and injected with cRNA coding for the ascorbic acid transporter SVCT1(h) or glucose transporters GLUT2, GLUT5, or SGLT1 as described (20Rumsey S.C. Xu O. Kwon G.W.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 480-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Briefly, ovaries were resected from adult female frogs anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (2 g/750 ml) (Sigma) in ice water. Ovarian lobes were opened and incubated in 2 changes of OR-2 without calcium (5 mm HEPES, 82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 100 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.8) with collagenase (2 mg/ml) (Sigma) for 30 min each at 23 °C. Individual oocytes (stages V and VI) were isolated from connective tissue and vasculature, transferred to calcium-containing OR-2 (1 mm CaCl2), and maintained at 18–20 °C until injection with cRNA. Oocytes were injected utilizing a Nanoject II injector (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA). Injection volumes were 36.8 nl, and cRNA concentrations 1 ng/nl. Sham-injected oocytes were injected with 36.8 nl of water. Post injection oocytes were maintained at 18–20 °C until experiments were performed. Two days post-injection, oocytes were equilibrated at room temperature in OR-2. To begin experiments, flavonoids and [14C]ascorbate or 2-[3H]deoxyglucose or [14C]fructose or [14C]glucose were added together at the indicated concentrations for the times specified. Flavonoids in Me2SO were prepared as described for cells. Control oocytes were incubated in substrate with 1% Me2SO without flavonoids. After incubation at room temperature, oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Individual oocytes per replicate were solubilized with 10% SDS, and internalized radioactivity was quantified by scintillation spectrometry as pmol/oocyte. Each data point represents the mean value of 10–15 oocytes ± S.D. Each experiment was repeated a minimum of 3 times with similar results. Error bars were omitted when the S.D. was less than symbol size. Effects of quercetin on hyperglycemia were tested using Zucker-fa/fa rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN). Rats were fed a diet providing recommended allowances for all nutrients and were housed individually in standard hanging stainless steel cages in an environmentally controlled animal research facility maintained at 25 °C and 55% relative humidity. For experiments, 5 rats 9–15 weeks old were fasted overnight. The following morning a glucose solution of 2 g/kg of body weight without quercetin was administered by oral drip. Blood samples were collected by tail vein bleeding at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. Glucose concentrations were immediately determined by glucometer (Dex, Bayer Corp., Elkhart, IN). The experiment was repeated on the same rats within 5 days using a glucose solution of 2 g/kg of body weight plus quercetin, 3–65 mg/kg of body weight. Results were matched to each rat in the presence and absence of quercetin. Each data point represents the mean of five animals ± S.E. Glucose with and without quercetin was administered at least four times over 4 weeks to the same rats with similar results, and no animals became overtly ill or hypoglycemic. For time course experiments, the area under the curve was determined for each condition, and the statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed paired t test. For dose experiments, data from the 30-min control time point (no quercetin) were normalized to 100%. The effect of each quercetin dose at this time point was expressed as percent after calculating as follows. Blood glucose30min after glucose administration with quercetin−base­line valueBlood glucose30min after glucose administration without quercetin−base­line valueEquation 1 Effects of quercetin on ascorbic acid absorption were studied in normal CD (Sprague-Dawley) rats 12–15 weeks old with implanted carotid artery catheters (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). Individual rats were housed and fed as described above. Before the experiments, 10 rats were fasted overnight with access to water. To begin experiments the following day, blood from arterial catheters as a zero time value was drawn immediately before administration of the experimental solution. Experimental solutions were fed by gavage and contained either ascorbic acid alone 60 mg/kg of body weight or ascorbic acid 60 mg/kg of body weight with quercetin 15 mg/kg of body weight. Blood was drawn at 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min and placed on ice for processing. The experiment was repeated on the same rats with the alternate solution within 1 week. Arterial catheters were maintained with heparinized solutions of glycerol and NaCl, and blood was withdrawn according to the provider’s recommendations. After 100 μl of blood was withdrawn and discarded, 100 μl of blood was withdrawn and transferred to heparinized Microtainer tubes (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Catheters were flushed with 100 μl of heparinized NaCl solution after each blood withdrawal. Ascorbic acid was analyzed as described (30Levine M. Conry-Cantilena C. Wang Y. Welch R.W. Washko P.W. Dhariwal K.R. Park J.B. Lazarev A. Graumlich J. King J. Cantilena L.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3704-3709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Each point represents the mean of data from 10 animals ± S.E. Results were matched to each rat in the presence and absence of quercetin. The area under the curve was determined for each condition, and statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed paired t test. Ascorbic acid with or without quercetin was administered at least 3 times over 4 weeks to the same rats with similar results. To study the effects of flavonoids on sodium-dependent ascorbate transport, CHO cells were transfected with SVCT1(h). Compared with vector-alone-transfected cells, ascorbate transport increased 5–6-fold over 15 min in cells stably transfected with SVCT1(h) (Fig.1A). Increased transport was linear for at least 15 min. Results were similar in transiently transfected cells (not shown). Because of their abundance in foods, the flavonoid quercetin and its glycone precursor rutin were tested for their effects on ascorbate transport. Cells stably transfected with SVCT1(h) were incubated with ascorbate 10–400 μm for 10 min with or without 50 μm quercetin, 50 μmrutin, or sodium. Ascorbate transport was inhibited ∼80% by quercetin, virtually completely when sodium was replaced by choline, and was unaffected by rutin (Fig. 1B). Again, results were similar in transiently transfected cells (not shown). The findings indicate that the flavonoid quercetin is a potent inhibitor of ascorbate transport by SVCT1(h) in transiently or stably transfected cells. For consistency, stably transfected cells were used to characterize flavonoid effects. Flavonoids (Fig. 2A) consist of a benzopyran configuration (rings A and C) linked to a benzene ring (ring B). Variations in the heterocyclic C-ring and the linkage between the benzopyran and benzene rings are the basis for classifying flavonoids into six groups (31Hollman P.C. Katan M.B. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2B). Within groups, compounds can also be classified whether they are non-glycosylated (aglycones) or glycosylated (glycones). Flavonoid groups and representative aglycone compounds for each are: flavonol (quercetin, rutin (glycone form of quercetin), myricetin, fisetin, gossypetin, gossypin (glycone form of gossypetin); flavone (apigenin); flavanone (naringenin, naringin (glycone form of naringenin)); isoflavone (genistein, daidzein); catechin (catechin); and anthocyanin (cyanidin). There are similarities between the chemical structure of ascorbate and some flavonoids, especially flavonols (Fig. 2C). Because quercetin was an effective inhibitor and is a flavonol, other flavonols were tested for inhibition of ascorbate transport in cells stably transfected with SVCT1(h). Fisetin, myricetin, and quercetin each had a similar IC50 for transport inhibition (Fig.3A, TableI). Inhibition was eliminated if glycosylated residues were present at the 3 or 8 positions (rutin and gossypin, respectively) and when the hydrogen at the 8 position was replaced with a hydroxyl group (gossypetin).Table IFlavonoid concentration inhibiting ascorbic acid transport by 50% (IC50) in SVCT1(h)-transfected CHO cellsFlavonoidsIC50μmFlavonolQuercetin15Rutin (glycone of quercetin)NIFisetin16Myricetin11GossypetinNIGossypin (glycone of gossypetin)NIFlavoneApigenin16FlavanoneNaringenin49Naringin (glycone of naringenin)NIIsoflavoneGenistein20CatechinCatechinNIAnthocyaninCyanidin84NI, not inhibitory.

The tested compounds in rank of most to least inhibitory were myricetin > quercetin > fisetin = apigenin > genistein > naringenin > cyanidin >>> naringin = catechin = rutin = gossypin = gossypetin (Fig. 3, A and B, Table I). The data in Figs. 2and 3 suggest that inhibition of SVCT1(h) by flavonoids is affected by the presence of a double bond at C2-C3 and a ketone at C4 and that these moieties confer structural similarity to ascorbate (Fig. 2,A and C). Inhibition of transport was also eliminated by substitution of the hydrogen at C8 and by glycosylation at C3 or C8 (see Fig. 2A). We tested other possibilities to explain flavonoid inhibition of ascorbate transport. To test reversibility, cells were preincubated with quercetin 100 μm under the conditions that inhibited ascorbate transport, washed, and incubated with ascorbate without quercetin. Inhibition of transport was entirely reversible. Ascorbate transport without quercetin preincubation was 4.4 nmol/10 min/mg of protein and, with quercetin preincubation and washing, was 4.3 nmol/10 min/mg of protein. Without Me2SO, transport was 4.2 nmol/10 min/mg of protein, indicating that Me2SO alone did not inhibit cellular transport. HPLC ascorbate analyses showed that ascorbic acid concentrations were unchanged in the presence of quercetin 100 μm, indicating that the transport findings could not be explained by ascorbate oxidation by quercetin (32Long L.H. Clement M.V. Halliwell B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 50-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (not shown). To determine the kinetics mechanism of ascorbate inhibition of SVCT1(h), it was necessary to utilize a system that expressed only SVCT1(h). CHO cells had basal ascorbate transport (Fig.1, A and B). Using reverse transcription-PCR, SVCT2 but not SVCT1 was detected in CHO cells (not shown). Endogenous SVCT2 would interfere with accurate determination of inhibition kinetics of flavonoids with respect to SVCT1. Because X. laevis oocytes are not expected to transport ascorbate basally (23Daruwala R. Song J. Koh W.S. Rumsey S.C. Levine M.

Particular interest in this gene family is stimulated by the fact that the SLC26A2, SLC26A3,and SLC26A4 genes have been recognized as the disease genes mutated in diastrophic dysplasia, congenital chloride diarrhea, and Pendred syndrome, respectively. We report the expansion of theSLC26 gene family by characterizing three novel tissue-specific members, named SLC26A7, SLC26A8, andSLC26A9, on chromosomes 8, 6, and 1, respectively. The SLC26A7–A9 proteins are structurally very similar at the amino acid level to the previous family members and show tissue-specific expression in kidney, testis, and lung, respectively. More detailed characterization by immunohistochemistry and/or in situ hybridization localized SLC26A7 to distal segments of nephrons, SLC26A8 to developing spermatocytes, and SLC26A9 to the lumenal side of the bronchiolar and alveolar epithelium of lung. Expression of SLC26A7–A9 proteins inXenopus oocytes demonstrated chloride, sulfate, and oxalate transport activity, suggesting that they encode functional anion exchangers.

Specific interest in the SLC26 gene family is stimulated by the fact that the first three human genes are associated with phenotypically distinct recessive diseases.

Our observation that the first fully sequenced animal,Caenorhabditis elegans, has seven members of this gene family prompted us to hypothesize that many more than three genes with important physiological functions might exist also in human (2.Kere J. Lohi H. Höglund P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G7-G13PubMed Google Scholar). By a homology approach, five novel loci were identified with distinct tissue expression patterns (7.Lohi H. Kujala M. Kerkelä E. Saarialho-Kere U. Kestilä M. Kere J. Genomics. 2000; 70: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized two previously mapped candidates in the chromosomes 8 and 6 and a novel gene in chromosome 1, named SLC26A7–A9, respectively (Table I). The SLC26A7–A9 proteins show a high degree of similarity to the previous tissue-specific family members and are expressed at the highest level in kidney, testis, and lung, respectively. Functional expression of SLC26A7–A9 inXenopus laevis oocytes demonstrated chloride, sulfate, and oxalate transport activities.

Genomics. 2000; 70: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). SLC26A9 was first found by searching for the sulfate transport motif (PS01130) of the human SLC26A3 protein against NCBI's high throughput genomic sequence (htgs) data base with TBLASTN algorithm (17.Altschul S.F.

Multiple alignment of the protein sequences was done by ClustalX and BoxShade Server 3.21 (www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html). PutativeN-glycosylation sites were analyzed by the PROSITE program (23.Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Transmembrane topologies of the SLC26A7–A9 proteins were predicted by the TMHMM (24.Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) and PSIpred programs (25.Jones D.T. Taylor W.R. Thornton J.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3038-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The coding region of each gene was assembled from several overlapping PCR fragments, which were amplified by gene-specific primers designed to GENSCAN-predicted exons. The primer sequences can be obtained from the authors ([email protected] and [email protected]). The overlapping PCR fragments were amplified by PCR from the first strand cDNAs of human kidney, testis, and lung. The first strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SMART RACE method was used for amplification of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the SLC26A7–A9cDNAs by PCR. The following antisense primers were used with the universal primer mix for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends: 5′-ATA AGA ATT CAA GCT TTG ACA TTG-3′ and 5′-ACT TTG AAA TGC AAA GGA TCC ACG-3′for A7; 5′-GGA CTT AGA GCT GAA GCC AGA GAT-3′ and 5′-CTG AAG GTG GTG ATG TTG ATG TTC-3′for A8; and 5′-CCA GCC GGC TTT GCT CAC CCA CTG GCA-3′ and 5′-CTT GTG GGA CCT GGA TGG ATC CCC-3′for A9. The following sense primers were used for 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends: 5′-ACC CTG CAG CAG GTG AAA ATT ATC-3′ and 5′-CTA ATT CAG TAT AGA ATA TGC TGT TTG GCA-3′ for A7; 5′-CTG GCC TAT GTA TCA TCC GTC TAT GGC TTC for A8; and 5′-GAA GGT CAC AGA GCC TCA GGA ATT TCC-3′ and 5′-GGT TGA AGC AGG AAA GAT GGA GGC AAA-3′ for A9. The cloning of the 3′ ends of the genes was also verified by PCR with primers designed to the regions, which matched the expressed sequence tags (EST) annotated in GenBankTM. PCRs were done in 25-μl volumes using 5 μl of cDNA as template, 10 pmol of each primer, 1× reaction buffer, 0.2 mm of each nucleotide, and 1 unit of Advantage Polymerase Mix (CLONTECH) using the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1–2 min, followed by 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were subcloned to pCR-2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) and sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry (26.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) and an automated sequencer (ABI 373A, Applied Biosystems, Inc.). Northern analysis was done using the CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA) MTN Northern blots (MTN 7780-1 and MTN 7760-1). A 1984-bp PCR-amplified probe corresponding to nt 198–2181 of SLC26A7, a 551-bp probe corresponding to the 5′ sequence from nt 156–707 of SLC26A8, and a 2362-bp probe corresponding to the open reading frame sequence from nt 115–2476 ofSLC26A9 were radiolabeled with [32P]dCTP with Rediprime Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific probes were hybridized to Northern blot filters in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) for about 2 h to overnight, followed by washes with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature to 65 °C for several hours. Autoradiography was performed on x-ray films at −20 °C. PCR analyses were done as above using cDNAs from CLONTECH's human multiple tissue cDNA panels I and II (K1420–1 and K1421–1) with the following primers: 5′-AAT GGA CAG TGA AAC CCT GCA GCA G-3′ and 5′-GGA AGC TGT ACA ATG GGC TAA CAA T-3′ from A7; 5′-GGA TGT GTA TGT ATC GAT TAA AGG ATT-3′and 5′-GGG AAC TTG CAC AAG GCC AAC AC-3′ for A8; and 5′-GAG CAG AGC CCT TTC ACA CAC CTC-3′ and 5′-CTT GTG GGA CCT GGA TGG ATC CCC-3′for A9. The primers for GADPH were included in the kit. The expression of SLC26A9 was analyzed from two human lung-specific epithelial cell lines, NCI-H358 and A549 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) by RT-PCR. The first strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR was done as above with the following primers: 5′-CTC AGC CAA GAT CAA AGC TGT GGT-3′ and 5′-GAC GAT GGA CCC TGG GCC TGT GTA-3′. PCR products were verified by sequencing. A 538-bp fragment corresponding to positions 1629–2166 of the SLC26A8 cDNA was generated by PCR and used to transcribe sense and antisense RNA probes (27.Saarialho-Kere U.K. Pentland A.P. Birkedal-Hansen H. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of adult human testes were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki. Deparaffinized 5-μm tissue sections were digested with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C and treated with 0.1 m triethanolamine buffer containing 0.25% acetic anhydride for 10 min at room temperature. Sections were hybridized with35S-labeled probes (4 × 105 cpm/μl of hybridization buffer) at 52 °C overnight. The slides were then washed under stringent conditions with buffer containing RNase A (28.Prosser I.W. Stenmark K.R. Suthar M. Crouch E.C. Mecham R.P. Parks W.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 1073-1088PubMed Google Scholar), dipped to LM-1 emulsion (Amersham Biosciences), and exposed for 10–30 days at 4 °C. The slides were developed and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. The sense RNA probe was used as a negative control. Antisera were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides SHIHSNKNLSKLSDHSEV for SLC26A7, VEEVWLPNNSSRNSSPGLPD for SLC26A8, and ELSLYDSEEDIRSYWDLEQE for SLC26A9 corresponding to amino acids 639–656, 680–699, and 758–777, respectively. Two rabbits were immunized per each peptide, and both sera were used in parallel in the experiments giving similar results. Peptide synthesis and antibody production were purchased from Sigma. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival specimens of adult human kidney, testis, and lung were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki. Deparaffinized 5-μm tissue sections were pretreated in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min to block the endogenic peroxidase activity. The antisera were diluted 1:1000–1:2000. The peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique was performed utilizing the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories). Diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogenic substrate, and the slides were counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin. Preimmune serum for each immunized rabbit was used as the corresponding negative control, with similar dilutions to the antisera. Mature X. laevis females were purchased from the African Xenopus Facility C.C., Noordhoek, South Africa. Stage V and VI oocytes from X. laevis were maintained at 17 °C in modified Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, gentamycin sulfate 20 mg/liter). Oocytes were injected with either 50–100 nl of water (control) or 7–12 ng of SLC26A7–A9 cRNA using a Nanojet automatic injector (Drummond Scientific Co., Broomall, PA). For cRNA synthesis, pcDNA3.1:SLC26A7 or pcRII:SLC26A7, pcDNA3.1:A8 or pNKS2:SLC26A8, and pcRII:SLC26A9 plasmids were linearized byEcoRV, NotI, or XhoI digestions; the cDNAs were in vitro transcribed using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerases (Promega), and the resulting capped cRNA was dissolved in MilliQ water before use. Transport of [35S]sulfate, [36Cl−]chloride, and [14C]oxalate uptake was performed 3 days after injection. Briefly, 10 oocytes (per data point) were washed at room temperature for 1–2 min in solution A (115 mm sodium gluconate, 2.5 mm potassium gluconate, 4 mm calcium gluconate, 10 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4) or solution B (100 mmcholine chloride, 4 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm Hepes/Tris, pH 7.5) and then placed into 100 μl of solution A containing 2.5 mm NaCl with36Cl− or 0.1 mm oxalate with 2–5 μCi/ml [14C]oxalate, or into 100 μl of solution B containing 0.1 mm K2SO4 with 10 μCi/ml35SO42−(PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30–60 min at room temperature. The oocytes were washed 4 times with ice-cold solution B, lysed with 4% SDS, dissolved in scintillant (BCS, Amersham Biosciences), and counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Inhibition of the sulfate uptake of SLC26A9 was performed by adding either 1 mm DIDS, 5 mm thiosulfate, 5 mm oxalate, or 5 mm glucose to the uptake solution B. All isotopes were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Statistical analyses of the transport results were performed using the prism statistic package, version 3.0 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego, CA). The degree of statistical significance between two groups was calculated using the unpaired t test, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Previously, the SLC26-related ESTAA992584 was identified and mapped to chromosome 8. Its expanded sequence matched the human genomic draft sequence RP11-353D5, which was subjected to exon prediction (7.Lohi H. Kujala M. Kerkelä E. Saarialho-Kere U. Kestilä M. Kere J. Genomics. 2000; 70: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Exons predicted by GENSCAN were verified by sequencing the overlapping PCR fragments. The 5′- and 3′-regions of the gene were expanded by RT-PCR. The combined data revealed an open reading frame of 1971 bp encoding a 656-amino acid protein. The complete cDNA sequence has been submitted to GenBankTM (accession number AF331521) and designatedSLC26A7 (nomenclature for all three genes verified with the HUGO Nomenclature Committee). The sequence flanking the putative ATG translation start site (GAAAAATGACA) contains the −3 purine but not +4 guanine residues of the Kozak consensus sequence (29.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar), and four in-frame stop codons precede that methionine. A 3024-bp 3′-untranslated region precedes the consensus polyadenylation signal AATAAA. However, several alternative poly(A) signals were identified at the 3′ end of the SLC26A7composite sequence. Exon-intron boundaries were determined by aligning the cDNA sequence with genomic clones from the Human Genome Project and Celera Genomics (PAC clone RP11–353D5, GenBankTMaccession number AC017061 and Celera's clone GA_x2HTBL2W902, respectively) (30.Venter J.C.

The SLC26A7 protein shows 50% similarity to SLC26A2 and A3 proteins (BLASTP E value ∼1 × 10−80), and the multiple alignment of the proteins reveals a large number of conserved residues (Fig. 1). PROSITE predicted two putativeN-glycosylation sites for SLC26A7 at Asn125 and Asn131. The 10- or 12-transmembrane structure with intracellular N- and C-terminal domains was suggested by the TMHMM and PSIpred program, resembling the topology predicted for the SLC26A3 protein (2.Kere J. Lohi H. Höglund P. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G7-G13PubMed Google Scholar). ProfileScan analysis of the SLC26A7 protein sequence revealed two domains, which are also commonly shared within the other SLC26 family members (Table III): sulfate transporter family domain (ST family, predicted between aa ∼200 and 500, PF00916) and sulfate transporters and anti-ς-factor antagonists (STAS, between aa ∼500 and 700, PS50801). The putative NTP-binding STAS domain suggests that anion transport could be regulated by intracellular nucleotides (31.Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Curr.

https://openalex.org/W2090191667,"Muscles generate force and shortening in a cyclical interaction between the myosin head domains projecting from the myosin filaments and the adjacent actin filaments. Although many features of the dynamic performance of muscle are determined by the rates of attachment and detachment of myosin and actin, the primary event in force generation is thought to be a conformational change or 'working stroke' in the actin-bound myosin head. According to this hypothesis, the working stroke is much faster than attachment or detachment, but can be observed directly in the rapid force transients that follow step displacement of the filaments. Although many studies of the mechanism of muscle contraction have been based on this hypothesis, the alternative view-that the fast force transients are caused by fast components of attachment and detachment--has not been excluded definitively. Here we show that measurements of the axial motions of the myosin heads at ångström resolution by a new X-ray interference technique rule out the rapid attachment/detachment hypothesis, and provide compelling support for the working stroke model of force generation."

The hypoxic induction of VEGF is due in large part to an increase in the stability of its mRNA. We recently demonstrated that the stabilization of VEGF mRNA by hypoxia is dependent upon the RNA-binding protein HuR. This report describes the identification of a 40-bp functional HuR binding site in the VEGF mRNA 3′-untranslated region. This element can confer HuR-mediated stabilization of a heterologous gene in vitroand in vivo. Furthermore, the element is sufficient to confer an increase in the hypoxic induction of a heterologous gene. Deletion of the HuR binding site within this 40-bp element as mapped by RNase T1 and lead footprinting uncouples a stabilizing sequence from a destabilizing sequence, thus providing a novel RNA-protein regulatory model that might be exploited to manipulate VEGF expression and hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.

We sought to identify a functional HuR binding site in the VEGF mRNA and to determine whether this minimal element could confer HuR-mediated stabilization and hypoxia-inducible stabilization in a heterologous context.DISCUSSIONWe have identified a 40-bp RNA element from the VEGF 3′-UTR mRNA that can confer a HuR-mediated increase in RNA stability and an increase in expression of a heterologous gene under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, we have uncoupled stabilizing and destabilizing sequences within this 40-bp element. Current paradigms have conceptualized that RNA proteins, which function to stabilize RNA, do so by binding to the identical sequences, which otherwise confer instability (15.Zhao A. Chang F.C. Furneaux H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2695-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest an alternative model in which RNA-stabilizing factors may bind to a distinct site and thereby change the secondary or tertiary structure of the RNA, rendering it inaccessible to instability factors and endonucleolytic attack by ribonucleases. The reporter constructs and cotransfection system we have described here are well suited for studying potential RNA-protein interactions and the stability and/or instability of mRNA in intact cells. This system could be used to design specific agents (i.e. decoy oligonucleotides) (11.Shih S.C. Claffey K.P. J. Biol.

Furthermore, the identification of a RNA sequence, which can confer increased gene expression on a heterologous gene, is of tremendous importance in present technologies designed to deliver trans-genes (24.Ruan H.

However, it is unclear why HuR binding might be important in the hypoxic induction of VEGF (i.e. more stability under hypoxic conditions as compared with normoxic conditions) (13.Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). There is no apparent change in total HuR protein with hypoxia. However, HuR can shuttle back and forth from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (32.Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and hypoxia appears to promote an increase in the export of HuR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. 2A. P. Levy, unpublished data.

We sought to identify a functional HuR binding site in the VEGF mRNA and to determine whether this minimal element could confer HuR-mediated stabilization and hypoxia-inducible stabilization in a heterologous context. DISCUSSIONWe have identified a 40-bp RNA element from the VEGF 3′-UTR mRNA that can confer a HuR-mediated increase in RNA stability and an increase in expression of a heterologous gene under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Moreover, we have uncoupled stabilizing and destabilizing sequences within this 40-bp element. Current paradigms have conceptualized that RNA proteins, which function to stabilize RNA, do so by binding to the identical sequences, which otherwise confer instability (15.Zhao A. Chang F.C. Furneaux H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2695-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest an alternative model in which RNA-stabilizing factors may bind to a distinct site and thereby change the secondary or tertiary structure of the RNA, rendering it inaccessible to instability factors and endonucleolytic attack by ribonucleases. The reporter constructs and cotransfection system we have described here are well suited for studying potential RNA-protein interactions and the stability and/or instability of mRNA in intact cells. This system could be used to design specific agents (i.e. decoy oligonucleotides) (11.Shih S.C. Claffey K.P. J. Biol.

The cross section for nonresonant magnetic x-ray scattering depends on the antiferromagnetic modulation vector and spin polarization direction and allows these quantities to be extracted independently. The technique was used to show that the broadening of the nominally first-order ""spin-flip"" transition at 123 kelvin, at which the spins rotate by 90 degrees C, originates at the walls between domains with orthogonal modulation vectors. During cooling, the transition begins at these walls and progresses inward. The modulation vector domains are themselves unchanged."

In contrast, CLC protein has moderate sequence similarity, conserved genomic organization, and near structural identity to members of the galectin superfamily, and it has been designated galectin-10. To definitively determine whether or not CLC protein is a lysophospholipase, we reassessed its enzymatic activity in peripheral blood eosinophils and an eosinophil myelocyte cell line (AML14.3D10). Antibody affinity chromatography was used to fully deplete CLC protein from eosinophil lysates. The CLC-depleted lysates retained their full lysophospholipase activity, and this activity could be blocked by sulfhydryl group-reactive inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide andp-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate, previously reported to inhibit the eosinophil enzyme. In contrast, the affinity-purified CLC protein lacked significant lysophospholipase activity. X-ray crystallographic structures of CLC protein in complex with the inhibitors showed that p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate bound CLC protein via disulfide bonds with Cys29 and with Cys57 near the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), whereas N-ethylmaleimide bound to the galectin-10 CRD via ring stacking interactions with Trp72, in a manner highly analogous to mannose binding to this CRD. Antibodies to rat pancreatic lysophospholipase identified a protein in eosinophil and AML14.3D10 cell lysates, comparable in size with human pancreatic lysophospholipase, which co-purifies in small quantities with CLC protein. Ligand blotting of human and murine eosinophil lysates with CLC protein as probe showed that it binds proteins also recognized by antibodies to pancreatic lysophospholipase.

CLC protein, the unique autocrystallizing constituent that forms these distinctive hexagonal bipyramidal crystals, became synonymous with eosinophil lysophospholipase (LPLase) when chromatographic purification of this enzymatic activity yielded protein preparations that formed CLC and contained the CLC protein (2.Weller P.F.

Elbert B.L. Zhou Z. Leffler H. Ackerman S.J. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The overall structural fold of CLC protein is highly similar to that of galectin-1, -2, and -3 and most similar to galectin-7 (12.Leonidas D.D. Vatzaki E.H. Vorum H. Celis J.E. Madsen P. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13930-13940Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), but the protein shares only moderate amino acid sequence identity with members of this superfamily. The galectin-10 amino acid sequence is most similar to galectin-3 and -4 (25–30% identity) and less similar to galectin-1 and -2 (15–20% identity) (8.Leonidas D.D. Elbert B.L. Zhou Z. Leffler H.

Rosenberg H.F. Life Sci. 1996; 58: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CLC protein has a CRD containing 9 of the 13 conserved residues in the CRD of galectin-1, -2, and -7, sharing 6 of 8 residues directly involved in β-galactoside binding by these galectins (8.Leonidas D.D.

Initial carbohydrate binding studies using solid-phased simple sugars (8.Leonidas D.D. Elbert B.L. Zhou Z. Leffler H. Ackerman S.J. Acharya K.R.

Life Sci. 1996; 58: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggested that CLC protein had specific, albeit weak, binding activity forN-acetyl-d-glucosamine and lactose (8.Leonidas D.D.

Life Sci. 1996; 58: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the mode of carbohydrate binding was not established. However, our recent studies clearly show that these weak carbohydrate binding activities can be attributed to galectin-10 binding to the cross-linked agarose (or Sepharose) matrix and not to the solid-phased lactosamine-containing simple sugars themselves (13.Savage M.P. Parry S.H. Leonidas D.D. Acharya K.R. Ackerman S.J. Glycobiology. 1997; 7 (Abstr. 1106): 1041Google Scholar). Most recently, using x-ray crystallographic approaches, we have demonstrated that CLC protein does not show any affinity for β-galactosides but can bind mannose (in the crystal) in a manner that is unique and different from the binding of lactosamine-containing sugars by other related galectins (14.Swaminathan G.J. Leonidas D.D. Savage M.P. Ackerman S.J. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13837-13843Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). A detailed analysis of the topology and chemical nature of CLC protein's CRD in complex with mannose provided the first evidence of possible carbohydrate recognition by this unique lectin. The natural carbohydrate-containing ligand(s) of CLC protein has not as yet been identified, and the predicted bifunctional role of CLC protein as both a galectin and LPLase in eosinophil-mediated inflammatory responses remains speculative. The CLC protein is still considered to be the eosinophil LPLase despite the lack of amino acid sequence or structural homology with any other LPLases. The protein was originally reported to exhibit divalent cation-independent weak LPLase activity with a Michaelis constant (K m) of 22 μm andV max of 50 nmol/h/mg at 37 °C for lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine substrate (15.Weller P.F. Bach D.S. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15100-15105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CLC protein in the absence of bound lysophosphatide substrate did not provide direct information about the location of an LPLase active site, although we did suggest a potential catalytic triad based purely on structural considerations (8.Leonidas D.D. Elbert B.L. Zhou Z. Leffler H. Ackerman S.J. Acharya K.R. Structure. 1995; 3: 1379-1393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, the nature and mechanism of LPLase activity for CLC protein has remained highly speculative in view of its structural and other similarities to the animal galectins. In the present study, we have reassessed the LPLase activity of CLC protein/galantin-10 in human peripheral blood eosinophils and in the eosinophil-differentiated myelocyte cell line AML14.3D10. Our results show that CLC protein is not the eosinophil's LPLase and that it does not possess LPLase activity of its own, but that it does interact with known inhibitors of eosinophil LPLase activity via amino acid residues in its CRD. However, CLC protein does have the capacity to bind to human and murine LPLases that are recognized by antibodies to pancreatic LPLase. The enzyme responsible for the majority of LPLase activity expressed by the human eosinophil is probably identical to the 75-kDa pancreatic enzyme (16.Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H.

It displays many of the characteristics of mature peripheral blood eosinophils, including constitutive expression of the major protein mediators of the eosinophil such as the granule cationic proteins (major basic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil cationic protein) and CLC protein (18.Paul C.C.

In addition, it can be induced to express chemokine receptors (e.g. for eotaxins) (22.Zimmermann N. Daugherty B.L. Stark J.M. Rothenberg M.E. J.

The leukocyte-containing plasma fraction was harvested, diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline, and overlaid on Ficoll-Paque gradients (25 ml of cell mixture onto 15 ml of Ficoll-Paque 400 (Amersham Biosciences), followed by centrifugation for 30 min at room temperature. The granulocyte pellets were harvested and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The remaining erythrocytes were lysed using brief exposure (10 s) to distilled water, and the eosinophils were isolated using a Miltenyi MACS CD16 kit to remove neutrophils following the methods described by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) (25.Miltenyi S. Muller W. Weichel W. Radbruch A. Cytometry. 1990; 11: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). Total cell counts and eosinophil counts were performed using Randolph's stain. Human eosinophil purity was routinely >95% as assessed by differential counts of Wright's/Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge slides, with eosinophil viability >95% as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion. Murine blood eosinophils (kindly supplied by the laboratory of Dr. James J. Lee, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ) for whole cell lysates for CLC protein ligand blotting were purified from IL-5 transgenic mice to >98% purity using density gradient centrifugation on Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) followed by negative selection using Miltenyi MACS magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec) (26.Lee N.A. McGarry M.P. Larson K.A. Horton M.A. Kristensen A.B. Lee J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1332-1344PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from 1 × 108 to 1 × 109AML14.3D10 cells or 1 × 107 to 5 × 107 blood eosinophils by sonication (four 15-s sonication bursts with 1-min intervals for cooling) on ice using a model 450 sonifier (Branson Ultrasonic Corp., Danbury, CT) with a microtip at a constant duty cycle and power setting of 3.5. The crude sonicates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the soluble, cell-free supernatants were used for CLC protein depletion experiments including LPLase activity measurements, depletion, and affinity purification of the protein. Rabbit IgG antibodies to crystal-derived eosinophil CLC protein were affinity-purified on a solid-phase CLC-Sepharose 4B column as previously described (27.Dvorak A.M. Letourneau L. Login G.R. Weller P.F. Ackerman S.J. Blood. 1988; 72: 150-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Dvorak A.M. Ackerman S.J. Lab. Invest. 1989; 60: 557-567PubMed Google Scholar). A solid-phased CLC column was first prepared using CLC protein isolated by crystallization (in vitro formation of Charcot-Leyden crystals from human eosinophil whole cell lysates (29.Ackerman S.J. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2118-2126PubMed Google Scholar)); the crystal-derived CLC protein preparation contained a single homogeneous 16.5-kDa band on overloaded, silver-stained or Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. The resolubilized, crystal-derived CLC protein was solid-phased to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B resin using standard methodology (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies to CLC protein in the serum from a rabbit immunized with pure crystal-derived CLC protein was affinity-purified using the solid-phased CLC-Sepharose column using standard methodology. The affinity-purified anti-CLC IgG antibodies were then chemically cross-linked to Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) using dimethylpimylimidate as the cross-linker. Lysates of peripheral blood eosinophils or AML14.3D10 eosinophil-differentiated cells that express CLC protein were prepared by sonication as above and fractionated on the anti-CLC column at 50% or less of the column's CLC protein-binding capacity, first determined by saturating the column with CLC protein to quantitate the column's maximum CLC-binding capacity. The CLC-depleted flow-through fractions from the column were collected, concentrated to the original starting volume of whole cell lysate applied to the affinity column, and saved for determination of CLC content and for LPLase activity measurements. The CLC protein bound to the anti-CLC affinity column was eluted with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.5). The eluted CLC protein-containing fractions were dialyzed into 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 2 mmEDTA and concentrated to the starting volume of the original eosinophil or AML14.3D10 cell lysate using Centricon 10 (Amicon) centrifugal concentrators. The starting cell lysate, the CLC-depleted flow-through fractions from the anti-CLC affinity column, and the eluted, highly purified CLC protein from the same fractionation were all analyzed for CLC content by a highly sensitive CLC protein radioimmunoassay (29.Ackerman S.J. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 2118-2126PubMed Google Scholar), by SDS-PAGE, and by Western blotting using SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce) for detection and for LPLase activity. Unless otherwise indicated in the figures, equivalent volumes of the starting whole cell lysate, the pooled and concentrated CLC-depleted flow-through, and the eluted affinity-purified CLC protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Lysophospholipase activity was measured using a radioenzyme assay as described previously without any modifications (15.Weller P.F. Bach D.S. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15100-15105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Zhou Z. Tenen D.G. Dvorak A.M. Ackerman S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). LPLase activity was measured in 50–200-μl samples of whole cell lysates, the pooled and concentrated CLC-depleted flow-through, and the eluted affinity-purified CLC protein or bacterially expressed recombinant CLC protein in a final volume of 1 ml of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% Tween 20, and 2 mm EDTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 192 nmol of palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine containing 1 nmol of l-1-[1-14C]palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine substrate with a specific activity of ∼50 mCi/mmol (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, reactions were terminated by immediate extraction with acidified isopropyl alcohol/heptane/sulfuric acid (40:10:1; v/v/v) as previously described (31.Weller P.F. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 163: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Free palmitic acid partitioned in the upper extraction layer was quantitated by scintillation counting of 1 ml of the organic layer, and the μmol of released [14C]palmitic acid were determined. One unit of enzyme activity represents 1 μmol of fatty acid released/h at 37 °C and pH 7.5. The identity of the released reaction product was confirmed by thin layer chromatography (15.Weller P.F. Bach D.S. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15100-15105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Zhou Z. Tenen D.G. Dvorak A.M. Ackerman S.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All LPLase assays included a positive control enzyme, Vibrio sp. phospholipase B (Sigma), run as an internal standard to control for substrate quality and interassay variation in measuring LPLase activity. Results are expressed as the percentage of activity in whole cell lysates, as μmol of substrate cleaved/h, or nmol of substrate cleaved/h/106 eosinophils or AML14.3D10 cells. Two sulfhydryl group-reactive agents,N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) andp-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) (Sigma), both previously shown to be potent inhibitors of eosinophil LPLase activity (15.Weller P.F. Bach D.S. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15100-15105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were utilized at concentrations ranging from 10−2 to 10−5m. Concentrations of NEM and pCMBS in this range were previously shown to inhibit LPLase activity in eosinophil sonicates by more than 95% (15.Weller P.F. Bach D.S. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 15100-15105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For inhibition studies, NEM and pCMBS were added to whole cell lysates (sonicates), CLC-depleted lysates, or purified CLC protein for 30 min at 37 °C, prior to assaying LPLase activity. Rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody to crystal-derived CLC protein was prepared and utilized as previously described (27.Dvorak A.M. Letourneau L. Login G.R. Weller P.F. Ackerman S.J.

This affinity-purified antibody recognizes a single, 16.5-kDa CLC protein band on Western blots of peripheral blood eosinophil and basophil whole cell lysates and AML14.3D10 cell lysates as well as preparations of antibody affinity-purified and crystal-derived CLC protein. Polyclonal antibody to recombinant rat pancreatic LPLase, kindly provided by Drs. Ralf Kleene and Michael Schrader (Philipps University, Marburg, Germany), was prepared in chickens and used at a dilution of 1:1000. This antibody specifically recognizes a 75-kDa protein in rat zymogen granules (35.Rolink H. Studies on the characterization and function of carboxyesterlipase and colipase in zymogen granules of the rat pancreas.Ph.D. Thesis. University of Marburg, Marburg, Germany2000Google Scholar). Affinity-purified proteins, whole cell lysates, and rat zymogen granule extracts were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a Milliblot Graphite Electroblotter II semidry blotting apparatus (Millipore). The blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% Carnation nonfat dry milk in TBS and then incubated with the primary anti-CLC or anti-rat pancreatic LPLase antibody diluted as indicated above in 5% milk in TBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The blots were washed 3 times for 15 min each in TBS and incubated with affinity purified, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) at a 1:3,000 dilution or donkey anti-chicken IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) at a 1:10,000 dilution in 5% milk in TBS for 45 min at room temperature. Immunoblots were washed three times for 15 min each in TBS and then visualized using the SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescence kit reagents (Pierce) and Kodak BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). AML14.3D10 cells and purified mouse and human peripheral blood eosinophils were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After sonication and centrifugation as described above, duplicate sets of whole cell lysates (6 μg of total protein/sample) were resolved on each half of a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk (Carnation), half of the membrane was incubated for 1 h with 10 μg of crystal-derived CLC protein solubilized in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), followed by extensive washing with TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. The membrane half probed with CLC protein, along with the duplicate control membrane, was then probed with affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit IgG anti-CLC protein antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and the blots were developed using SuperSignal enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Both halves of the membrane were realigned and exposed to Kodak Biomax MR film. The control half of the membrane that had not been probed first with CLC protein was then reprobed with chicken anti-rat recombinant pancreatic LPLase antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-chicken IgY (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). CLC protein levels in whole cell AML14.3D10 lysates, affinity column fractions, and preparations of affinity-purified CLC protein were determined by a highly sensitive double antibody radioimmunoassay that detects CLC protein in the low nanogram range (0.1–10 ng/ml) (29.Ackerman S.J.

In skeletal muscle, insulin stimulates System A activity rapidly by a presently ill-defined mechanism. Here we demonstrate that insulin induces an increase in the plasma membrane abundance of SAT2 in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner and that this increase is derived from an endosomal compartment that is required for the hormonal activation of System A. Chloroquine, an acidotropic weak base that impairs endosomal recycling of membrane proteins, induced a complete inhibition in the insulin-mediated stimulation of System A, which was associated with a loss in SAT2 recruitment to the plasma membrane. The failure to stimulate System A and recruit SAT2 to the cell surface could not be attributed to a block in insulin signaling, as chloroquine had no effect on the insulin-mediated phosphorylation of protein kinase B or glycogen synthase kinase 3 or upon insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport. Our data indicate strongly that insulin increases System A transport in L6 cells by stimulating the exocytosis of SAT2 carriers from a chloroquine-sensitive endosomal compartment.

Our data indicate strongly that insulin increases System A transport in L6 cells by stimulating the exocytosis of SAT2 carriers from a chloroquine-sensitive endosomal compartment. The plasma membranes of mammalian cells possess multiple transport systems for the cellular exchange of amino acids (1.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and of the classical amino acid transport systems described the best studied has been the System A amino acid carrier, which mediates the sodium-coupled uptake of short-chain neutral amino acids (e.g. alanine). System A is expressed in many cell types. Its ability to mediate the uptake of amino acids with N-methyl substitutions has enabled the discrimination of System A from other amino acid transporters using N-methylaminoisobutyric acid (Me-AIB) 1The abbreviations used are: Me-AIBmethylaminoisobutyric acidSATSystem A transporterPI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinasePKBprotein kinase BGLUTglucose transporterCQchloroquineCDcytochalasin DGSK3glycogen synthase kinase 32DG2-deoxyglucoseTfntransferrinTfRtransferrin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMplasma membraneα-MEMα-minimal essential mediaIGFinsulin-like growth factor1The abbreviations used are: Me-AIBmethylaminoisobutyric acidSATSystem A transporterPI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinasePKBprotein kinase BGLUTglucose transporterCQchloroquineCDcytochalasin DGSK3glycogen synthase kinase 32DG2-deoxyglucoseTfntransferrinTfRtransferrin receptorPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMplasma membraneα-MEMα-minimal essential mediaIGFinsulin-like growth factoras a paradigm substrate. Functional studies using this substrate have shown that System A activity is highly pH-sensitive and that the carrier is subject to both long- and short-term modulation (1.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Numerous functional studies have demonstrated, for example, that System A activity is subject to adaptive up-regulation by amino acid deprivation in multiple cell types and that this response is dependent upon gene expression, since it is inhibited by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, inhibitors of translation and transcription, respectively (recently reviewed by us (2.Christie G.R. Hyde R. Hundal H.S. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2001; 4: 425-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). Whether such modulation results from the increased expression of System A carriers or that of regulatory molecule(s) capable of effecting changes in transporter activity has remained unclear. However, the recent cloning of three isoforms of theSystem Atransporter (SAT, also known as amino acid transporter A(ATA)), termed SAT1–3/ATA1–3 (3.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4.Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol.

The availability of molecular probes to System A has allowed us to demonstrate recently that the adaptive increase in transport activity triggered by amino acid deprivation stems from a selective up-regulation in the expression of SAT2 protein in the plasma membrane of muscle and fat cells (7.Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This finding is fully consistent with the observation of others that depriving human fibroblasts of amino acids induces an increase in SAT2 mRNA levels (8.Gazzola R.F. Sala R. Bussolati O. Visigalli R. Dall'Asta V. Ganapathy V. Gazzola G.C.

J. 1994; 297: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and cell stresses (11.McDowell H.E. Eyers P.A. Hundal H.S.

These stimuli induce a rapid increase in theVmax of System A transport that does not rely upon synthesis of new carriers, but which is thought to involve the acute modulation of carrier function effected by molecules participating in early insulin and growth factor signaling. We have shown previously that the stimulatory effects of insulin and IGF-1 on System A can be blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) (10.Tsakiridis T. McDowell H.E. Walker T. Downes C.P. Hundal H.S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.McDowell H.E. Eyers P.A. Hundal H.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and that expression of a constitutively active form of protein kinase B (PKB), which lies downstream of PI3K in the insulin signaling cascade, mimics the effect of insulin on this amino acid transporter (14.Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Precisely how the hormonal activation of PI3K and PKB are linked to an increase in functional System A activity is not yet understood, but it is plausible that signaling from these molecules either stimulates the activity of SAT proteins resident in the plasma membrane or that additional SAT carriers are recruited to the cell surface from an intracellular compartment. The concept of carrier recruitment from intracellular compartments in response to insulin is well established for the GLUT4 glucose transporter (15.Holman G.D. Kasuga M. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, it remains currently unknown whether SAT proteins can be recruited to the plasma membrane in a manner analogous to GLUT4. In an attempt to address this issue, we have investigated the effects of the acidotropic weak base, chloroquine (CQ), which impairs endosomal function and hence protein recycling (16.Puertollano R. Alonso M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3435-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17.Sibille J.C. Kondo H. Aisen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1010: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and cytochalasin D (CD), which disrupts the actin-dependent endocytosis of cell surface proteins (18.Durrbach A. Louvard D. Coudrier E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 457-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19.Lamaze C. Fujimoto L.M. Yin H.L. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20332-20335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) on the insulin-mediated activation of System A and upon the subcellular distribution of SAT2. We demonstrate, for the first time, that disrupting endosomal trafficking results in the loss of insulin-stimulated System A transport and that this correlates with a failure to recruit the SAT2 System A carrier from endosomal membranes.

At the end of the incubation period, cells from five (15 cm) dishes were scraped off the plates with a rubber policeman, pooled, and gently pelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice-cold buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm NaN3, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.4 plus 1 protease inhibitor tablet/50 ml) and homogenized. The cellular homogenate was subjected to a series of differential centrifugation steps to isolate crude cell membranes that were subsequently fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (32, 40, and 50% sucrose by mass) at 210,000 × g for 2.5 h. Membranes from on top of the 32% sucrose cushion and those at the 32/40% and 40/50% sucrose interfaces were recovered and their protein content determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as standard (25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Rat skeletal muscle was excised from the hind limbs of male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g) and fractionated based on a procedure established by Klip and co-workers (26.Klip A. Ramlal T. Young D.A. Holloszy J.O. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The procedure involves skeletal muscle homogenization and a series of differential centrifugation steps that allow isolation of crude muscle membranes. These were subsequently fractionated on a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (25, 30, and 35%) as described previously (26.Klip A. Ramlal T. Young D.A. Holloszy J.O. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 27.Aledo J.C. Lavoie L. Volchuk A. Keller S.R. Klip A. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This procedure resulted in the separation of three distinct membrane bands; one band was located above the 25% sucrose cushion representing membranes enriched with plasma membranes (denoted as F25), and a second band separated on top of the 30% sucrose layer (F30) contained membranes largely of endosomal origin (27.Aledo J.C. Lavoie L. Volchuk A. Keller S.R. Klip A. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A third band separated out on top of the 35% sucrose layer (F35) which consisted of membranes largely of intracellular origin that contain the insulin “recruitable” pool of GLUT4 glucose transporters (28.Douen A. Burdett E. Ramlal T. Rastogi S. Vranic M. Klip A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined using the Bradford method (25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (50 μg protein) or membranes (20 μg protein) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described previously (14.Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 5% milk protein and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20. Membranes were probed with polyclonal antibodies against PKB, phospho-PKB Ser473, and phospho-GSK3 (used at a final dilution of 1:1000), the SAT2 System A isoform (used at 1:3000 (7.Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), annexin II (used at 1:400, a gift from Prof. V. Gerke, University of Munster, Munster, Germany), GLUT4 (final dilution 1:500), TfR (1:1000), or a monoclonal antibody against the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (Mck-1, used at 1:100, a gift from Dr K. Sweadner, Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown, MA). Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminesence on Konica Medical film (Hohenbrunn, Germany). System A activity was assayed by measuring the uptake of Me-AIB as described previously (20.McDowell H.E. Christie G.R. Stenhouse G. Hundal H.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C1287-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, L6 myotubes were incubated with 10 μm [14C]Me-AIB (1 μCi/ml) for 10 min. Nonspecific tracer binding was determined using either [3H]mannitol as an extracellular marker or by determining cell-associated radioactivity in the presence of an excess saturating dose of unlabeled Me-AIB (10 mm). In some experiments glucose transport was measured simultaneously in the same population of muscle cells used to assay System A activity by a dual label approach (12.Hundal H.S. Bilan P.J. Tsakridis T. Marette A. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Uptake of 10 μm2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose (2DG; 1 μCi/ml, 26.2 Ci/mmol) was measured for 10 min. Carrier-mediated glucose transport was determined by quantitating cell-associated radioactivity in the presence of 10 μm cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of facilitative glucose transporters (14.Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Uptake of both Me-AIB and 2DG was determined by aspirating the radioactive medium, followed by three successive washes in ice-cold isotonic saline solution (0.9% NaCl, w/v). Cells were lysed in 0.05 m NaOH and the associated radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation counting. Total cell protein was determined by the method of Bradford (25.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). The transferrin receptor is known to recycle constitutively between the cell surface and an endosomal compartment. To assess the effects of CQ and CD on endosomal recycling, cell surface transferrin (Tfn) binding in L6 cells was determined essentially as described previously (29.Zuk P.A. Elferink L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22303-22312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, human Tfn (Sigma) was iodinated (2.6 × 106 cpm/μg) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (w/v), pH 7.4, with carrier free Na125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 10 min. Iodinated Tfn was isolated by passage through a Dowex-1 ion exchange column. Muscle cells were incubated with CQ and CD for times and at concentrations indicated in the figure legend (Fig. 2) prior to incubation for 30 min in MHB buffer (serum-free α-MEM medium, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C to deplete endogenous transferrin in the culture media. Cells were subsequently incubated in MHB buffer containing 3 μg/ml125I-Tfn (5 × 104 cpm/μg) for 60 min at 4 °C followed by three successive washes in ice-cold PBS and lysis in 1% Triton X-100 prior to quantitating total cell-associated radioactivity using a Beckman LS6000IC counter. To quantitate the internalized radioactivity, the above protocol was repeated on a duplicate set of cells, but this set was washed three times with PBS/25 mm glacial acetic acid (pH 4.2) following the initial three washes with ice-cold PBS to strip surface-associated125I-Tfn. The difference between the two samples gives an indication of surface Tfn binding. Nonspecific surface binding was corrected for by determining radioactivity associated with cells incubated at 4 °C with MHB containing 3 μg/ml 125I-Tfn with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled Tfn. Statistical analysis for multiple comparisons was performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Newman-Keuls test. Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software and considered statistically significant at p values <0.05. To investigate the effects of CQ on System A activity in L6 myotubes we first performed dose and time response studies with this acidotropic agent. Muscle cells were preincubated with 100 μm CQ for up to 3 h, after which period basal and insulin-stimulated Me-AIB uptake was assayed. In the absence of any pretreatment with CQ, insulin increased Me-AIB uptake by ∼65%, but this stimulation was progressively lost upon pretreatment of cells with CQ (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions CQ also induced a modest reduction (∼25%) in basal System A transport activity (Fig. 1A). Insulin-stimulated System A activity was virtually undetectable in cells pre-exposed to 100 μm CQ and was maximally suppressed following preincubation with CQ for 2 h (Fig. 1, A–C). These findings indicate that System A transporters may recycle constitutively at the cell surface and that insulin stimulates System A by enhancing its exocytosis from a CQ-sensitive endosomal compartment. If this supposition is correct, then System A activity in the plasma membrane will depend on the relative rates with which the carrier protein is exocytosed and endocytosed. Studies in yeast and mammalian cells indicate strongly that actin filaments and actin-based motor proteins play a key role in receptor-mediated endocytosis (18–30). Thus, to examine further the importance of exo- and endocytic events in the regulation of System A activity, we investigated the effects of treating muscle cells with cytochalasin D, a reagent that induces depolymerization of actin filaments, in addition to CQ. To assess how each drug affects the recycling of membrane proteins we monitored surface binding of125I-transferrin as an index for plasma membrane transferrin receptor (TfR) abundance, a paradigm marker protein that recycles constitutively at the cell surface. Fig. 2 shows that surface Tfn binding was increased significantly (by 73%) following incubation of cells with CD, whereas it fell by ∼40% in cells that had been exposed to CQ (Fig. 2). These findings are consistent with the view that CD and CQ inhibit endocytosis and exocytosis of TfR, respectively. Previous work using rat adipocytes has shown that the CQ-induced disruption in IGF-II receptor recycling is reversible, suggesting that endosomal function can be restored upon withdrawal of CQ from the incubation medium (31.Oka Y. Kasuga M. Kanazawa Y. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17480-17486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test for whether this was also the case in L6 myotubes, muscle cells were washed free of CQ, and Tfn binding was assayed during the post-wash recovery period. Withdrawal of CQ from the incubation medium for periods of up to 2 h led to a restoration in Tfn binding to a level that was not significantly different from cells that had not been exposed to CQ (Fig. 2). Having established that CD inhibits TfR internalization, we assessed the effects of this drug on System A transport activity. Preincubation of L6 myotubes with 2 μm CD alone induced a near 30% stimulation in Me-AIB uptake (Fig. 3). This increase most likely arises through a modest up-regulation in cell surface System A carrier number that is associated with inhibition of their internalization, whereas carrier exocytosis from the endosomal compartment remains unaffected. This proposition is supported by the finding that the CD-induced increase in System A activity did not take place when muscle cells were treated with CQ just prior to incubation with CD (Fig. 3), under which conditions both endo- and exocytosis are inhibited. Treatment of cells with insulin following incubation with CD results in a further increase in System A activity over and above that elicited by CD but to a level no greater than that observed in the presence of insulin alone (Fig. 3) This finding provides further support for the idea that exocytosis of carriers from an endosomal pool is the mechanism by which insulin stimulates System A transport. PI3K has been implicated strongly in the control of both basal and insulin-stimulated exocytosis of recycling proteins such as TfR (32.Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 211: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,33.Jess T.J. Belham C.M. Thomson F.J. Scott P.H. Plevin R.J. Gould G.W. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that if the stimulation of System A elicited by both CD and insulin relies upon carrier recruitment from an endosomal compartment, then it ought to be blocked by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. Consistent with this idea, wortmannin prevented stimulation of Me-AIB uptake in response to CD and insulin (Fig. 3), and use of the structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitor, LY 294002, yielded similar results (data not shown). The data presented in Fig. 2 indicate that endosomal function can be restored slowly when muscle cells are washed and allowed to recover for 2 h following pretreatment with CQ. We postulated that if the hormonal activation of System A was dependent on a functional endosomal compartment, then the ability of insulin to stimulate System A activity should also be recoverable during the post-wash period. Fig. 4 shows that CQ suppressed completely the hormonal activation of System A but that this stimulation was restored progressively in cells that had been washed “free” of the drug and allowed to recover subsequently in media lacking CQ for up to 2 h. It is plausible that the inhibitory effects exerted by CQ on the hormonal activation of System A might involve direct effects of the drug on membrane transporters or through a blockade in insulin signaling. To examine these possibilities we investigated the effects of CQ on insulin-stimulated glucose transport and upon the phosphorylation of two important insulin signaling intermediates, PKB and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) (34.Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). Although CQ inhibited the hormonal stimulation of System A transport, the drug had no apparent effect on insulin-stimulated glucose transport when assayed in the same cell population (Fig. 5A). This observation is in agreement with previous work using adipocytes showing that although CQ disrupts the recycling of IGF-II receptors, it has little impact on insulin-stimulated glucose transport or upon transporter recruitment to the cell surface (31.Oka Y. Kasuga M. Kanazawa Y. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17480-17486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Shepherd P.R. Soos M.A. Siddle K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 211: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 33.Jess T.J. Belham C.M. Thomson F.J. Scott P.H. Plevin R.J. Gould G.W. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 34.Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovic M.

J. 1993; 296: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings imply, first, that although a proportion of the insulin-regulated glucose transporter, GLUT4, localizes to recycling endosomes (36.Livingstone C. James D.E. Rice J.E. Hanpeter D. Gould G.W. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the effects of CQ on GLUT4 recycling are likely to be minimal. Second, because CQ inhibits insulin-stimulated System A transport and influences the recycling dynamics of TfR and the IGF-II receptor (31.Oka Y. Kasuga M. Kanazawa Y. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17480-17486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this indicates that such proteins are present in a distinct population of endosomal vesicles from which GLUT4 is excluded. To assess the possibility that CQ may have impaired insulin signaling, we monitored the insulin-induced phosphorylation of PKB, an insulin signaling intermediate implicated in the regulation of diverse end point responses to the hormone such as glycogen synthesis (37.Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), glucose transport, and System A transport (14.Hajduch E. Alessi D.R. Hemmings B.A. Hundal H.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1006-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Fig. 5B shows that insulin promoted the phosphorylation of PKB and also that of its downstream physiological target, GSK3. This finding is fully compatible with the observed stimulation in glucose transport elicited by the hormone (Fig. 5A) and indicates strongly that CQ is unlikely to have inhibited activation of System A through suppression of early insulin signaling events. Three SAT isoforms (SAT1–3, also known as ATA1–3) have recently been cloned (3.Varoqui H. Zhu H. Yao D. Ming H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4049-4054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 4.Yao D. Mackenzie B. Ming H. Varoqui H. Zhu H. Hediger M.A. Erickson J.D. J. Biol.

Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Of these, SAT2 appears to be the most abundantly expressed isoform in skeletal muscle, whereas SAT3 expression occurs at a much lower level, and that of SAT1 is not detectable (6.Sugawara M. Nakanishi T. Fei Y.J. Martindale R.G. Ganapathy M.E. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1509: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7.Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Recent work from our laboratory has shown that SAT2 protein expression is enhanced in muscle and fat cells following a period of amino acid deprivation, suggesting that changes in SAT2 expression are likely to underpin the adaptive increase in System A activity (7.Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, the observation that SAT3 is a relatively poor mediator of Me-AIB uptake compared with the other isoforms (38.Hatanaka T. Huang W. Ling R. Prasad P.D. Sugawara M. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) implies that SAT2 is the most likely isoform to mediate insulin-stimulated Me-AIB uptake in muscle. To test this proposition, we investigated the effects of insulin and chloroquine treatment on the subcellular distribution of SAT2 in L6 myotubes. For these studies a 32, 40, and 50% (w/w) discontinuous sucrose gradient was utilized. The membranes that float on top of the 32% sucrose cushion have been shown previously to be enriched with plasma membrane (PM) markers such as the α1 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase (12.Hundal H.S.

Membranes from the 32/40% and 40/50% sucrose interfaces are depleted in PM markers but are enriched with proteins of intracellular origin. Fig. 6A shows the relative abundance of annexin II, a protein that is a major component of fusogenic endosomal vesicles and thus a representative endosomal marker, in the three membrane fractions. Annexin II was detected in all three membrane fractions, but its abundance was greatest in membranes recovered from the 32/40% sucrose gradient interface (Fig. 6A), indicating that this fraction was enriched with endosomal membranes. Consistent with our recent work (7.Hyde R. Christie G.R. Litherland G.J. Hajduch E. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 563-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), SAT2 was detected in all three membrane fractions but was enriched in membranes recovered from the 32/40% sucrose interface (Fig. 6A). When SAT2 abundance was investigated in the three fractions following isolation of cells treated with insulin, we did not observe any changes in SAT2 content in membranes recovered from the 40/50% sucrose interface (data not shown). However, data from three separate experiments revealed that the hormone induced a greater than 2-fold increase in SAT2 in the PM-enriched fraction, Fig. 6B (this was associated with an increase in the Vmax of System A transport from 388 ± 10 pmol/min/mg to 584 ± 16 pmol/min/mg (p < 0.05), with no significant change inKm). The increase in cell surface SAT2 was associated with a concomitant reduction in SAT2 abundance in membranes recovered from the 32/40% sucrose interface (Fig. 6B). These findings imply that insulin promotes recruitment of SAT2 to the PM from the 32/40% fraction, which is enriched with endosomal membranes. Pretreatment of L6 cells with CQ for 2 h prior to subcellular fractionation reduced the amount of SAT2 recovered in the PM fraction, a finding consistent with the idea that this compound prevents the delivery of proteins to the cell surface from the endosomal compartment without affecting the internalization of PM proteins that are constitutively recycling at the cell surface. The loss in PM SAT2 was not recovered in any of the other membrane fractions isolated from the sucrose gradient, raising the possibility that, once internalized, SAT2 may have been routed for lysosomal degradation. Unlike SAT2, pretreatment of L6 cells with CQ had no detectable effect on the insulin-dependent recruitment of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the PM (Fig. 6C). The increase in GLUT4 abundance elicited by insulin was, however, prevented by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (Fig. 6C). These findings are consistent with the observation that CQ does not impair insulin-stimulated glucose transport (Fig. 5A) and with numerous reports showing that insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation requires PI3K activity (39.Hajduch E. Litherland G.J. Hundal H.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of SAT2 abundance in subcellular membrane fractions prepared from rat skeletal muscle indicate that, as in L6 cells, the carrier is present in membranes of endosomal origin (F30) based on enrichment of TfR (a marker of recycling endosomes). In contrast, SAT2 immunoreactivity was very low in membranes that harbor the insulin responsive GLUT4 pool (F35) (Fig. 6D). Indeed, in the present studies the carrier was only detected in this fraction upon prolonged exposure of autoradiographic film. Although SAT2 immunoreactivity was greatest in the PM (F25) fraction, it should be noted that the abundance of SAT2 in the F30 fraction is not insignificant, as the total protein recovery of this fraction is ∼5-fold higher than that of PM enriched fraction (27.Aledo J.C. Lavoie L. Volchuk A. Keller S.R. Klip A. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These findings thus raise the possibility that SAT2 may also be recruited to the sarcolemma of rat muscle from an endosomal pool as observed in our cell-based studies. To further strengthen our assertion that SAT2 mediates insulin-stimulated System A transport, we investigated (i) whether the insulin-mediated increase in plasma membrane SAT2 was sensitive to wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor; and (ii) whether SAT2 translocation could be rescued following CQ wash-out in a time-dependent manner. Fig. 7A shows that the increase in plasma membrane SAT2 elicited by insulin was suppressed by prior treatment of cells with 100 nm wortmannin, a finding consistent with the observation that wortmannin inhibits the hormonal activation of System A transport (Fig. 3). In line with the data presented in Fig. 4, we observed that CQ prevented the insulin-induced increase in cell surface SAT2 but that cells “washed free” of CQ displayed a time-dependent return of SAT2 recruitment (Fig. 7B). Taken together, the findings presented in Figs. 6 and 7suggest strongly that SAT2 translocation underpins the functional increase in System A transport that is observed in response to insulin in L6 cells. In summary, we have shown that treatment of skeletal muscle cells with insulin increases System A amino acid transport due to the translocation of SAT2 protein from an intracellular pool (which contains a high abundance of the endosomal marker annexin II) to the plasma membrane. CQ, a substance that disrupts the trafficking of endosomal transferrin receptors to the plasma membrane, prevents both the recruitment of SAT2 from this internal pool and the increase in System A transport following insulin treatment. Furthermore, disrupting actin microfilaments with CD moderately increases both System A activity and transferrin binding, consistent with a role for the actin network in endocytosis from the plasma membrane. Collectively these results imply that insulin stimulates System A activity by increasing the exocytosis of the SAT2 amino acid transporter from an intracellular endosomal location to the plasma membrane. Our present working model for the hormonal regulation of skeletal muscle System A transport is shown in Fig. 8. Future experiments will seek to determine the nature of the endosomal SAT2 vesicles in greater detail and how the endosomal and cytoskeletal systems interact with insulin signaling networks to regulate System A activity.

However, its functions and regulation are not yet clearly understood. In this study, we constructed an adenovirus vector carrying rat HNF-4α cDNA and transfected the adenovirus to human hepatoma cells, HuH-7, to enforce expression of the exogenous HNF-4α gene. We analyzed HNF-4α-induced genes using cDNA microarray technology, which included over 9000 genes. As a result, 62 genes showed a greater than 2.0-fold change in expression level after the viral transfection. Fifty-six genes were consistently induced by HNF-4α overexpression, and six genes were repressed. To assess HNF-4α function, we attempted to classify the genes, which had been classified by their encoding protein functions in a previous report. We could classify 45 genes. The rest of the HNF-4α-sensitive genes were unclassified (4 genes) or not identified (13 genes). Among the classified genes, almost half of the induced genes (26 of 40) were related to metabolism genes and particularly to lipid metabolism-related genes. This cDNA microarray analysis showed that HNF-4α is one of the central liver metabolism regulators.

In this study, we constructed an adenovirus vector carrying rat HNF-4α cDNA and transfected the adenovirus to human hepatoma cells, HuH-7, to enforce expression of the exogenous HNF-4α gene. We analyzed HNF-4α-induced genes using cDNA microarray technology, which included over 9000 genes. As a result, 62 genes showed a greater than 2.0-fold change in expression level after the viral transfection. Fifty-six genes were consistently induced by HNF-4α overexpression, and six genes were repressed. To assess HNF-4α function, we attempted to classify the genes, which had been classified by their encoding protein functions in a previous report. We could classify 45 genes. The rest of the HNF-4α-sensitive genes were unclassified (4 genes) or not identified (13 genes). Among the classified genes, almost half of the induced genes (26 of 40) were related to metabolism genes and particularly to lipid metabolism-related genes. This cDNA microarray analysis showed that HNF-4α is one of the central liver metabolism regulators. Differentiation of mammalian cells is associated with changes in gene expression that are primarily controlled at the level of transcription. Tissue-specific gene transcription is regulated based on the recognition of cis-elements of the target genes, accomplished by transcription factors that have restricted tissue distributions. Transcription factors that control embryonic cell differentiation are often required to maintain and regulate gene expression in the adult cell. Liver-specific gene expression is governed by the combinatorial action of a small set of liver-enriched transcription factors as follows: hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1), 1The abbreviations used are: HNFhepatocyte nuclear factorC/EBPCCAAT/enhancer-binding proteinTTRtransthyretinApoapolipoproteinm.o.i.multiplicity of infectionX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranosideESTexpressed sequence tagMODYmaturity onset diabetes of the youngPEPCKphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinasePPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorESTexpressed sequence tagPBSphosphate-buffered salinea member of the POU homeobox gene family (1.Frain M.

Prezioso V.R. Smith E. Litvin O. Costa R.H. Darnell J.E. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1427-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Although many of these factors have been shown to be important components of the differentiation process that culminates in the fully functional liver, the manner in which different members of these families participate in the determination of cell phenotypes is poorly understood. hepatocyte nuclear factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein transthyretin apolipoprotein multiplicity of infection 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside expressed sequence tag maturity onset diabetes of the young phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor expressed sequence tag phosphate-buffered saline Dedifferentiated hepatoma variants (7.Späth G.F.

We have demonstrated that when hepatocytes are plated onto a model basement membrane, such as that derived from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) gel, they retain their normal cell polarity and liver-specific gene expression by up-regulation of hepatic transcription factors, namely by HNF-1 and HNF-4 expression (9.Nagaki M. Shidoji Y. Yamada Y. Sugiyama A. Tanaka M. Akaike T. Ohnishi H. Moriwaki H. Muto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 38-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results strongly imply that among the liver-enriched transcription factors, HNF-1 and HNF-4, play a crucial role in the determination and maintenance of hepatocyte-specific differentiation status. HNF-4 is expressed at the earliest stage in the developing hepatic diverticulum (10.Duncan S.A. Manova K. Chen W.S. Hoodless P. Weinstein D.C. Bachvarova R.F. Darnell J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7598-7602Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This expression of HNF-4 early in the genesis of the hepatic lineage precedes that of HNF-1, which has also been implicated in the regulation of liver gene expression (11.Cereghini S. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Importantly, HNF-4 is a positive regulator and activator of HNF-1 expression (12.Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). A series of independent findings has contributed to the idea that HNF-4 may act the furthest upstream, as a master gene in a transcription factor cascade that could drive the differentiation of hepatic lineage. In this study, to address the question of which genes are influenced by HNF-4α gene overexpression, we used cDNA microarray technology. Recent technological advances in the production of cDNA microarrays have made it possible to profile the gene expressions of tens of thousands of genes (13.Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T. Lee J.C. Trent J.M. Staudt L.M. Hudson J. Boguski M.S. Lashkari D. Shalon D. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Science. 1999; 283: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar, 14.Brown P.O. Botstein D. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (2025) Google Scholar). We used over 9000 human cDNAs printed onto microarrays and analyzed for an expression profile of HNF-4α-overexpressed cells in comparison with that induced by the adenovirus-mediated lacZ gene as a virus control. Of 9182 genes, we identified 62 genes that reached a greater than 2.0-fold increase or decrease in expression level after the HNF-4α transfection. Fifty-six genes were induced by HNF-4α overexpression, and six genes were repressed. This profiling analysis of the expression level of genes offers useful information in great quantity. For organizational purposes, we adapted a previous functional classification (15.Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fleischmann R.D. Fuldner R.A. Bult C.J. Lee N.H. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Gocayne J.D. White O. Sutton G. Blake J.A. Brandon R.C. Chin M.U. Clayton R.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 377 Suppl. 6547: 3-174Google Scholar) to profile the genes based on their encoding protein functions. A human hepatoma cell line, HuH-7, and a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Tokyo, Japan) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen), 12.5 mm HEPES buffer (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2% lactoalbumin (Sigma-Aldrich) or with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 12.5 mm HEPES buffer, respectively. A monkey renal blastocyte cell line, COS-7, and human uterus cervical cancer cell line, HeLa, obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 12.5 mm HEPES buffer. 2.0 × 107 cells were subcultured overnight in a 150-mm dish. A recombinant adenovirus vector carrying rat HNF-4α2 cDNA was constructed according to previously reported protocols (16.Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA encoding a full-length HNF-4α2 was inserted into the SwaI site of the cosmid vector pAxCAwt. The construct was co-transfected with EcoT221-digested Ad5-dIX DNA-tagged viral terminal protein into 293 cells from a human embryonic kidney cell line. The recombinant adenovirus (AdCAGHNF4) was grown in 293 cells, purified, and titrated according to the conventional protocols (16.Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus vector, AdCAGLacZ, bearing the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase gene was obtained from the Riken Gene Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). After plating overnight, the medium was changed, and the cells were infected with purified recombinant adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 10 for 1 h. Determination oflacZ gene expression was carried out according to the method described by Miyake et al. (16.Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). In brief, the fixed cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated in a reaction mixture containing 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml X-gal in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, and then washed three times with PBS. 2.0 × 107 HuH-7 cells were inoculated into a 150-mm dish and cultured overnight. The cells were infected with AdCAGHNF4 or AdCAGLacZ as a control at 10 m.o.i. for 1 h. Forty-eight h after the culture medium was replaced with fresh RPMI 1640 medium, the cells were washed twice with PBS, and total RNA was isolated from the AdCAGHNF4- and AdCAGLacZ-treated cells using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) RNA was purified using an Oligotex-dT30 mRNA purification kit (Takara, Osaka, Japan). One μg of highly purified poly(A) RNA from the AdCAGHNF4- and AdCAGLacZ-treated cells was sent out for cDNA microarray analysis, including generation of cDNA, fluorescent labeling, and hybridization on the microarray glass, to Incyte Genomics (Human UniGEM V, version 2.0 microarray, Palo Alto, CA). In brief, isolated mRNA is reverse-transcribed with 5′-Cy3- or Cy5-labeled random 9-mers (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda, CA). The paired reactions were combined and purified with a TE-30 column (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The fluorescently labeled probe was then applied to the array for hybridization at 60 °C for 6.5 h. After hybridization, the glass was washed with buffer at decreasing ionic strength. The microarray was scanned at a resolution of 10 microns in order to detect Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence. After scanning the signal, Incyte GEMtoolsTM software (Incyte Genomics) was used for image analysis. The area surrounding each element image was used to calculate a local background, which was then subtracted from the total element signal. Background-subtracted element signals are used to calculate Cy3:Cy5 ratios. The average of the resulting total Cy3 and Cy5 signal gives a ratio that is used to balance or normalize the signals. Total RNA (10–40 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to positively charged nylon membranes, GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were hybridized with cDNA probes for human HNF-4α, HNF-1, ApoAI, ApoCIII, albumin, and TTR, each of which was created by the PCR method using a digoxigenin luminescent labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Scanning densitometry and signal intensity quantification were performed on an NIH Image program (version 1.61, developed at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The cellular levels of the transcripts were normalized by 28 S ribosomal RNA and shown as a fold of control values in the same experiment. Western blot analyses of HNF-4α and HNF-1α were performed according to the method described previously, with some modifications (17.Nishiwaki R. Ohta T. Sueoka E. Suganuma M. Harada K. Watanabe M.F. Fujiki H. Cancer Lett. 1994; 83: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, infected cells were rinsed twice with PBS, and protein preparation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Protein concentration in homogenates was measured using a DC-protein assay (Bio-Rad) employing bovine serum albumin as the standard. The extracted proteins (20 μg) were subjected to 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions and then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Goat polyclonal anti-human HNF-4α and rabbit polyclonal anti-human HNF-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz; final dilution 1:200–1000) were used as the primary antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-goat immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz; final dilution 1:1500) or horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham Biosciences; final dilution 1:1500) was used as the secondary reagent. Detection was performed using an ECL system (Amersham Biosciences), and the data were processed on an NIH Image program to measure the signal intensity. To determine the viral infection in hepatoma cells, we first assessed the expression of β-galactosidase in the cells infected by the control adenovirus, AdCAGLacZ (Fig. 1B). AdCAGLacZ infection at 10 m.o.i. induced β-galactosidase expression in 60–70% of the HuH-7 cells. Other cell lines also expressed β-galactosidase to the same extent after AdCAGLacZ infection (data not shown). Phase-contrast photomicrographs revealed no apparent changes in cell shape in HuH-7 cells transfected at 10 m.o.i. by AdCAGLacZ (data not shown) or AdCAGHNF4 (Fig. 1D) over a 48-h culture period. Forty-eight h after infection with AdCAGHNF4, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that lines of hepatoma-derived cells, HuH-7 and HepG2, and non-hepatocyte-derived cells, COS-7 and HeLa, showed increases in expression of HNF-4α mRNA (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis constitutively detected the endogenous HNF-4α in HuH-7 and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3). AdCAGHNF4 infection increased the expression of HNF-4α protein in these cells. In COS-7 and HeLa cells, HNF-4α was detected after infection with AdCAGHNF4.Figure 3Western blot analysis of HNF-4α and HNF-1 in hepatocyte- and non-hepatocyte-derived cell lines. Extracted protein were prepared from each cell line 48 h after infection with the indicated adenovirus at 10 or 50 m.o.i. and were then electrophoresed and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were labeled with anti- HNF-4α and -HNF-1 antibodies. 54-kDa HNF-4α proteins were derived from full-length HNF-4α cDNA. The hybridization signals were quantified using the NIH Image program.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 267-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 12.Kuo C.J. Conley P.B. Chen L. Sladek F.M. Darnell J.E. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The expression of HNF-1 and of various direct target genes of HNF-4 was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the intracellular levels of HNF-1, ApoAI, and ApoCIII mRNA were increased in the AdCAGHNF4-targeted hepatoma cells. On the other hand, the lacZ gene transfection failed to increase these transcripts. The results also showed that HNF-4α overexpressed by AdCAGHNF4 functioned well and could induce the liver-specific genes,ApoAI and ApoCIII. HNF-4α overexpression did not append the liver phenotype to that of nonhepatic cells (Fig. 2A). Further, HNF-4α overexpression failed to increase albumin and TTR mRNA, which are the targeted genes of HNF-1 and/or HNF-4. The human hepatoma-derived cell line, HuH-7, was infected by AdCAGHNF4 or AdCAGLacZ for 1 h. Forty-eight h later, a total of 600 ng of each purified poly(A) RNA from these cells were subjected to reverse transcription reaction, and the resultant cDNAs were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5 fluorescence and then hybridized to the UniGEM Human V version 2.0 microarray containing 9182 sequence-verified human genes (analysis was performed by Incyte Genomics). These fluorescent cDNAs were simultaneously hybridized to probe sequences on the microarray, and the amount of fluorescence seen with the individual dyes was determined by confocal microscopy. The differential expression of each expressed sequence tag (EST) was then calculated from the relative intensity of the Cy3 versus Cy5 fluorescent signal. Three independent transfection experiments were conducted comparing AdCAGHNF4- and AdCAGLacZ- infected cells. Duplicate experiments were conducted on a single mRNA preparation from the cells. Recently, it has been reported that the coefficient of variation of the Incyte cDNA microarray technology platform for differential expression is 12% across the entire signal range (18.Yue H. Eastman P.S. Wang B.B. Minor J. Doctolero M.H. Nuttall R.L. Stack R. Becker J.W. Montgomery J.R. Vainer M. Johnston R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E41Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In the present study, about 80% of the top 50 genes identified by the first cDNA microarray experiment were also changed by more than 2.0-fold in the second analysis using the same mRNA (data not shown). There was slightly greater mRNA variation at the low signal levels. Fig. 4 shows the plots of the differential expression of the 9182 genes in these three experiments. Overall, the expression of most genes was not altered by HNF-4α. Based on the observation that the expression level of a few genes changed by more than 2.0-fold between the control and the treated samples, we applied a threshold of a 2.0-fold change in expression level between AdHNF4- and AdLacZ-infected cells. As shown in Table I, in this analysis we identified 62 genes that were expressed at different levels with more than a 2.0-fold change. A total of 61 genes were identified as unique and were named in the GenBankTM, and the remaining single gene was identified as an unnamed EST in the GenBankTM. Of these 62 HNF-4α responsive genes, 56 genes (55 known genes and one unnamed EST) were up-regulated. The remaining six genes were down-regulated, and all were named in the GenBankTM.Table IGenes in which expression was altered more than 2-foldGenBank™ IDGene nameAverageRatio 1Ratio 2Ratio 3CategorySubcategoryGenes up-regulated by HNF-4α 1AI433969Cysteine-rich protein 1 (intestinal)8.411.04.59.8MetabolismTransport 2NM0021504-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase7.95.95.312.4MetabolismAmino acid 3AL035541Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (soluble)5.36.03.36.5MetabolismSugar 4X02619Apolipoprotein A-II5.07.94.52.6MetabolismLipid 5AA385242HtrA-like serine protease4.75.93.94.2NF1-aNF, not found in this list. 6AI858956Apolipoprotein M4.55.33.84.5MetabolismLipid 7NM005651Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase4.33.53.26.3MetabolismAmino acid 8AI654712Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α4.22.74.05.9NF 9L07597Ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90 kD, polypeptide 14.13.63.05.8Gene/protein expressionRibosomal protein10NM000041Apolipoprotein E4.04.93.73.5MetabolismLipid11AW247252Nucleoside phosphorylase4.04.33.24.5MetabolismNucleotide12M34276Plasminogen3.93.92.75.2Gene/protein expressionProtein turnover13NM000040Apolipoprotein C-III3.64.12.93.7MetabolismLipid14AI079558ESTs3.23.13.03.5NF15AA481712Protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I, β subunit3.23.02.73.9MetabolismLipid16L26165Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1)3.13.12.43.8Cell divisionCell cycle17AL037120Peptidase D3.03.23.12.8MetabolismAmino acid18AW362087Major histocompatibility complex, class I, C3.03.23.12.7Cell/organism defenseImmunology19U42408Ladinin 12.93.02.82.8NF20AW161042Biliverdin reductase B2.92.92.73.0MetabolismLipid21X06290Lipoprotein, Lp(a)2.83.23.32.0MetabolismLipid22AB002405Expressed in activated T/LAK lymphocytes2.83.62.42.5NF23NM000019Acetyl-coenzyme A acetyltransferase 12.72.93.12.2MetabolismLipid24AW188221Testis enhanced gene transcript (BAX inhibitor 1)2.72.92.62.7NF25AA789250Cyclin-dependent kinase 22.72.73.12.4Cell divisionCell cycle26L07548Aminoacylase 12.72.32.43.3MetabolismAmino acid27AA993248Apolipoprotein A-I2.72.43.02.6MetabolismLipid28AA779691Carnitine/acylcarnitine translocase2.63.32.52.1MetabolismLipid29AI635252N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase2.62.83.02.1NF30L25275Sulfotransferase family 1A, phenol-preferring, member 32.62.72.03.2MetabolismLipid31NM000235Lipase A, lysosomal acid, cholesterol esterase2.62.13.02.7MetabolismLipid32AF023676Transmembrane 7 superfamily member 22.62.02.73.1NF33S69232Electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase2.62.43.12.2MetabolismEnergy34NM003645Fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase, very long-chain 12.62.82.42.5MetabolismLipid35NM000781Cytochrome P450, subfamily XIA (cholesterol side chain cleavage)2.53.52.02.1Cell/organism defenseHomeostasis36AI913006Cathepsin Z2.53.52.12.0Gene/protein expressionProtein turnover37U29057Major histocompatibility complex, class I, B2.52.32.13.2Cell/organism defenseImmunology38AF055066HLA-G histocompatibility antigen, class I, G2.52.52.32.6Cell/organism defenseImmunology39AW161773Wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 112.52.32.52.6NF40AB002405Expressed in activated T/LAK lymphocytes2.42.62.22.5NF41AL120395Interferon, γ-inducible protein 302.42.52.52.1Unclassified42AI801227Nuclear receptor subfamily 0, group B, member 22.42.52.22.4NF43AA523002Phosphorylase, glycogen; liver2.42.22.52.4MetabolismSugar44AI860222Solute carrier family 25 (mitochondrial carrier; citrate transporter), member 12.32.32.22.5MetabolismTransport45M80899AHNAK nucleoprotein (desmoyokin)2.32.02.62.4Unclassified46NM005036Peroxisome proliferative-activated receptor α2.32.12.22.6Unclassified47NM002744Protein kinase C ζ2.32.32.22.4Signaling/communicationProtein modifications48AA613978Complement component 4A2.32.72.12.0Cell/organism defenseHomeostasis49AI051578Apolipoprotein C-I2.32.52.32.0MetabolismLipid50AB006780Lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 3 (galectin 3)2.32.12.22.5Unclassified51D10040Fatty-acid-coenzyme A ligase, long-chain 22.22.32.32.1MetabolismLipid52NM001908Cathepsin B2.22.32.12.2Gene/protein expressionProtein turnover53U35464α-1 antitrypsin2.22.12.42.0Gene/protein expressionProtein turnover54AW327720Bet1 (S. cerevisiae) homolog2.12.02.32.1NF55Y09763γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor ε2.12.02.22.0Signaling/communicationReceptor56NM000755Carnitine acetyltransferase2.02.02.12.0MetabolismLipidGenes down-regulated by HNF-4α 1M64982Fibrinogen, A α polypeptide3.02.82.63.5Cell structure/motilityExtracellular matrix 2AF038197KIAA1051 protein2.92.52.14.1NF 3X68733α-1-antichymotrypsin2.82.12.04.4Gene/protein expressionProtein turnover 4NM004490Growth factor receptor-bound protein 142.62.72.03.2Signaling/communicationEffector 5AA700884Glutathione peroxidase 2 (gastrointestinal)2.62.52.23.0Cell/organism defenseHomeostasis 6AI928978Ubiquitin C-terminal esterase L1 (ubiquitin thiolesterase)2.52.92.02.7Gene/protein expressionPost-translational modifications1-a NF, not found in this list.

In our cDNA microarray study, these expressions were induced in HuH-7 cells by HNF-4α, and the results were confirmed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Besides ApoAI and ApoCIII, most of the apolipoproteins, including ApoAII, ApoE, ApoCI, and lipoprotein(a), were induced by HNF-4α (Table I). A mutation in HNF-4α can cause a form of early onset type 2 diabetes (maturity onset diabetes of the young, MODY1) (20.Yamagata K. Furuta H. Oda N. Kaisaki P.J. Menzel S. Cox N.J. Fajans S.S.

A study addressing the relationship between HNF-4α and cysteine-rich intestinal protein-1 has not, to our knowledge, been reported previously. This gene belongs to the LIM/double zinc finger protein family and is suggested to be important for cellular zinc transport (21.Hempe J.M. Cousins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9671-9674Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Low zinc absorption has been observed in diabetic animals and humans (22.DiSilvestro R.A. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1509S-1511SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), and zinc plays a clear role in the synthesis, storage, and secretion of insulin (23.Chausmer A.B. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1998; 17: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis, was induced by HNF-4α in our microarray analysis. This enzyme is highly induced in the diabetic animal model as compensation for lack of insulin function (24.Rajas F. Croset M. Zitoun C. Montano S. Mithieux G. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1165-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The HNF-1α binding site was found to be located in the promoter region of PEPCK (25.Yanuka-Kashles O. Cohen H. Trus M. Aran A. Benvenisty N. Reshef L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7124-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study has revealed that HNF-4α can bind the enhancer/promoter region of PEPCK directly (26.Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. Sugiyama T. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 604-618PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that in addition to HNF-1α, HNF-4α might be a major transcription factor of the PEPCK gene. We could not show the expression change of HNF-1α after overexpression of HNF-4α by cDNA microarray analysis because the former was not included in this microarray analysis. However, we did show that HNF-4α induced HNF-1 in HuH-7 cells by Northern and Western blot analysis (Figs. 2 and 3). Some genes associated with the intracellular signaling pathway, such as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21, protein kinase C, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, were induced by HNF-4α overexpression (Table I). Many of the genes that displayed differential expression encode proteins with known functions, but others, including novel and previously identified ESTs, correspond to genes with unknown functions. Genes were classified on the basis of the biological function of the encoded protein, using a modified version of a previously established classification scheme (15.Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R.

TheXrcc2 and Rad51D/Rad51L3 genes, whose products interact with each other, have essential roles in ensuring normal embryonic development.

Chromosomal DNA is vulnerable to attacks from the environment and sustains multiple types of damage, including the double strand break (DSB), 1The abbreviations used are: DSBdouble strand breakHRRhomologous recombinational repairssDNAsingle-stranded DNAdsDNAdouble-stranded DNANi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidBSAbovine serum albuminwhich is a lethal DNA lesion for cells if it is not repaired. Homologous recombinational repair (HRR) is one of the major pathways for the repair of DSBs. When cells are defective in HRR, unrepaired DSBs accumulate in chromosomes (1.Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S.

U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In homologous pairing, RecA binds the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) produced at DSB sites and forms nucleoprotein filaments. Then, the nucleoprotein filaments bind double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and form a three-component complex that includes ssDNA, dsDNA, and RecA. In the three-component complex, the homology between ssDNA and dsDNA is searched, and joint molecules, in which the ssDNA invades into the homologous region of the dsDNA, are formed as products of homologous pairing. In eukaryotes, the Rad51 protein has been identified as a homologue of RecA (4.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Ogawa T. Cell. 1992; 69: 457-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The Rad51 protein, which is conserved from yeast to human (5.Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Matsuda Y. Ushio N. Ikeo K. Ogawa T. Nat.

Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), which interacts with the S. cerevisiae Rad57 protein (30.Hays S.L. Firmenich A.A. Berg P. Proc.

Interestingly, the Xrcc2 knock-out mice exhibited embryonic lethality associated especially with a high frequency of apoptotic death of neurons in the developing brain (33.Deans B. Griffin C.S. Maconochie M. Thacker J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6675-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Xrcc2 interacts with the human Rad51D/Rad51L3 protein (Rad51D), another Rad51 paralog (34.Braybrooke J.P. Spink K.G. Thacker J. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29100-29106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 35.Schild D. Lio Y. Collins D.W. Tsomondo T. Chen D.J. J. Biol.

Genesis. 2000; 26: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), indicating that both Xrcc2 and Rad51D are essential for embryonic development. In the present study, we purified the Xrcc2·Rad51D complex and characterized it biochemically. The purified Xrcc2·Rad51D complex catalyzed homologous pairing between ssDNA and dsDNA, similar to that of the Xrcc3·Rad51C complex. The Xrcc2·Rad51D complex formed a multimeric ring structure in the absence of DNA and formed nucleoprotein filaments in the presence of ssDNA. These biochemical characteristics of Xrcc2·Rad51D are consistent with the idea that these proteins act in an early step of the HRR pathway. The Xrcc2 and Rad51D genes were cloned from human brain cDNA (purchased from CLONTECH) by PCR. The overexpression plasmid for Xrcc2 and Rad51D was introduced into E. coli JM109(DE3) cells with the plasmid containing the genes for E. coli tRNA Arg-3 and tRNA Arg-4, which recognize the CGG and AGA/AGG codons, respectively. The cells were grown in 10 liters of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 30 °C for 10 h, and then 200 μm isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce protein expression. Xrcc2 and Rad51D were produced for 12 h at 18 °C in the presence of isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cells were harvested. Both Xrcc2 and Rad51D contain a His6 tag at the N terminus. The cells producing Xrcc2 and Rad51D were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.5) and 0.5m NaCl and were disrupted by sonication. The samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 30,000 × g, and the supernatants were incubated with 4 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. Then, the Xrcc2 and Rad51D-bound resin was packed into a column and washed with 300 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 30 mm imidazole, and 0.5m NaCl. Subsequently, the resin was washed with 150 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 30 mm imidazole. Xrcc2 and Rad51D were eluted by a gradient of imidazole from 30 to 400 mm in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The samples eluted from the Ni-NTA column were applied to a Mono-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The proteins were eluted by a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 1200 mm and were dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Xrcc2 and Rad51D were further purified by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200HR resin (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard protein. High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides (120 mer) for the D-loop formation assay were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The nucleotide sequences are as follows: 5′-ATTTC TTCAT TTCAT GCTAG ACAGA AGAAT TCTCA GTAAC TTCTT TGTGC TGTGT GTATT CAACT CACAG AGTGG AACGT CCCTT TGCAC AGAGC AGATT TGAAA CACTC TTTTT GTAGT-3′ and were derived from a clone of human α-satellite DNA. The 5′ ends of the oligonucleotides were labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. To avoid irreversible denaturation of the dsDNA, we prepared plasmid DNA without any treatment that would potentially cause denaturation, such as alkaline treatment. The plasmid DNA (pGsat4; 3216 base pairs) containing the human α-satellite sequence was introduced into theE. coli DH5α strain, and the cells were cultured for 12 to 16 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested, mildly disrupted with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme and 0.1% sarkosyl, and centrifuged at 28,000 rpm for 1 h. The supernatant containing the pGsat4 plasmid DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform three times, and the pGsat4 DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated by ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) and treated with 0.15 mg/ml RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. The pGsat4 DNA was purified by a 5–20% sucrose gradient centrifugation at 24,000 rpm for 18 h. DNA concentrations are expressed in moles of nucleotides. TheE. coli cells (JM109) containing pGsat4 DNA were cultured in LB medium until an A660 of 0.3 was achieved and were infected with the helper phage R408 at a multiplicity of infection of ∼20. After infection, the cells were continuously cultured for 6 h with vigorous agitation. Then, the supernatant was harvested and treated with DNase I (10 unit/ml) and RNase A (10 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. The phage containing pGsat4 ssDNA was precipitated by adding 0.25 volume of phage precipitation solution containing 3.75m ammonium acetate (pH 7.5) and 20% polyethylene glycol 8000. The resulting pellet was resuspended with TE buffer, and the pGsat4 ssDNA was extracted by chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) followed by phenol:chloroform saturated with TE buffer. After several phenol:chloroform extractions, the aqueous phase was extracted by chloroform, and the pGsat4 ssDNA was precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 3.25 m ammonium acetate. The resulting pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol and dried under vacuum. The pGsat4 ssDNA was dissolved in H2O; its concentration is expressed in moles of nucleotides. Single-stranded pGsat4 DNA (30 μm) was mixed with Xrcc2·Rad51D in 10 μl of standard reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 3% glycerol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then analyzed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Superhelical pGsat4 DNA (18 μm, 3216 base pairs) was mixed with Xrcc2·Rad51D in 10 μl of standard reaction buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.1), 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 12 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 2 mm MgCl2, and 6% glycerol. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the samples were electrophoresed on an 0.8% agarose gel for 4 h at 3 V/cm in 0.5× TBE buffer. The bands were visualized by ethidium bromide staining. A32P-labeled single-stranded 120 mer oligonucleotide (1.8 μm) was mixed with Xrcc2·Rad51D (2 μm) in 10 μl of standard reaction buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 12 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 2 mmMgCl2. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of pGsat4 form I DNA (20 μm). After an incubation at 37 °C for the indicated time, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the proteins were removed from the DNA by treatment with proteinase K (700 μg/ml) followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. The products of homologous pairing (D-loops) were separated from the unreacted DNA substrates by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer. The amount of labeled ssDNA fragments incorporated into the D-loops was quantified with a Fuji BAS2500 image analyzer. The reactions were conducted with a 4.8-fold excess amount of ssDNA (molecule). In the experiments with RecA, a 32P-labeled single-stranded 120 mer oligonucleotide (1.8 μm) was mixed with RecA (2 μm) in 10 μl of standard reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml BSA, 12 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 10 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by the addition of pGsat4 form I DNA (20 μm). After an incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction was terminated, and the products were separated from the unreacted DNA substrates by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer. The amount of labeled ssDNA fragments incorporated into the D-loops was quantified with a Fuji BAS2500 image analyzer. Xrcc2·Rad51D or HsRad51 (1–2 μm) was incubated with or without circular ssDNA (φX174; 10 μm) or nicked circular dsDNA (φX174; 10 μm) in buffer, containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mmMgCl2, in the presence or absence of 2 mm ATP. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and were adsorbed onto a freshly glow-discharged carbon-coated grid. The proteins or the protein-DNA complexes were visualized by negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate. Several splicing variants of Rad51D have been reported in human cells (18.Kawabata M. Saeki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To identify the Rad51D transcript that interacts with Xrcc2, we performed two-hybrid screening with the human brain cDNA library. Two Rad51D clones that positively interact with Xrcc2 were obtained. Both Rad51D clones encode a protein consisting of 328 amino acid residues, which is identical to HsR51H3 (Rad51D/Rad51L3) (16.Cartwright R. Dunn A.M. Simpson P.J. Tambini C.E. Thacker J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1653-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We coexpressed Xrcc2 and Rad51D in the E. coli recA− JM109(DE3) strain as N-terminal His6-tagged (20 amino acid residues) proteins. It has been reported that chicken DT40 cells lacking either the Xrcc2 or Rad51D gene were extremely sensitive to cisplatinum, which induced intra- and interstrand DNA cross-inks (28.Takata M.

As shown in Fig. 1, Band C, the His6-tagged Xrcc2 and Rad51D proteins fully complemented the cisplatinum-sensitive phenotypes in theXrcc2−/− and Rad51D−/− chicken DT40 cells, respectively (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that the His6 tag did not affect the functions of these proteins. After coexpression, both Xrcc2 and Rad51D were detected in the soluble fraction and were coeluted from the Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). The Xrcc2 and Rad51D proteins were further copurified by Mono-Q (Amersham Biosciences) column chromatography and Superdex 200HR gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) (Fig. 1A, lane 2). These results indicate that Xrcc2 and Rad51D form a complex. Endonuclease and exonuclease activities were not detected in the Xrcc2·Rad51D fractions with superhelical and linearized dsDNAs as substrates (data not shown). We have previously reported that the Xrcc3·Rad51C complex catalyzes homologous pairing between a single-stranded oligonucleotide and a superhelical dsDNA by the D-loop formation assay, which is a standard assay for homologous pairing by RecA (10.Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5538-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the Xrcc2·Rad51D complex also catalyzes homologous pairing. The superhelical dsDNA used in this assay was prepared by a method without alkali treatment to avoid irreversible denaturation of the double helix of the dsDNA (37.Shibata T. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7557-7564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homologous pairing by Xrcc2·Rad51D was an ATP-independent reaction (Fig. 2A, lane 7), like those catalyzed by Xrcc3·Rad51C (10.Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12274-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and was detected only with a homologous combination of ssDNA and dsDNA but not with a heterologous combination or with BSA instead of Xrcc2·Rad51D (Fig. 2, A,lane 6, and B, lane 1). The migration distance of the D-loop formed by Xrcc2·Rad51D was exactly the same as that of the control D-loop formed by RecA (Fig. 2B,lanes 3 and 4). These data clearly show that the products formed by Xrcc2·Rad51D were authentic D-loops. A low MgCl2 condition (2 mm) was preferred in the homologous pairing promoted by Xrcc2·Rad51D as compared with a high MgCl2 condition (10 mm) (Fig. 2B,lanes 4 and 5), and the activity observed with the low MgCl2 condition was about 20% of that observed with RecA at its optimum MgCl2 condition (10 mm) (Fig. 2C). In the Superdex 200HR gel filtration chromatography, Xrcc2·Rad51D was eluted near the void volume, and no proteins were detected in the fractions corresponding to the molecular size (71 kDa) of the Xrcc2·Rad51D heterodimers (Fig. 3). This result indicates that Xrcc2·Rad51D exists as a multimer rather than a heterodimer. Therefore, we analyzed the structure of the Xrcc2·Rad51D multimer by electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, Xrcc2·Rad51D formed multimeric ring structures (Fig. 4, A–E). The ring structure formed by Xrcc2·Rad51D is similar to that of HsRad52 in its size and shape (39.Kagawa W.

Xrcc2·Rad51D bound both ssDNA and dsDNA (Fig. 5, A and B). Although significant amounts of ssDNA and dsDNA were still bound to Xrcc2·Rad51D in the absence of ATP, agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that the migration distances of the complexes between Xrcc2·Rad51D and DNA were drastically changed by the addition of ATP (Fig. 5, A, lane 5, and B, lane 5). These results suggest that less Xrcc2·Rad51D bound to ssDNA in the absence of ATP. Both Xrcc2 and Rad51D have an ATP-binding motif. It has been reported that disruptions of the ATP-binding motif of Xrcc2 did not affect the complementation of the phenotypes of the Xrcc2-deficient cell line, irs1 (42.O'Regan P. Wilson C. Townsend S. Thacker J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22148-22153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ATP may be important in regulating the DNA binding of Rad51D or may bind different sites from the ATP-binding motifs of Xrcc2 and Rad51D. Further studies are required to elucidate the roles of ATP binding by Xrcc2·Rad51D. In the absence of DNA, Xrcc2·Rad51D formed a multimeric ring structure (Fig. 4), and no filamentous structure was observed. However, an electron microscopic analysis showed that Xrcc2·Rad51D formed filamentous structures in the presence of ssDNA (Fig. 6A). To compare the Xrcc2·Rad51D filament with the HsRad51 filament, we visualized the HsRad51·ssDNA complex under the same conditions (Fig. 6B) used for the Xrcc2·Rad51D filament observation. As shown in Fig. 6B, HsRad51 formed short nucleoprotein filaments with ssDNA, but the length of the filaments were shorter than that of the Xrcc2·Rad51D filament, which fully covered circular ssDNA (Fig. 6A). The ssDNA circle (5386 bases) covered with Xrcc2·Rad51D was significantly smaller than the same length of the dsDNA circle (5386 base pairs) covered by HsRad51 (Fig. 6, Aand C). Thus, the DNA bound to Xrcc2·Rad51D may be packaged differently from that bound to HsRad51, possibly wrapping around the Xrcc2·Rad51D ring as in the case of HsRad52 (43.Parsons C.A. Baumann P. Van Dyck E. West S.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4175-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although both HsRad51 and Xrcc2·Rad51D formed filamentous complexes in the presence of ssDNA, the appearance of those filaments was different. HsRad51 formed a nucleoprotein filament, which was clearly helical in appearance (Fig. 6, B and C). This helical filament is strikingly similar to that of RecA (44.Flory J. Tsang S.S. Muniyappa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7026-7030Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the filaments formed by Xrcc2·Rad51D did not have a RecA-like helical appearance (Fig. 6A) and interestingly, did have significant similarities with those formed by Xrcc3·Rad51C (10.Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K. Kagawa W. Takata M. Takeda S. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5538-5543Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or HsRad52 (39.Kagawa W.

Both Xrcc2 and Xrcc3are expressed in the brain (12.Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tebbs R.S. Schild D. Tucker J. Shen M.R. Brookman K.W. Siciliano M.J. Walter C.A. Fan W. Narayana L.S. Zhou Z. Adamson A.W.

Genet. 1993; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our present and previous two-hybrid analyses have shown that Xrcc2 and Xrcc3 interact with Rad51D and Rad51C, respectively, in the human brain cDNA library (10.Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K.

These facts suggest that Xrcc2·Rad51D and Xrcc3·Rad51C may have a specific function in the brain. In nondividing neuronal cells, the homologous chromosomes, not the sister chromatids, must be the templates for homologous pairing, because the cells are arrested before DNA synthesis (the G0 phase). Xrcc2·Rad51D and Xrcc3·Rad51C may have a preference for homologous pairing between homologous chromosomes rather than sister chromatids. Both Xrcc2 and Xrcc3 are required independently for HRR in mammalian cells, because no other proteins can complement their mutant phenotypes. These facts suggest that Xrcc2· Rad51D and Xrcc3·Rad51C are functionally similar but have different roles in the HRR pathway. Schild et al. (35.Schild D. Lio Y. Collins D.W. Tsomondo T. Chen D.J. J.

This interaction may function to form a multiprotein complex containing all four proteins onto the DSB site. Recently, it was reported that Xrcc2·Rad51D interacts with Rad51B and Rad51C, forming a complex distinct from that of Xrcc3·Rad51C (45.Masson J.-Y. Tarsounas M.C. Stasiak A.Z. Stasiak A. Shah R.

Further analyses are required to elucidate the biological significance of these homologous pairing activities in the human system. The Xrcc2, Xrcc3, Rad51C, andRad51D genes are also expressed in dividing cells, where theRad51 expression is observed (12.Liu N. Lamerdin J.E. Tebbs R.S. Schild D. Tucker J. Shen M.R. Brookman K.W.

Interestingly, the mutant cell lines lacking one of the Xrcc2,Xrcc3, Rad51C, and Rad51D genes significantly attenuated the Rad51 assembly on chromosomes after exposure to γ-rays (28.Takata M.

These results suggest that Xrcc2·Rad51D and Xrcc3·Rad51C are assembled on the damaged sites of chromosomes before Rad51 and that they initiate homologous pairing in cooperation with Rad51 in dividing cells. In addition to the similarity between Xrcc2·Rad51D and Xrcc3·Rad51C, we also found significant similarity between Xrcc2·Rad51D and HsRad52, an important protein in the HRR pathway. HsRad52 is known to form a multimeric ring structure similar to that of Xrcc2·Rad51D (41.Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. Van Dyck E. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that HsRad52 also formed nucleoprotein filaments with ssDNA and catalyzed homologous pairing as did Xrcc2·Rad51D and Xrcc3·Rad51C (10.Kurumizaka H. Ikawa S. Nakada M. Eda K.

These results indicate that the characteristics of HsRad52 are similar to those of the Rad51 paralogs, although HsRad52 lacks obvious sequence homology with any of the Rad51 paralogs. The multiple homologous pairing activities may be necessary to support the HRR pathway in human chromosomes, which are more complex than those of bacteria and unicellular organisms such as yeast.

https://openalex.org/W1966847727,"Abstract The human “ether-a-go-go”-related gene (HERG) K+ channel, and its homologues are present in heart, neuronal tissue, some cancer cells, and the MLS-9 rat microglia cell line (Zhou, W., Cayabyab, F. S., Pennefather, P. S., Schlichter, L. C., and DeCoursey, T. E. (1998) J. Gen. Physiol. 111, 781–794). Despite its importance, there are few studies of ERG modulation. In this first report of regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation we show that MLS-9 cells express transcripts for r-erg1 (rat homologue of HERG) and r-erg2, and an immunoreactive doublet was identified using an anti-HERG antibody. The constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of the ERG1 protein, detected by co-immunoprecipitation, was reduced by the protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lavendustin A, herbimycin A, or genistein (but not daidzein). The whole cell ERG current was reduced by protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors or the Src-selective inhibitory peptide, src40–58, but not by a scrambled peptide. Conversely, the current was increased by the Src-activating peptide,srcpY, but not by an inactive analogue. Activating endogenous Src or transfecting constitutively active v-Src altered the voltage dependence and deactivation kinetics to produce more current at negative potentials. Co-immunoprecipitation identified an association between the channel protein and Src. Thus, r-ERG1 and Src tyrosine kinase appear to exist in a signaling complex that is well positioned to modulate this K+ channel and affect its contribution to cellular functions."

Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar). The modular structure of the STAT proteins includes an SH2 domain that engages in a reciprocal phosphotyrosine·SH2 interaction to hold DNA binding dimers together and a DNA binding domain that is separated from the SH2 domain by a linker domain of unknown function (1.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3345) Google Scholar, 2.Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 227-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (3361) Google Scholar).We previously described the failure to stimulate transcription by a mutant in the linker domain of STAT1, STAT1(K544A/E545A) (4.Yang E. Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This mutant protein was normally tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated, accumulated in the nucleus, and bound a high affinity STAT site in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). This mutant also participated normally in transcriptional responses to IFNα, which involves formation of a STAT1:STAT2 heterodimer that cooperates with a third protein, ISGF-2/p48/IRF-7. Yet, STAT1(K544A/E545A) failed to trigger transcriptional activation of either reporter or endogenous genes in response to IFNγ, which requires a STAT1:STAT1 dimer (STAT1 homodimer). Therefore, we concluded that the linker domain might have a role in recruiting transcriptional coactivators to IFNγ-responsive start sites.We have now expanded our analysis of the ability of STAT1(K544A/E545A) to bind DNA. We find that, instead of playing a role in recruiting transcriptional co-activators, the linker mutation affects binding to different STAT1 binding sites to different degrees. By in vitro measurement, the off-rate of the mutant protein is much higher than wild type, which likely determines whether the STAT molecule can activate transcription inside cells. Although it was hypothesized, based on structural analysis of STAT1, that the linker domain might communicate SH2-phosphotyrosine engagement to the DNA binding domain (2.Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), we find that other mutations in the linker domain do not necessarily impair DNA binding. Finally, we show that, despite strong equilibrium binding to certain STAT binding sites, STAT1(K544A/E545A) cannot activate transcription in response and that the phosphorylated mutant protein cannot accumulate on chromatin. From these results, we suggest a time-dependent role of bound STAT molecules in the generation of an effective assembly of proteins to initiate regulated transcription.DISCUSSIONElectrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) have gained widespread acceptance as a measure of protein·DNA interaction (9.Buratwoski S. Chodosh L.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2, Section 12.2. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). However, the limitations of the assay are not widely appreciated: The assay is indirect, and due to the “caging” phenomenon (effectively irreversible protein·DNA association when the two interacting species enter gel pores together during electrophoresis), true binding kinetics become obscured. Both these limitations are clearly demonstrated by the present series of experiments. Although STAT1(K544A/E545A) binds a variety of DNA probes as detected by EMSA, it fails to be detected on genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation. And although the apparent affinity for IRF-1 and m67 binding sites is close to wild type, the mutant exhibits a greatly accelerated off-rate for the interaction with these probes. In fact, the 40-fold increase in off-rate probably also accounts for the failure to detect STAT1(K544A/E545A) accumulation by chromatin precipitation (CHIP). The rate of formaldehyde cross-link formation during the chromatin precipitation procedure is known to be a slow process, occurring over minutes rather than seconds (12.McGhee J.D. Hippel P.H.v. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1281-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13.Dedon P.C. Soults J.A. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The decreased residence time by the STAT1(K544A/E545A) mutant on the IRF-1 promoter may therefore be insufficient to allow for efficient cross-linking. To our knowledge, the STAT1(K544A/E545A) mutant is the first DNA binding factor to demonstrate so severe a discordance between EMSA activity and in vivo binding. However, such studies require cells in which wild type protein is missing so that the function or lack of function of mutant proteins can be examined after permanent introduction.These results are most easily understood by revisiting the familiar equations Kd =koff/kon andkoff = ln2/t1/2 (for STAT●DNA ↔ STAT + DNA) (14.Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn C. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). This means that off-rate and on-rate for STAT·DNA dissociation can both increase while keeping theKd constant. Thus the 40-fold increase inkoff (40-fold decrease in half-life) with a similar Kd for the STAT1(K544A/E545A) dimer suggests that the mutant protein binds and dissociates from DNA more rapidly than wild type protein (i.e. kon andkoff increase). The crystal structure of STAT1 bound to DNA (“pliers grip”) is in accord with this idea, because wild type STAT1 dimers clearly envelope their target DNA sequences (2.Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Given the strong reciprocal phosphotyrosine·SH2 interaction plus the total envelopment of the DNA by the dimer (15.Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai-Huang L.H. Qureshi S. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to infer that STAT1 (possibly STATs in general) may undergo a limited conformational change in binding and dissociating from DNA. Any such conformational change would quite probably involve the linker and/or DNA binding domains. The K544-E545 residues and the linker domain as a whole may assist this process by providing enough flexibility to allow binding but also enough rigidity to ensure a reasonable residence time for STAT1. Although the surface-exposed K544-E545 residues do not appear to have any contact with residues directly involved in DNA binding, local structural perturbations in the linker domain might increase the “flexibility” of the linker domain enough to account for increases in both association and dissociation rates. These perturbations apparently leave intact the residues that contact the phosphate backbone and major groove and that provide the majority of the binding energy between STAT and DNA, because STAT1(K544A/E545A) can still bind GAS sites with affinities in the range of wild type. Although similar findings have been reported for other types of protein interactions (16.Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M.

Although it is still possible that STAT1(K544A/E545A) may have defective co-activator recruitment, there seems little question that the primary defect in this mutant is its abnormal DNA binding kinetics and inability to accumulate on an in vivotemplate. Fusion proteins of Gal4 DNA binding domain and the STAT1 C terminus are active under the same conditions as Fig. 3 (aand b), and the Gal4 DNA binding domain has an off-rate of ∼20–30 min under physiologic conditions. 2T. Kodadek, personal communication. Given that STAT1(K544A/E545A) still bears the C-terminal activation domain, it is not unreasonable to entertain the notion that STAT1(K544A/E545A) would be able to activate transcription were it to reside for a sufficiently long time on a GAS-bearing promoter. Interpreted in this light, transcriptional activation by STAT1 simply takes more time than the residence time of the mutant on DNA (t1/2 = 1 min). In support of this idea, the correlation between a rapid off-rate and transcriptional in effectiveness was observed for both STAT1(N460A) and STAT1(K544A/E545A).Signal-regulated transcription factors have been shown to act over different time scales. On the one hand, CHIP data for estrogen-responsive promoters argues for nearly instantaneous recruitment of RNA polymerase II in response to activator accumulation (17.Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This fact is consistent with estrogen receptor's off-rate of 1–2 min (18.Kim J. Haan G.D. Nardulli A.M. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3173-3180Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and observations of glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding dynamics in vivo, which suggest extremely rapid on/off-rates (19.McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). On the other hand, many activators have been demonstrated to accumulate on chromatin hours before RNA polymerase accumulation and maximal transcription rates (20.Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21.Agalioti T. Lomvardas S. Parekh B. Yie J. Maniatis T. Thanos D. Cell. 2000; 103: 667-678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). This time-lag between activator binding and transcription may suggest a time-dependent accumulation of co-activators and components of the basal transcription machinery. In vitro studies of transcription support this idea, because transcription from the adenovirus major late promoter takes 10–20 min to reach maximal activity in crude extracts (22.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9142) Google Scholar). Although preliminary, our data suggest that STAT1 must reside at transcriptional start sites for a period somewhere between the residence time of mutant and wild type, or 1–40 min. Given the fact that active STAT dimers accumulate in the nucleus within 5 min of ligand activation (8.Haspel R.L. Salditt-Georgieff M. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6262-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), this situation would imply that co-activator assembly is potentially a rate-limiting component of transcription by the STATs.

The modular structure of the STAT proteins includes an SH2 domain that engages in a reciprocal phosphotyrosine·SH2 interaction to hold DNA binding dimers together and a DNA binding domain that is separated from the SH2 domain by a linker domain of unknown function (1.Darnell Jr., J.E.

Wen Z. Haspel R.L. Zhang J.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5106-5112Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This mutant protein was normally tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylated, accumulated in the nucleus, and bound a high affinity STAT site in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). This mutant also participated normally in transcriptional responses to IFNα, which involves formation of a STAT1:STAT2 heterodimer that cooperates with a third protein, ISGF-2/p48/IRF-7. Yet, STAT1(K544A/E545A) failed to trigger transcriptional activation of either reporter or endogenous genes in response to IFNγ, which requires a STAT1:STAT1 dimer (STAT1 homodimer). Therefore, we concluded that the linker domain might have a role in recruiting transcriptional coactivators to IFNγ-responsive start sites. We have now expanded our analysis of the ability of STAT1(K544A/E545A) to bind DNA. We find that, instead of playing a role in recruiting transcriptional co-activators, the linker mutation affects binding to different STAT1 binding sites to different degrees. By in vitro measurement, the off-rate of the mutant protein is much higher than wild type, which likely determines whether the STAT molecule can activate transcription inside cells. Although it was hypothesized, based on structural analysis of STAT1, that the linker domain might communicate SH2-phosphotyrosine engagement to the DNA binding domain (2.Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), we find that other mutations in the linker domain do not necessarily impair DNA binding. Finally, we show that, despite strong equilibrium binding to certain STAT binding sites, STAT1(K544A/E545A) cannot activate transcription in response and that the phosphorylated mutant protein cannot accumulate on chromatin. From these results, we suggest a time-dependent role of bound STAT molecules in the generation of an effective assembly of proteins to initiate regulated transcription. DISCUSSIONElectrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) have gained widespread acceptance as a measure of protein·DNA interaction (9.Buratwoski S. Chodosh L.A. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2, Section 12.2. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). However, the limitations of the assay are not widely appreciated: The assay is indirect, and due to the “caging” phenomenon (effectively irreversible protein·DNA association when the two interacting species enter gel pores together during electrophoresis), true binding kinetics become obscured. Both these limitations are clearly demonstrated by the present series of experiments. Although STAT1(K544A/E545A) binds a variety of DNA probes as detected by EMSA, it fails to be detected on genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation. And although the apparent affinity for IRF-1 and m67 binding sites is close to wild type, the mutant exhibits a greatly accelerated off-rate for the interaction with these probes. In fact, the 40-fold increase in off-rate probably also accounts for the failure to detect STAT1(K544A/E545A) accumulation by chromatin precipitation (CHIP). The rate of formaldehyde cross-link formation during the chromatin precipitation procedure is known to be a slow process, occurring over minutes rather than seconds (12.McGhee J.D. Hippel P.H.v. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1281-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 13.Dedon P.C. Soults J.A. Allis C.D. Gorovsky M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 197: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The decreased residence time by the STAT1(K544A/E545A) mutant on the IRF-1 promoter may therefore be insufficient to allow for efficient cross-linking. To our knowledge, the STAT1(K544A/E545A) mutant is the first DNA binding factor to demonstrate so severe a discordance between EMSA activity and in vivo binding. However, such studies require cells in which wild type protein is missing so that the function or lack of function of mutant proteins can be examined after permanent introduction.These results are most easily understood by revisiting the familiar equations Kd =koff/kon andkoff = ln2/t1/2 (for STAT●DNA ↔ STAT + DNA) (14.Riggs A.D. Bourgeois S. Cohn C. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 401-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). This means that off-rate and on-rate for STAT·DNA dissociation can both increase while keeping theKd constant. Thus the 40-fold increase inkoff (40-fold decrease in half-life) with a similar Kd for the STAT1(K544A/E545A) dimer suggests that the mutant protein binds and dissociates from DNA more rapidly than wild type protein (i.e. kon andkoff increase). The crystal structure of STAT1 bound to DNA (“pliers grip”) is in accord with this idea, because wild type STAT1 dimers clearly envelope their target DNA sequences (2.Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Given the strong reciprocal phosphotyrosine·SH2 interaction plus the total envelopment of the DNA by the dimer (15.Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Tsai-Huang L.H. Qureshi S. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to infer that STAT1 (possibly STATs in general) may undergo a limited conformational change in binding and dissociating from DNA. Any such conformational change would quite probably involve the linker and/or DNA binding domains. The K544-E545 residues and the linker domain as a whole may assist this process by providing enough flexibility to allow binding but also enough rigidity to ensure a reasonable residence time for STAT1. Although the surface-exposed K544-E545 residues do not appear to have any contact with residues directly involved in DNA binding, local structural perturbations in the linker domain might increase the “flexibility” of the linker domain enough to account for increases in both association and dissociation rates. These perturbations apparently leave intact the residues that contact the phosphate backbone and major groove and that provide the majority of the binding energy between STAT and DNA, because STAT1(K544A/E545A) can still bind GAS sites with affinities in the range of wild type. Although similar findings have been reported for other types of protein interactions (16.Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5888-5895Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we have been unable to find any other mutational study that has likewise altered protein·DNA binding kinetics without significantly changing binding affinity.Lastly, our data may provide some of the first indications about the rate of transcriptional complex formation by the STATs in vivo.

We have previously observed relatively more holoenzyme-associated kinase than expected from the tissue cAMP content during the pre-replicative cAMP surge in the regenerating liver, in which both RI and RII were up-regulated (7.Ekanger R. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Sand T.E. Scott J.D. Krebs E.G. Eikhom T.S. Christoffersen T. Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest the possibility that RI or RII subunits may have a negative effect on cA-PK dissociation even at high cAMP concentrations. We used the CRE-luciferase reporter gene to probe for dissociation of cA-PKI and cA-PKII in intact cells. Nuclear translocation of the C subunit requires cA-PK dissociation and is considered a prerequisite for phosphorylation of the CREB/CREM family of nuclear transcription factors, and hence for cAMP stimulation of CRE-governed reporter gene expression (8.Mayr B.

We show that cells overexpressing either hRIα or hRIIα, even when maximally cAMP challenged, had decreased cAMP responsive gene induction, suggesting that cAMP produced incomplete dissociation of either isozyme in intact cells. We will also present evidence that the affinity between RI and C subunits in the presence of saturating cAMP is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than hitherto assumed (11.Builder S.E. Beavo J.A.

The cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which is highly homologous to cA-PK (13.Honda A. Adams S.R. Sawyer C.L. Lev-Ram V. Tsien R.Y. Dostmann W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The RII subunit of cA-PK type II mutagenized in the substrate motif was able to form holoenzyme without blocking the C activity (14.Wang Y. Scott J.D. McKnight G.S. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2446-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cAMP-saturated cA-PKII holoenzyme was reported to be fully active (15.Yang S. Fletcher W.H. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6267-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and this observation was linked to the fact that most cA-PK anchoring proteins (AKAPs) preferentially bind RII (16.Colledge M.

This is more easily explained if cA-PK is catalytically active while physically retained in a supramolecular complex with its substrate, than if activation involves dissociation of the C subunit from the AKAP-anchored R subunit. We show that neither cA-PKI nor cA-PKII had significant catalytic activity against synthetic or physiological substrate under near physiological in vitroconditions.

His6hRIα and His6hRIIα were constructed by subcloning the RIα/RIIα cDNA into pBAD (CLONTECH). For cell transfection, RIα and RIIα cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA (Invitrogen). The pCMV5-Cα plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Stanley McKnight, University of Washington, Seattle, WA. The luciferase reporter plasmid, pT81–4CRE-Luc was a kind gift from Dr. Marit Bakke, University of Bergen, Norway. The green fluorescent protein plasmid pGFP-C1 was from CLONTECH. Buffer A is a near physiological buffer with respect to pH, ionic strength, potassium, phosphate, and magnesium concentration, and consists of 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm Na2PO4, 130 mm KCl, 0.3 mm ATP, 2 mmMg(CH3COO)2, 0.3 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol. HEK 293 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/cm2 in a 6-well plate and transfected 24 h later by calcium phosphate precipitation with reporter plasmid (0.16 μg of pT81–4CRE-Luc), various concentrations of pCMV5-Cα, pcDNA-hRIα, or pcDNA-hRIIα. The total amount of plasmid was kept constant (2 μg) by compensating with pCMV5 empty vector. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline 24 h after transfection, lysed in 80 μl of 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, and assayed for luciferase activity. Some of the cultures had received treatment with cAMP elevating agents (30 μm forskolin, 250 μmisobutylmethylxanthine) and cAMP analogs (1 mm8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP, 0.7 mmN6-monobutyryl-cAMP, and 0.7 mmN6-benzoyl-cAMP) the last 3 h before harvesting. The transfection efficiency of the HEK 293 cells was determined by replacing pT81–4CRE-Luc with 0.1 μg of pGFP-C1, and visualization of green fluorescent cells 24 h after transfection. The Cα subunit was purified from 12 kg of bovine heart. The 10,000 × gsupernatant after homogenization in 10 mm KPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol was passed through P1-cellulose, applied to DEAE-Sepharose (1.5 liters), washed with 80 liters of 55 mm KPO4, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithioerythritol, and Cα eluted with 0.1 mm cAMP in 50 mmKPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmdithioerythritol. Active fractions were diluted 3-fold in water, chromatographed on SP-Sepharose, and eluted with a linear KCl gradient (0 to 500 mm). The 99% pure enzyme was applied on a hydroxylapatite column, and eluted in 5 ml of 600 mmKPO4 at a concentration of 0.3 mm. Recombinant human R subunits were harvested from transformedEscherichia coli BL21, bovine R subunit from E. coli E222. Bovine RI was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and DEAE-Sepharose chromatography. His-tagged R was purified on Ni2+-NTA chromatography, and GST-tagged R by GSH affinity chromatography. Thrombin cleavage to separate GST and R was performed with GST-R still bound to resin. For final purification the R subunits were subjected to FPLC size exclusion chromatography on a column equilibrated in buffer A without ATP. Commercially available C-FITC and R-TRITC had decreased specific kinase activity and decreased affinity for C subunit, respectively. We therefore labeled bovine Cα subunit with FITC and bovine RIα subunit with TRITC according to Adams (2.Adams S.R. Harootunian A.T. Buechler Y.J. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The Cα subunit was biotinylated when in holoenzyme complex to protect the R-C interaction face from modification. The cA-PKI holoenzyme (2 mg/ml) was mixed with 0.6 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Pierce), and reacted for 0.5 h at room temperature. Free biotin-Cα subunit was obtained by FPLC (Superdex 200) in 50 mm phosphate buffer with 30 μm cAMP. The C-FITC and the biotinylated C subunit had the same molar activity (18 s−1) as unmodified C, and similar efficiency in releasing [3H]cAMP bound to RIα. Cyclic AMP bound to RI-TRITC with the same affinity as to unmodified RI, and the C subunit released [3H]cAMP from complex with RI-TRITC and RI at similar rate (not shown). For determination of FRET, subunits incubated in a 0.5 ml cuvette, were excited (Xenon lamp) at 490 nm, and emission determined at 510 and 580 nm (by PTI photomultiplier) before and after addition of 50 μm cAMP. For scintillation proximity assay, streptavidin-coated flashplates (PerkinElmer Life Science) were coated with the biotin-Cα and washed with buffer A with 5 mg/ml serum albumin. RIα (10–2600 nm), that had been fully exchanged with [3H]cAMP, was incubated in buffer A with 1.25–2.5 μm [3H]cAMP in the C subunit-coated wells. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, plates were counted at 25 °C (TopCount-NXT, Packard). Kinase incubations were in buffer A with [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylation of Kemptide was determined as described in Refs. 7.Ekanger R. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Sand T.E. Scott J.D. Krebs E.G. Eikhom T.S. Christoffersen T. Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. J.

For TH phosphorylation, aliquots were mixed with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar), and32P-RII and [32P]TH detected by autoradiography after separation by SDS-PAGE. The level of C and R subunits of cA-PK in cell extracts was determined as described previously (7.Ekanger R. Vintermyr O.K. Houge G. Sand T.E. Scott J.D. Krebs E.G. Eikhom T.S. Christoffersen T. Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4374-4382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that the total level of R subunits (RI + RII) was determined by the ammonium sulfate precipitation method (23.Doskeland S.O. Ogreid D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A thorough study (24.Hofmann F. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1441-1447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed equimolar expression of the R (RI + RII) and C subunits of cA-PK in mammalian tissue, averaging 0.3 pmol/mg tissue, wet weight. This translates to an average intracellular concentration of subunits of about 0.5 μm, assuming the extracellular space to occupy 15% of the tissue, and the subunits to distribute in 70% of the intracellular space. The presently studied HEK293 cells had 3.3 pmol of R subunit/mg of protein and 3.0 pmol of C subunit/mg of protein (see first paragraph under “Results”). Assuming that the cells contained 10% protein, this value translates to about 0.3 pmol of subunit/mg of cellular wet weight, which means that the untransfected HEK293 cells had an average level of cA-PK subunit expression. The free C subunit encounters substrates in the cell, but the % substrate saturation is unknown. To obtain an estimate, the rate of phosphorylation of PAH in vitro in the absence of competing substrates, was compared with the rate in intact, cAMP-stimulated hepatocytes (21.Doskeland A.P. Vintermyr O.K. Flatmark T. Cotton R.G. Doskeland S.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation was about 8 times slower in the intact cell, suggesting that one-eighth of the C subunit pool was accessible for PAH phosphorylation, and that at most seven-eights of it (85–90%) was occupied by other substrates. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with pT81–4CRE-Luc and expression vector containing either RIα or RIIα, to study the effect of overexpressed RI and RII subunits on gene transcription via the cAMP-responsive element (CRE). The cells were stimulated with agents elevating the endogenous cAMP as well as potent cAMP analogs to ensure full saturation of the R subunits of cA-PK. It was found that cells overexpressing RIα or RIIα had about half as strong luciferase induction by cAMP agonists as control cells (Fig. 1A). A similarly blunted luciferase induction was noted in RIα overexpressing cells exposed to potent acetoxy-methylated cAMP analogs (25.Schultz C. Vajanaphanich M. Harootunian A.T. Sammak P.J. Barrett K.E. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6316-6322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Schultz C. Vajanaphanich M. Genieser H.G. Jastorff B. Barrett K.E. Tsien R.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 702-708PubMed Google Scholar) at 20-fold higher concentration than required for maximal luciferase induction in control cells (not shown). There was no evidence that RIα expression had interfered nonspecifically with luciferase expression, since co-transfection with 400 ng of Cα expression plasmid could override the effect (Fig. 1B). The effect of expressed exogenous RI and C subunits could be mutually titrated in cells not stimulated with cAMP agonists (Fig. 1, B and C), confirming that the CRE-Luc expression system responded to Cα subunit and that the Cα effect could be blocked by R subunit. The luciferase induction was next compared between cells with near balanced coexpression of exogenous R and Cα and cells with moderate overexpression of Cα alone. Again, cells with enforced expression of RIα or RIIα had lower response to cAMP challenge (Fig. 1D). This suggested that overexpressed R could inhibit the ability of exogenous (Fig. 1D) as well as of endogenous (Fig. 1A) Cα to induce CRE-governed luciferase. The observed effects of enforced expression of R subunits in cAMP-stimulated cells were statistically significant. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed significantly less cAMP-stimulated luciferase expression in cells overexpressing RI (p < 0.010;n = 10) or RII (p < 0.025;n = 6). When including results from cells coexpressing Cα subunit, the p values were <0.001 (n = 18) for RI and <0.005 (n = 12) for RII. It is concluded that cells with enforced expression of RIα or RIIα subunits of cA-PK had blunted response to maximal cAMP stimulation. In separate experiments, in which the luciferase reporter gene was replaced by green fluorescent protein (GFP) as reporter, about 25% of the cells were detectably green 24 h after transfection. The transfection efficiency was not affected by co-transfection with RIα, RIIα, or Cα plasmids. GFP containing cells co-transfected with RIα, RIIα, or Cα plasmids at the concentration used in the experiments shown in panels A and D of Fig. 1were tested for content of R (RI + RII) subunit and C subunit. The average increase of RI, C, and RII was 2.4, 2.8, and 9.5 pmol/mg protein, respectively. In cells transfected with 400 rather than 4 ng of Cα plasmid the protein kinase activity was increased 30-fold. The basal level of RI + RII was 3.3 pmol/mg protein, and of C subunit was 3.0 pmol/mg protein. The moderate overexpression of RI explained why it only protected partially against 4 ng of Cα plasmid and not at all against 400 ng of Cα plasmid (Fig. 1B). It also suggested that RI might be more efficient than RII in preventing the C subunit to stimulate gene transcription in cells with strongly increased cAMP level. The results of Fig. 1suggested that the RI subunit of cA-PKI could sequester the C subunit even in maximally cAMP-stimulated intact cells. This was unexpected in view of previous estimates of the dissociation constant of the complex between cAMP-saturated RI and the C subunit (11.Builder S.E. Beavo J.A. Krebs E.G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1980; 8: 33-43Google Scholar, 27.Doskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It was therefore decided to study in detail the strength of the interaction between cAMP-saturated RI and C under physiologically relevant conditions using isolated protein kinase subunits. One approach used the ability of C-FITC to enhance the emission of RI-TRITC and RI-TRITC to quench the emission of C-FITC when at close distance (FRET) (2.Adams S.R. Harootunian A.T. Buechler Y.J. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The fraction of C-FITC in complex with RI-TRITC was calculated from the relative emissions at 510 and 580 nm, as detailed in Table I. Using this method, an apparent equilibrium Kd of 0.24 μmwas determined for the complex between RI-TRITC and C-FITC in the presence of a saturating concentration of cAMP (Fig. 2).Table IDetermination of the fractional association of RIα-TRITC (RIα) and Cα-FITC (Cα) by fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysisIncubate contentcps 510 nmcps 580 nmcps 580 nm (RIα only)Ratio 510 nm/ 580 nm (Cα)/(RIα)Fractional association (rdiss − rx)/( rdiss − rholo)30 nmCα14,5002,260050 nmRIα1532,8202,820Σ 50 nm RIα + Cα14,6535,0802,8205.14 rdiss0.0050 nm RIα + Cα + cAMP14,0004,9522,7705.05 rx0.0750 nm RIα + Cα11,9005,0753,2203.70 rholo1.0500 nm RIα12822,40022,400Σ 500 nm RIα + Cα14,62824,66022,4000.647 rdiss0.00500 nm RIα + Cα + cAMP11,80025,63823,8000.496 rx0.86500 nm RIα + Cα11,20025,54523,8000.471 rholo1.0The FITC-labeled bCα subunit (30 nm) and the TRITC-labeled bRIα subunit (50 or 500 nm) were excited at 490 nm, and the emission monitored (cps) at 510 and 580 nm. The emission at 510 nm was due to Cα alone, since RIα did not emit at this wavelength. At 580-nm Cα had significant emission (15.6% of that at 510 nm) which was subtracted to obtain the emission due to RIα only (column 3 from the right). The ratio of emission 510/580 nm (Cα/RIα) is shown for the separated subunits (rdiss), and for combined subunits in the presence (rx) and absence (rholo) of 50 μm cAMP. The rdiss represents the completely dissociated state (fractional association = 0), andrholo the completely associated holoenzyme state (fractional association = 1.0).

The fractional association observed in the presence of cAMP was determined as shown in the right hand column. The experiment was conducted at 25 °C in buffer A. This Kd value was surprisingly low in view of previous estimates, and could be due to enhancement of the R-C binding by the introduction of the fluorescent groups. In a second approach we used biotin-labeled Cα and unlabeled RI subunit. The biotin labeling of the C subunit was performed when the C was in cA-PKI holoenzyme complex and the coupling chemistry was different from that used for the C-FITC labeling. Biotin-Cα was immobilized to streptavidin-coated wells of a microplate with intrinsic solid scintillant (and scintillation proximity assay). The added RI·[3H]cAMP complex was detected only when close to the wall (bound to biotinylated C). The immobilized C subunit was estimated to be half-maximally saturated by 0.16 μmRI-[3H]cAMP (Fig. 3), confirming the high affinity between RI-cAMP and C subunit. A third method relied on unlabeled native R and C subunits. A trace amount of Cα (50 pm) was injected into size exclusion FPLC columns equilibrated with 100 μm cAMP and various concentrations of hRIα. The position where the C subunit kinase activity eluted was determined. Half-maximal shift of Cα elution position occurred when the column was equilibrated with 0.25 μm hRIα (data not shown). It is concluded that the Cα subunit interacts with cAMP-saturated RIα with aKd in the submicromolar range. Since the ternary cAMP·cA-PKI complex (cAMP4, RIα2, and Cα2) apparently could form in intact cells (Fig. 1) and at submicromolar concentrations of cA-PKI subunits (Figs. 2 and 3), the question of the catalytic activity of the ternary complex has biological importance. We investigated this possibility using several substrates. In the first series of experiments the Cα-catalyzed phosphorylation of the physiological substrate phenylalanine-4-monooxygenase was studied at various concentrations of RIα in the presence of a very high concentration (100 μm) of cAMP. At the highest concentration (30 μm) of cAMP-saturated RIα studied the phosphorylation rate was inhibited more than 99% (Fig. 4A). This shows that Cα in the ternary complex with cAMP-saturated RI expressed less than 1% of its potential phosphotransferase activity, and possibly had no activity at all. Half-maximal inhibition of the phosphorylation was observed at 0.32 μm cAMP-saturated RIα (Fig. 4B), in line with the physicochemical data indicating a submicromolarKd for the complex between Cα and cAMP-saturated RIα (see above). Qualitatively similar results were obtained when the Cα activity was determined with tyrosine-4-monooxygenase as the substrate, using autoradiography to detect the phosphorylated protein (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation of tyrosine-4-monooxygenase in the presence of cAMP (100 μm) was inhibited by at least 95% also by RIIα (Fig. 5).Figure 5Cyclic AMP-saturated RIα and RIIα inhibit the Cα catalyzed phosphorylation of TH under near physiological conditions. TH (5 μm) was phosphorylated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of 0.7 nm Cα subunit and 50 μm cAMP under conditions like described in the legend to Fig. 4. After separation by SDS-PAGE, [32P]TH and32P-RII was detected by autoradiography. The four left lanes show decreasing [32P]TH in samples incubated with increasing RIα.

This suggested that 50–100 μmcAMP, as routinely used, could saturate cA-PKI and II holoenzyme nearly completely. Although cAMP-saturated cA-PKI or II holoenzyme had insignificant activity toward large physiological protein substrates (Figs. 4 and 5), the possibility remained that they could phosphorylate smaller substrates (15.Yang S. Fletcher W.H. Johnson D.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6267-6271Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In our hands, RIα (Fig. 6), as well as RIIα (Fig. 7), could inhibit Kemptide phosphorylation nearly completely in the presence of cAMP.

Reconstituted BioB from Escherichia coli contains a [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster thought to be involved in the reduction and cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), generating methionine and the reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical responsible for dethiobiotin H-abstraction. Using EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy as well as methionine quantitation we demonstrate that the reduced S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster is indeed capable of injecting one electron into AdoMet, generating one equivalent of both methionine andS = 0 [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. Dethiobiotin is not required for the reaction. Using site-directed mutagenesis we show also that, among the eight cysteines of BioB, only three (Cys-53, Cys-57, Cys-60) are essential for AdoMet reductive cleavage, suggesting that these cysteines are involved in chelation of the [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster. Biotin synthase (BioB) catalyzes the insertion of a sulfur atom between the C6 and C9 carbons of dethiobiotin. Reconstituted BioB from Escherichia coli contains a [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster thought to be involved in the reduction and cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), generating methionine and the reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical responsible for dethiobiotin H-abstraction. Using EPR and Mössbauer spectroscopy as well as methionine quantitation we demonstrate that the reduced S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster is indeed capable of injecting one electron into AdoMet, generating one equivalent of both methionine andS = 0 [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster. Dethiobiotin is not required for the reaction. Using site-directed mutagenesis we show also that, among the eight cysteines of BioB, only three (Cys-53, Cys-57, Cys-60) are essential for AdoMet reductive cleavage, suggesting that these cysteines are involved in chelation of the [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster. A new class of iron-sulfur enzymes has recently emerged. They are defined on the basis of their absolute requirement forS-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) 1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet (SAM)S-adenosylmethionineDTTdithiothreitolRNRribonucleotide reductasePFLpyruvate formate lyaseLAMlysine aminomutaseDTBdethiobiotin5-DAF5-deazaflavinBioBbiotin synthaseAdo⋅5′-deoxyadenosyl radical1The abbreviations used are: AdoMet (SAM)S-adenosylmethionineDTTdithiothreitolRNRribonucleotide reductasePFLpyruvate formate lyaseLAMlysine aminomutaseDTBdethiobiotin5-DAF5-deazaflavinBioBbiotin synthaseAdo⋅5′-deoxyadenosyl radical(1.Sofia H.J.

The combination of a reduced iron-sulfur cluster and AdoMet is generally considered to result in the reductive cleavage of AdoMet and the generation of a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical essential for initiation of catalysis. The prototypes for this class of enzymes are the activating components of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) and pyruvate formate lyase (PFL), lysine aminomutase (LAM), and biotin synthase (BioB) (2.Cheek J.

The proteins of these systems have been shown to assemble an oxygen-sensitive [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster, probably chelated by the three cysteines in the CXXXCXXC sequence that is conserved among all enzymes and a fourth, not yet identified ligand (6.Ollagnier S.

For RNR, PFL activases, and LAM, it has been shown that the cluster has to be reduced to the [4Fe-4S]1+ state before it can react with AdoMet (6.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R.

The reaction results in the production of one equivalent of methionine, one equivalent of 5′-deoxyadenosine, and approximately one equivalent of a substrate radical. The latter is a protein-bound glycyl radical in RNR and PFL and a lysine-derived radical in LAM (19.Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schäfer W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In all cases, electrons are not transferred from the cluster to AdoMet in the absence of the substrate, showing that the reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable. In this report we present studies of the same reaction for BioB. S-adenosylmethionine dithiothreitol ribonucleotide reductase pyruvate formate lyase lysine aminomutase dethiobiotin 5-deazaflavin biotin synthase 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical S-adenosylmethionine dithiothreitol ribonucleotide reductase pyruvate formate lyase lysine aminomutase dethiobiotin 5-deazaflavin biotin synthase 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical Biotin synthase (BioB) catalyzes the incorporation of a sulfur atom into dethiobiotin to form biotin (see Scheme 1 below) (22.Marquet A. Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Vitamins and Hormones. 2001; 61: 51-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, this reaction is very inefficient and the reported yields of biotin never exceed 1–2 equivalents per protein after several hours reaction, raising the possibility that BioB is not an enzyme but a reactant (23.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24.Birch O.M. Furhmann M. Shaw N.M . J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8352-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The protein from Escherichia coli is a 76-kDa homodimer that binds a [4Fe-4S] center on each polypeptide chain (14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar,26.Ugulava N.B. Gibney B.R. Jarrett J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5206-5214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Recently, Jarrett and co-workers (27.Ugulava N.B. Gibney B.R. Jarrett J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8343-8351Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) suggested that the active form of BioB contained two clusters, one [4Fe-4S] and one [2Fe-2S], per polypeptide chain. On the other hand, using a different procedure for reconstitution of iron centers in BioB, we are able to generate enzyme of similar activity with no more than 4 Fe and 4 S atoms per monomer mainly in the form of a [4Fe-4S] cluster (14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15.Hewitson K. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Shaw N.M. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Roach P.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition to an Fe-S cluster and AdoMet, several proteins and cofactors are necessary for biotin formation: namely NADPH, DTT, iron, sulfide, cysteine, flavodoxin, and flavodoxin reductase (23.Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 24.Birch O.M. Furhmann M. Shaw N.M . J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The flavodoxin system is thought to effect in the reduction of the cluster. Requirement of iron, sulfide, and DTT suggests that the cluster is labile and has to be reconstituted during catalysis. Finally, the source of the sulfur for the biosynthesis of dethiobiotin has not been firmly established, although it has been suggested to be the cluster itself (28.Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Mejan A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This function is proposed to specifically reside in the [2Fe-2S] cluster in Jarrett's enzyme preparations (25.Ugulava N.B. Sacanell C.J. Jarrett J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8352-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It should be noted that, in vivo, the sulfur atom of biotin is derived from cysteine (24.Birch O.M. Furhmann M. Shaw N.M . J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Finally, studies of site-directed mutants have demonstrated the requirement of six cysteines for activity. Cys-53, Cys-57, and Cys-60 (numbers referred to the Escherichia colienzyme) are thought to be important for chelation and function of the [4Fe-4S] cluster (13.McIver L. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13888-13894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15.Hewitson K. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Shaw N.M. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Roach P.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The function of Cys-97, Cys-128, and Cys-188, which are also absolutely required, is still unknown (24.Birch O.M. Furhmann M. Shaw N.M . J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these cysteines might provide the site for a second cluster, namely the [2Fe-2S] center proposed by Jarrett and collaborators (25.Ugulava N.B. Sacanell C.J. Jarrett J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8352-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As for RNR, PFL, and LAM, the [4Fe-4S] cluster in BioB is suggested to play a key role in the reductive cleavage of AdoMet. The formation of biotin from dethiobiotin requires abstraction of two hydrogen atoms. Removal of each hydrogen atom, sequentially, is presumably accomplished by the product of the reductive cleavage of AdoMet, the reactive 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. This is consistent with the observation that formation of biotin requires at least two equivalents of AdoMet (29.Shaw N.M. Birch O.M. Tinschert A. Venetz V. Dietrich R. Savoy L.A. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,30.Guianvarc'h D. Florentin D. Bui B.T.S. Nunzi F. Marquet A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Radicals at C-9 or C-6 are thus thought to react with a sulfur source to form the tetrahydrothiophene moiety of biotin. In this report we specifically address the question of the role of the [4Fe-4S] cluster during AdoMet activation. We show that in BioB fromE. coli only the reduced [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster is able to reduce AdoMet into methionine and that the substrate dethiobiotin is not required for the reaction. Mutations at Cys-97, Cys-128, and Cys-188 do not affect AdoMet reduction activity of BioB. In contrast, mutations at Cys-53, Cys-57, and Cys-60 abolished this activity. All chemicals were of reagent grade and obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. or Fluka unless otherwise stated.57Fe2O3 was converted into ferric chloride by dissolving it in a hot concentrated (35%) hydrochloric acid of analytical grade (Carlo Erba) and repeatedly concentrated in water. 5-Deaza-7,8-demethyl-10-methyl-isoalloxazine (5-DAF) was prepared according to Ashton et al. (31.Ashton W.T. Brown R. Tolman R.L. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1978; 15: 489-491Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Mutants and wild-type proteins were prepared as described previously (12.Hewitson K.S. Baldwin J.E. Shaw N.M. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15.Hewitson K. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Shaw N.M. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Roach P.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of apoproteins was achieved with either 56Fe or 57Fe, as described (14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 15.Hewitson K. Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Shaw N.M. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Roach P.L. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In both cases the reconstituted proteins were desalted over Sephadex G-25 to remove adventitiously bound iron. Reconstituted wild-type and mutated proteins were reduced inside an anaerobic glove box. 5-DAF was dissolved in Me2SO, diluted to a final concentration of 1 mm with water and stored inside the glove box in the dark. The protein (100–160 μm) was prepared in 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and irradiated in the presence of 5-DAF (20–50 μm). Reduction could be monitored using UV-visible light directly inside the box. After a 40-min reaction, the reduced protein solution was divided into two portions, one being transferred to an EPR tube (190 μl) and the other to a Mössbauer cup (400 μl). To avoid exposure to oxygen, EPR tubes and Mössbauer cups were frozen directly inside the box in a well filled with isopentane cooled from outside the box by liquid nitrogen. All the experiments were done under anaerobic conditions inside the glove box (<2 ppm O2, 18 °C). BioB, wild-type, or mutant protein (100–230 μm), in 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30 mm KCl was first reduced as described above. After reduction the solution was shielded from light using an aluminum foil, and AdoMet (500 μm) was added anaerobically. At four time intervals (from 0 to 120 min) two aliquots were removed, one (40 μl) for methionine determination and one (190 μl) immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen inside the glove box for EPR spectroscopic analysis. A wild-type 57Fe-labeled BioB preparation was also analyzed by Mössbauer spectroscopy. AdoMet reductase activity was measured at 570 nm from the amount of the methionine ninhydrine-derivative analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (System 7300, Beckman) calibrated with pure amino acid standards. Spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX (9.5 GHz) EPR spectrometer equipped with an ESR 900 helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments). Double integrals of the EPR signals and spin concentration were obtained through the Win-EPR software using the spectrum of a 200 μm Cu(EDTA) standard recorded under nonsaturating conditions. 57Fe-Mössbauer spectra were recorded using 400-μl cuvettes containing 230 μmprotein. Spectra were recorded on a spectrometer operating in constant acceleration mode using a cryostat that allowed temperatures from 1.5 to 300 K. Magnetic fields (0.05 T) were applied parallel to the observed γ-rays. Protein concentration (by monomer) was determined by the method of Bradford (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215477) Google Scholar) standardized against bovine serum albumin and multiplied by a correction factor of 1.1 for the biotin synthase (33.Nozaki Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Protein-bound iron was determined under reducing conditions with bathophenanthroline disulfonate after acid denaturation of the protein (34.Fish W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 158: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and labile sulfide by the method of Beinert (35.Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In the following experiments, all carried out inside an anaerobic glove box, BioB designates purified preparations of anaerobically reconstituted biotin synthase, containing 3.3–3.9 iron and 3.4–4.0 sulfide per monomer, mainly in the form of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters as shown by Mössbauer spectroscopy (see Ref. 14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar and below). Purification and reconstitution have been described previously (12.Hewitson K.S. Baldwin J.E. Shaw N.M. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M.

Inorg. Chem. 2002; 7: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Anaerobic reaction of reduced BioB, containing mainly [4Fe-4S]1+clusters, with AdoMet, was assayed for the formation of methionine, one of the products of the reductive cleavage of AdoMet. The concentration of S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster was determined by quantifying its characteristic EPR signal (Fig. 1, inset); the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster form is EPR-silent, and the EPR spectra of the S = 3/2 [4Fe-4S]1+cluster, generally a minor species, are difficult to quantify because of their broad features and small signal amplitudes. In a typical experiment, BioB (0.1–0.16 mm) was first reduced by illuminating in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of deazaflavin (5-DAF), using a 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0 (buffer A). This procedure afforded a maximum of 50–60% of polypeptides containing a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster as determined from the intensity of the EPR signal. When reduced BioB was reacted with an excess of AdoMet (0.5 mm) in buffer A, the EPR signal of the cluster slowly declined following first-order kinetics with a rate constant of 0.025 ± 0.005 min−1, and the reaction was completed within about 1 h (Fig. 1). As shown below, the EPR-silent reaction product has been identified as the corresponding [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster form. In the course of the reaction, methionine was formed with the same rate, showing that methionine formation is associated with cluster oxidation. All along the reaction, 0.9–1.0 mol of methionine was formed per mol of cluster converted to the [4Fe-4S]2+form. In three experiments the same ∼1:1 ratio was obtained with different preparations having widely different amounts of reduced cluster (data not shown). Furthermore, when the final EPR-silent form of BioB, obtained after reaction with AdoMet, was desalted, reduced a second time and then exposed again to AdoMet, a second and comparable burst of methionine formation was observed (0.8 mol of methionine per mol of reoxidized cluster). Finally, the reaction proceeded with similar rates and yields in the presence of an excess of either dethiobiotin (2.5 mm) or DTT (5 mm). No formation of methionine was observed when either BioB or AdoMet was omitted from the reaction mixture. Furthermore, in the absence of AdoMet the S = 1/2 signal of the 1+ state did not decline measurably within the same time range. We conclude that the [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster is competent for AdoMet cleavage, even in the absence of the dethiobiotin substrate. The reaction can be described with the following reaction,[4Fe­4S] 1++1 AdoMet→1 methionine+Ado⋅+[4Fe­4S] 2+REACTION 1In a control experiment reconstituted BioB lacking EPR-active clusters and containing mainly EPR-silent [4Fe-4S]2+clusters was incubated with an excess of AdoMet (0.5 mm) in buffer A. After 1-h incubation no significant production of methionine (less than 0.01 mol/mol of monomer BioB) was observed, demonstrating that the [4Fe-4S]2+ center is not competent for AdoMet cleavage to methionine. The same type of experiment was performed with each of the eight Cys-to-Ala mutant proteins available in our laboratory. As reported earlier, among the five mutated enzymes that still exhibit upon anaerobic reduction the S = 1/2 EPR signal of the [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster, only two, namely C276A and C288A, were fully enzymatically active, whereas the three others, C97A, C128A, and C188A, were inactive (Table I). The other mutant proteins, C53A, C57A, and C60A, were both EPR-silent after incubation with photoactivated deazaflavin and inactive (Table I). Determination of methionine for each EPR-active mutant after 1 h reaction with an excess of AdoMet gave the same results as the wild-type protein (Table I). Only for the C188A mutant was a decreased production of methionine observed. No methionine was detected with the three EPR-silent C53A, C57A, and C60A mutants, treated exactly under the same conditions.Table IAdoMet reductase activity of reconstituted wild-type and mutants BioBProtein[4Fe-4S]1+1-aPercentage (±5%) of total iron in the S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ state as quantitated by EPR spectroscopy after reduction with photoactivated deazaflavin; percentage does not include [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters in the S = 3/2 state.

Open table in a new tab To characterize the EPR-silent iron center after reaction with AdoMet, similar experiments were carried out with a preparation of wild-type BioB reconstituted with57Fe (sample A), reduced with photoactivated DAF (sample B), and incubated for 15 min with AdoMet (sample C), as described above. Aliquots of each sample (0.83 mm Fe) were transferred into Mössbauer cups and EPR tubes, and a fraction was set aside for analysis of methionine formation. The Mössbauer spectrum of sample A (Fig. 2A) exhibits a major species (the doublet drawn above the experimental spectrum) with isomer shift δ = 0.45 mm/s and quadrupole splitting ΔEQ = 1.13 mm/s, accounting for ≈60% of the total iron. The parameters of this doublet are the same as those reported for the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of BioB (14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M.

Two doublets, each representing approximately 6% of the iron, exhibit ΔEQ ≈ 3.1 mm/s, δ ≈ 1.2 mm/s and ΔEQ ≈ 3.1 mm/s, δ ≈ 0.7 mm/s (see also Fig. 3 of Ref. 14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The two broad lines between +2 mm/s and +3 mm/s Doppler velocity are the high energy features of these doublets. Most likely both doublets represent adventitiously bound FeII. Isomer shifts of ≈0.7 mm/s are typical of tetrahedral high spin FeIIS4 complexes suggesting that this species represents mononuclear FeIIbound to cysteinyl sulfurs of sites lacking a cluster. A third minority species, contributing 10–15% of the absorption in Fig. 2A, exhibits a doublet with ΔEQ ≈ 0.55 mm/s and δ ≈ 0.27 mm/s, parameters identical to those of the [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster in oxygen-exposed BioB samples (14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Finally, the spectrum contains an unresolved paramagnetic component (approximately 10% of Fe), recognizable by some shallow absorption between −1 mm/s and −3 mm/s Doppler velocity. This paramagnetic component, or at least a fraction of it, might belong to a [4Fe-4S]1+ cluster, even though it is difficult to see in the EPR spectrum (Table I). A sample similar to the one shown in Fig. 2A, was incubated for 15 min with 0.5 mm AdoMet before freezing at liquid nitrogen. Its Mössbauer spectrum (not shown) was the same as that of Fig. 2A, suggesting that under these conditions the presence of AdoMet does not affect the [4Fe-4S]2+cluster. The 4.2 K Mössbauer spectrum of a photoreduced sample (sample B), shown in Fig. 2B, exhibits a broad paramagnetic component very similar to the spectrum reported for the [4Fe-4S]1+clusters of BioB (14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It is not possible to obtain for this sample a precise estimate of the fraction of iron associated with the [4Fe-4S]1+ state. Our analysis, however, indicates that 60–80% of the iron is associated with the 1+ state and that possibly 10% of the iron belongs to [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. The lower limit would suggest that all [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters have been reduced. The upper limit is not inconsistent with our observations for sample A if we take into account our previous observation that, upon photoreduction, the iron of the [2Fe-2S] cluster is used to build clusters with [4Fe-4S] cores (14.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K.S. Roach P. Baldwin J.E. Münck E. Fontecave M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4165-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Accordingly no [2Fe-2S] cluster could be detected in sample B. Moreover, some of the adventitiously bound iron is likely to be recruited for cluster reconstitution during the extended (45 min) photo-illumination process. Our estimate that 60–80% of the iron of sample B belongs to [4Fe-4S]1+ is not inconsistent with the EPR spectroscopic analysis of the sample, which suggest that 52% of the total iron in the sample belongs to spin S = 1/2 [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters. The enhanced intensity in the central portion of the spectrum of Fig. 2B suggests that the sample contains some S = 3/2 [4Fe-4S]1+clusters as well. The effect of addition of AdoMet on the Mössbauer spectrum of the photoreduced sample is shown in Fig. 2C. It can be seen that the contribution of the [4Fe-4S]1+ form has decreased (EPR showed that only 35% of total iron was in the S = 1/2 state) and that the doublet characteristic of the [4Fe-4S]2+ state has reappeared. We estimate that this doublet accounts for ≈30% of the iron. This value may contain 10% of the iron in [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster not reduced prior to the addition of AdoMet (as in sample B). A spectrum recorded atT = 100 K (not shown) revealed that no additional mononuclear ferrous iron was generated, showing that cluster destruction did not occur during the reaction. The distribution of iron within different species in samples A, B, and C as derived from Mössbauer analysis is reported in Table II. From these numbers and those from the EPR analysis, a reasonably good correlation, within the uncertainties, is observed between the amount o"

Idx-1 (Pdx-1/Stf-1/Ipf-1) is transiently expressed in all pancreatic cells as well as in the epithelial layer of the duodenal mucosa during early embryogenesis (5Leonard J. Peers B. Johnson T.

During development, Idx-1 becomes progressively confined to the endocrine β cells where it is critical for the transcriptional regulation of the insulin gene (6Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 9Guz Y. Montminy M.R. Stein R. Leonard J. Gamer L.W. Wright C.V. Teitelman G.

Stanojevic V. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), result in a failure of the pancreas to develop (pancreatic agenesis). Brn-4 is a member of the class III family of pou-homeodomain proteins that are highly expressed in neural stem cells and regulate stem cell-specific genes, such as the intermediate filament protein nestin (11Josephson R. Muller T. Pickel J. Okabe S. Reynolds K. Turner P.A. Zimmer A. McKay R.D. Development. 1998; 125: 3087-3100PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shimazaki T. Arsenijevic Y. Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Weiss S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During early pancreas development, the expression of Brn-4 is specifically restricted to stem/progenitor cells that later differentiate into glucagon-producing α cells (13Jensen J. Heller R.S. Funder-Nielsen T. Pedersen E.E. Lindsell C. Weinmaster G. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Brn-4 has not been detected in either differentiating or mature β cells. Brn-4 also stimulates glucagon gene expression by interaction with the α cell-specific G1 promoter element within the glucagon gene (14Hussain M.A. Lee J. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7186-7194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe that the developmental misexpression of Brn-4 under the control of the mouse Idx-1promoter (MIP)1in mice results in the ectopic expression of the glucagon gene in pancreatic β cells that continue to express insulin. Furthermore, Brn-4 expression in the undifferentiated pancreatic ductal cell line AR42J, a pancreatic precursor cell line, results in the expression of the proglucagon gene. Misexpression of Brn-4 under the control ofrat insulin II promoter (RIP) failed to yield an altered β cell phenotype in transgenic mice. Brn-4 expression in the differentiated mouse insulinoma cell line Min6 also failed to induce glucagon gene expression. Expression of Idx-1 occurs at mouse embryonic development days e8.0–e8.5, ∼24 h earlier than the expression of insulin. Our findings suggest that the ectopic expression of Brn-4 at an early developmental stage under Idx-1 promoter control, both in transgenic mice and under cytomegalovirus promoter control in AR42J cells, directs glucagon gene expression in precursors of pancreatic β cells. Expression of Brn-4 later during mouse embryo development under RIP control and in differentiated clonal β cell Min6 cells fails to alter the phenotype of the pancreatic β cell. Our results directly demonstrate in vivo and in vitro the temporal importance of Brn-4 expression in the determination of the proglucagon-expressing α cell lineage. Our findings underscore the importance of temporal windows during development when the expression of critical transcription factors has the capability of determining the phenotype of specific cell lineages of hormone-producing cells of the endocrine pancreas. Two plasmid constructs carrying −4.6 kb of the MIP and the −0.64 kb of RIP were used for inserting mouse Brn-4 and Pax6 cDNAs that were amplified by PCR. These constructs carry a rabbit β-globin exon 2 splice signal between the transcriptional start site of the respective promoters and the translational start codon of the cDNA. A rabbit β-globin poly(A) signal was ligated 3′ in the respective cDNAs (see Fig.2B). Linearized vectors excluding plasmid-derived sequences were used as transgenes for microinjection. Generation of transgenic animals was performed by the Beth-Israel Transgenic Facility in Boston. The time of implantation of the transgene-injected eggs was taken as e0.5 (15Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Pregnant foster mothers were sacrificed, and the embryos were removed at e8.5, e10, e15, and e18. Embryos (e8.5 and e10) or pancreata (e15 and e18) were extracted for protein, DNA, and total RNA with TRIZOL (Invitrogen). Protein extracts were analyzed by Western immunoblots, and nucleic acid extracts were analyzed by RT-PCR. Mice carrying the transgene were identified by PCR amplification of DNA derived from tail-snip tissue (15Hogan B. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Upstream primers corresponded to 3′ of the transcriptional start site (Idx-1, 5′-AGCTCATTGGGAGCGGTTTTG-3′; rat insulin II, 5′ ACAGCTATCAGTGGGAACTGTGA-3′); the downstream primer was within the cDNA sequence of the transgene construct 5′TTCGAGGCAGCTGTGGCCATGGTCG-3′ (see Fig. 2B). Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After dehydration, tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm serial sections were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol. Nonspecific serum binding was blocked with 10% donkey nonimmune serum, and sections were stained with primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Idx-1 HM253 1:500 (8Miller C.P. McGehee Jr., R.E. Habener J.F.

Biotinylated secondary antibodies were detected with the ABC Elite system (Vector Systems). Protein extracts from transgene-negative (wild-type, WT) and transgene-positive (TG) mice were separately pooled, and 100 μg of protein was fractionated via 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane for protein immunodetection.

Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Protein was extracted for insulin and glucagon assays with commercially available assay kits (Linco) from portions of e15 and e18 embryonic pancreata for radioimmunoassay as described (18Sander M. Neubuser A. Ee J. Kalamaras H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The radioimmunoassay detects glucagon specifically with little cross-reactivity with glucagon-like peptide-1 and -2. To analyze for transgene expression, RNA was extracted from embryonic mouse tissue (e8.5) and embryonic pancreas (e10) with the one-step method and then reverse-transcribed with Super Script II first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Target sequences were amplified with Taqpolymerase using the first-strand cDNA as a template. Both upstream and downstream PCR primers were chosen to lie within the RNA transcript. Since the transgene construct carried a rabbit β-globin splice signal, correct expression of the transgene could be identified by a smaller PCR product lacking the inserted β-globin splice sequence as compared with the PCR from genomic DNA. Correct eukaryotic processing of the transgenes was verified by transfecting (LipofectAMINE, Invitrogen) the rat immortalized β cell line INS-1 with the MIP-Brn-4 and RIP-Brn-4 expression plasmids. AR42J cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection, and INS-1 (rat insulinoma), Min6 (mouse insulinoma), and βTC-1 (mouse insulinoma) cells were generously provided by C. Wollheim (University of Geneva, Switzerland), J. Miyazaki (Kumamoto University), and S. Efrat (University of Tel Aviv, Israel), respectively. RIN1056A cells were generated in our laboratory (19Philippe J. Chick W.L. Habener J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). AR42J and Min6 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 with a pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) carrying the full-length rat Brn-4 cDNA (provided by R.G. Rosenfeld, University of San Diego, CA) under control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. RNA from cultured cells was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed as above using primers and cycling conditions used for glucagon and for rat and mouse adenosyl-phophoribosyl transferase described previously (20Daniel P.B. Habener J.F. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3721-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analyses of pancreata of e18 of WT and MIP-Brn-4 TG mice were done with antisera to insulin and glucagon (Fig.1A). The pancreata of WT mice show the typical intense insulin staining of almost all of the cells of the islets because the β cells that produce insulin comprise 80–90% of all islet cells (Fig. 1A, left top panel). Also typical of WT pancreata, the α cells that express glucagon are sparse and are distributed around the periphery of the islets (Fig.1A, right top panel). In contrast to the pancreata of control WT mice, the pancreata of TG mice show a striking difference in the distribution of glucagon-expressing cells (Fig.1A, right middle and lower panels). In the pancreata of TG mice, glucagon and insulin staining is seen in essentially all of the cells of the islets (Fig. 1A,left middle and lower panels). Therefore, we conclude that insulin and glucagon are co-expressed in the same cells of TG mice. The coexpression of glucagon and insulin in the same cells is evidenced by the strong similarities in the patterns of cellular immunostaining for insulin and glucagon (Fig. 1A, left andright panels, respectively). Notably, the immunostaining of e18 pancreata of TG mice expressing Brn-4 directed by either the RIP (Fig. 1B) or the expression of Pax6 directed by MIP (data not shown) gave a pattern of glucagon and insulin expression indistinguishable from that of WT mice. Therefore, neither the RIP promoter driving Brn-4 expression nor the MIP promoter driving Pax6 expression is capable of inducing the ectopic expression of glucagon in β cells. The MIP promoter effectively expresses Brn-4 ectopically in the β cells of e18 in TG mice, as shown by the appearance of Brn-4-positive nuclei throughout the cells of the islets (Fig. 1C,left lower panel) as compared with the typical restricted distribution of Brn-4 expression to the α cells located at the periphery of the islets of WT mice (Fig. 1C, left upper panel). Of importance is the finding that the distribution of endogenous Idx-1 expression in the WT and TG mice is indistinguishable, i.e. the ectopic expression in β cells of Brn-4 driven by MIP does not alter the expression of Idx-1 (Fig.1C, right upper and lower panels). This finding in vivo is consistent with the findings of Brn-4 and Idx-1 expression interactions in INS-1 cells in vitro (see Ref. 21Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar and see below). Western immunoblot analyses of levels of expression of transcription factors in total pancreatic protein extracts of e18 embryos showed increased expression of Brn-4 in both the MIP-Brn-4 and RIP-Brn-4 transgenic pancreata, as compared with wild-type pancreata (Fig.1D). This observation makes it unlikely that a dose effect of Brn-4 expression is a cause for the differences in the phenotypes of MIP-Brn-4 and RIP-Brn-4 transgenic mice. Idx-1 immunoreactivity was unchanged in the transgenic animals, suggesting that Brn-4 does not influence the expression of Idx-1, i.e. Brn-4 does not suppress Idx-1 in β cells (Fig. 1, C andD). The paired-homeodomain transcription factor Pax6 is implicated in α cell development shown by a reduction in glucagon-producing cells in Pax6 null mice (18Sander M. Neubuser A. Ee J. Kalamaras H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 22St-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and Pax6 binds to a proximal element in the glucagon promoter and up-regulates glucagon gene transcription (23Andersen F.G. Heller R.S. Petersen H.V. Jensen J. Madsen O.D. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,24Hussain M.A. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28950-28957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). An increase in Pax6 may increase glucagon gene expression. The effect of Brn-4 overexpression in pancreatic β cells does not alter Pax6 levels as determined by Western immunoblot (Fig. 1D). Nkx6.1 is a homeodomain transcription factor suggested to be β cell-specific (13Jensen J. Heller R.S. Funder-Nielsen T. Pedersen E.E. Lindsell C. Weinmaster G. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 25Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18749-18758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Nkx6.1 levels in total pancreas extract are not altered by Brn-4 misexpression (Fig. 1D). Altered expression of Idx-1, Nkx6.1, or Pax6 does not appear to account for the phenotype of co-expression of Brn-4, Idx-1, insulin, and glucagon found in the islets (β cells) of mice carrying the transgene consisting of the MIP driving misexpression of Brn-4. We measured the contents of glucagon and insulin in protein extracts prepared from pancreata of MIP-Brn-4 transgenic and non-transgenic littermates (control) at e15 and e18. The animals carrying the transgene had increased pancreatic glucagon content (TG mice, 600 ± 110 and 650 ± 120 as compared with control mice, 330 ± 70 and 430 ± 90 ng/mg protein for e15 and e18, respectively). Insulin levels did not appear to be affected by the presence or absence of a transgene (TG mice, 10 ± 0.9 and 7.6 ± 0.3 as compared with control mice, 9.2 ± 1.2 and 7.4 ± 0.8 μg/mg protein for e15 and e18, respectively). The radioimmunoassay used is capable of distinguishing glucagon from other glucagon gene products (i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon-like peptide-2), suggesting that the increased glucagon immunoreactivity was properly detecting processed glucagon derived from the precursor protein proglucagon. Analysis of the expression of the transgenes in mouse embryo tissues was performed with the identical PCR primers that were used for transgene detection. Total RNA from e8 and e12 embryos and pancreata from e15 and e18 were extracted, and RT-PCR was performed to detect transgene expression (Fig.2A). Correct processing of the transgene-derived RNAs was tested in the rat β cell line INS-1 transfected with the transgene expression DNA plasmids (Fig. 2,B and C). Proper expression of the transgene-derived mRNA yielded a shorter PCR product as compared with the genomic DNA template due to the removal of the rabbit β-globin splice site (see “Materials and Methods”). Expression of the MIP-Brn-4 transgene was detectable in e8 embryos (Fig.2C, leftmost panel), whereas the RIP-Brn-4 transgene, although present, was not expressed at the RNA level. At a later developmental stage (e10), both the MIP-Brn-4 (not shown) and RIP-Brn-4 transgenes were expressed (Fig. 2C,rightmost panel). This agrees with previous observations that Idx-1 is expressed earlier in development (i.e.e8.0–e8.5) than is insulin, which is detectable around e9.0–e9.5. Thus, a different time of transgenic misexpression of Brn-4 may account for the different islet phenotype generated using the two different promoters, MIP and RIP. However, the issue of timing of expression is further complicated by the evidence that MIP is activated in pancreatic precursor cells, and the RIP is activated in cells presumably already committed to become β cells. Thus, both temporal and spatial compartmental expression of the Idx-1 and insulin genes must be considered. To examine the property of Brn-4 to activate the expression of the proglucagon gene, we performed Brn-4 transfection-expression studies in cell lines in vitro. The rat pancreatic duct precursor cell line AR42J expresses Idx-1 but not endocrine hormones (27Zhou J. Wang X. Pineyro M.A. Egan J.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2358-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) 2M. A. Hussain, C. P. Miller, and J. F. Habener, unpublished observations. and can be differentiated in vitro into a pancreatic endocrine phenotype (27Zhou J. Wang X. Pineyro M.A. Egan J.M.

In contrast, mouse Min6 cells exhibit a phenotype of differentiated pancreatic endocrine β cells that express most if not all transcription factors specific for β cells, maintain a glucose-induced insulin secretory response, and express insulin but not glucagon (Fig. 3) or somatostatin (not shown). Transfection of AR42J cells with Brn-4 cDNA results in the expression of the proglucagon gene, whereas the Min6 cells transfected with Brn-4 cDNA do not express proglucagon (Fig. 3). The experimental expression of Brn-4 induces proglucagon gene expression in undifferentiated islet precursor cells (AR42J), but experimental expression of Brn-4 in a differentiated β cell line (i.e.Min6) fails to induce proglucagon gene expression. The results of the studies of misdirected expression of Brn-4 in transgenic mice in vivo and transfection expression studies in AR42J cells in vitro indicate that Brn-4 expressed at an early developmental stage, either in vivo or in vitro, can induce proglucagon gene expression. However, when Brn-4 is expressed in cells that are already committed to differentiate into β cells (i.e. RIP-Brn-4 transgenic mice, or Min6 cells), Brn-4 fails to alter the phenotypic determination of those respective cells. Our results suggest that the expression of Brn-4 is an important step in the determination of whether or not an early developing pancreatic endocrine cell lineage will express glucagon at later stages of development, and the suppression of Brn-4 expression may be a key event in the phenotypic determination of a cell programmed to become an insulin-producing β cell. Our results also suggest that an ectopic gain of function of Brn-4 leads to a change in the pattern of glucagon expression when under the control of a promoter (Idx-1) that is active early during pancreatic development. An altered phenotype is not detected if Brn-4 is later expressed under the control of the insulin promoter (RIP) that is active 24 h later during development (1Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) and when the endocrine cell lineage is committed irreversibly to a β cell lineage. Thus, there appears to be a temporal window (24 h between e8.5–9.0 and e9.5–10.0) during early pancreas development that allows for a change in the phenotypic programming of cells destined to become endocrine cells and, at a later developmental stage, the program cannot be changed. However, these temporal considerations must take into account the spatial constraints of gene expression likely to be at play; Idx-1 appears to be expressed in early pancreatic precursor cells, whereas insulin is presumably expressed in cells already committed to become β cells. How can the phenotype of the coexpression of Idx-1, Brn-4, insulin, and glucagon in the transient transgenic mice in this study be explained? Our results rule out a dose effect of Brn-4 expression in pancreatic β cells. Brn-4 protein levels were equally elevated (Fig.1D, Western immunoblot) in mice transgenic for MIP-Brn-4 that expressed high levels of glucagon and for RIP-Brn-4 that did not have any detectable glucagon in pancreatic β cells. Protein levels of Idx-1 in pancreata (β cells) were no different in transgenic mice expressing either the MIP-Brn-4 or the RIP-Brn-4 transgenes (Fig.1D). It is worth noting the important report of Wanget al. (21Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) in which the introduction (transfection) of either Brn-4 or dominant negative Idx-1 expression vectors into the INS-1 clonal β cell line resulted in the ectopic expression of the proglucagon gene. The conclusions drawn from these studies were that Idx-1 suppresses and Brn-4 activates the ectopic expression of the proglucagon gene (21Wang H. Maechler P. Ritz-Laser B. Hagenfeldt K.A. Ishihara H. Philippe J. Wollheim C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25279-25286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These intriguing findings support our findings that interactions exist among Idx-1 and Brn-4 in determining the β cell versus α cell phenotype are also consistent with our findings, which found no effects of ectopic Brn-4 expression on levels of Idx-1 (and of Nkx6.1, Pax6, and CREB) in the pancreas of RIP-Brn-4 transgenic mice as compared with control mice (Fig. 1D). Although we observed that ectopic expression of Brn-4 in the undifferentiated AR42J islet progenitor cell line induced the expression of glucagon, it failed to do so in the differentiated MIN6 clonal β cell line (Fig. 3). The ectopic expression of Idx-1 in stably transfected glucagonoma cell lines induced the expression of the insulin gene yet did not extinguish the expression of proglucagon (30Serup P. Jensen J. Andersen F.G. Jorgensen M.C. Blume N. Holst J.J. Madsen O.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9015-9020Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These intriguing disparate findings of the effects of the ectopic expression of Brn-4 on the induction of proglucagon expression in insulin-producing β cells remain unexplained but may be attributable to the different experimental conditions and/or the different β cell lines used. Mice lacking the Pax6 gene have diminished numbers of α cells and β cells (18Sander M. Neubuser A. Ee J. Kalamaras H.C. Martin G.R. German M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1662-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 22St-Onge L. Sosa-Pineda B. Chowdhury K. Mansouri A. Gruss P. Nature. 1997; 387: 406-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, Pax6 has been shown to be important for the expression of the glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin genes, so it appears that Pax6 may be critical for the development of the endocrine pancreas phenotype development in general. A highly relevant report addresses the phenotypic consequences of the misexpression in transgenic mice of Pax6, a transcription factor important for pancreatic endocrine cell development and differentiation (31Yamaoka T. Yano M. Yamada T. Matsushita T. Ii M. Moritani S. Yoshimoto K. Hata J. Itakura M. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Pax6 was expressed under the control of the insulin and Idx-1 (Pdx-1) promoters. Transgenic mice generated with both promoters displayed disturbed β cell development with increased β cell apoptosis and diabetes. Pax6 overexpression under the control of the insulin promoter specifically affected β cells, whereas overexpression under the control of the MIP resulted in hypoplasia of the exocrine pancreas, increased proliferation of both ductal epithelia and islet cells, and the development of cystic malformations of the pancreas. The differences between our observations and those of Yamaokaet al. (31Yamaoka T. Yano M. Yamada T. Matsushita T. Ii M. Moritani S. Yoshimoto K. Hata J. Itakura M. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with Pax6 overexpression under apparent similar circumstances may be due to the different strains of mice used in our study and by Yamaoka et al. (31Yamaoka T. Yano M. Yamada T. Matsushita T. Ii M. Moritani S. Yoshimoto K. Hata J. Itakura M. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the fact that the phenotype they describe is present during postnatal life and not prenatal life (e18), as in our study. The transcription factor Nkx6.1 has been suggested to repress glucagon expression in β cells (1Edlund H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 13Jensen J. Heller R.S. Funder-Nielsen T. Pedersen E.E. Lindsell C. Weinmaster G. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Our present findings of the expression of Brn-4 in pancreatic β cells along with unaltered Nkx6.1 expression suggest that the presence of Nkx6.1 alone is not sufficient to suppress glucagon gene expression in differentiating pancreatic endocrine cells, particularly if Brn-4 is expressed early in mouse pancreas development,i.e. under the control of the Idx-1 promoter. Our results are supported by a recent report that the earliest sign of α cell development appears to be Brn-4 expression, which apparently precedes Isl-1 expression (13Jensen J. Heller R.S. Funder-Nielsen T. Pedersen E.E. Lindsell C. Weinmaster G. Madsen O.D. Serup P. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 163-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 25Sussel L. Kalamaras J. Hartigan-O'Connor D.J. Meneses J.J. Pedersen R.A. Rubenstein J.L. German M.S. Development. 1998; 125: 2213-2221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our studies indicate that if Brn-4 is expressed early in the differentiation of pancreatic endocrine cells in conjunction with other transcription factors important for the epigenetic control of glucagon gene expression, it is capable of inducing permanent glucagon gene expression in the early cell lineage that becomes β cells. Whether this is due to a direct interaction of Brn-4 with the proximal G1 promoter element of the glucagon gene or via indirect mechanisms remains unanswered. One known target gene induced by Brn-4 is that encoding nestin, an intermediate filament protein expressed in neural stem cells (11Josephson R. Muller T. Pickel J. Okabe S. Reynolds K. Turner P.A. Zimmer A. McKay R.D. Development. 1998; 125: 3087-3100PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shimazaki T. Arsenijevic Y. Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Weiss S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 444-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Identification of the target genes of Brn-4 actions in the early stages of the development of pancreatic islet cells may lead to an understanding of how the differentiation of a common precursor endocrine cell into α cell versus β cell lineages is regulated.

Both PSA and hK2 are regulated by androgens and are synthesized and secreted by the epithelial cells of the prostate tubules (8Young C.Y. Montgomery B.J. Andrews P.E. Qiu S. Bilhartz D.L.

PSA acts on semenogelin I and II, the major gel-forming proteins in seminal plasma, causing lysis of the seminal clot immediately after ejaculation (12Lilja H. World J. Urol. 1993; 11: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing is a common mechanism for producing functionally diverse proteins from a single gene (13Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). In addition to the major 1.6-kb mRNAs, multiple transcripts were found to originate from the KLK3 and KLK2 genes (14Henttu P. Lukkarinen O. Vihko P. Int. J.

Indeed, several alternatively spliced variants have been reported for both genes (15Riegman P.H. Klaassen P. van der Karput J.A. Romijn J.C. Trapman J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Yoshiki T. Yuasa T. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 56-59PubMed Google Scholar). The identity and function of the products encoded by the various KLK2 and KLK3 mRNA species are not known. Some of the transcripts formed by alternative splicing events in these genes are predicted to encode different isoforms of the original PSA and hK2 proteins. In this study, we identified alternative transcripts in each of these genes that arise from unusual splicing events in which sequences from the first intron remain linked to the first exon in the mature mRNA, creating new ORFs that encode for novel polypeptides. These proteins, named PSA-LM and K-LM, share only the signal peptide with PSA and hK2, respectively. In their mature form, their amino acid sequences differ completely from the kallikrein family and other proteins in the databases. Analysis of the pattern of expression of these novel alternative transcripts and their protein products suggests that, like PSA and hK2, they are up-regulated by androgens and are expressed primarily in the secretory cells of the prostate epithelium. The LEADSTM platform for clustering and assembly of genomic sequences, cDNAs and ESTs (www.labonweb.com/sitehtml/leads_overview_toc.html), was used to generate the LEADS Transcriptome Database, which includes predicted transcripts of human genes. The LEADS software models important parts of the transcription process, including alternative splicing. The LEADS databases built from GenBankTM versions 106.0 through 120.0 were searched for prostate-specific novel genes and splice variants. For this purpose, clusters were automatically screened according to the source tissue of the ESTs and cDNAs. Several clusters were composed mostly of transcripts from prostate tissues. The resulting clusters were then subjected to bioinformatic annotation and manually inspected. This analysis led to the identification of several ESTs that support the existence of alternative transcripts of the KLK3 gene, linking exon 1 with the adjacent intronic sequences, and coding for a putative novel protein (Fig. 1). Among these ESTs are AA506939,AA524970, AA528287, AI525636, and AI557311. Total RNA was extracted from cells using the Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH). Poly(A) RNA was isolated from total RNA using (dT)25Dynabeads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Reverse transcription (RT) was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl using 2 μg of total RNA from human tissues or cell lines and 2.5 units of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen), in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer and supplemented with 10 pmol of dT15 (Promega, Madison, WI) and 30 units of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR was carried out using 1 μl of the RT reaction, in the presence of 2 mmdNTPs, 25 pmol of primers, and 2.5 units of DNA polymerase mix of the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The following primers were used: PSA-LM-specific primers were the forward primer A (5′-CCGGAGAGCTGTGTCACCATGTG-3′), spanning the initiation codon of the PSA-LM ORF, and the reverse primer E (5′-AAGCAGCTGGGAGCAGGGAGCTG-3′), at positions 287–309 within the PSA-LM ORF. K-LM-specific primers were the forward primer H (5′- CTCTCCATCGCCTTGTCTGTGGG-3′) at position 16–38 of this ORF, and the reverse primer L (5′-GGACAGGGTTGAATGCTC-3′) located at nucleotides 19–36 immediately downstream of the stop codon. PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels, and their identity was verified by DNA sequencing. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) analysis was performed on poly(A) RNA from human prostate tissue using the Marathon cDNA Amplification Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Adaptor-ligated, double-stranded cDNA libraries were prepared essentially as suggested by the manufacturer. Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used for the first strand synthesis. First round PCR was performed on these libraries using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). All PCRs were carried out in the presence of 1.5 μg of anti-Taq monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels, purified, and sequenced. A nested PCR approach was used to isolate 5′- and 3′-RACE products. For 5′-RACE, first round PCR was carried out with an adaptor-specific primer and the PSA-LM-specific reverse primer E (described above). Nested PCR was then performed on these reactions using the reverse primer C (5′-CCCCAACCATGGCCCCTCTCAC-3′) at positions 47–68 in the PSA-LM ORF. For 3′-RACE, first round PCR was performed with the forward primer A (described above), and nested PCR with the forward primer B (5′-GTGAGAGGGGCCATGGTTGGGG-3′) derived from positions 47–68 of the PSA-LM ORF. Multiple Tissue Northern blot (MTNTM-Human II), containing poly(A) RNA samples from a variety of tissues, was purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Poly(A) RNA (2 μg) of LNCaP cells was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and blotted onto Nytran Super Charge membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Equal loading was verified by ethidium bromide staining of the gels. Probes were labeled using the Random Primer DNA Labeling Mix (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) and [α-32P]dCTP. Hybridization was carried out in the EZ-Hybridization Solution (Biological Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel) at 68 °C for 18 h. The membranes were rinsed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, followed by two washes with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. Autoradiograms were obtaining by exposing the membranes to x-ray films. Quantification was performed by densitometric analysis of hybridizing bands from scanned autoradiograms. The following probes were obtained by RT-PCR. PSA probe was a product of a forward primer (5′-CTTGCTGGGTCGGCACAGCCTG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-GGTCCCCAGTGCTGGCTCCTGG-3′), both derived from exon 3 of the KLK3 gene. The PSA-LM probe was a product of the forward primer D (5′-CCAACCCAGCACCCCAGCCCA-3′) at positions 121–141 within the PSA-LM ORF and the reverse primer E (see above). The K-LM probe was obtained with the forward primer J (5′-CCCAGCCTCGTCCCTTCAGCC-3′) and the reverse primer K (5′-GGGACCAGTGGCATGGAGAGAGG-3′), at positions 122–142 and 347–369, respectively, within the K-LM ORF. A 780-bp probe used for the analysis of hormonal regulation of PSA-LM was derived from intron 1 sequences by RT-PCR, using the forward primer D and the reverse primer M (5′-GGTGCTAGGAACCAGGGA- TAAGTG-3′). A PSA-LM-specific fragment was obtained by RT-PCR using the forward primer D (see above) and the reverse primer F (5′-GGAGGTGGACCAGTGATACGGTCCAAG-3′) derived from the 3′-untranslated region of PSA-LM at positions 81–107 downstream of the stop codon. This fragment was then cloned into the pT-Adv vector (CLONTECH). Clones in opposite orientations were used to prepare sense and antisense riboprobes by digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prostate sections were prepared as described for immunohistochemistry (see below). In situ hybridization was performed essentially according to the procedure described by Roche Molecular Biochemicals (20Roche Molecular BiochemicalsNon-radioactive in Situ Hybridization Application Manual. 2nd Ed. Basel, Switzerland1996: 34-56Google Scholar). After deparaffinization and rehydration, sections were digested with proteinase K (10 μg/ml) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, for 20 min at 37 °C. Hybridization with 0.2–1 μg/ml digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes was carried out in hybridization buffer (2× SSC, 50% formamide, 0.02% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) for 4–5 h at 60 °C. Hybridization was followed by three 20-min washes with 1× SSC and 50% formamide at 55 °C, and two 15-min washes with 1× SSC at room temperature. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody was used at 1:500 dilution for 90 min at room temperature, and detection was obtained by the addition of nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate for 15 min at room temperature. The human prostatic adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was propagated in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum. When cells reached 70% confluency, the culture medium was replaced by phenol red-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum for 24 h, followed by addition of 10 nm methyltrienolone (R1881, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or testosterone (Fluka) for periods of 9–48 h. The complete coding sequences of K-LM or PSA-LM were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the pcDNA4/Myc-His mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), enabling the synthesis of proteins fused to the Myc and His epitope tags at the C terminus. LNCaP cells, at about 70% confluency, were transfected with these expression constructs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, spent media were collected, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and lysed in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (CompleteTM, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins from the culture medium were immunoprecipitated using c-Myc-conjugated agarose beads (9E10 AC, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 33–51 of PSA-LM (NH2-CQAEALSPPTQHPSPDREL-COOH) and residues 85–104 of K-LM (NH2-PSQIPAPSCFTKEQVPRHLC-COOH) were synthesized. Polyclonal antibodies were raised by immunizing rabbits with the PSA-LM and K-LM peptides conjugated to bovine serum albumin and keyhole limpet hemocyanin, respectively. The anti-PSA monoclonal antibody used for immunoblot analysis was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (A67-B/E3). The anti-PSA monoclonal antibody used for immunohistochemistry was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). A mouse monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Tissue extracts, prepared in RIPA buffer, and cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and subjected to immunodetection using a commercial anti-Myc antibody or the immunized sera described above. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were used as secondary antibodies. Proteins were visualized with the SuperSignal West Pico or West Femto ECL systems (Pierce). Human prostate samples, taken from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and 3-μm sections were prepared and mounted on OptiPlusTM slides (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). Deparaffinization was performed with xylene for 10 min, and the sections were rehydrated by rinsing three times with 100% ethanol and once in 95% ethanol. Slides were washed in double distilled H2O and then incubated with 3% H2O2 for 5 min. Subsequently, the slides were washed again in double distilled H2O and twice in OptimaxTM Wash Buffer (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using HistostainTM Plus Bulk Kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). The anti-PSA-LM and K-LM polyclonal antibodies, raised in the course of this study, were used at 1:100 and 1:50 dilutions, respectively. Counterstaining with hematoxylin was employed. Seminal plasma, obtained from ejaculates after removal of spermatozoa by centrifugation, was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing a protease inhibitor mixture. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, followed by immunodetection as described above. The nucleotide sequence for the PSA-LM transcript that contains all of intron 1 has been deposited in the GenBankTM database under accession number AF335478. The second PSA-LM-encoding transcript, derived by alternative splicing within intron 1, has been deposited under GenBankTM accession number AF335477. The K-LM encoding transcript was deposited under GenBankTM accession number AF336106. We found prostate-derived, alternatively spliced variants of the PSA-encoding KLK3 gene by searching the LEADS Human Transcriptome Database (see “Experimental Procedures”). These variants include all or part of intron 1, thereby linking the first exon to the adjacent intronic sequences. RT-PCR was carried out with primers derived from both sides of this sequence in order to verify the existence of such transcripts in prostate samples. This sequence was then elongated using the RACE methodology. A new open reading frame (ORF) of 312 nucleotides was revealed, beginning with the start codon of PSA and ending in a stop codon within the sequences adjacent to exon 1, which are spliced out as intron 1 in the PSA mRNA (Fig. 1). To characterize these transcripts, RT-PCR was performed with a forward primer from this ORF and reverse primers derived from each of the downstream PSA exons. Sequence analysis of the PCR products indicated that the remaining PSA introns are spliced out and that PSA coding exons 2–5 are located downstream of the stop codon of this ORF, serving therefore as 3′-untranslated sequences (Fig. 1). In addition, this analysis revealed the use of an alternative donor splice site within intron 1 (Fig. 1). The putative novel protein predicted by this new ORF, which we designated PSA-linked molecule (PSA-LM), is 104 amino acids long and shares amino acid sequence identity with PSA only in the N-terminal 15 amino acids that encompass the signal peptide of the pre-form protein (Fig. 2 A). Thus, the mature PSA and PSA-LM proteins are entirely different. Based on the close similarity between the KLK3 and KLK2 genes, and the high level of homology between their non-coding sequences, including introns (3Lundwall A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 6Riegman P.H. Vlietstra R.J. van der Korput J.A. Romijn J.C. Trapman J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (80% in intron 1), we looked for evidence of similarly spliced transcripts in the KLK2 gene. Analysis of the intronic sequences adjacent to exon 1 disclosed an ORF of 423 nucleotides, beginning with the start codon of hK2 within exon 1 and ending in a stop codon within intron 1 of the KLK2 gene. We verified the existence of alternative transcripts that include intron 1 and contain this ORF by performing RT-PCR on prostate samples, using a forward primer at the beginning of this ORF and a reverse primer immediately after the stop codon. In analogy to PSA-LM, the putative 141-amino acid protein specified by this new ORF, K-LM (hK2-linked molecule), shares with hK2 only the N-terminal 15 amino acids, which includes the signal peptide (Fig. 2 B), and its mature form displays no similarity with hK2. The PSA-LM and K-LM proteins exhibit 32% identity and 51% similarity with each other. These novel proteins show no similarity to any other protein in the databases and contain no known protein signatures. Interestingly, however, the PSA-LM and K-LM proteins are rich in proline residues (16 and 17%, respectively) and in serine/threonine residues (15 and 19%). Proline-rich proteins often serve as adaptor molecules, bringing together other proteins (reviewed in Ref. 21Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 22Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar). However, it is not clear whether the proline-rich sequences play a role in the biological function of these novel polypeptides. The tissue-specific expression of PSA-LM was analyzed by RT-PCR, using a primer from exon 1 and a reverse primer derived from intron 1 within the new ORF. Out of 12 different tissues and cell lines examined, the expected PCR fragment was detected only in prostate and in the prostate-derived cell line LNCaP (Fig. 3 A and data not shown). RT-PCR analysis also showed prostate-specific expression of the K-LM-encoding transcript (data not shown). The expression pattern of these transcripts was further studied by Northern blotting (Fig. 3 B). A probe derived from exon 3 of PSA detected a major transcript of about 1.6 kb only in prostate (Fig. 3 B, left panel). Additional minor bands of about 1.9, 3, 5, and 6.5 kb were also observed, in agreement with previous reports (14Henttu P. Lukkarinen O. Vihko P. Int. J. Cancer. 1990; 45: 654-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,15Riegman P.H. Klaassen P. van der Karput J.A. Romijn J.C. Trapman J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 155: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A probe specific for PSA-LM, derived from its coding sequences within intron 1, detected RNA transcripts only in prostatic tissue. These were the same size as the larger bands seen with the PSA probe (Fig. 3 B, middle panel). This is not surprising because the PSA probe is included in the PSA-LM 3′-UTR and should therefore also detect the PSA-LM-encoding transcripts. The relative intensity of these bands in the left panel of Fig. 3 B implies that the PSA-specific transcript of 1.6 kb is considerably more abundant. Prostate-specific transcripts were also detected with a probe derived from the K-LM ORF (Fig. 3 B, right panel). The exact nature of the higher bands observed with these probes is not clear. They might represent precursors of mature mRNAs or complex alternative splicing patterns, because several spliced products as well as alternative polyadenylation have been described for both the KLK2 and KLK3 genes (15Riegman P.H.

Yoshiki T. Yuasa T. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 56-59PubMed Google Scholar). The transcript of about 3 kb might result from inclusion of intron 1, which contains the novel ORF, as described in Fig. 1 A. Inclusion of all introns would result in a transcript of about 5 kb, whereas the addition of a 1.5-kb-long 3′-UTR, as reported by Liu et al. (17Liu X.F. Essan M. Vasmatzis G. Lee B. Pastan I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), could explain the 6.5-kb transcript. The androgenic transcriptional activation of the KLK2 and KLK3 genes has been studied extensively (8Young C.Y. Montgomery B.J. Andrews P.E. Qiu S. Bilhartz D.L. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3748-3752PubMed Google Scholar, 9Young C.Y. Andrews P.E. Montgomery B.T. Tindall D.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Riegman P.H.

We analyzed the effects of androgenic stimulation on the expression of PSA-LM using the androgen-responsive LNCaP cell line. After 24 h of hormonal depletion, cells were fed on charcoal-striped serum in the absence or presence of either testosterone or a synthetic androgen (R1881). Northern blot analysis with a probe derived from exon 3 of PSA showed a strong induction of the 1.6-kb PSA-encoding transcript after exposure to 10 nm R1881 (Fig. 4, left panel) or testosterone (data not shown) for 9 h, conditions previously shown to yield maximal expression of PSA mRNA (8Young C.Y. Montgomery B.J. Andrews P.E. Qiu S. Bilhartz D.L. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3748-3752PubMed Google Scholar). Under these conditions, a 2–6-fold up-regulation of the 3-, 5-, and 6.5-kb transcripts was also detected using a 780-bp probe derived from intron 1 that spans the PSA-LM ORF without the signal peptide common to PSA (Fig. 4,right panel). The nature of the other bands observed with this probe is not clear. Higher levels of PSA and PSA-LM mRNAs were also observed up to 48 h (data not shown). Analysis of prostate sections by in situ hybridization indicated specific expression of the PSA-LM-encoding transcripts in the secretory epithelial cells of the prostate tubules (Fig. 5). Expression of PSA in the prostate has also been shown to be restricted to these cells (8Young C.Y. Montgomery B.J. Andrews P.E. Qiu S. Bilhartz D.L. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3748-3752PubMed Google Scholar, 25Qui S. Young C.Y.F. Bilhartz D.L. Prescott J.L. He W.W. Tindall D.J. J. Urol. 1990; 144: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that expression of PSA and PSA-LM undergo similar modes of transcriptional regulation. Polyclonal antibodies were generated against synthetic peptides derived from the amino acid sequences of PSA-LM and K-LM. In order to verify the specificity of these antibodies, the full coding sequences of PSA-LM and K-LM were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA4, tagged with Myc and His epitopes. LNCaP cells were transfected with these constructs, and after 48 h the culture medium was collected, and cells were harvested and lysed. Immunoblot analysis of the transfected cell lysates, using an anti-Myc antibody or our polyclonal antibodies, showed expression of PSA-LM and K-LM (Fig. 6, A and B, left and middle panels). The observed sizes of these recombinant proteins (13 and 20 kDa, respectively) are similar to those predicted from their amino acid sequence (11 and 15 kDa), with the addition of about 3 kDa of the epitope tags. The additional bands observed in Fig. 6 B most likely represent cross-reacting proteins, as they were not detected with other sera raised against K-LM (not shown). The secretion of these proteins to the growth medium of the transfected cell cultures was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using anti-Myc-coupled beads, followed by immunodetection with the specific antibodies (Fig. 6, A and B, right panels). Endogenous PSA-LM and K-LM proteins could not be detected in LNCaP cells or other prostate-derived cells either prior or following androgenic stimulation (data not shown), perhaps due to low protein levels. Immunohistochemistry analysis of prostate sections using our PSA-LM and K-LM polyclonal antibodies and a monoclonal antibody against PSA, showed that the three proteins are detected only in the secreting cells of the tubule lumen (Fig. 7). The specific staining observed within the lumen of some of the tubules in Fig. 7 could reflect the secretion of these proteins. It is important to bear in mind, however, that the cross-reacting bands detected with the anti-K-LM antibodies in Fig. 6 B raise questions about the specificity of these antibodies and the interpretation of the immunostaining data presented in Fig. 7 C. The presence of a common signal peptide, the secretion of the recombinant proteins upon transfection to LNCaP cells, and the specific expression in the prostatic secretory epithelial cells strongly suggest that, like PSA and hK2 (26Lovgren J. Valtonen-Andre C. Marsal K. Lilja H. Lundwall A. J. Androl. 1999; 20: 348-355PubMed Google Scholar), PSA-LM and K-LM are secreted to the seminal fluid. Immunoblot analysis of samples of semen plasma and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) identified a major form of the native K-LM protein, appearing as 27 kDa (Fig. 8). The appearance of this and fainter bands in these samples, which are bigger than the expected size of this protein, could be due to post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation. This assumption gains support from the presence of several putative glycosylation sites in its amino acid sequence (not shown). We failed to identify the PSA-LM protein in these samples, perhaps due to lower expression levels, lower sensitivity of antibodies, protein instability, or masking by other proteins as in the case of complexed PSA (27Carroll P.R. Urology. 2001; 57: 591-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The alternative transcripts of the KLK2 and KLK3 genes described here share the same 5′-untranslated sequences and start codon with the major mRNA species of the respective gene. In addition, the novel alternative protein products have the same signal peptide required for secretion of the original proteins encoded by these genes. Thus, PSA-LM and K-LM are expected to undergo the same mode of hormonal regulation, expression, and secretion as the PSA and hK2 proteins. This assumption is indeed supported by the data presented here. Our observations indicate that expression of PSA-LM is restricted to the glandular epithelium of the prostate and is up-regulated by androgens, implying that the same control elements regulate the transcription of the mRNAs that specify the two distinct protein products of the KLK3 gene. In addition, similar to PSA and hK2, the K-LM protein appears to be secreted to the seminal fluid. There are only a few examples of dual utilization of a single promoter to yield two polypeptides that, in their mature form, differ entirely in their amino acid sequences. One extensively studied example is calcitonin and the calcitonin gene-related peptide. In this case, the two transcripts share the first three exons and have the same initiation codon. However, tissue-specific alternative RNA processing associated with differential use of polyadenylation sites, followed by N-terminal proteolytic cleavage, generate two peptide hormones with completely different structures and functions (28Lou H. Gagel R.F.J. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another example is the leptin receptor and the leptin receptor gene-related protein (OBR/OB-RGRP): alternative splicing yields two transcripts that share only the first two 5′-untranslated exons, but the coding exons are entirely different, resulting in two polypeptides with no sequence similarity (29Bailleul B. Akerblom I. Strosberg A.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2752-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The current scientific literature on the physiology and pathobiology of PSA is somewhat controversial, and the physiological role of PSA is still not clear (2Diamandis E.P. Clin. Chem. 2000; 46: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the biological functions of PSA may be influenced by the activity of other kallikreins, such as hK2, the activating enzyme of the pro-form of PSA (7Rittenhouse H.G. Finlay J.A. Mikolajczyk S.D. Partin A.W. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1998; 35: 275-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 10Kumar A. Mikolajczyk S.D. Goel A.S. Millar L.S. Saedi M.S.

Commun. 1997; 238: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Efforts are underway to supplement PSA diagnostics with other markers aimed in particular at enhancing the discrimination between patients with benign disease and those with prostate cancers. The hK2 protein is now emerging as an additional prostatic tumor marker that might have clinical applications complementary to those of PSA (7Rittenhouse H.G. Finlay J.A. Mikolajczyk S.D. Partin A.W. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1998; 35: 275-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Additional studies are required to evaluate the involvement of PSA-LM and K-LM in the biology of PSA and hK2, as well as in signaling pathways that lead to the progression of prostate cancer. Such studies may also clarify their potential clinical value. We thank N. Almogy and N.

The sites of peroxynitrite-induced tyrosine nitration in TH have been identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry and tyrosine-scanning mutagenesis. V8 proteolytic fragments of nitrated TH were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A peptide of 3135.4 daltons, corresponding to residues V410-E436 of TH, showed peroxynitrite-induced mass shifts of +45, +90, and +135 daltons, reflecting nitration of one, two, or three tyrosines, respectively. These modifications were not evident in untreated TH. The tyrosine residues (positions 423, 428, and 432) within this peptide were mutated to phenylalanine to confirm the site(s) of nitration and assess the effects of mutation on TH activity. Single mutants expressed wild-type levels of TH catalytic activity and were inactivated by peroxynitrite while showing reduced (30–60%) levels of nitration. The double mutants Y423F,Y428F, Y423F,Y432F, and Y428F,Y432F showed trace amounts of tyrosine nitration (7–30% of control) after exposure to peroxynitrite, and the triple mutant Y423F,Y428F,Y432F was not a substrate for nitration, yet peroxynitrite significantly reduced the activity of each. When all tyrosine mutants were probed with PEO-maleimide activated biotin, a thiol-reactive reagent that specifically labels reduced cysteine residues in proteins, it was evident that peroxynitrite resulted in cysteine oxidation. These studies identify residues Tyr423, Tyr428, and Tyr432 as the sites of peroxynitrite-induced nitration in TH. No single tyrosine residue appears to be critical for TH catalytic function, and tyrosine nitration is neither necessary nor sufficient for peroxynitrite-induced inactivation. The loss of TH catalytic activity caused by peroxynitrite is associated instead with oxidation of cysteine residues.

The mechanisms by which 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine damages dopamine neurons are complex and are thought to involve, at least in part, the production of peroxynitrite (ONOO−) (2.Blum D.

It can also cause lipid peroxidation and DNA damage and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, effects that contribute to its cytotoxic potential (6.Groves J.T. Curr. Opin. Chem.

Based on the importance of TH to dopamine neuronal function, and considering the possibility that ONOO− causes the inhibition of TH as an early event in the process of dopamine neuronal degeneration (1.Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and tyrosine-scanning mutagenesis have identified tyrosines 423, 428, and 432 as the sites of ONOO−-induced nitration. Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (DTNB),p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (pCMB), Me2SO, glutathione, bradykinin, bovine pancreatic insulin, and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and glutathione-agarose were obtained from Sigma. Catalase and a monoclonal antibody against TH were products of Boehringer Mannheim. Thrombin and pGEX vectors were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protease V8 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Guanidine hydrochloride was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Tetrahydrobiopterin was purchased from Dr. Shircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). A monoclonal antibody against nitrotyrosine was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI), and horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-mouse IgGs were products of Cappel. Trypsin, PEO-maleimide-activated biotin (PMAB), and Immunopure TMB peroxidase kits were obtained from Pierce.N-biotinoyl-N-(iodoacetyl)ethylene diamine (BIAM) was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc.

Restriction endonucleases, T4 ligase, and T4 kinase were products of New England Biolabs. Acetonitrile and trifluoroacetic acid were HPLC grade, and all other reagents were obtained from commercial sources in the highest possible qualities. TH was cloned by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein as previously described (3.Kuhn D.M. Aretha C.W. Geddes T.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10289-10294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,21.Kuhn D.M. Arthur Jr., R.E. Thomas D.M. Elferink L.A. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Tyr-to-Phe site-directed mutagenesis of TH was carried out for each of its 17 tyrosine residues (22.Grima B. Lamouroux A. Blanot F. Biguet N.F. Mallet J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) via splicing by overlap extension (23.Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). For selected tyrosine residues (see below), double and triple tyrosine mutants were also created. Automated nucleotide sequencing confirmed all mutations. Recombinant fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, and the glutathioneS-transferase fusion tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, resulting in highly purified TH preparations (>95% pure). ONOO− was synthesized by the quenched-flow method of Beckman et al. (24.Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined by the extinction coefficient ε302 = 1670m−1 cm−1. The hydrogen peroxide contamination of ONOO− solutions was removed by manganese dioxide chromatography and filtration (24.Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar). ONOO−(100–500 μm) was added to TH (10 μm with respect to the 60-kDa monomer) with vigorous mixing in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, and incubations were carried out for 15 min at 30°C. The volume of ONOO−added to the enzyme samples was always less than 1% (v/v) and did not influence pH. Upon completion of incubation with ONOO−, samples were diluted 1:10 with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6, and stored at 4°C. Residual TH activity was assayed according to the method of Lerner et al. (25.Lerner P. Nose P. Ames M.M. Lovenberg W. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). TH and ONOO−-treated TH (TH-ONOO−) were individually purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The HPLC system consisted of two Waters 6000 pumps (controlled by a personal computer) in line with a Spectroflow 757 UV detector set at 214 nm. A gradient of 20–65% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was applied in a 60-min time period over a Vydac C18 (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pores) column. Fractions corresponding to the whole protein were collected and dried in a vacuum system. Seventy micrograms of TH and 70 μg of TH-ONOO− were individually reconstituted in 60 μl of 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 50 mm Trizma hydrochloride buffer, pH 8.0. To this was added 330 μl of water and 330 μl of 1 mmCaCl2 in 50 mm Trizma hydrochloride, pH 7.6. Three micrograms of protease V8 (in 3 μl) was added to each sample, which was mixed and allowed to sit for 18 h at room temperature. Samples were then evaporated under vacuum to ∼200 μl followed by the addition of 1.6 μl of trifluoroacetic acid. Next, they were purified by C18 ZipTip (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) application and eluted into 5 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile (1:1) saturated with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. One microliter was then spotted onto a gold-plated MALDI plate to which had been applied an ultrathin layer of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid according to the method of Cadene and Chait (27.Cadene M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 5655-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To obtain better MALDI-TOF MS ion counting statistics for the triply nitrated species, 40 μg of the V8 digest was separated by microbore HPLC, and fractions were collected corresponding to the nitrated species. Microbore HPLC conditions were as follows. Flow rate was set at 0.05 ml/min across a 150 × 1.0-mm column with the same sorbent as above. Solvent A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water containing 10 mm EDTA-free acid. Solvent B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 98:2 acetonitrile/water containing 10 mm EDTA free acid. A gradient of 0% B to 45% B was applied linearly over 60 min. The fraction corresponding to the triply nitrated species was dried under a vacuum and reconstituted in 1 μl of the above matrix solution, and 0.5 μl was spotted onto a MALDI plate. MALDI mass spectra were acquired on a Voyager DE-STR TOF mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. In linear mode, the accelerating voltage was set to 20,000 V with grid voltage at 95%, guide wire turned off, and extraction delay time at 400 ns. In reflector mode, the accelerating voltage was set to 20,000 V with grid voltage at 76%, mirror voltage ratio at 1.12, guide wire at 0.05%, and extraction delay time at 310 ns. Time of flight to mass conversion was achieved with the use of external standards of bradykinin (monoisotopic calculated mass for [M + H]+ = 1060.57 Da; average mass for [M + H]+ = 1061.22 Da) and bovine pancreatic insulin (average calculated mass for [M + H]+= 5734.56 Da; average calculated mass for [M + 2H]2+ = 2867.78 Da). Following treatment with ONOO−, wild type TH and all Tyr-to-Phe mutants were analyzed for nitrotyrosine content by ELISA and Western blotting. ELISA was used in initial screens of TH tyrosine nitration because of its sensitivity and high sample throughput capability. Once Tyr-to-Phe mutants were identified that were reduced in the extent to which they were tyrosine-nitrated by ONOO−, these mutants were analyzed by Western blotting as well. ELISA assays were optimized to determine nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in TH preparations. Control and ONOO−-treated TH samples containing 200 ng of protein were adsorbed overnight at 4 °C to 96-well Nunc-Immuno plates with Maxi-Sorp surfaces. Sample wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then blocked with nonfat dry milk (5% w/v) for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody against nitrotyrosine (1:1000 dilution in nonfat dry milk). Following three washes with phosphate-buffered saline, wells were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution in nonfat dried milk) at room temperature for 2 h. Immunopure TMB peroxidase substrate was added to wells, and absorbance was read in a microtiter plate reader at 550 nm. Under these conditions, absorbance readings for nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity in TH were linear up to 500 ng of protein/well. All samples were applied to plates in triplicate. Untreated wild-type TH and ONOO−-nitrated TH samples were applied to wells throughout the plate as internal controls. For Western blotting, TH preparations were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels according to Laemmli (28.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (0.1% v/v) and 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with a monoclonal antibody specific for nitrotyrosine. After incubations with primary antibodies (diluted 1:2000), blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (diluted 1:5000), and immunoreactive protein bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence by exposure to Kodak Biomax MR film. Digital images of films were captured with a Sony CCD-IRIS/RGB color video camera, and relative pixel densities of protein bands were obtained. The effect of ONOO− on TH sulfhydryls was determined with the use of thiol-reactive biotinylation reagents as described by Kim et al. (29.Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PMAB and BIAM react selectively with reduced cysteines in proteins and do not react with cysteines that have been oxidized (29.Kim J.R. Yoon H.W. Kwon K.S. Lee S.R. Rhee S.G. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 214-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). These probes are not quantitative, but they allow a relative measure of the extent to which cysteine residues have been oxidized. Initial screening of the effects of ONOO− on the status of sulfhydryls in TH (wild-type and all mutants) was carried out with ELISA as described above for the determination of nitrotyrosine content of TH. Untreated or ONOO−-treated TH was diluted 1:2 with 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.5 or pH 8.5, for subsequent labeling with PMAB (50 μm) or BIAM (50 μm), respectively. Proteins were labeled for 60 min at room temperature in the dark, after which they were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotting to nitrocellulose. Remaining samples were diluted 1:50 with phosphate-buffered saline, and 50 ng of protein was applied to 96-well plates. Blots and plates were then processed as described above with the exception that horseradish peroxidase-linked avidin (diluted 1:500 in nonfat dry milk) was used in place of a secondary antibody, and biotin reactivity was visualized by ECL. Absorbance readings for the biotinylated labels on 96-well plates were linear up to 200 ng per well. Wild-type TH (10 μm) was treated at 30 °C for 15 min with varying concentrations of the selective sulfhydryl reagents pCMB or DTNB as described above for ONOO−. Following treatment, TH samples were diluted 1:10 with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6. Residual TH activity was assayed, or samples were probed with PMAB as described above. The V8 partial cleavage fragment containing amino acid residues 410–436 (VRAFDPDTAAVQPYQDQTYQPVYFVSE) was obtained in good yield and used to determine the nitration status of tyrosine residues 423, 428, and 432 after treatment of intact TH with ONOO−. The calculated average mass for [M + H]+ of the native peptide is 3136.40 Da; the observed peak at m/z3136.0 in linear mode and at m/z 3136.46 in reflector mode represented the protonated species. Treatment of TH with ONOO− produced four congeners of the protein consisting of 0–3 nitration events per molecule, with each nitro group adding 45 Da to the V8 fragment. Thus, peaks at m/z 3181.48,m/z 3226.88, and m/z3271.85 (Fig. 1) correspond to one, two, and three nitration events per protein molecule, respectively. Peaks occurring 16 and 32 units lower than those representing nitration correspond to products from prompt fragmentation caused by the immediate loss of an oxygen from a nitro group to form a nitroso species, followed by loss of a second oxygen possibly to form a nitrene or dehydroazepine species as outlined by Sarver et al. (30.Sarver A. Scheffler N.K. Shetlar M.D. Gibson B.W. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Untreated TH did not produce any peaks in the m/zrange corresponding to the nitrated peptides (data not shown). Two additional, unrelated peaks are present in the mass spectra of both the ONOO−-treated and untreated samples. The peak atm/z 3289 corresponds to V8 partial cleavage fragment Leu333–Glu363. The peak atm/z 3307 is unidentified but is not related to ONOO− treatment, since it is also present in the mass spectrum of the analogous V8 digestion fragment of untreated TH. The inset to Fig. 1 is an abbreviated segment of a better quality mass spectrum of only the triply nitrated species. To obtain the sample for this spectrum, another sample of ONOO−-treated TH was digested by V8, and the mixture was separated by HPLC, which allowed the differently nitrated peptides to be isolated and analyzed by MALDI-TOF. The peak atm/z 3271.4 in the inset mass spectrum in Fig. 1 corresponds to the triply nitrated species as shown in Fig. 1. Prompt fragmentation peaks are also seen in the inset at 16-unit multiples lower than the m/z 3271.4 peak (e.g. at m/z 3255.4 and 3239.8). The prompt fragmentation peaks appear larger for the triply nitrated species than for the doubly or singly nitrated species, because all three nitro groups in the triply nitrated species can undergo photodecomposition, leading to greater accumulation of lower mass species (i.e. increments of 16 Da). Each tyrosine residue within the 3135.4-Da peptide of TH was mutated to phenylalanine, and the effect of ONOO− on tyrosine nitration and enzyme activity expressed by these mutants was determined. Tyr225 was also mutated, because it was previously claimed to be the site of ONOO−-induced nitration (1.Ara J. Przedborski S. Naini A.B. Jackson-Lewis V. Trifiletti R.R. Horwitz J. Ischiropoulos H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7659-7663Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Fig. 2Apresents results with ONOO−-induced nitration of Y423F, Y428F, and Y432F as assessed by anti-nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity. The extent to which ONOO− caused nitration in these mutants was reduced by comparison with wild-type TH. Digital scans of the data in Fig. 2A indicated that Y423F nitration was reduced to 27% of control when normalized to the amount of TH protein in each sample (see Fig. 2B). Similarly, the nitration of Y428F and Y432F was reduced to 32 and 39% of control, respectively. All possible combinations of double tyrosine mutants were made among these tyrosines, and the ONOO−-induced nitration of these mutants is shown in Fig. 2A as well. It can be seen that nitration of Y423F/Y432F (6% of control), Y428F,Y432F (16% of control), and Y423F,Y428F (27% of control) was reduced more than seen with the single mutants. Finally, the triple tyrosine mutant Y423F,Y428F,Y432F was not nitrated by ONOO−(last lane of Fig. 2A). The removal of Tyr225 from TH resulted in a 20% increase in tyrosine nitration after ONOO− treatment. The effects of tyrosine mutagenesis on basal TH activity and on the extent to which ONOO− modified catalytic activity of the mutants are presented in Fig. 2C. Single or double mutations of Tyr423, Tyr428, and Tyr432 to phenylalanine were tolerated very well by the enzyme. All expressed levels of activity that were within 20% of wild-type TH, with the exceptions of Y423F,Y432F and Y428F,Y432F, whose basal levels of activity were 60 and 69% of wild type, respectively. The triple Y423F,Y428F,Y432F mutant showed somewhat more disruption of catalytic function, expressing basal levels of activity that were ∼20% of control. Fig. 2C also shows that ONOO− (100 μm) reduced the catalytic activity of wild type TH and each mutant, regardless of basal levels of activity. The effect of ONOO− on Y423F and Y428F was the same as its effect on wild-type enzyme, but the remaining mutants appeared to be more sensitive to inhibition. For example, ONOO− reduced the activity of Y432F to 20% of control, and the double mutants were inhibited by 80–85% as compared with a 50% inhibition of wild-type TH. The reduction in TH catalytic activity caused by ONOO−was significant for wild-type enzyme and for all mutants (p < 0.05, Bonferroni's test). Each of the remaining 14 tyrosines in TH, not described above for Fig. 2, was converted to phenylalanine individually, and the effects of ONOO− on the levels of enzyme activity and tyrosine nitration were determined. The results are presented in Table I. All Tyr-to-Phe mutants of TH retained catalytic activity, but some were sensitive to substitution. For example, the basal activities of Y200F and Y314F were about 40–45% of wild-type, and Y448F and Y463F expressed higher levels of activity than wild-type TH (35–40% increases). ONOO− treatment of each of these mutants caused a significant reduction in their activities. Y214F was most sensitive to inhibition, showing reductions in activity to 15% of control after ONOO− treatment. Y225F and Y371F were inhibited to 20% of control by ONOO−. The remaining mutants were inhibited by ONOO− to about the same extent as wild-type TH. Table I also shows that these same mutants were tyrosine-nitrated to the same extent as wild-type enzyme.Table ITyrosine-scanning mutagenesis of TH and the effects of ONOO−on catalytic activity and relative tyrosine nitrationTyrosine mutant1-aData for tyrosines 423, 428, and 432 are presented in Fig. 2 and are excluded from the table.TH activity1-bWild-type TH and all mutants (10 μm) were exposed to ONOO− (100 μm) for 15 min at 30 °C, after which samples were diluted 1:10 with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and remaining enzyme activity was determined.

https://openalex.org/W2049500058,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 binds to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and -II with high affinity and has been shown to modulate IGF-I actions in vivo and in vitro. The synthesis of IGFBP-1 is suppressed by insulin, and administration of IGFBP-1 to rats results in impaired glucose metabolism. A synthetic peptide (bp1-01) has been shown to have a high affinity and specificity for human IGFBP-1 and to inhibit IGF-I binding. The current studies were undertaken to determine if, after incubation of bp1-01 with IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complexes, anabolic and insulin-like effects of IGF-I could be detected in human hepatoma (HepG2) cell cultures and to determine the receptor subtype(s) through which these effects were mediated. Incubation of HepG2 cells with bp1-01 (200 nm) increased IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis by 44% and glycogen synthesis by 170% compared with stimulation by IGF-I alone. Incubation with bp1-01 also enhanced IGF-I-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1. Exposure of the cells to bp1-01 alone enhanced glycogen synthesis and phosphorylation of IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptors. This was not a direct effect of bp1-01 because it did not bind to the receptor and did not activate tyrosine kinase activity in the presence of an anti-IGF-I receptor antibody. The addition of bp1-01 (200 nm) plus insulin to HepG2 cell culture medium resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the hybrid receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, and the glycogen synthesis response compared with the effects of insulin alone. This enhancement of hybrid receptor phosphorylation and glycogen synthesis by bp1-01 peptide was diminished by preincubation with an inhibitory antibody for the α subunit of IGF-I receptor (αIR3). bp1-01 stimulated the hybrid receptor phosphorylation response to IGF-I, and this effect was inhibited by prior incubation of the cells with αIR3. In conclusion, bp1-01 competes with IGF-I for binding to IGFBP-1, which leads to release of free IGF-I from IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complexes. This released IGF-I stimulates biologic actions that are mediated predominantly through the IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptor.

Metabolism. 1993; 42: 409-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This increased IGFBP-1 is believed to contribute to the low free IGF-I concentrations that are present in poorly controlled diabetes (12.Clemmons D.R. Busby Jr., W.H. Synder D.K. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 727-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Administration of IGF-I to patients with type I or type II diabetes results in increased free IGF-I levels and improvement in insulin sensitivity (13.Usala A.-L. Madigan T.I. Burguera B. Sinha M.K.

Cooney G.J. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1991; 129: 2254-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and IGFBP-1 transgenic mice that overexpress rat IGFBP-1 show glucose intolerance (16.Rajkumar K. Barron D. Lewitt M.

Thus, the concentration of IGF-I that has unrestricted access to receptors appears to be a determinant of glucose metabolism, and in diabetes the plasma insulin levels partially regulate free IGF-I by control of IGFBP-1 concentrations. insulin-like growth factor insulin-like growth factor-binding protein insulin-like growth factor I receptor insulin receptor substrate 1 insulin receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium DMEM with high glucose DMEM with low glucose insulin-like growth factor insulin-like growth factor-binding protein insulin-like growth factor I receptor insulin receptor substrate 1 insulin receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium DMEM with high glucose DMEM with low glucose In previous studies, investigators used phage-display libraries to identify a disulfide-containing peptide (bp1-01, CRAGPLQWLCEKYF) that bound to the IGF-I binding site on human IGFBP-1 (18.Lowman H.B. Chen Y.M. Skelton N.J. Mortensen D.L. Tomlinson E.E. Sadick M.D. Robinson I.C. Clark R.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8870-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This peptide had a high affinity for human IGFBP-1, and it blocked human IGF-I binding to IGFBP-1 with an IC50 of 180 nm. It did not bind to forms of IGFBPs that are present in other species such as rat IGFBP-1, and it did not bind to human IGFBP-3. Based on these observations, we proposed that after binding of this peptide to IGFBP-1 in extracellular fluids, IGF-I would be released from the IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complexes and that if the appropriate receptors were present in the target cell type, the released IGF-I would stimulate IGF-I-like biological actions including enhancement of insulin-like actions. The current studies were undertaken using human heptoma (HepG2 cells). These cells synthesize IGFBP-1 and IGF-I and express both insulin and IGF-I receptors on their surface (19.Verspohl E.J. Roth R.A. Vigneri R. Goldfine I.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1436-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition, these cells express IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptors. These receptors are composed of one α and β insulin receptor subunit and one α and β subunit from the IGF-I receptor. These two half receptors are linked by a disulfide bond to form a hybrid heterotetramer (20.Treadway J.L. Frattali A.L. Pessin J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11801-11805Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This hybrid receptor has a relatively high affinity for IGF-I that is similar to the affinity of the IGF-I receptor homodimer and a much lower affinity for insulin (21.Soos M.A. Field C.E. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Hybrid receptors are widely distributed in human tissues including liver, spleen, skeletal muscle, and placenta (22.Baileys E.M. Nave B.T. Soos M.A. Orr S.R. Haywood A.C. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These hybrid receptors have been proposed to mediate IGF-I signaling in tissues where they represent the predominant receptor subtype (23.Belfore, A., Pandini, G., Vella, V., Squatrito, S., and Vigneri, R.Biochemistry 81, 403–407Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown increases in hybrid receptor abundance in skeletal muscle of patients with type II diabetes (24.Ferderici M. Zucaro L. Porio O. Massou R. Barboni P. Lauro D. Sesti G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2887-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and gene targeting experiments that disrupt the normal function of these receptors in skeletal muscle lead to the development of insulin resistance (25.Fernandez A.M. Kim J.K. Yakar S. Dupont J. Hernandez-Sanchez C. Castle A.L. Filmore J. Shuhan G.I. LeRoith D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The major aims of this study were to determine whether this peptide could compete with IGF-I for binding to IGFBP-1 in HepG2 cell conditioned medium, to determine whether release of IGF-I from IGFBP-1 would result in alteration in insulin and/or IGF-I actions, and to compare the relative importance of each receptor subtype in mediating these effects. Human hepatoma (HepG2) calls were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Tissue culture media, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Invitrogen. [35S]Methionine was from ICN Biochemical Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA), and d-[3H]glucose was from Amersham Biosciences. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes (Immobilon-P) were obtained from Millipore. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99), antibody for the β subunit of IGF-I receptor (β-IGFI-R) (C-20), and anti-insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) antibody (A-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Co. (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody for the α subunit of insulin receptor (αIR) (47-9 and 83-14) that has no cross-reactivity with IGFI-R was from NeoMarker (Fremont, CA), and the antibody for the β subunit of insulin receptor (βIR) that has no cross-reactivity with IGFI-R was from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). The antibody for the α subunit of IGFI-R (αIR3) was prepared and purified as described previously (26.Duan C. Hawes S.B. Prevette T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4280-4288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recombinant human IGF-I and IGFBP-1 binding peptide bp1-01 (CRAGPLQWLCEKYF) were gifts from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). 125I-IGF-I (150 uCi/μg) was prepared as described previously (27.D'Ercole A.J. Underwood L.E. Van Wyk J.J. Decude C.J. Foushee D.B. Pecile A. Muller R. Growth Hormone and Related Peptides. Excerta Medica, Amsterdam1976: 190-205Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (DMEM-H) (4 g/liter) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The cells were grown in 5% CO2:95% air at 37 °C and passaged using a split ratio of 1:4 after trypsinization. The capacity of IGFBP-1 in HepG2 conditioned medium to bind to 125I-IGF-I and the effect of increasing concentrations of bp1-01 on binding were determined using the polyethylene glycol precipitation method as described previously (28.Sakai K. D'Ercole A.J. Murphy L.J. Clemmons D.R. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Duplicate tubes containing125I-IGF-I (25,000 cpm/tube) were incubated with 5 μl of serum-free DMEM that had been conditioned by HepG2 cells for 30 h and 0–1 μm bp1-01 peptide for 2 h at room temperature. Bound IGF-I and free IGF-I were separated by precipitation using 12.5% polyethylene glycol (Mr 8,000). The pellets were washed in 6.25% polyethylene glycol, and bound125I-IGF-I was determined by gamma counting. HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence (6 × 104 cells/cm2) on 24-well culture plates. The cultures were rinsed twice with serum-free DMEM-H and incubated for 30 h in 0.25 ml of low-methionine (10−7m) DMEM (a mixture of 10% DMEM-H and 90% methionine-free DMEM-H). The cultures then received 0 or 200 nm bp1-01, various concentrations of IGF-I (0–150 ng/ml), and 0.05 μCi/well [35S]methionine (ICN Biochemical Inc.) (specific activity, 1,206 Ci/mmol). The incubation was continued for 4 h. The plates were placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and then exposed to 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min twice. The trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was solubilized in 0.2 ml of 1% SDS, 0.1 nNaOH, and 3 ml of scintillation mixture (ScintiSafeTMEcono2; Fischer Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) and then counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments) (29.Sakai K. Busby W.H. Clarke J.B. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8740-8745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). [3H]glucose (Amersham Biosciences) incorporation into glycogen was determined using a modification of the method of Widmer et al. (30.Widmer U. Schmid C. Zapf J. Froesch E.R. Acta Endocrinol. 1985; 108: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were seeded at a density of 6 × 104 cells/cm2 in 24-well culture plates in 1.0 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. After 24 h, the cells were washed twice with serum-free DMEM with low glucose (DMEM-L) (1.0 g/liter) and incubated for 24 h with the same medium. Either 0 or 200 nm bp1-01 and either IGF-I (0–150 ng/ml) or insulin (0–1 nm) plus 0.5 μCi ofd-[3H]glucose (specific activity, 34.0 Ci/mmol) were added directly, and the incubation was continued for 2 h. The medium was replaced with 200 μl of 0.2 nKOH containing 1 mg of glycogen, and cells were incubated for 40 min at 60 °C. The cell lysates were transferred to 12 × 75-mm tubes, and the incubation was continued for 1 h at 60 °C. The tubes were placed on ice, and 1 ml of cold ethanol (−20 °C) was added. Glycogen was separated by centrifugation at 5,000 × gfor 5 min, and the pellets were washed twice with 1 ml of cold ethanol containing 0.1% LiBr and 0.2 n KOH. The final precipitable radioactivity was solubilized in 0.2 ml of 0.2 n HCl and 2 ml of scintillation fluid and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. In some experiments, either the antibody for the IGFI-R (αIR3; 10 nm) and/or the insulin receptor (αIR (clone 47-9); 50 nm) was incubated with the cultures for 30 min before the addition of bp1-01, insulin, and [3H]glucose. HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence on 10-cm tissue culture dishes. The cells were rinsed three times with serum-free DMEM-H and incubated with the same medium for 30 h, and then various concentrations of bp1-01 (0–500 nm) were added directly, and the incubation was continued for 1.5 h. IGF-I (0 or 10 ng/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min. The cultures were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant (900 μg of protein) was incubated with either anti-β-IGFI-R antibody, anti-IRS-1 antibody, or anti-β-IR antibody (1:300 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were precipitated by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 7,000 ×g for 1 min and washed with lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors four times. The proteins were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.45-μm pore size). The membrane was probed with a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Super-Signal CL-H substrate system; Pierce) and then exposed to Kodak X-AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The signal intensities were quantified by scanning densitometry and analyzed using NIH Image. In the experiments where the effect of insulin was to be determined, the cells that had been exposed to serum-free medium for 30 h were incubated with bp1-01 for 1.5 h and then exposed to insulin (0–1 nm) for 5 min. Further processing was the same as that described for IGF-I stimulation. Total protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce). To identify IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptor and IGFI-R homodimers, HepG2 cells were solubilized in 1.0 ml of lysis buffer without a nonionic detergent. The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was incubated with anti-αIR monoclonal antibody (1.0 μg) for 18 h at 4 °C and then incubated with anti-mouse IgG-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C. The immobilized anti-mouse IgG-agarose was sedimented by centrifugation. The supernatant (1.0 ml) was incubated with an anti-β-IGFI-R polyclonal antibody (1 μg) for 18 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were conducted as described previously. To separate IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptors and the IR homodimer, the cells were lysed as described above, and then, after the removal of the insoluble material, the supernatant was incubated with anti-IGFI-R monoclonal antibody (αIR3) (1.0 μg) for 18 h at 4 °C, exposed to anti-mouse IgG-agarose for 3 h at 4 °C, and centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with anti-βIR polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution) for 18 h at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted as described previously. A paired Student's t test was used to compare difference between the control and the test groups. To determine whether bp1-01 peptide could compete with IGF-I for binding to the IGFBP-1 in HepG2 cell conditioned medium,125I-IGF-I binding was quantified in the presence of increasing concentrations of the bp1-01 peptide. Increasing concentrations of bp1-01 peptide inhibited IGF-I binding to IGFBP-1 in HepG2 conditioned medium, and half-maximal inhibition occurred with 140 nm, which is similar to the concentration reported by Lowman et al. (18.Lowman H.B. Chen Y.M. Skelton N.J. Mortensen D.L. Tomlinson E.E. Sadick M.D. Robinson I.C. Clark R.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8870-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) (e.g. 160 nm) using pure IGFBP-1 (Fig. 1). HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 24-well culture plates, and the ability of IGF-I to stimulate [35S]methionine incorporation into cellular protein in the presence of the bp1-01 peptide was determined. IGF-I stimulated the incorporation of [35S]methionine into HepG2 cells by 42 ± 2.1% above the basal level. Coincubation with bp1-01 (200 nm) increased this response to 83 ± 5.5% above the basal level (p < 0.05 compared with the effect of IGF-I alone) (Fig. 2). bp1-01 alone (200 nm) had no significant effect. Thus, the addition of bp1-01 peptide increased the IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis presumably by inhibiting IGF-I binding to IGFBP-1, thus allowing more IGF-I to be available to interact with the IGF-I receptor. IGF-I stimulated [3H]glucose incorporation into HepG2 cells by 162 ± 18% above control (Fig. 3A). The addition of bp1-01 (200 nm) with IGF-I enhanced the cell glycogen synthesis response to each concentration of IGF-I that was tested. The maximal response was a 317 ± 18% increase (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3A). Because HepG2 cells secrete IGF-I into culture medium, the ability of increasing concentrations of bp1-01 to stimulate glycogen synthesis in the absence of exogenously added IGF-I was determined. HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 24-well culture plates, and the [3H]glucose incorporation response to increasing concentrations of bp1-01 was measured. bp1-01 stimulated [3H]glucose incorporation into HepG2 cells up to 71.8 ± 8.0% above the basal level without the addition of IGF-I or insulin (Fig. 3B). To exclude the possibility that this was a direct effect of the bp1-01 peptide, the identical peptide concentrations were tested in the presence of the anti-IGFI-R antibody, αIR3 (an antibody that blocks IGF-I binding to IGFI-R). This antibody completely blocked the glycogen synthesis response to bp1-01 (p < 0.01). The antibody that blocks binding of insulin to the insulin receptor (αIR) partially blocked the glycogen synthesis response (p < 0.05), but it was not as effective as αIR3. To determine that bp1-01 was not binding to the IGFI-R or IR, we quantified 125I-bp1-01 binding and the effect of each anti-receptor antibody in competition for binding. Minimal binding (e.g. <0.1%) was detected, and it was not inhibited by either antibody (data not shown). These results are consistent with the conclusion that bp1-01 stimulated the dissociation of IGF-I from the IGF-I·IGFBP-1 complex and that the released IGF-I enhanced glycogen synthesis. Because the bp1-01 peptide enhanced the effect of IGF-I on glycogen and protein synthesis, we determined whether it could alter insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. When 1 nm insulin was incubated with HepG2 cells, it stimulated [3H]glucose incorporation by 54 ± 1.6% above the basal level (Fig. 4). The addition of bp1-01 increased the response to insulin stimulation further to 121 ± 6.8%. bp1-01 alone increased glucose incorporation by 48 ± 3.6%. This enhancement of the insulin-stimulated effect by bp1-01 was completely inhibited by preincubation of the cultures with αIR3 or αIR. The combination αIR3 plus αIR completely inhibited the response to insulin plus bp1-01 (Fig. 4). IGF-I can bind to both IGFI-R and IR; however, the affinity of the IR for IGF-I is substantially lower, therefore we used a relatively low concentration of IGF-I (e.g. 10 ng/ml) to analyze IGF-I receptor and IRS-1 activation. Immunoprecipitation of IGFI-R, IRS-1, and IR from HepG2 cells that had been stimulated by the addition of 10 ng/ml IGF-I followed by immunoblotting for phosphotyrosine revealed that IGF-I increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IGFI-R, IRS-1, and IR. The addition of bp1-01 to the culture medium during the incubation with IGF-I enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of IGFI-R (Fig. 5A), IRS-1 (Fig. 5B), and IR (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the addition of bp1-01 without IGF-I had no significant effect on IGFI-R phosphorylation, and it had no detectable effect on IR or IRS-1 phosphorylation. It should be noted that in this experiment, the effect of IGF-I on IR phosphorylation cannot be clearly separated from an effect on the hybrid IGF-I/IR receptor. Because only 10 ng/ml IGF-I was added, and this concentration is not adequate to compete with insulin for binding to insulin receptors, it is probable that most of the effect of IGF-I alone noted in Fig. 5C is due to stimulation of hybrid receptor phosphorylation. Similarly, the enhancement of the response to IGF-I noted in Fig. 5, A and B, could be due to enhanced hybrid receptor phosphorylation. To distinguish between these possibilities, HepG2 cells were exposed to IGF-I or bp1-01, and then the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αIR3. The remaining supernatant was immunoprecipitated with the βIR antibody. Fig. 6 shows that IGF-I and bp1-01 stimulated phosphorylation of hybrid receptors (top panel, lanes 3, 5, and 7), but they had no effect on IR phosphorylation (top panel, lanes 4,6, and 8). Furthermore, the effects of IGF-I and bp1-01 were additive. This result supports the conclusion that the result shown in Fig. 5C is due to phosphorylation of hybrid receptors and not insulin receptors. To determine the extent to which the response shown in Fig. 5A was due to hybrid receptor as compared with IGFI-R phosphorylation, the experiment was repeated as described in Fig. 5A, except that the lysates were immunoprecipitated with αIR3 first, and the remaining supernatant was immunoprecipitated with anti-β-IGFI-R. Similar to the results obtained in the experiment shown in Fig. 6, IGF-I and bp1-01 stimulated hybrid receptor phosphorylation but had a minimal effect on the IGFI-R phosphorylation (data not shown). Because the addition of bp1-01 enhanced the cellular response to insulin as well as IGF-I, we determined its effect on insulin-stimulated IR and IRS-1 phosphorylation. Insulin (1.0 nm) stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and IRS-1, and the addition of bp1-01 stimulated an additional increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of both IR (Fig. 7A) and IRS-1 (Fig. 7B) compared with insulin alone. In contrast, bp1-01 alone had no effect. When the experiment was repeated three times, scanning densitometry showed that the intensities of the phosphorylated IR or IRS-1 bands from the cultures that received bp1-01 followed by stimulation with 1 nm insulin were increased by 65 ± 5.9% and 120 ± 18%, respectively, above the level that was detected with insulin stimulation alone. Because bp1-01 enhanced the effect of insulin but had no effect when added alone, these results strongly suggest that peptide inhibitor increased the cellular responsiveness to insulin by increasing the interactions between free IGF-I and either IGFI-R or the IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptor. To determine which receptor(s) was mediating the effects of bp1-01, phosphorylation of IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptor and the insulin receptor were analyzed after insulin or bp1-01 exposure. Stimulation of HepG2 cells with 200 nm bp1-01 peptide alone showed enhanced phosphorylation of a band corresponding to the IGF-I/insulin hybrid receptor plus the insulin receptor (Fig. 8A, a, lane 3, 1). In contrast, IGFI-R phosphorylation was not increased (Fig. 8A, a, lane 4, 2). Insulin alone also stimulated phosphorylation of this band (Fig. 8A, a, lane 5, 1). The combination of bp1-01 plus insulin stimulated an additional increase (Fig. 8A, a, lane 7, 1). To distinguish between the portion of this effect that was due to stimulation of the hybrid IGF-I/insulin receptors (as compared with the insulin receptors), cells were exposed to αIR3 for 30 min before insulin addition. The addition of αIR3 completely inhibited the increase in hybrid receptor phosphorylation that was induced by the addition of bp1-01 (Fig. 8A, b, lane 3, 1). In contrast,"
https://openalex.org/W1981229938,"Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) is a homeodomain-containing transcriptional regulator responsible for the activation of thyroid- and lung-specific genes. It has been demonstrated that its DNA binding activity is redox-regulated in vitro through the formation of dimers and oligomeric species. In this paper, we demonstrate that the redox regulation mainly involves a Cys residue (Cys(87)), which resides out of the DNA binding domain, belonging to the N-transactivation domain. In fact, the oxidized form of a truncated TTF-1 (containing the N-transactivation domain and the DNA-binding domain, here called TTF-1N-HD) looses specific DNA binding activity. Since most of the oxidized TTF-1N-HD is in a monomeric form, these data indicate that the redox state of Cys(87) may control the DNA-binding function of the homeodomain, suggesting that Cys(87) could play an important role in determining the correct folding of the homeodomain. By using gel retardation and transient transfection assays, we demonstrate that the redox effector factor-1 (Ref-1) mediates the redox effects on TTF-1N-HD binding and that it is able to modulate the TTF-1 transcriptional activity. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments demonstrate the occurrence of interaction between Ref-1 and TTF-1N-HD. Having previously demonstrated that Ref-1 is able to modulate the transcriptional activity of another thyroid-specific transcription factor (Pax-8), our data suggest that Ref-1 plays a central role in the regulation of thyroid cells."

The negatively charged groups of the cytoplasmic domain of Band 3 protein also produce an allosteric effect on S-nitrosated Hb. Formation and deoxygenation of a SNO-Hb/Band 3 protein assembly does not in itself cause NO release, even in the presence of glutathione; however, this assembly may play a role in the migration of NO from the red blood cells to other targets and may be linked to Heinz body formation. Studies of the anaerobic oxidation of Hb S revealed an altered redox potential relative to Hb A0 that favors met-Hb formation and may therefore underlie the increased rate of autoxidation of Hb S under aerobic conditions, the increased formation of Heinz bodies in sickle cells, and the decreased lifetime of red cells containing Hb S.

Reaction of NO with oxygenated heme groups results in heme oxidation and nitrate formation. This process, like NO binding to deoxy-Hb, occurs rapidly and with a similar rate constant (10.Doyle M.P.

Biol. 1975; 91: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). As shown in this report, reactions of NO at the sulfhydryl groups of Hb also promote met-Hb formation.Several lines of study have shown that S-nitrosated Hb (SNO-Hb) can be formed in vivo and in vitro, and although present at low concentration, may be of importance in blood pressure regulation. Hb contains a highly conserved cysteine residue at position β93 whose reactions with NO may account for its persistence in hemoglobin's evolutionary history. A dynamic cycle of SNO-Hb formation in the lungs and NO release in the tissues was implicated by finding the presence of greater levels of SNO-Hb in aortic relative to venous blood (13.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). This cycle has, however, been brought into question. Notably, Gladwin and co-workers (14.Deem S. Gladwin M.T. Berg J.T. Kerr M.E. Swenson E.R. Am. J. Resp. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) did not see higher levels of SNO-Hb in aortic blood, even in patients given low levels of NO in breathing gas (4 μm NO delivered to 10 mmheme).It is now well established that the formation of SNO-Hb is under allosteric control (13.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Functional and crystallographic studies demonstrate that the βCys93 residues at which NO is bound in SNO-Hb A0 are more accessible in the high affinity conformation of oxy (R-state) Hb than in deoxy (T-state) Hb (6.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin and their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 15.Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev.

Nature. 1969; 222: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This conformational sensitivity results in a rate dependence for SNO-Hb formation that mirrors the greater relative exposure of βCys93 in conditions that favor the R-state. Allosteric considerations were also invoked to explain the decreased stability of the deoxy form of SNO-Hb (13.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar), but allosteric control of NO release from SNO-Hb in vivo is still under debate (14.Deem S. Gladwin M.T. Berg J.T. Kerr M.E.

In a purified condition, free of red blood cell constituents, SNO-Hb is sufficiently stable to allow oxygen binding studies (7.Bonaventura C. Ferruzzi G. Tesh S. Stevens R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24742-24748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and oxidation-reduction studies (this report) to be carried out over a period of several hours without significant loss of NO from the SNO-Hb derivative.Stamler and co-workers (19.Pawlowski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) recently presented evidence showing that interactions of SNO-Hb with the Band 3 protein on the erythrocyte membrane can facilitate NO release from SNO-Hb. Band 3 protein, also known as anion-exchanger AE1, mediates anion exchange through the erythrocyte membrane and interacts strongly with Hb A0(20.Low P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 21.Knauf P.A. Curr. Top. Membr. Transport. 1979; 912: 249-363Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 22.Walder J.A. Chatterjee R.

We show in this report that the cytoplasmic domain of Band 3 protein stabilizes the low affinity conformation of SNO-Hb A0, as previously reported for unmodified Hb A0(22.Walder J.A. Chatterjee R. Steck T.L. Low P.S. Musso G.F. Kaiser E.T. Rogers P.H. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10238-10246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but that these interactions do not in themselves cause release of NO from the SNO-Hb/Band 3 protein assembly. The release of NO may require a transport pathway and a series of transnitrosation reactions, but this has not been fully resolved.We previously reported that S-nitrosated forms of Hb A0 and Hb S have increased oxygen affinity, with increased R-state character that is most evident at low levels of oxygen saturation (7.Bonaventura C. Ferruzzi G. Tesh S. Stevens R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24742-24748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This finding, in light of the higher solubility of R-state Hb S relative to its T-state, prompted us to suggest thatS-nitrosation of Hb S might be viewed as a possible therapeutic approach to inhibition of Hb S polymer formation and alleviation of sickle cell disease (7.Bonaventura C. Ferruzzi G. Tesh S. Stevens R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24742-24748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As part of a study directed toward exploring this possibility, we report here the redox properties of unmodified and S-nitrosated forms of Hb A0and Hb S. As will be shown, the redox properties of Hb S were found to differ from those of Hb A0. Moreover,S-nitrosation shifts the redox potential of Hb A0 toward greater ease of oxidation, with smaller effects on Hb S. The shift of SNO-Hb forms of Hb A0 and Hb S toward the R-state, with higher oxygen affinity and greater ease of oxidation, probably involves a regional conformational alteration of the deoxy-Hb tetramer that prevents βHis146 from making its normal contribution to T-state stability. This was previously shown to be the case in Hb in which the SH-groups at βCys93 were modified by N-ethylmaleimide (16.Perutz M.F. Muirhead H. Mazzarella L. Crowther R.A. Greer J. Kilmartin J.V. Nature. 1969; 222: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23.Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Hemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar). The NO of SNO-Hb thus acts in a similar fashion as other sulfhydryl reagents and increases oxygen affinity and the ease of anaerobic oxidation.The in vitro studies reported here suggest that oxidative and nitrosative reactions in red blood cells containing Hb S could be appreciably altered. These alterations may help explain the well documented tendency of Hb S to oxidize more quickly than Hb A0 under aerobic conditions, the shorter lifetime of red blood cells containing Hb S, and the contribution of Hb S to malarial resistance (24.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Blood. 1987; 70: 1245-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar).The biological significance of this work includes the description of possible SNO-Hb reactivity patterns and their relevance to blood pressure regulation. Additional information regarding Band 3·SNO-Hb complex formation complements that of Stamler and co-workers (19.Pawlowski J.R. Hess D.T. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 409: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) with respect to the mechanism for NO release from SNO-Hb in vivo.DISCUSSIONHb is of central importance to human health in its role as a respiratory protein. Another chapter in the study of the human health significance of Hb is beginning, in which the focus is on NO uptake and delivery by Hb A0 and the role this plays in the control of blood pressure and in oxidative and nitrosative reactions. The significance of this report stems from our exploration of what can and cannot happen once nitrosation of the β93 sulfhydryl group occurs.Our results address the physiologically significant changes brought about by anions and SH modifiers that alter Hb conformation (allosteric controls) and Hb redox potential (electronic controls). These changes regulate Hb-based NO uptake and delivery as well as its oxygen transport functions. Intriguing differences in the redox potentials of Hb A0 and Hb S were found that may alter the oxidative and nitrosative reactions in red blood cells containing Hb S. This finding also clarifies a long-standing puzzle regarding the greater ease of aerobic oxidation (autoxidation) of Hb S. It is now clear that although the substitution in Hb S is external, its structural consequences reach to the heme site where a shift in the redox potential of Hb S makes the protein more susceptible to oxidation.Quantitative studies of the redox (oxidation-reduction) equilibria of respiratory heme proteins were begun by Taylor and Hastings (37.Taylor J.F. Hastings B. J. Biol. Chem. 1939; 131: 649-662Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) who studied the equilibrium between ferrous and ferric myoglobin. As reviewed elsewhere (6.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin and their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar), the oxidation-reduction equilibria of Hb under varied experimental conditions has been the subject of many investigations. Inconsistencies in the earlier data can be attributed to Hb interactions with the oxidizing or reducing agents used in the redox titrations (6.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin and their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 38.Antonini E. Wyman J. Brunori M. Taylor J.F. Rossi-Fanelli A. Caputo A. J.

Our spectroelectrochemical approach allows us to explore the redox behavior of Hb with higher resolution and reproducibility than previously possible. Significantly, the cationic mediator used in the studies reported here allows us to probe SH-modified Hbs and the anionic control mechanisms operating in these systems.Earlier studies performed by Antonini and Brunori (6.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin and their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar) and Banerjee and Cassoly (42.Banerjee R. Cassoly R. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 42: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated the impact on anaerobic oxidation of chemically modifying the β93 cysteine residue of Hb. These authors, using different SH modifiers, observed a negative shift of about 30 mV in redox potential relative to native Hb. Our results confirm and extend these earlier studies, and show that modification of the β93 SH-group by NO and a number of other thiol reagents results in species more easily oxidized than unmodified Hb A0. By analogy to the well documented anionic allosteric effectors that stabilize the T-state (31.Taboy C.H. Faulkner K.M. Kraiter D. Bonaventura C. Crumbliss A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39048-39054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we propose that these thiosteric modifiers influence theE 1/2 of the protein by stabilizing the protein's R-state. NO, however, holds the distinctive position of being the only thiosteric modifier known to operate in vivo. While the concentration of SNO-Hb in vivo is too low to have a significant effect on oxygen binding, this Hb form could have a considerable influence on NO transport and metabolism.Figs. 2 and 3 and results shown in Table I demonstrate thatS-nitrosation and other chemical modifications of the β93 cysteine of Hb produce shifts toward more negative potential and higher oxygen affinity. The mechanism by which E 1/2 andP 50 are shifted seems to be associated with a shift toward the R-state conformation. As a test of this model, we investigated CPA-Hb A0 and its S-nitrosated derivative. CPA-Hb A0, from which the C-terminal His and Tyr have been removed by digestion with carboxypeptidase A, has a more negative E 1/2 value relative to Hb A0, consistent with it being locked in the high O2 affinity (R-state) conformation (6.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin and their Reactions with Ligands. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971Google Scholar, 43.Bonaventura J. Bonaventura C. Brunori M. Giardina B. Antonini E. Bossa F. Wyman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 82: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The finding thatS-nitrosation of CPA-Hb A0 does not affect its redox potential is in accord with the conclusion that SH modifiers exert their influence by stabilizing the R-state of Hb.Hypothetically, the formation of the S-nitrosated derivative of oxidized (met) Hb can be associated with either a transnitrosation reaction between met-Hb A0 and SNO-deoxy-Hb (Equation 1), or a redox process by which one electron is transferred from SNO-deoxy-Hb to an existing met-Hb A0 molecule (Equation 2). (In the Equations below the heme site of met-Hb reactant is arbitrarily labeled using *.)Met­Hb*+SNO­deoxy­Hb→SNO­met­Hb*+deoxy­HbEquation 1 Met­Hb*+SNO­deoxy­Hb→deoxy­Hb*+SNO­met­HbEquation 2 Our anaerobic oxidation results show that oxidation of SNO- deoxy-Hb by met-Hb to give SNO-met-Hb (Equation 2) is thermodynamically feasible. The half-potentials are a minimum of 10–15 mV apart, which is sufficient for a thermodynamic electron exchange between the modified and non-modified Hb, and is reasonable in light of the concentrations reported for met-Hb and SNO-deoxy-Hb in vivo([met-Hb]≫[SNO-Hb]) (44.Feelish M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., New York1996Google Scholar). Moreover, previous work has demonstrated the existence of an internal electron exchange pathway between the β-chain heme groups and the SH-groups at position βCys93 (45.Rifkind J.M. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1981; 12: 191-232Google Scholar, 46.Bonaventura C. Godette G. Tesh S. Holm D.E. Bonaventura J. Crumbliss A.L. Pearce L.L. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5499-5507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This pathway would facilitate the electron exchange mode represented by Equation 2. The rates for electron exchange in Equation 2 have not been determined, and may be much faster than those observed in previous studies of Cu-treated Hb (45.Rifkind J.M. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1981; 12: 191-232Google Scholar, 46.Bonaventura C. Godette G. Tesh S. Holm D.E. Bonaventura J. Crumbliss A.L. Pearce L.L. Peterson J. J. Biol.

Met-Hb is known to be formed as a result of the interactions of NO with oxy-Hb, and we find that NO interactions with the SH-groups also favor met-Hb formation. Accordingly, we suggest a possible paradigm for Hb-based transport, storage, and metabolism of NO in vivo that is shown schematically in Fig. 4. This paradigm, in which met-Hb plays a significant role, is based on results reported herein for SH-modified forms of Hb A0 (NEM-Hb A0, PDS-Hb A0, and SNO-Hb A0), and CPA-Hb (SNO-CPA-Hb), as well as reports from the literature (3.Stamler J.S.

Possible responses to low oxygen conditions are shown, although the physiological condition is rarely “free” of oxygen, and met-Hb levels are usually low. There are many conditions where erythrocytes are greatly retarded in their flow through the capillaries, creating low oxygen conditions. In diabetes, sickle cell disease, hereditary stomatocytosis, polycythemias, normal thrombotic disorders and infarcts, etc., movement of the red blood cells past obstructions may be so slow that complete deoxygenation can in fact occur. There is no question that evolution adapts to such stress conditions as well as normal physiological function.Healthy human adults typically have about 2–3% of their circulating hemoglobin oxidized daily (28.Winterbourn C.C. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), creating a small pool of met-Hb in red blood cells. Spencer et al. (36.Spencer N.Y. Zeng H. Patel R.P. Hogg N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 47: 36562-36567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that the interaction of deoxy-Hb A0 with S-nitrosated glutathione (GSNO) leads to the formation of NO, met-Hb A0, and glutathione (GSH) (Equation 3), followed by the formation of a heme-NO adduct (Hb-NO) (Equation 4).Hb A0+GSNO→met­Hb A0+NO+GSHEquation 3 Hb A0+NO→Hb­NOEquation 4 This process could play an important role in increasing the pool of available met-Hb on one hand, and in eliminating excess NO in red blood cells on the other hand. Although met-Hb occurs as a small (generally <1%) fraction of the total Hb (∼20 mm in heme in erythrocytes), met-Hb levels are sufficient to be involved in the storage and metabolism of biologically relevant levels of NO. This concept is supported by the stability of met-SNO-Hb in vitro(this work), 2C. H. Taboy, C. Bonaventura, and A. L. Crumbliss, unpublished observations. its negatively shifted redox potential (this work) and its recognized vasodilatory activity (13.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar).Fig. 4 represents our model for possible inter-relationships between the deoxy, oxy, and met forms of Hb A0 and theirS-nitrosated counterparts. This scheme illustrates the six pathways that have been studied in vitro and may be involved in the NO biochemistry of hemoglobin in vivo. Cycle A represents the well documented oxygenation cycle that depends on environmental PO2. Cycle B represents the equilibrium between met- and deoxy-Hb, showing that deoxy-Hb can be oxidized to form met-Hb via a 1 electron reduction of S-nitrosated glutathione (top of the cycle), leading to the formation of NO and glutathione. (Other processes, like the interaction of NO with oxy-Hb, can also produce met-Hb.) The second half of cycle B (going from met-Hb to deoxy-Hb) requires the intervention of a reducing agent. We have shown here that S-nitrosated Hb A0 has a low enough E 1/2 to reduce met-Hb A0 to deoxy-Hb A0, leading to the formation of a stable SNO-met-Hb species (interface between cycles B and D). This electron exchange process at the B/D cycle interface is thermodynamically feasible in vitro and can theoretically lead to reactivation of met-Hb A0 to deoxy-Hb A0 and storage of NO as SNO-met-Hb, which has been demonstrated to have vasodilatory properties (13.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). The reaction depicted in Fig. 4, reaction C, shows a possible route to generate SNO-met-Hb that bypasses any low-level concentration of SNO-deoxy-Hb. The driving force to go “directly” to SNO-met-Hb from SNO-oxy-Hb via path C would be to maintain the low-spin state of the heme, by having iron undergo both an electron exchange and a ligand exchange. We know that the R to T transition of the protein is directly correlated to the spin-state change of the iron, and can therefore influence the unloading of NO from the β93 cysteine in erythrocytes. Reaction F represents a probable oxygen-driven equilibrium between the oxy and deoxy form of the S-nitrosated protein. Significantly, our in vitro experiments show that both SNO-deoxy-Hb A0 and SNO-met-Hb A0 are remarkably stable (i.e. do not release NO) if no low molecular weight NO-carriers such as cysteine or glutathione are present in the medium. This observation is important; as it strongly suggests that for NO unloading from SNO-Hb (or the SNO-Hb/Band 3 protein assembly) to occur, an acceptor for a transnitrosation reaction must be present (Fig. 4, reaction G), or possibly an intracellular reductant that releases NO from the SNO complex. We are presently investigating the possibility that electrons travel from the β chain heme site to the SNO site by the internal electron transfer pathway that we have previously documented to exist (46.Bonaventura C. Godette G. Tesh S. Holm D.E. Bonaventura J. Crumbliss A.L. Pearce L.L. Peterson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5499-5507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).High levels of met-Hb have been associated with formation of Heinz bodies that associate with Band 3 protein in red blood cells (35.Cassoly R. Salhany J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 745: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 47.Salhany J.M. Cassoly R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1399-1404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,49.Kiese M. Methemoglobinenia: A Comprehensive Treatise. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1974Google Scholar). The reactions of met-Hb may also play a role in NO transport, metabolism, and storage. The results described above reveal that at least three types of NO interactions with Hb favor met-Hb formation. They also show that met-Hb is well suited for storing NO as SNO-Hb. SNO-met-Hb, sequestered at the membrane as a Hb·Band 3 complex may also aid in the delivery of NO to tissues. Notably, the conformation of met-Hb can be adjusted from R toward T by modifying the composition of the protein environment, i.e. by increasing the concentrations of various allosteric effectors such as Cl−and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate in the protein environment (15.Perutz M.F. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Taboy C.H. Faulkner K.M. Kraiter D. Bonaventura C. Crumbliss A.L. J. Biol.

Because NO cannot be accommodated at the βCys93 position in the normal T-state, anion binding to Hb in either its met or deoxy state might be expected to facilitate the release of NO from SNO-met-Hb. However, anion binding is clearly insufficient to cause NO release. Band 3 protein, like small anions, can act as an allosteric effector that shifts Hb toward its T-state, but the association of SNO-Hb with Band 3 protein does not in itself c"
https://openalex.org/W2078208184,"The native forms of common globular proteins are in their most stable state but the native forms of plasma serpins (serine protease inhibitors) show high energy state interactions. The high energy state strain of α1-antitrypsin, a prototype serpin, is distributed throughout the whole molecule, but the strain that regulates the function directly appears to be localized in the region where the reactive site loop is inserted during complex formation with a target protease. To examine the functional role of the strain at other regions of α1-antitrypsin, we increased the stability of the molecule greatly via combining various stabilizing single amino acid substitutions that did not affect the activity individually. The results showed that a substantial increase of stability, over 13 kcal mol−1, affected the inhibitory activity with a correlation of 11% activity loss per kcal mol−1. Addition of an activity affecting single residue substitution in the loop insertion region to these very stable substitutions caused a further activity decrease. The results suggest that the native strain of α1-antitrypsin distributed throughout the molecule regulates the inhibitory function in a concerted manner. The native forms of common globular proteins are in their most stable state but the native forms of plasma serpins (serine protease inhibitors) show high energy state interactions. The high energy state strain of α1-antitrypsin, a prototype serpin, is distributed throughout the whole molecule, but the strain that regulates the function directly appears to be localized in the region where the reactive site loop is inserted during complex formation with a target protease. To examine the functional role of the strain at other regions of α1-antitrypsin, we increased the stability of the molecule greatly via combining various stabilizing single amino acid substitutions that did not affect the activity individually. The results showed that a substantial increase of stability, over 13 kcal mol−1, affected the inhibitory activity with a correlation of 11% activity loss per kcal mol−1. Addition of an activity affecting single residue substitution in the loop insertion region to these very stable substitutions caused a further activity decrease. The results suggest that the native strain of α1-antitrypsin distributed throughout the molecule regulates the inhibitory function in a concerted manner. The native forms of common globular proteins are in their most stable state and protein folding is a spontaneous process (1.Anfinsen C.B.

The stoichiometry of inhibition (SI, the number of moles of inhibitors required to completely inhibit 1 mol of a target protease) is given by 1 +ksubstrate/kinhibition, in which ksubstrate andkinhibition are the rate constants for the substrate and inhibitory pathways, respectively. The crystal structure of a serpin-protease complex revealed that the reactive site loop of the serpin is cleaved and inserted into the major β-sheet, sheet A, in the complex, whereas the target protease is attached to the cleaved loop of the serpin as an acyl intermediate (13.Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). The conformational conversion during complex formation accompanies the distortion of the protease active site (13.Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar), which prevents catalytic deacylation and results in trapping the stabilized complex. Flexibility of the native serpin structure is required for conformational conversion, and the high energy state of the native conformation appears to be a driving force for this conversion. To understand the structural basis and mechanistic consequences of the high energy state of native serpins, we have characterized stabilizing amino acid substitutions of human α1-antitrypsin (α1AT), a prototype serpin (14.Kwon K.-S.

Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H. Structure. 1996; 4: 1181-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22.Lee C. Maeng J.-S. Kocher J.-P. Lee B. Yu M.-H. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We screened thermostable mutations over the entire α1AT molecule and found stabilizing mutations that influence the flexibility of the native state distributed throughout the molecule (17.Seo E.J. Im H. Maeng J.-S. Kim K.E. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16904-16909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). If the increase in the stability of the native state of α1AT is manifested in the formation of the inhibitory complex, there should be a correlation between that increase in stability and the loss of inhibitory activity. Interestingly, however, only the stabilizing substitutions in the loop insertion region, such as Lys335 (23.Im H. Yu M.-H. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 934-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and Gly117 (18.Lee C. Park S.-H. Lee M.-Y. Yu M.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) of sheet A, decreased the inhibitory activity, and the stabilizing mutations at most other sites of α1AT did not cause the activity loss (17.Seo E.J. Im H. Maeng J.-S. Kim K.E. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16904-16909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that cavity filling substitutions designed at several sites of α1AT increased the stability of the molecule, but activity affecting mutations among them were localized in the region that appears to be mobilized during the loop insertion (22.Lee C. Maeng J.-S. Kocher J.-P. Lee B. Yu M.-H. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1446-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Thus, the high energy state in the loop insertion region appeared to be a nature's design for functional regulation but such a role of the strain at most other sites was not obvious. In the present study, we addressed this point by examining very stable mutations that were made through combining various single residue substitutions that did not affect the inhibitory activity individually. Characterization of the stable mutations suggests that the strain of α1AT scattered over the molecule does regulate the inhibitory activity. Ultrapure guanidine hydrochloride was purchased from ICN Biochemicals, Inc. (Aurora, IL). Porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), human leukocyte elastase (HLE),N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide,andN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. The plasmid for α1AT expression in Escherichia coli and the purification of recombinant proteins were described previously (14.Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, calculated from tyrosine and tryptophan content of the α1AT protein (24.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions at specific sites were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. α1AT cleaved at the reactive site loop was prepared by incubating with PPE at a molar ratio of 1:0.4 (α1AT:protease) at 37 °C for 1 h in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added at a final concentration of 1 mm to stop the reaction. Uncleaved molecules were removed by precipitating them at 70 °C for 15 min. The cleaved form was purified by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ column in 10 mm phosphate, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5. Cleavage of α1AT was confirmed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Equilibrium unfolding was carried out as a function of guanidine hydrochloride in 10 mmphosphate, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 6.5. The transition was monitored at 25 °C by change in fluorescence intensity (λex = 280 nm, λem = 360 nm) on RF-5000 spectrofluorometer (Shimazu) or circular dichroism (CD) signal at 222 nm on Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter in 1-cm path length cell. The native protein was pre-equilibrated in the buffer containing various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride at 25 °C for 4 h. The concentration of protein was 10 and 20 μg/ml for spectrofluorometry and CD spectroscopy, respectively. Equilibrium unfolding monitored by fluorescence change was fitted to a two-state model or three-state model and changes in the unfolding stability was determined according to Pace and co-workers (25.Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Thomson J.A. Creighton T.E. Protein Structure: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1989: 311-330Google Scholar). Briefly, it was calculated with the fitted thermodynamic parameters and the equation, ΔΔG = <m> × ΔCm, where ΔCm is the difference between the values ofCm, equilibrium transition midpoint, for the wild type and mutant protein, and <m> is the average of the “m-value,” a measure of the dependence of the free energy of unfolding (ΔG) on denaturant concentration. The <m> value used in the present study was 7.6 kcal mol−1m−1. The SI was determined as described (11.Rubin H. Wang Z.-M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Various amounts of purified recombinant α1AT proteins were incubated with 100 nm PPE or HLE at designated molar ratios of α1AT to protease in 50 μl of assay buffer (30 mm phosphate, 160 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG 8000, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). After incubation with the protease at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with the assay buffer and residual enzyme activity was determined. The active concentration of PPE was determined by measuring the initial rates of hydrolysis of 1 mmN-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide (26.Hopkins P.C.R. Carrell R.W. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The active concentration of HLE was determined as described previously (27.Rubin H. Plotnick M. Wang Z.-M. Liu X. Zhong Q. Schechter N.M. Cooperman B.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7627-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with trypsin-titrated human plasma α1AT and a substrate,N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide. The activity inhibition was extrapolated to yield the minimum molar ratio of α1AT to the protease giving 100% inhibition. The association rate constant for the interaction of recombinant α1AT with PPE was measured under second order conditions (28.Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a reaction mixture containing equimolar concentrations (8 nm) of the protease and the inhibitor. Stable α1AT variants were constructed by combining various single residue substitutions that increased conformational stability without diminishing the inhibitory activity (Fig. 1, colored cyan). Each component substitutions of α1AT are located at various secondary structures (helix A, helix B, helix C, helix H, helix F, and the following loop, helix I and the following loop, strand 3 of β-sheet A, strands 2–6 of β-sheet B, and strands 1 and 2 of β-sheet C). Fig. 2A shows the unfolding transition of several α1AT variants in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, which was monitored by the change in intrinsic fluorescence intensity. By combining various stabilizing substitutions of α1AT, the midpoint of unfolding transition (Cm) could be increased up to 3.29 from 0.65 m, the wild type value. The stabilizing effects of various combinations are summarized in Table I. The stability of M16 α1AT molecule that was cleaved in the reactive site loop was comparable to that of the cleaved wild type (Fig. 2A,filled symbols, Cm of 6.24versus 5.91 m). The stability of other cleaved mutant α1AT was also comparable. When the unfolding transition was monitored by CD spectrometry, the wild type and M7 α1AT showed biphasic transitions (Fig. 2B), in which the transition at the lower denaturant concentration appeared to coincide with the transition monitored by fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2B, dotted lines). The unfolding transition of M13 and M16 monitored by CD showed single transitions with the mid-point of 2.66 and 3.29 m, respectively (Fig. 2B), which are superimposable with the unfolding transitions monitored by fluorescence (dotted lines).Figure 2Guanidine hydrochloride-induced unfolding transition of the variant α1AT carrying combinatorial mutations.A, unfolding was monitored by the increase in fluorescence emission intensity at 360 nm (λex = 280 nm). Samples (10 μg/ml) were incubated in guanidine hydrochloride solution of 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.5, at 25 °C for 4 h.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the effect of the stabilizing mutations on the inhibitory activity of α1AT, the SI value of the variants α1AT toward HLE was measured. Fig. 3 shows that M13, M14b, and M16, but not M7, increased the SI, and the degree of increase correlated with the stability increase. The SI values of other variants α1AT are summarized in Table I. Table I also shows the mutational effect on the inhibitory activity that was obtained from the SI values of the wild type and the variant α1AT (relative activity). When the SI values toward PPE were measured for several variant forms of α1AT, similar degrees of activity decrease were observed (data not shown). Table I also shows the ratios of partitioning between the substrate and inhibitory pathways (ksubstrate overkinhibition) for each variant α1AT, which were obtained from the SI values (SI-1). When the wild-type α1AT interacts with HLE, the partitioning ratio is close to 0 because most of α1AT molecules form the inhibitory complex. The stable mutation, M16, increased this ratio up to 10, which indicates that less than 10% of the mutant molecules formed the inhibitory complex and the rest were cleaved by HLE. The association rate constant (ka) of the variants α1AT with PPE did not differ significantly from the wild type value, 5.5 × 105m−1s−1 (data not shown). The association rate with HLE was over 107m−1 s−1 and could not be determined precisely. Some of the previously identified single residue substitutions caused activity decrease although they increased the stability much less than M7 did. To examine if the stable multiple substitutions constructed in the present study affect the inhibitory activity in a similar way to that of the previously identified activity affecting single residue substitutions, K335V (Fig. 1, colored red) was combined with M5b, M7, and M14a. Table II shows that the combinations increased the stability as much as expected from the sum of individual effects, and decreased the inhibitory activity more than K335V.Table IICombination of multiple stabilizing mutations and activity-affecting single mutationCombinationsCmΔΔG2-aChange in the conformational stability by the mutation (ΔΔG) was calculated as in Table I.Relative activity2-bRelative activity is indicated as the inverse of the ratio of the SI toward HLE or PPE of each mutant type over that of the wild-type (for HLE; 1.0 ± 0.03, for PPE; 1.6 ± 0.06).Relative activity2-bRelative activity is indicated as the inverse of the ratio of the SI toward HLE or PPE of each mutant type over that of the wild-type (for HLE; 1.0 ± 0.03, for PPE; 1.6 ± 0.06).mkcal mol−1HLEPPEK335V1.516.50.500.50K335V + M5b2.4914.00.280.46M5b1.597.11.051.04K335V + M72.8817.00.300.41M71.9810.11.001.00K335V + M14a3.5121.70.140.10M14a2.6515.20.680.632-a Change in the conformational stability by the mutation (ΔΔG) was calculated as in Table I.2-b Relative activity is indicated as the inverse of the ratio of the SI toward HLE or PPE of each mutant type over that of the wild-type (for HLE; 1.0 ± 0.03, for PPE; 1.6 ± 0.06). Open table in a new tab We examined the combinatorial effect of the stabilizing substitutions of α1AT that did not affect the activity individually. Loss of inhibitory activity was observed with the current set of the stabilizing mutations only when the stability increase was substantial (Table I). In Fig. 4, correlation between the stability increase of α1AT and the decrease in the inhibition toward HLE was examined (filled circles). Any significant decrease in activity was not observed with the stability increase up to 13 kcal mol−1, but the activity leveled off as the stability increased further with a correlation of about 11% activity loss per kcal mol−1. This degree of activity reduction toward HLE was approximately similar to that toward PPE (data not shown). These results clearly showed that a substantial stability increase by the multiple substitutions could also affect the inhibitory function of α1AT, although each component substitution has inert effect on the activity. The results suggest that high energy states of α1AT distributed throughout the molecule regulate inhibitory function in a collective manner. Some single residue substitutions in the loop insertion region, such as those at Gly117 or Lys335 site, increased the stability up to 6 kcal mol−1 with a concomitant decrease in the inhibitory activity (16.Im H.

Gly117 and Lys335 sites lie beneath helix F and the following loop that cover β-sheet A at the bottom half in the loop insertion region (Fig. 1), and flexibility in this region appears to be critical for the loop insertion during the complex formation. Since simultaneous stabilization at many other sites throughout the molecule is as detrimental as the stabilization in the loop insertion region (Table I), flexibility throughout the α1AT molecule may also be critical for the complex formation. Various studies suggested that rapid loop insertion in a serpin (12.Wright H.T. Scarsdale J.N. Proteins Struct. Funct.

Experimental data showed a direct correlation between retardation of the loop insertion and the activity decrease (15.Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct.

The stability increase in the current set of mutant proteins may also influence the complex formation by retarding the loop insertion. Why then is the activity affected only when the stability increase is over 13 kcal mol−1? Unfolding of the wild type α1AT is biphasic, as probed by CD signal, although the change in fluorescence intensity monitors only the first transition (Fig. 2). Very stable variants that decreased the inhibitory activity such as M13 and M16 showed a single superimposable unfolding transition, whereas M7, which did not affect the activity, showed biphasic transition (Fig. 2B). Biphasic transition of equilibrium unfolding indicates that the molecule is made of two folding domains. The intrinsic fluorescence change monitors the environmental change near Trp194 (35.Kim D. Yu M.-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the unique buried tryptophan residue at the top of strand 3 of sheet A. It is very likely that equilibrium fluorescence change reflects initial opening of sheet A, and unfolding of α1AT can be considered as opening of sheet A followed by further unfolding of the remaining secondary structures. For those mutations that show a single transition, opening of sheet A appear to be coupled with complete unfolding. It may be that such conformation property of α1AT as domain folding is important for proper complex formation with a target protease. There is another possibility that the energy difference between the strained native state and a more stable state in the complex becomes too small to trap the protease-inhibitor complex as an acyl-enzyme inhibitor. It was suggested that the energy difference is utilized for trapping the protease-inhibitor complex (32.Silverman G.A. Bird P.I. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Coughlin P.B. Gettins P.G. Irving J.I. Lomas D.A.W. Luke C.J. Moyer R.W. Pemberton P.A. Remold-O'Donnell E. Salvesen G.S. Travis J. Whisstock J.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), presumably by distorting the protease active site (13.Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). If the difference becomes too small, the proposed distortion and trapping may become inefficient. Further studies will elucidate detailed mechanisms how the stability of a serpin molecule regulates its inhibitory activity. We examined how the stable multiple substitutions constructed in the current study might influence the activity affecting single residue substitutions. The activity of K335V decreased further down when a multiple substitution, such as M5, M7, or M14, was combined (Table II; Fig. 4, open symbols). The results suggest that at least two distinct steps are involved in the regulation of the complex formation. The first step appears to be the destabilization of the interactions between helix F and sheet A, which is affected by the activity affecting single residue substitutions in this region (e.g. K335V) but not by such multiple stable substitutions as M5 or M7. The step is likely to be independent of the changes in fluorescence property and secondary structure contents. However, the activity affecting single residue substitutions also shift the unfolding midpoints monitored by fluorescence and CD signals with a good correlation with the activity decrease (16.Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11072-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18.Lee C. Park S.-H. Lee M.-Y. Yu M.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7727-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, the step is likely to be prerequisite to opening of sheet A detected by fluorescence and CD. The second step is opening of β-sheet A for the insertion and locking of the reactive site loop. This step appears to require flexibility of the whole molecule, because the inhibitory activity is affected when the step is coupled with global stability as with the very stable multiple substitutions. Whereas the interactions at specific location are important in the first step, collective molecular properties may be as important in the second step. Our results clearly suggest that high energy states of α1AT regulate concertedly various steps of the complex formation. In summary, we probed the functional role of the native strain of α1AT that is distributed throughout the molecule. Although stability of the wild type α1AT is optimized and is designed in such a way that the activity is not sensitive to a minor change in the stability, a substantial stability increase of α1AT affected the inhibitory activity of the molecule. The opening of sheet A, a critical step for the loop insertion, appears to be regulated by such conformational properties as domain folding and global stability as well as local high-energy states in the loop insertion region."
https://openalex.org/W2137478991,"To study the recognition by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (TrpRS) of tRNATrp discriminator base, mutations were introduced into the discriminator base of Bacillus subtilis, Archeoglobus fulgidus, and bovine tRNATrp, representing the three biological domains. WhenB. subtilis, A. fulgidus, and human TrpRS were used to acylate these tRNATrp, two distinct preference profiles regarding the discriminator base of different tRNATrp substrates were found: G>A>U>C for B. subtilis TrpRS, and A>C>U>G for A. fulgidus and human TrpRS. The preference for G73 in tRNATrp by bacterial TrpRS is much stronger than the modest preferences for A73 by the archaeal and eukaryotic TrpRS. Cross-species reactivities between TrpRS and tRNATrp from the three domains were in accordance with the view that the evolutionary position of archaea is intermediate between those of eukarya and bacteria. NMR spectroscopy revealed that mutation of A73 to G73 in bovine tRNATrp elicited a conformational alteration in the G1-C72 base pair. Mutation of G1-C72 to A1-U72 or disruption of the G1-C72 base pair also caused reduction of Trp-tRNATrp formation. These observations identify a tRNATrp structural region near the end of acceptor stem comprising A73 and G1-C72 as a crucial domain required for effective recognition by human TrpRS.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the covalent attachment of amino acids to their cognate tRNA, thereby ensuring the faithful translation of the genetic code (1.Ibba M. Soll D. Annu. Rev.

Cross-species aminoacylation provided a useful phylogenetic probe that generated early evidence for the close relationship between archaea and eukarya (3.Kwok Y. Wong J.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The specific recognition of a tRNA by its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is guided by identity elements on the tRNA. The discriminator base (N73) has been shown to be a major identity element on tRNATrpfor bacterial and eukaryotic TrpRS 1The abbreviations used are: TrpRStryptophanyl-tRNA synthetasetRNATrptRNA for TrpIPTGisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranosideHSQCheteronuclear single-quantum correlation(4.Xue H.

N73 is strongly conserved in tRNATrp among different species from the same biological domain, always being G in bacterial and chloroplast tRNATrp but A in archaeal and most eukaryotic tRNATrp (8.Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The reliance on N73 by TrpRS in its specific recognition of tRNATrp has resulted in one of the first observations of an evolutionary change in identity elements, with bacterial and eukaryotic TrpRS utilizing dissimilar identity elements on the tRNATrp (4.Xue H.

Archeoglobus fulgidus is a hyperthermophilic, sulfate-reducing, and strictly anaerobic archaeon, for which the complete genome has been sequenced (9.Klenk H.P. Clayton R.A. Tomb J.F. White O. Nelson K.E. Ketchum K.A. Dodson R.J. Gwinn M. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Richardson D.L. Kerlavage A.R. Graham D.E. Kyrpides N.C. Fleischmann R.D. Quackenbush J. Lee N.H. Sutton G.G. Gill S.

A complete set ofBacillus subtilis, A. fulgidus, and bovine tRNATrp carrying different base substitutions at N73 was hyperexpressed in Escherichia coli and examined in terms of their efficiency as substrates for tryptophanylation by B. subtilis, A. fulgidus, and human TrpRS. Moreover, to determine any structural role of N73 in bringing about tryptophanylation, solution NMR spectroscopy was employed to compare the structures of wild-type A73 bovine tRNATrp and its G73 mutant, which were respectively, the best and the poorest substrates among the bovine tRNATrp N73 variants toward reaction with human TrpRS. Three pairs of complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotides separately encoding a T7 promoter sequence upstream of B. subtilis, A. fulgidus, and bovine tRNATrp genes carrying random nucleotides at position N73 were synthesized according to the gene sequences of B. subtilis (GenBankTM accession number D10981), bovine (GenBankTM accession number M10543), and A. fulgidus (GenBankTM accession number AE000782) tRNATrp (see Fig. 1 below). Individual pairs of the oligodeoxyribonucleotides were mixed and incubated at 60 °C for 15 min to form double-stranded DNA fragments, which were separately inserted into the SfiI and HindIII restriction sites of the E. coli pGEM-9zf(−) vector (Promega) (4.Xue H. Shen W. Giege R. Wong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9316-9322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was employed to construct single and double mutations of N73 and the 1–72 base pairs using a proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All recombinant plasmids were obtained by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal, Sigma Chemical Co.) Blue-White screening and confirmed by DNA sequencing using the BigDye sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequences of B. subtilis, A. fulgidus, and bovine tRNATrp were aligned using the program ClustalW. The position of each residue was assigned, and the cloverleaf structures of these three tRNATrp were constructed (Fig. 1). The modified nucleotides in native B. subtilis (10.Matsugi J. Murao K. Ishikura H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and bovine tRNATrp (11.Fournier M. Labouesse J. Dirheimer G. Fix C. Keith G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 521: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) are known. The modified nucleotides of native A. fulgidus tRNATrp have not been analyzed, but those of Halobacterium volcaniitRNATrp were regarded as providing a first approximation description of the modifications in wild-type archaeal tRNATrp (12.Gupta R.

Recombinant pGEM-9zf(−)-derived plasmids were transformed into the E. coli JM109 and cultured in M9-glycerol medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 1% glycerol, 0.01 mm FeCl3, 0.1 mmCaCl2, and 100 mg/liter thiamine, as described previously (4.Xue H. Shen W. Giege R. Wong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9316-9322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the 15N-labeled tRNA,15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) was used as a nitrogen source in the M9-glycerol medium (14.Yan X. Xue H. Liu H. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). When culture absorbance reached A550 = 0.16, 0.2 mm IPTG was added to induce the culture for 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and total tRNA was isolated by phenol extraction (pH 6.4). To remove DNA and high molecular weigh RNA, the supernatant was incubated with 2.5 m NaCl at 4 °C for 3 h. The total tRNA in the supernatant was purified on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Sigma), and tRNATrp was separated by reverse-phase HPLC on a Vydac C4-derivatized silica column (15.Xue H. Shen W. Wong J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the tRNATrp were identified by dot-blot hybridization, precipitated, and washed twice with 70% ethanol, stored at −20 °C, and lyophilized before use. 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 8 m urea was warmed up by pre-running to 50 °C, and tRNATrp preparations were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min with loading buffer containing formamide (50% v/v) prior to electrophoresis in TBE electrophoresis buffer (90 mmTris-borate, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA) at 1000 V for 6 h. The gel was stained with 0.1% toluidine blue (Sigma) in 7.5% acetic acid for 15 min, and destained with 2.5% acetic acid. To identify tRNATrp in the HPLC fractions, 10 μl of each fraction was loaded on a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The tRNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene) for 1 min. Afterward, the membrane was incubated in 100 ml of hybridization buffer (0.9 m NaCl, 0.09 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's reagent with 25 μg/mlE. coli purified total tRNA) and gently shaken at 68 °C for 1 h. Specific oligodeoxyribonucleotides with complementary sequence to tRNA and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) were used to probe membranes at 60 °C for 6 h. A concentration, 4 μm, of γ-32P-labeled 5′-CCACGACTGGCGGGTCTGGAG-3′ was used for A. fulgidustRNATrp, 5′-CTGGAGTCAGACGCGCTACCATTGC-3′ for bovine tRNATrp, and 5′-GGAGAGACTCGAACTCCCAACACCCG-3′ for endogenous E. coli tRNATrp. The probed membrane was washed twice in wash buffer (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS) and autoradiographed at −80 °C. The intensity of each dot was estimated by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). To analyze the modified nucleotides in cloned bovine and A. fulgidustRNATrp, each wild-type tRNATrp (20 μg) was hydrolyzed as described previously (16.Xue H. Glasser A.L. Desgres J. Grosjean H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2479-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Each nucleotide detected in the HPLC eluate was identified based on comparison of its UV spectrum and retention time with ribonucleoside reference standards. All modified nucleotides were determined in terms of moles of residue per mole of tRNA using Br8G as internal standard. The TrpRS of B. subtilis hyperexpressed from recombinant plasmid pKSW1 was purified as described (17.Shi W. Chow K.C. Wong J.T. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18.Xue H. Xue Y. Doublie S. Carter C.W. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 709-715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A pBluescript SK+ based cDNA clone with the human TrpRS gene (GenBankTM accession number NM_004184) inserted into an EcoRI site was obtained from J. Justesen (19.Fleckner J. Rasmussen H.H. Justesen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11520-11524Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); the full-length gene was digested by EcoRI and subcloned into pTrcHis-B expression vector (Invitrogen). The sequence between vector mini-cistron and initial ATG of human TrpRS gene, encoding His6-tag and a leading sequence, was removed by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using proofreadingPfu DNA polymerase prior to transformation into E. coli JM109 strain. The human TrpRS was induced by 1 mmIPTG and precipitated from the French press crude extract by addition of ammonium sulfate to 3 m. The pellet containing the synthetase was resuspended and applied to Phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column followed by a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (both from Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The fractions were screened for tryptophanylation activity using A. fulgidus wild-type tRNATrp as substrate. The purified human TrpRS was concentrated to 0.5 mg/ml in 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. To obtain A. fulgidus TrpRS, a pUC18-derived cDNA clone (ATCC number, 629131; TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research) locus, AF1694) containing TrpRS gene (trpS) (GenBankTM accession number AE000986) of A. fulgidus was supplied by ATCC. A pair of primers was designed to flank the A. fulgidus TrpRS gene with a BamHI site at the 5′-end and EcoRI site at the 3′-end, and proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase was used to yield the full-length A. fulgidus TrpRS gene. The PCR-amplified fragment was digested by BamHI and EcoRI and subcloned into the same sites of pTrcHis-A expression vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant expression vector was transformed intoE. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cell (Stratagene). The His6-tagged A. fulgidus TrpRS was hyperexpressed by induction with 0.5 mm IPTG and extracted by French press. The crude extract containing soluble His6-taggedA. fulgidus TrpRS was mixed with 3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose slurry (Qiagen) by gently shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. The mixture was packed in a mini column for gravity flow chromatography. After the resin was drained and washed with 10 mm imidazole untilA280 was constant and further washed with 20 mm imidazole. The enzyme was eluted with 100 mmimidazole. The fractions containing A. fulgidus TrpRS were concentrated and dialyzed by means of Centricon (Amicon) and stored at −20 °C in 50% glycerol. Tryptophanylation with B. subtilis TrpRS was performed at 22 °C as described (20.Xu Z.J. Love M.L. Ma L.Y. Blum M. Bronskill P.M. Bernstein J. Grey A.A. Hofmann T. Camerman N. Wong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4304-4311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tryptophanylation with human TrpRS was carried out at 30 °C in reaction buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, with 2.4 mm ATP and 10 μml-[5-3H]tryptophan (5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Tryptophanylation with A. fulgidus TrpRS was carried out at 65 °C in reaction buffer containing 100 mm MOPS (Sigma), pH 7.0, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl with 2.4 mmATP and 10 μml-[5-3H]tryptophan (5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). At various time points, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed and spotted onto a 3MM (Whatman) filter. Filters were soaked in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid followed by 95% ethanol wash before subjected to liquid scintillation counting and subtraction of control radioactivity from reaction mixture without added tRNATrp. When the steady-state kinetic parameterskcat and Km for tRNATrp were to be determined, a saturating concentration of 10 μml-[5-3H]tryptophan (10 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia) for TrpRS was present in the assay mixture. The tRNA concentration was varied over a 10-fold range, all at least 100-fold in excess over TrpRS. Assays were performed in duplicates using six tRNA concentrations and two TrpRS concentrations, and errors on individual kinetic constants were consistently less than 15%. Kinetic parameters from three replicate experiments were estimated by fitting data into the Eadie-Hofstee plot using data analysis software Origin 6.1 (Originlab) and averaged. 15N-Labeled samples of bovine wild-type tRNATrp and its A73G mutant were prepared as described previously (14.Yan X. Xue H. Liu H. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Sensitivity-enhanced gradient two-dimensional 1H- and 15N-HSQC spectra were performed on a Varian INOVA 500 NMR spectrometer at 30 °C. Spectral widths at the proton and nitrogen dimensions were 12,000 and 6000 Hz, respectively. On the basis of tRNATrp sequence alignment (Fig. 1), the pairwise sequence identity was found to be 68.0% between A. fulgidus and B. subtilis, 67.1% between bovine and A. fulgidus, and 49.3% between bovine and B. subtilis. More tellingly, there were 18 identical nucleotides between A. fulgidus and B. subtilis tRNATrp unshared by bovine tRNATrp, and 18 identical nucleotides between A. fulgidus and bovine tRNATrp unshared by B. subtilis tRNATrp. In contrast, there were only four identical nucleotides between B. subtilis and bovine tRNATrp unshared by A. fulgidustRNATrp. These results suggest that, although sequence divergence is large between bovine and B. subtilistRNATrp, A. fulgidus tRNATrpoccupies an intermediate phylogenetic position between them with unmistakable resemblance to both of them. For all three recombinant tRNATrp, base substitutions at N73 did not greatly influence the expression levels of the tRNA inE. coli. The bulk of bovine or A. fulgidustRNATrp was eluted in one major HPLC peak as revealed by dot-blot hybridization (Fig. 2) in contrast to the multiple HPLC peaks observed with B. subtilis tRNATrp differing in nucleotide modifications (15.Xue H. Shen W. Wong J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Compared with B. subtilis tRNATrp, bovine and A. fulgidus tRNATrp was eluted earlier in the HPLC (Fig. 2), suggesting that the latter two tRNA molecules were less hydrophobic. Similar HPLC profiles were observed for all four N73 variants within each kind of tRNATrp. Compared with native bovine and H. volcaniitRNATrp, the bovine and A. fulgidustRNATrp hyperexpressed in E. coli lacked some of the species-specific modifications, and acquired other modifications typical of host E. coli tRNATrp (Table I). The appearance of T in these two cloned tRNA molecules, possibly in place of ψ54 of native bovine tRNATrp, and m1ψ54 of archaeal tRNATrp exemplified by H. volcaniitRNATrp, was a striking difference between the cloned and native molecules, which likely arose from differences between E. coli and bovine or archaeal nucleoside-modifying enzymes. T is a highly conserved signature nucleotide in bacterial tRNA. Another difference was the presence in the cloned molecules of 4-thiouridine (s4U) (Table I), which is a signature modification at position 8 of E. coli tRNA but never observed in eukaryotic or archaeal tRNA (8.Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M. Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). The appearance of 2′-O-methylcytidine (Cm) in cloned bovine tRNATrp but not in clonedA. fulgidus tRNATrp clearly indicates that the conversion of C to 2′-O-methylcytidine (Cm) depends not only on the availability of the requisite modifying enzyme system in E. coli host but also on appropriate tRNA sequence setting. It is also intriguing that no dihydrouridine (D) was observed in cloned bovine or A. fulgidus tRNATrp. This residue is present in native bovine and B. subtilistRNATrp but absent from native H. volcaniitRNATrp. Electrophoresis in denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea yielded different migration rates for the three cloned tRNAs that were consistent with their different lengths, A. fulgidus tRNATrp being the longest with 77 residues, B. subtilis tRNATrp being the shortest with 74 residues, and bovine tRNATrp being intermediate with 75 residues (Fig. 3).Table IModified ribonucleotides in native and cloned tRNATrptRNATrps4UGmfa7d7GDCmm1Ai6Am5Cm1Gm2Gm22Gm7GTΨΨmm1ΨCloned B. subtilis1-aFrom Ref. 4.0.20.2−1.31.0−0.9−−−−−1.10.9−−Cloned bovine0.30.1−−0.9−−−0.7−−0.71.31.8−−Cloned A. fulgidus0.20.1−−−−−−0.4−−0.51.21.3−−Native E. coli1-aFrom Ref. 4.0.5−3.31.1−−−−−−0.71.10.8−−Native B. subtilis1-bFrom Ref. 10.−−−+−−+−−−−−++−−Native bovine liver1-cFrom Ref. 11.−+−+++−−++++−++−Native H. volcanii1-dFrom Refs. 12,13.−−+−+−−++−+−−+−+1-a From Ref. 4.Xue H.

Open table in a new tab Dot blot hybridization by means of tRNA-specific probes identified the bovine tRNATrp peak at about 42 min in the HPLC elution profile and the slower emergence of A. fulgidustRNATrp at about 52 min. Because endogenous E. coli tRNATrp was eluted at about 70 min, both of these cloned tRNATrp isolated would contain little endogenous tRNATrp. Previously it was found that the rate of tryptophanylation by B. subtilis TrpRS for the G73A mutant is some 10-fold decreased relative to the G73 wild-type (4.Xue H. Shen W. Giege R. Wong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9316-9322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the discriminator base is a major identity element inB. subtilis tRNATrp. Table II shows that the variation ofkcat/Km with the nature of N73 was caused mostly by a change in kcat rather than Km: the Km for G73 wild-type and the G73A, G73C, and G73U mutants all fell within the range of 0.02–0.03 μm, whereas their kcatvaried over an 18-fold range.Table IIKinetics parameters for N73 variants of tRNATrp from the three biological domains of archaea, eukarya, and bacteria upon tryptophanylation by A. fulgidus human and B. subtilis TrpRSSpecies/domainN73B. subtilisTrpRSA. fulgidusTrpRSHuman TrpRSkcatKM2-aThekcat/KM values represent thekcat/KM value of each tRNA substrate relative to the kcat/KMmeasured for the wild-type tRNATrp upon tryptophanylation by its cognate TrpRS.kcat/KM2-aThekcat/KM values represent thekcat/KM value of each tRNA substrate relative to the kcat/KMmeasured for the wild-type tRNATrp upon tryptophanylation by its cognate TrpRS.kcatKMkcat/KM2-aThekcat/KM values represent thekcat/KM value of each tRNA substrate relative to the kcat/KMmeasured for the wild-type tRNATrp upon tryptophanylation by its cognate TrpRS.kcatKMkcat/KM2-aThekcat/KM values represent thekcat/KM value of each tRNA substrate relative to the kcat/KMmeasured for the wild-type tRNATrp upon tryptophanylation by its cognate TrpRS.s−1μms−1μms−1μmA. fulgidus/archaeaA73 WT0.32 ± 0.040.12 ± 0.0110.0100.53 ± 0.0080.06 ± 0.00812.76 ± 0.090.09 ± 0.0050.27A73C0.21 ± 0.030.11 ± 0.0080.0070.11 ± 0.0070.05 ± 0.0060.251.49 ± 0.130.09 ± 0.0030.15A73U0.26 ± 0.030.13 ± 0.0090.0080.09 ± 0.0030.05 ± 0.0070.201.05 ± 0.070.10 ± 0.0080.09A73G0.57 ± 0.080.10 ± 0.0060.0220.07 ± 0.0040.06 ± 0.0070.130.63 ± 0.060.11 ± 0.0070.05Bovine/eukaryaA73 WT0.21 ± 0.020.16 ± 0.0130.0050.08 ± 0.0050.21 ± 0.0150.044.49 ± 0.060.04 ± 0.0021A73C0.12 ± 0.010.17 ± 0.0210.0030.06 ± 0.0050.22 ± 0.0200.031.71 ± 0.120.04 ± 0.0050.38A73U0.18 ± 0.020.16 ± 0.0150.0040.04 ± 0.0020.17 ± 0.0190.031.36 ± 0.050.05 ± 0.0060.24A73G0.48 ± 0.030.15 ± 0.0090.0130.03 ± 0.0030.18 ± 0.0130.021.40 ± 0.080.06 ± 0.0080.21B. subtilis/bacteriaG73A0.81 ± 0.110.03 ± 0.0020.110.14 ± 0.0050.09 ± 0.0110.181.29 ± 0.090.14 ± 0.0120.08G73C0.27 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.0010.050.06 ± 0.0020.12 ± 0.0080.060.60 ± 0.060.15 ± 0.0090.04G73U0.46 ± 0.020.03 ± 0.0040.060.05 ± 0.0030.12 ± 0.0090.050.48 ± 0.040.15 ± 0.0110.03G73 WT5.09 ± 0.120.02 ± 0.00110.04 ± 0.0020.10 ± 0.0130.050.33 ± 0.020.15 ± 0.0080.022-a Thekcat/KM values represent thekcat/KM value of each tRNA substrate relative to the kcat/KMmeasured for the wild-type tRNATrp upon tryptophanylation by its cognate TrpRS. Open table in a new tab In contrast, the discrimination by B. subtilis TrpRS against heterologous tRNATrp entailed differentiation at both thekcat and Km levels. For example, comparing thekcat/Km values for the best tRNA substrate (B. subtilis G73) and worst tRNA substrate (bovine A73C), the former excelled over the latter by 357-fold, which was the combined result of an 8.5-fold (0.02/0.17) difference inKm and 42-fold difference (5.09/0.12) inkcat. Likewise, the kcatof A. fulgidus A73 tRNATrp for this enzyme was one-ninth the kcat for B. subtiliswild-type G73, and its Km was also 6-fold that of the latter. Similarly the 79-fold greater catalytic efficiency towardB. subtilis G73 compared with bovine A73G arose from a 7.5-fold lower Km and a 10.6-fold higherkcat. Clearly, this enzyme is endowed with stringent selectivity not only toward N73 with a preference of G>A>U>C but also toward the remainder portion of the tRNA molecule that varies with the preference of bacterial tRNA>archaeal tRNA>eukaryotic tRNA. Purified recombinant human TrpRS (Fig. 4) charged most efficiently bovine, less efficiently A. fulgidus, and least efficiently B. subtilis tRNATrp. However, the bias displayed by human TrpRS toward tRNATrp from the three biological domains was somewhat less extreme than the B. subtilis enzyme, yielding a relative kcat/Km of 0.27 toward A. fulgidus tRNATrp, and relativekcat/Km of 0.02 towardB. subtilis G73 wild-type tRNATrp, improving to 0.082 when G73 in the latter molecule was mutated to A73. That the human TrpRS preferred archaeal to bacterial tRNATrp was entirely in keeping with a closer phylogenetic relationship of eukarya to archaea than to bacteria. The dependence of human enzyme on the discriminator base position was also less extreme compared with the bacterial enzyme. Mutation of A73 in bovine tRNATrp to the worst case of G73 reduces its relative kcat/Km to 0.21. The preference of human TrpRS for A>C>U>G at position 73 held for all three biological sources of tRNA, and was more moderate than the N73 preference of the B. subtilis enzyme. Studies using in vitro tRNA transcripts also indicated a preference of A>G for the human enzyme (6.Xu F. Chen X. Xin L. Chen L. Jin Y. Wang D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4125-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A. fulgidusis a sulfate-reducing hyperthermophilic archaeon. Its His6-tagged TrpRS, upon hyperexpression and purification from E. coli, yielded a polypeptide of molecular mass ∼50 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). This enzyme acylated A. fulgidus, bovine, and B. subtilis tRNATrpat 65 °C but with kcat/Kmvalues lower than those of human and B. subtilis TrpRS. The requirement of this enzyme for high temperature to be active was manifest in the fact that at 30 °C it displayed no measurable activity even toward wild-type A. fulgidustRNATrp, in contrast to human TrpRS, which could readily acylate wild-type A. fulgidus tRNATrp at 30 °C. The low relativelykcat/Km values of theA. fulgidus enzyme could arise from its dependence on modified nucleotides present in native archaeal tRNA but missing from the cloned A. fulgidus tRNATrp, which may contribute to tRNA thermostability at the assay temperature of 65 °C. A. fulgidus TrpRS exhibited a same preference of A>C>U>G as human TrpRS. Moreover, although it showed approximate 20% reactivity toward B. subtilis A73 tRNATrpand less than 4% reactivity toward bovine A73 tRNATrp, it retained for these heterologous tRNA substrates its preference pattern of A>C>U>G. The comparable activities of A. fulgidusTrpRS toward bacterial tRNATrp and eukaryotic tRNATrp are in accord with an intermediate phylogenetic position of the archaea between bacteria and eukarya. Cloned bovine tRNATrp was efficiently tryptophanylated by human TrpRS with akcat/Km of 1.12 × 108 s−1m−1. When its discriminator base A73 was mutated, loss of catalytic efficiency occurred with the largest loss caused by mutation to G, stemming mostly from a 3-fold decrease in kcat and a 1.5-fold increase in Km (Table II). Previously, by utilizing base pair mutations to differentiate between overlapping NMR resonances, we have identified most of the base pair resonances in B. subtilis tRNATrp (14.Yan X. Xue H. Liu H. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1927133309,"There is considerable divergence in the sequences of steroid receptor response elements, including the vitamin D response elements (VDREs). Two major VDRE-containing and thus 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25-(OH)(2)D(3))-regulated genes are the two non-collagenous, osteoblast-derived bone matrix proteins osteocalcin and osteopontin. We observed a stronger induction of osteopontin than osteocalcin mRNA expression by 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Subsequently, we have shown that vitamin D receptor/retinoid X receptor alpha (VDR/RXRalpha) heterodimers bind more tightly to the osteopontin VDRE than to the osteocalcin VDRE. Studies using point mutants revealed that the internal dinucleotide at positions 3 and 4 of the proximal steroid half-element are most important for modulating the strength of receptor binding. In addition, studies with VDRE-driven luciferase reporter gene constructs revealed that the central dinucleotide influences the transactivation potential of VDR/RXRalpha with the same order of magnitude as that observed in the DNA binding studies. The synthetic vitamin D analog KH1060 is a more potent stimulator of transcription and inducer of VDRE binding of VDR/RXR in the presence of nuclear factors isolated from ROS 17/2.8 osteoblast-like cells than the natural ligand 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3). Interestingly, however, KH1060 is comparable or even less potent than 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) in stimulating VDRE binding of in vitro synthesized VDR/RXRalpha. Thus, the extent of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3)- and KH1060-dependent binding of VDR/RXRalpha is specified by a central dinucleotide in the VDRE, and the ligand-induced effects on DNA binding are in part controlled by the cellular context of nuclear proteins."

The insulin pathway transmits its signal from the insulin receptor through Chico, a Drosophilahomologue of insulin-receptor substrates, Drosophilaphosphatidylinositol kinase (DPI3K), and Drosophila AKT (also known as protein kinase B) (13.Edgar B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E191-E193Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

However, no role of DERK activation especially related with cell proliferation was illustrated.

When overexpressed in Schneider cells, DMKP-3 specifically inhibited DERK activity without noticeable effects toward DJNK and Drosophila p38. DMKP-3 also specifically interacted with DERK at its N-terminal docking site motif (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem.

In this study, we investigated the role of DERK in Schneider cell proliferation by modulating ERK activity using both overexpression and partial knock-out methodologies. By overexpressing DMKP-3 within Schneider cells, we identified the role of DERK in cell proliferation. This finding was detected by inhibition profiles of the G1to S cell cycle progression and by BrdU incorporation. The role of DERK in Schneider cell proliferation was further confirmed by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated interference (RNAi) of DERK and DMKP-3 (14.Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N.

The SmaI-XhoI fragment of this recombinant vector was subsequently subcloned into theEcoRV-XhoI sites of pMT/V5 to generate pMT/V5-DMKP-3-CA-RR double mutant. Stable Schneider cells containing a copper-inducible DMKP-3 or DMKP-3-CA were described in a previous study (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing DMKP3-RR or DMKP3-CA-RR mutant were generated as described previously (18.Lee W.J. Kim S.H. Kim Y.S. Han S.J. Park K.S. Ryu J.H. Hur M.W. Choi K.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Schneider cells were maintained in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma), and the induction of DMKP-3 proteins was performed as described by Kim et al. (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The activation of DERK was performed by treatment with 10 μg/ml human insulin for 5 min (14.Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The cell extracts were made using a lysis buffer as described previously (18.Lee W.J. Kim S.H. Kim Y.S. Han S.J. Park K.S. Ryu J.H. Hur M.W. Choi K.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Samples were quantitated and immediately used for assay or stored at −70 °C. 50–100 μg of protein from whole cell extracts was separated by 8–10% SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis performed as described previously (18.Lee W.J. Kim S.H. Kim Y.S. Han S.J. Park K.S. Ryu J.H. Hur M.W. Choi K.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 821-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activation of endogenous DERK was determined by using phospho-specific anti-ERK antibody (New England Bio Labs). DMKP-3 proteins were detected by purified anti-DMKP-3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). α-Tubulin was also detected as a control by using anti-α-tubulin antibody (Calbiochem). Blots were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Promega) secondary antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Genepia). The Schneider cell line, DMKP-3, and DMKP-3-CA stable cell lines were grown to 50% confluence in Schneider medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were then treated with 1 mm CuSO4 for DMKP-3 or DMKP-3-CA induction and grown for 69 h before harvesting cells for fluorescent-activating cell sorting (FACS) analysis. In some cases, the cells were treated with human insulin (10 μg/ml) for 24 h before harvesting. Cells collected from 6-well plates were rinsed twice with PBS and fixed by adding 70% cold ethanol. The cells were washed with PBS containing 1% horse serum. Subsequently, the DNA was stained with 100 μg/ml propidium iodide for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell cycle profile and forward scatter were determined using a Becton Dickinson FACS Caliber, and data were analyzed using the ModFit LT 2.0 (Verity Software House, Inc.) and WinMDI 2.8 (created by Joseph Trotter, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). For DERK localization studies, Schneider cells were co-transfected with DMKP-3 expression vector (pPacPL-DMKP-3-Myc, pPacPL-DMKP-3-CA-Myc, or pPacPL-DMKP-3-R56A/R57A-Myc) and pPacPL-DERK-His in a 5:1 ratio using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (17.Han S.J. Choi K.Y. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and further grown for 36 h posttransfection. The cells were then fixed and permeabilized with 100% methanol at −20 °C for 15 min and blocked by incubating with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum for 30 min at room temperature. The coverslips were incubated with appropriately diluted DMKP-3, anti-rabbit-c-Myc (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-mouse-RGS·His antibody (1:100, Qiagen) in the blocking solution for 2 h, and then washed three times with PBS. Secondary antibody reaction was performed for 1 h in 50% glycerol solution containing goat anti-rabbit Rhodamine Red™ X-conjugated IgG secondary antibody (1:100 diluted, Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) for detecting DMKP-3, goat anti-mouse-Cy2-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:100 dilution for His-DERK, or goat anti-rabbit-rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:100 for detecting DMKP-3-Myc proteins. DAPI was then treated at a final concentration of 1 μm in PBS for 10 min, and the cells were extensively washed with PBS and mounted for photography using a Radiance 2000/MP, multiphoton imaging system (Bio-Rad). For the BrdU incorporation studies, Schneider cells were grown at 23 °C to 60% confluence on coverslips in 6-well plates. They were then transfected with calcium phosphate as described previously (17.Han S.J. Choi K.Y. Brey P.T. Lee W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 369-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with 7 μg of pPacPL vector, pPacPL-DMKP-3, pPacPL-DMKP-3-CA, pPacPL-DMKP-3-RR, or pPacPL-DMKP-3-CA-RR. After 24 h, the cells were washed with fresh medium containing 10% FBS and allowed to grow for 24 h with media and with or without 10 μg/ml human insulin. BrdU labeling was performed over the last 4 h, and the cells were fixed with methanol/formaldehyde (99:1) for 15 min at −20 °C and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. The slips were then incubated with anti-DMKP-3 antibody (1:100) prior to incubating with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:100). The cells were then fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and treated with HCl (2 m) for 30 min for BrdU antibody. Cells were washed with PBS for five times, blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum, and incubated with anti-BrdU monoclonal antibody (Jackson Immuno Research) in the blocking solution, which was followed by incubation in a mixture of Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson Immuno Research). For DNA staining, fixed cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml DAPI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Each experiment was performed at least three times. DERK and DMKP-3 dsRNAs were made as described previously (14.Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar), and dsDNA was made before in vitro transcription. DERK dsRNA was obtained by PCR (GenBank™ accession number M95126) against nucleotides 306–325 (sense primer) and 1066–1084 (antisense primers) using pBluescript-DERK (kindly provided by Dr. Ernst Hafen, Universitat Zurich, Switzerland). DMKP-3 dsRNA was also made by PCR of pOT2-DMKP-3 (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) against nucleotides 81–97 (sense primer) and 775–793 (antisense primer). Each primer was designed to contain a T7 RNA polymerase binding site (GAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGA) at its 5′ end. Each dsRNA was synthesized using a MEGAscript T7 transcription kit (Ambion). All dsRNAs were extracted by phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in water. The treatment of Schneider cells with human insulin activates DERK by phosphorylation within 5 min (Fig. 1 A) (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, the phospho-DERK proteins are significantly translocated into nuclei of the cells (Fig. 1 A). To understand the role of DERK activation in Schneider cell proliferation, we monitored the progression of the cell cycle by analyzing the proportion of cells progressing from the G1 to S phase following the treatment of the cells with insulin and checked the effects of DMKP-3 overexpression (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The human insulin stimulated the G1 to S phase cell cycle progression of Schneider cells, therefore, the fraction of cells in G0/G1 was decreased, and the relative portion of cells in the S phase was increased (Fig. 1 B). The G1 to S phase cell cycle progression by insulin was significantly blocked by the induction of DMKP-3 with CuSO4, therefore, the fraction of cells in the S phase was decreased from 52 to 33% (Fig. 1 B). Although the catalytically inactive mutant, DMKP-3-CA, lost most of its phosphatase activity (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it significantly retained the capacity to inhibit G1 to S progression (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the percentage of cells in the S phase was reduced from 47 to 37% by the induction of DMKP-3-CA in the cells treated with insulin (Fig. 1 B). The retention of the inhibitory effect on G1 to S phase progression of the catalytic mutant DMKP-3-CA suggests that CuSO4, which is used to induce the proteins, contributes partly to the inhibition of the G1 to S phase progression, or alternatively that the DMKP-3-CA mutant retains some cell cycle inhibitory function. Actually, the CuSO4 itself contributed somewhat to the inhibition of the G1 to S phase cell cycle progression, which was made evident by a control experiment using Schneider cells without a CuSO4-inducibleDMKP-3 gene (Fig. 1 B). However, the percentage of cells in the S phase, which decreased by CuSO4 treatment, was greater in DMKP-3-CA stable cells from 47% to 37% compared with that observed in Schneider cells (37% to 32%). Therefore, the DMKP-3-CA mutant partly retains the ability to inhibit G1 to S phase cell cycle progression. To confirm the role of DMKP-3 and to exclude the effect of CuSO4 on the regulation of G1 to S cell cycle progression, we expressed the DMKP-3 protein by transient transfection and monitored DNA synthesis by BrdU incorporation (19.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Under the cell growth condition used, ∼33% of cells actively incorporated BrdU, and the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU was increased ∼2.5-fold with the insulin treatment (Fig. 2), which demonstrates that insulin has a strong positive effect on DNA synthesis. BrdU incorporation was almost blocked in cells expressing DMKP-3, and only 6 and 15% of the cells expressing DMKP-3 incorporated BrdU in the absence or presence of insulin, respectively (Fig. 2, representative cells are shown in lower panel). Upon expressing the DMKP-3-CA catalytic mutant, the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU, which was increased by insulin treatment, was decreased to the uninduced level (i.e. from 83 to 35%) in cells treated with insulin (Fig. 2, upper panel). However, the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU was not reduced by DMKP-3-CA overexpression when the cells were grown in medium that was not treated with insulin (Fig. 2, upper panel). Therefore, the catalytic mutant DMKP-3-CA may retain an inhibitory role in G1 to S progression, especially in cells stimulated with insulin. To determine the role of the DERK binding ability of DMKP-3 in the inhibition of G1 to S phase progression, we also measured BrdU incorporation in cells expressing DMKP-3-RR (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the DERK binding mutant. The induction of DMKP-3-RR and of the DMKP-3-CA-RR double mutant did not markedly reduce the phospho-DERK levels under various expression levels. 2H.-B. Kwon and K.-Y. Choi, unpublished results. In addition, neither DMKP-3-RR nor DMKP-3-CA-RR significantly reduced the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU (Fig. 2, upper panel). Therefore, the DERK binding ability of DMKP-3 is essential for the regulation of the G1 to S phase cell cycle progression of Schneider cells. To understand the role of DERK in the control of cell size, we used data obtained from FACS analysis as forward scatter value comparisons (8.Prober D.A. Edgar B.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 435-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 12.Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We found that human insulin also stimulates an increase in the size of Schneider cells as well as promotes the G1 to S cell cycle transition. However, the cell size increase caused by insulin stimulation was not significantly blocked by the induction of either DMKP-3 or DMKP-3-CA by CuSO4 as the control Schneider cells were treated with CuSO4 (Fig. 3, compare upper three panelswith middle three panels). The inhibition of G1 to S phase cell cycle progression by catalytically inactive DMKP-3-CA mutant suggested that the DMKP-3 protein can regulate DERK activity by mechanism(s) other than catalysis. It is known that several MAPK phosphatases including mammalian MKP-3, can regulate MAPK by substrate trapping (19.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 20.Mattison C.P. Ota I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1229-1235PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether DMKP-3 can trap DERK within the cytoplasm of Schneider cells. In this case, we co-transfected plasmids for Myc-tagged DMKP-3 (DMKP-3-Myc) and His-tagged DERK (DERK-His) proteins and immunocytochemically localized the proteins. DERK-His proteins were found to be significantly localized in the cytoplasm when co-expressed with DMKP-3-Myc. The cytosolic localization of DERK-His was even more significant when cells were co-expressed together with the catalytically inactive DMKP-3-CA-Myc (Fig. 4). However, DERK proteins were significantly localized at the nuclei of cells by co-transfection with DMKP-3-RR-Myc, which had substantially lost its DERK binding capacity (Fig. 4) (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To identify the role of DERK in the proliferation of Schneider cells more directly, we depleted DERK or DMKP-3 protein by RNAi (14.Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The DERK protein levels were significantly lowered by DERK RNAi, and DERK activities, which were determined by phospho-ERK levels, were also subsequently lowered (Fig. 5 A). The insulin dependence of the activation of DERK activity was similarly observed in cells depleted in DERK (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, the insulin dependence on the activation of DERK was almost abolished in cells treated with DMKP-3 dsRNA, and therefore, the phospho-ERK level was high even without insulin stimulation (Fig. 5 A). Because of limitation in the detection of endogenous DMKP-3 within Schneider cells (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the effectiveness of DMKP-3 RNAi was proven by monitoring the level of transiently expressed DMKP-3-Myc both by Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses. These findings showed complete depletion of DMKP-3-Myc (Fig. 5 B). The treatment of DERK dsRNA caused percentages of cells incorporating BrdU to be reduced in both cells treated or not treated with insulinversus the control cells (Fig. 6). On the other hand, BrdU-positive cells were increased 69% by DMKP-3 RNAi in cells not treated with insulin. However, the percentage of BrdU-positive cells was not increased by DMKP-3 RNAi in cells stimulated with insulin (Fig. 6). Actually, the percentage of BrdU-positive cells was high without insulin treatment, and this was not increased further by DMKP-3 RNAi (Fig. 6). In addition, these results correlated with the phospho-DERK levels (Fig. 5). The ERK pathway is an important signaling pathway for the proliferation and differentiation of cells, and aberrant regulation of the pathway often results in cancers in mammals and abnormal development in Drosophila (1.Diaz-Benjumea F.J. Hafen E. Development. 1994; 120: 569-578PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E.

The role of the ERK pathway in the proliferation of cells is well characterized in mammals and is mediated by the activation of the cell cycle machinery, which regulates G1 to S phase progression (24.Kerkhoff E. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1457-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 25.Pages G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouyssegur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). InDrosophila, the ERK pathway has been mainly studied with respect to several developmental processes including eye development and the specification of terminal structures in the embryo (1.Diaz-Benjumea F.J. Hafen E. Development. 1994; 120: 569-578PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Brunner D. Oellers N. Szabad J. Biggs W.H. Zipursky S.L. Hafen E.

However, the upstream components of the ERK pathway, epidermal growth factor receptor and Drosophila RAS, are known to be involved in Drosophila cell division and growth (6.Baker N.E. Rubin G.M. Dev. Biol. 1992; 150: 381-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 8.Prober D.A.

Nature. 1989; 340: 150-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Currently, the role of downstream MAPK module kinases (26.Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) including DERK in the proliferation of cells has not been illustrated in Drosophila. Drosophila insulin receptor also transduces a signal for the positive regulation of growth (27.Fernandez R. Tabarini D. Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3373-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28.Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 29.Chen C. Jack J. Garofalo R.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The DInr, DAkt, Chico, and Dp110 (homologues of mammalian insulin receptors Akt, IRS, and PI3-K, respectively) influence both cell size and numbers in theDrosophila wing (28.Leevers S.J. Weinkove D. MacDougall L.K. Hafen E. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6584-6594Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 30.Weinkove D. Neufeld T.P. Twardzik T. Waterfield M.D. Leevers S.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and a reduction in the components resulted in the inhibition of both cell growth and cell size (27.Fernandez R. Tabarini D. Azpiazu N. Frasch M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3373-3384Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 29.Chen C. Jack J. Garofalo R.S. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar,30.Weinkove D. Neufeld T.P. Twardzik T. Waterfield M.D. Leevers S.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of DAKT increased cell size without increasing cell numbers and proliferation rates in imaginal discs (12.Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Therefore, the insulin receptor signaling pathway may regulate cell growth at the upstream of DAKT and be independent of DAKT, which involves size control. However, it is unknown how insulin receptor stimulates the proliferation of Drosophila cells, and it is also not clear whether this is because of direct modulation of the cell cycle machinery or other secondary effects (12.Verdu J. Buratovich M.A. Wilder E.L. Birnbaum M.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 500-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The stimulation of Schneider cells with human insulin caused the activation of the components of both DPI3K-DAKT and DSOR1-DERK cascades (14.Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). However, the physiological role(s) associated with the activation of the cascade was not characterized. In this study, we found that human insulin promotes cell proliferation through the G1 to S phase transition. G1 to S phase cell cycle progression and BrdU incorporation were significantly inhibited by DMKP-3 overexpression. This result suggests that insulin may stimulate G1 to S phase cell cycle progression through the activation of DERK. Although the DMKP-3-CA catalytic mutant essentially lost its DERK inhibitory function in vitro (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it significantly inhibited G1 to S phase cell cycle progression, especially in cells stimulated with insulin (Fig. 2, upper panel). The reduced number of BrdU-positive cells caused by DMKP-3-CA overexpression suggests that other function(s) of DMKP-3 rather than catalysis may be involved in the inhibition of insulin-stimulated cell proliferation. The cytosolic trapping of DERK by DMKP-3 could be an alternative mechanism for the inhibition of cell proliferation, and this was proven by the co-localization of DERK-His and DMKP-3-Myc and the differential localization of DERK-His and the DERK binding mutant, DMKP-3-RR (Fig. 4). DMKP-3-RR, which was defective in DERK binding ability, did not trap DERK in the cytosol, therefore, significant amounts of the DERK proteins were localized into the nuclei. Hence, the DMKP-3-RR and DMKP-3-CA-RR mutants, which did not interact with DERK, could not inhibit BrdU incorporation. Unexpectedly, the expression of the DMKP-3-CA-Myc catalytic mutant caused lower amounts of DERK-His proteins to be localized in the nucleus compared with the cells that co-expressed the wild-type DMKP-3-Myc. These results may attributed to the tighter interaction between DMKP-3-CA catalytic mutant and DERK as compared with the wild-type DMKP-3 (15.Kim S.H. Kwon H.-B. Kim Y.-S. Ryu J.-H. Kim K.-S. Ahn Y. Lee W.-J. Choi K.-Y. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cytosolic trapping of several MAPKs by specific MKPs was also observed in the mammalian and yeast system (19.Brunet A. Roux D. Lenormand P. Dowd S. Keyse S. Pouyssegur J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 664-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 20.Mattison C.P. Ota I.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1229-1235PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed that the inhibition of BrdU incorporation by DMKP-3-CA catalytic mutant only occurs in cells stimulated with insulin (Fig. 2, upper panel). Although less significant, we observed similar DMKP-3-CA effects in terms of the reduced percentage of cells at the S phase by insulin treatment (from 47 to 37%) compared with the reduction observed with no insulin treatment (from 33 to 28%) (Fig. 1 B). To identify the mechanism of DMKP-3-CA action in the inhibition of insulin-stimulated cell proliferation, we also measured BrdU incorporation in cells expressing DERK binding mutants, DMKP-3-RR and DMKP-3-CA-RR. In these experiments, the expression of neither DMKP-3-RR nor DMKP-3-CA-RR significantly lowered the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU even in cells stimulated with insulin (Fig. 2,upper panel). Therefore, the DERK binding ability of DMKP-3, which involved DERK sequestration within the cytosol, is essential to inhibit insulin-stimulated cell proliferation. BrdU incorporation was not significantly reduced by DMKP-3-RR or DMKP-3-CA-RR induction in basal cells not treated with insulin (Fig. 2, upper panel). These results suggest that DERK binding is prerequisite for catalysis and the subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation. The percentage of cells incorporated BrdU was also decreased by wild-type DMKP-3 in cells not treated with insulin. How does the DMKP-3 block basal BrdU incorporation but not DMKP-3-CA? Without insulin treatment, levels of both phospho-ERK and the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU were significantly up-regulated by DMKP-3 RNAi (Figs. 5 A and6 B), and the levels of phospho-ERK and the percentage of cells incorporating BrdU were almost equivalent to those observed in insulin-stimulated cells. These results suggest that DMKP-3 has a catalytic role in the regulation of basal ERK activity and the subsequent inhibition of basal BrdU incorporation. However, the percentage of cells inhibited BrdU incorporation by wild-type DMKP-3 expression in the basal status cells is more significant than the level inhibited by DMKP-3-CA expression (Fig. 2 B). These results further suggest that DMKP-3 may synergistically and subtly regulate cell proliferation through the coordinated dephosphorylation and cytosolic trapping of DERK. The levels of phospho-DERK and percentage of BrdU-incorporating cells were significantly decreased by DERK RNAi in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells, which suggest again the importance of DERK in the regulation of cell proliferation. In conclusion, we have identified the role of DERK in Schneider cell proliferation, which involves insulin signaling. In addition, we suggest that DMKP-3 plays important roles in the regulation of both basal and insulin-stimulated cell proliferation by catalysis and the trapping of DERK, respectively. The size increase of Schneider cells caused by insulin treatment provides evidence of the insulin pathway in the size increase of Schneider cells, and this finding agrees with previous observation in Drosophila imaginal disc or wing (9.Bohni R.

Although DERK was activated by insulin treatment in Schneider cells, the DERK activation was not involved in the size increase. The size increase of Schneider cells may be acquired by alternative route(s) such as the DPI3K-DAKT cascade (11.Gao X. Neufeld T.P. Pan D. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W2007242612,"The regulation of chondrogenesis and of the genes expressed as markers of chondrocyte differentiation is poorly understood. The hyaluronan-binding proteoglycan aggrecan is an essential and specific component of cartilage, but the aggrecan proximal promoter is expressed in an unregulated fashion in vitro. DNA comprising the rat aggrecan gene (83 kb including the 30-kb first intron) was surveyed for active elements, which would impart selective expression to the aggrecan promoter in transfection assays in vitro. A 4.7-kb DNA fragment (P3) with cell-specific enhancer activity was discovered ∼12 kb upstream of the transcription start site; this active DNA fragment is position- and orientation-independent, and strongly stimulates aggrecan promoter expression in chondrocytes, while weakly suppressing transcription in fibroblasts. Most of this activity has been localized to P3–7, a 2.3-kb internal fragment of P3. Another enhancer element (A23), which is not tissue-specific, was discovered about 70 kb downstream of the transcription start site. Several lines of transgenic mice were created using combinations of these DNA elements to drive the lacZreporter gene. Neither a short (900 bp) nor a long (3.7 kb) promoter alone showed detectable expression in 14.5-day embryos, whereas placing the P3 tissue-specific enhancer together with P0 gave strong expression restricted to embryonic cartilage of transgenic mice. The A23 downstream enhancer in conjunction with P0 did not confer expression. This is the first report of a gene control region which confers authentic tissue-specific regulation of aggrecan in vitroor in vivo and should greatly facilitate understanding the coordinate regulation of chondrocytic genes."

The gp190 is among the very few members of this large family to contain two CRH domains.

By using soluble forms of deletion mutants made by progressive truncations from the end of the D1IgD2 fragment, we demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal module of D2 was dispensable for LIF binding and that the correct conformation of the D1Ig fragment required a full amino-terminal module of D2.

Other members of the family in human also have two CRH domains. These consist of the common chain for the IL-3, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptors (the β-common chain), the TPO receptor, the leptin receptor, and also the OSM-specific receptor, which lacks the amino-terminal half of the membrane-distal CRH. In the β-common and the TPO receptor, the two CRH domains are adjacent to each other, and the available data suggest that only the membrane-proximal domain for the β-common chain (4.D'Andrea R.J.

Blood. 1999; 94: 365-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is involved in interactions with the ligand. Recently, crystallographic structure of the β-common ectodomain has been solved, showing that this receptor is expressed at the cell surface as an homodimer in the absence of any ligand, with two monomers tightly bound to each other (7.Carr P.D. Gustin S.E. Church A.P. Murphy J.M. Ford S.C. Mann D.A. Woltring D.M. Walker I. Ollis D.L. Young I.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 291-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine the respective roles of D1 and D2 in the receptor function, we reported previously (8.Taupin J.-L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that c-Myc-tagged truncation mutants of gp190 ectodomain lacking D2 were either never produced as secreted proteins and retained inside the cell (e.g. D1Igmyc and D1myc) or were secreted (e.g. D1IgFNmyc) but in both cases were not recognized by conformation-dependent anti-D1Ig mAb. In contrast, D1IgD2myc was efficiently secreted and bound LIF, whereas deletion mutants containing D2 but lacking D1,i.e. mutants IgD2FNmyc, D2Fnmyc, and D2myc, were efficiently secreted and folded but were unable to bind LIF (8.Taupin J.-L.

Therefore, it was concluded that D2 was required for a functional receptor to be produced and that the ability to bind LIF relied on both the presence of D1 and a superstructure involving direct contacts between the two CRH domains. Recently, we generated specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for human gp190, which displayed antagonistic or agonistic activity toward the receptor (9.Taupin J.-L. Legembre P. Bitard J. Daburon S.

One antagonistic mAb called 1C7 was directed against the D1Ig region and displayed a LIF blocking activity via impairment of LIF/gp190 interaction, whereas another called 12D3 was directed against the D2 domain and displayed a LIF blocking activity via impairment of gp130 recruitment to the LIF-gp190 complex. In addition, a pair combination of anti-D2 mAb, including mAb 12D3, displayed a potent agonistic activity in the absence of LIF, a phenotype that was never obtained with a large panel of anti-D1Ig mAb (9.Taupin J.-L. Legembre P. Bitard J. Daburon S. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Godard A. Jacques Y. Moreau J.F. J. Biol.

Taken together, these findings strongly suggested that the two CRH domains have distinct roles in receptor conformation, LIF binding, and receptor activation. Here, we attempted to address these questions more specifically for the D2 domain. In a first step, deletion mutants lacking one or several domains of gp190 extracellular region, as well as deletion mutants within D2, were fused to a transmembrane and intracellular transducing region, and their ability to trigger cytokine-dependent or -independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells was studied. In a second step, progressive deletions were performed in the D2 domain starting from the carboxyl terminus of the shortest LIF-binding receptor (i.e.D1IgD2) backward to the Ig-like domain. These mutants were expressed in a soluble form, and their ability to bind LIF and maintain the general conformation of the receptor was analyzed. The anti-gp190 mAbs specific for domains D1 (6G8) or D2 (12D3, 8C2) have already been described (9.Taupin J.-L. Legembre P. Bitard J. Daburon S. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Duplomb L. Godard A. Jacques Y.

The anti-gp130 mAb B-S12 was purchased from Diaclone (Besançon, France). The anti-c-Myc mAb 9E10 was purified from cell culture supernatants of the secreting hybridoma provided by Dr. Ramsay (see Ref. 11.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Human OSM and murine interleukin (IL)-3 were as supernatants of transiently transfected COS cells. Human LIF was produced in stably transfected CHO cells (12.Taupin J.-L. Gualde N. Moreau J.F. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cytokines were used as crude supernatants along with control supernatants of nontransfected recipient cells. We have already described the generation of the secreted carboxyl-terminally c-Myc-tagged gp190 (sgp190myc) and its deletion mutants D1IgD2myc, IgD2FNmyc, D1IgFNmyc, D2FNmyc, D2myc, and FNmyc (8.Taupin J.-L.

The creation of the gp190/130 chimeric transmembrane form that contains the full-length gp190 ectodomain fused to the transmembrane and intracellular region of gp130 has also been described (8.Taupin J.-L.

The same strategy was used to obtain the D1IgD2/130, IgD2FN/130, D1IgFN/130, D2FN/130, D2/130, and FN/130 transmembrane forms of the deletion mutants. We used the transmembrane and intracellular region of gp130 instead of that of gp190, because the homodimerization of the intracellular segment of gp190 is not able to transduce any proliferative signal in contrast to gp130 (9.Taupin J.-L.

The truncations within the D2 domain were carried out by PCR, using specific primers. We first prepared the series of mutants containing fragments of D2 deleted from its carboxyl terminus and then fused them to the D1Ig-encoding region as follows. The piece of D2 domain was amplified using a sense primer that contained an EcoRV site and a specific antisense primer that contained an XbaI site. The PCR product was digested and ligated into the pEDr plasmid (14.Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) encoding D1IgD2myc, digested with EcoRV and XbaI to remove D2. The EcoRV site is located at the beginning of D2 in the wild-type receptor, and the XbaI site fuses the D2 domain to the c-Myc tag. The following mutants were made, named with the residue in gp190 sequence after which the deletion was performed: Δ345, Δ355, Δ371, Δ381, Δ391, Δ398, Δ415, Δ431, Δ448, Δ459, Δ472, Δ489, Δ499, and Δ514. Residue numbering is according to Gearing et al. (1.Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.J. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). We also prepared mutants containing fragments of D2 deleted from its amino terminus or its carboxyl terminus, which we fused to the transmembrane and intracellular region of gp130 as follows. The D2 domain coding region was amplified using a specific sense primer that contained anSpeI site and an antisense primer that contained anXbaI site for those deleted from D2 amino terminus, or a sense primer that contained an SpeI site and a specific antisense primer that contained an XbaI site for those deleted from D2 carboxyl terminus. The PCR product was digested and ligated into the pEDr plasmid encoding mycD2/130, digested withSpeI at the beginning of D2 and XbaI at the junction between D2 and the transmembrane region. The plasmid pEDr-mycD2/130 was obtained by digesting the plasmid pEDr-D2/130 withSpeI and inserting a double-stranded DNA sequence encoding the c-Myc epitope flanked by XbaI and SpeI sites. The following mutants bearing deletions from D2 amino terminus were made, mycD2(432–541)/130 and mycD2(500–541)/130. The following mutants bearing deletions from D2 carboxyl terminus were made, mycD2(332–431)/130, mycD2(332–459)/130, and mycD2(332–499)/130. The plasmid pEDr-myc/130 was obtained by digesting the plasmid pEDr-mycD2/130 with SpeI and XbaI and then religating the empty vector. The constructs encoding chimeras fused to DHFR-(1,2), and DHFR-(3) fragments were obtained as follows. Fragments encoding DHFR-(1,2) and DHFR-(3) preceded by a 10-amino acid long linker were excised with XbaI and SmaI from pBS plasmids, provided by Dr. Michnick, and subcloned in a pZ plasmid, which corresponds to a pEdr plasmid (14.Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) from which the DHFR gene has been replaced by the neomycin resistance gene. This pZ plasmid also contained a gp130 coding sequence that was mutated to bear anXbaI site at the junction between the transmembrane and the intracellular region. Then the sequence encompassing the transmembrane, the linker, and each of the DHFR fragment regions was amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides bearing SpeI and EcoNI restriction sites. The digested PCR products were subcloned into the pEDr-D2/130 and pEDr-myc/130 digested by XbaI andEcoNI, leading to pEDr-D2-DHFR-(1,2), pEDr-D2-DHFR-(3), pEDr-myc-DHFR-(1,2), and pEDR-myc-DHFR-(3). All the mutants were sequenced (Cybergene, Evry, France). The sequences of all the primers used are available upon request. Parent Ba/F3 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and murine IL-3 at a final 1/200 dilution. They were washed and electroporated (280 V, 900 microfarads, infinite resistance) using an Easyject+ electroporator (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium), with plasmids pRcglo or pRcglo-gp130, which bore the neomycin resistance gene, in the presence or absence of the pEDr plasmid containing either the gp190/130 chimera or the chimeric transmembrane deletion mutants of the gp190 ectodomain. The cells were plated in medium containing IL-3. At day 1, G418 was added at 1 mg/ml. Every other day between day 4 and 14, 80% of the culture medium was replaced by fresh medium containing G418 supplemented or not with LIF at 50 ng/ml. At day 16, the cells were washed to eliminate residual traces of IL-3; G418 selection was stopped, and the living cells were maintained in medium with LIF or without any added cytokine. For the transient transfection of COS cells, we used the DEAE-dextran method, as described previously (8.Taupin J.-L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Supernatants were harvested at day 5 after the transfection. For the metabolic labeling experiments, the35S substrate was added at day 3 for an overnight incubation before supernatants were harvested. The stable transfection of the DHFR-deficient CHO-DUCKX cell line was as described elsewhere (8.Taupin J.-L. Miossec V. Pitard V. Blanchard F. Daburon S. Raher S. Jacques Y. Godard A. Moreau J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14482-14489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All the gp190 deletion mutants we used in this study were cloned in the pEDr plasmid, which contains a functional DHFR encoding sequence that confers to the transfected CHO-DUCKX cells, the ability to grow in the nucleoside-free selection medium. All the experiments using transfected CHO cell lines were performed on confluent monolayers of cells, at least 3–4 weeks after transfection (around 107cells per 10-cm diameter dish). Ba/F3 cells were grown in suspension, and adherent CHO cells were released following treatment with PBS containing 25 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C prior to staining. For each staining, 2 × 105 cells were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with saturating concentrations (10 μg/ml) of the indicated antibody in 0.1 ml of PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.1% human polyclonal IgG (w/v, both from Sigma). The cells were then washed twice with the same buffer and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with the FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed by resuspension in 0.14 ml of PBS containing 1% formaldehyde (v/v) and analyzed by flow cytometry with a three-color FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Mountain View, CA) using the CellQuest software. Metabolic labeling of the recombinant protein expressed in CHO cells was performed as follows. Cells were starved for 2 h in 4 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Then 200 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Translabel, ICN, Orsay, France) were added per dish. When supernatants were to be analyzed, they were harvested 12 h later, centrifuged to remove debris, and stored at 4 °C until use. For the preparation of cell lysates, the supernatant was discarded 4 h after the labeling had begun; the cell layer was washed with PBS, and the cells were lysed in 4 ml of an isotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) in the presence of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min on ice. Then the cell lysate was harvested, centrifuged to remove debris, and stored at −80 °C until use. For the immunoprecipitation, 1 ml of CHO supernatant or lysate was pre-cleared one or four times, respectively, with 0.05 ml of a 50% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Affi-Gel protein A, Bio-Rad) for 1 h at 4 °C under continuous rolling. Beads were eliminated by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated with 20 μg of the indicated mAb for 2 h under similar conditions. Immune complexes bound to protein A were sedimented by rapid centrifugation, and beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Bead pellets were resuspended in 0.025 ml of sample loading buffer containing 0.1m dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and visualized by fluorography. The proliferation assays were conducted as follows. Ba/F3 cells were washed three times with RPMI, and then cells (5 × 103 per well, in 50 μl, in duplicate) were incubated in the presence of 50 μl of 3-fold dilutions of LIF or OSM or of IL-3 as a positive control and culture medium without any added cytokine as a negative control, as indicated. After 3 days at 37 °C, 0.015 ml of a 5 mg/ml solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Sigma) in PBS was added to each well. After 4 h at 37 °C, 0.11 ml of a mixture of 95% isopropyl alcohol + 5% formic acid was added to the wells, and the absorbance values were read in a Titertek Multiskan microplate reader (Labsystems, Les Ullis, France) at 570 nm. The blank consisted of eight wells containing only culture medium. The sandwich ELISA for soluble gp190 measurement has been described previously (15.Pitard V. Lorgeot V. Taupin J.-L. Aubard Y.

Both mAb are directed at the D1Ig fragment of gp190, and the assay has a detection limit of 0.5 ng/ml. To estimate the relative affinity of the soluble deletion mutants for LIF, we set up a sandwich ELISA as follows. All steps were performed at room temperature, and plate washes were performed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The anti-gp190 mAb 6G8 was used as a capture mAb. After saturation with PBS containing 1% BSA for 1 h, plates were washed once and then incubated with a saturating and constant concentration of 200 ng/ml wild-type sgp190myc or its mutants for 2 h and washed three times. Serial dilutions of CHO-derived human LIF ranging from 0.256 to 4000 ng/ml were added for 2 h. After 3 washes, plates were incubated with the biotinylated non-blocking anti-LIF mAb 1F10 at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml for 1.5 h and washed again 3 times. The plates were then incubated with peroxidase-labeled streptavidin for 30 min and washed 3 times. The plates were revealed by the addition of the substrate tetramethylbenzidine (Sigma) and read at 450 nm after the addition of half a volume of 1 n sulfuric acid. When grown in the presence of IL-3 or in cytokine-free medium, Ba/F3 cell lines were washed twice with serum- and cytokine-free RPMI medium before the activation step. When grown in the presence of LIF, Ba/F3 cells were first washed twice and starved for 2 days in the presence of IL-3 and then washed with serum-free and cytokine-free medium. The cells were activated by incubation for 2 h with cytokine-free medium or medium containing 50 ng/ml hLIF, in the presence of 8% fetal calf serum. The cells were then rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately lysed on ice for 15 min with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100) in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (2 mm) and proteinase inhibitors. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was harvested, and the total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Sigma) using BSA as a standard. The cell lysate (10 μg of proteins/lane) was boiled for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% gels and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 0.1% Tween 20/Tris-buffered saline (TBST) supplemented with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated in TBST supplemented with 5% (w/v) milk with a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit anti-STAT3 serum (R & D Systems Europe, Abingdon, UK) or a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Ozyme, St-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France) for 3 h at room temperature. After three washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin polyclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., CliniSciences, Montrouge, France) for another hour at room temperature. The membrane was washed again three times in TBST, and the proteins were visualized using the chemiluminescence ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The ability of the DHFR reconstituted from its separated fragments to bind its ligand methotrexate was studied as described in Remy et al. (16.Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). DHFR-lacking CHO DUCKX cells, both parent and stable transfectants, were plated in 24-well plates at 3 × 105 cells/well and cultured in medium containing dialyzed serum for 22 h at 37 °C in the absence of added nucleosides and in the presence of 10 μm of FITC-labeled methotrexate (fMTX, Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). The cell layer was gently washed once in PBS and incubated for 30 min in the absence of fMTX to allow the efflux of unbound fMTX from the cell cytoplasm. The cell layer was washed four times on ice with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were detached with trypsin in PBS. After neutralization of trypsin with 1:10 volume of serum, fMTX-DHFR intracellular complexes were analyzed by flow cytometry. A series of deletion mutants within the gp190 ectodomain, which lacked one or several of its constitutive D1, Ig, D2, or FN modules, namely DIIgD2, IgD2FN, D2FN, D2, D1IgFN, and FN, were obtained fused to gp130 transmembrane and intracellular region (Fig. 1). They were transfected alone or in combination with full-length gp130 in Ba/F3 cells. The transfectants were selected by progressive replacement of IL-3, which is required to sustain parental Ba/F3 cells proliferation, by plain culture medium without any added cytokine or by culture medium containing LIF. Table I summarizes the results of these stable transfection experiments, in terms of ability for the deletion mutants to confer long term proliferation of the Ba/F3 cell recipient. At least four transfections were performed, with up to six for the remaining deletion mutants that were unable to allow cell growth after four attempts. As already reported, in the presence of LIF, gp130 alone never led to cell proliferation, because gp190 is required for LIF binding. Chimeric gp190/130, which contained the full gp190 ectodomain, only triggered cell proliferation in the presence of gp130 and LIF. The mutants D1IgD2/130, D1IgFN/130, and FN/130 were not able to sustain cell survival and proliferation under any of the conditions tested. In contrast, the IgD2FN, D2FN, and D2 deletion mutants reproducibly conferred long term cell proliferation, which was independent of gp130 or LIF, because it occurred even upon transfection of the gp190 mutant alone. We also designed a construct where the entire ectodomain of gp190, but not its signal peptide encoding sequence, was removed and replaced by a c-Myc tag. This construct called Myc/130 was transfected under the same conditions. As can be seen in Table I, it did not lead to gp130- or LIF-dependent or -independent proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Therefore, the spontaneous proliferation occurring with several of the deletion mutants could not be attributed to the transmembrane and intracellular region of gp130 by itself, which then was considered to be unable to trigger a productive signal on its own.Table IGeneration of Ba/F3 cell lines following stable transfection of the gp190 deletion mutantsConditions for transfection and cytokine selection1-aThe gp190 deletion mutant was transfected together with the G418 resistance plasmid encoding gp130 (gp130 plasmid) or with the empty G418 resistance plasmid (no gp130 plasmid), and cells were selected in the presence of G418 and by progressive replacement of IL-3 with cytokine-free medium (no cytokine) or medium containing LIF (LIF).gp190 deletion mutantNonegp190/130D1IgD2/130IgD2FN/130D2FN/130D2/130D1IgFN/130FN/130myc/130No gp130 plasmid, no cytokine01-b0, no stable cell line obtained from"

 in his Perspective show, however, that the previous energy estimates were too high because the emission was believed to be isotropic. With respect to energetics, gamma-ray bursts tie with supernovae. Gamma-ray bursts continue to hold the record as the brightest objects in the universe."
