https://openalex.org/W2057864962,"How China and the rest of the world affect each other. China's environmental problems dominate those of the world, not only because China contains a fifth of the world's people, but also because China's economy is so big and developing so rapidly. The expanding links of globalization mean that China's problems are the world's problems too. In a Feature this week, Jianguo Liu and Jared Diamond look at the effects of China's sweeping environmental change and socio-economic challenges, synthesizing detailed literature that is scattered even for Chinese readers and largely inaccessible to western readers. On the cover, crowds on Nanjing Lu, Shanghai's famous shopping street where global influences are clear to see (Mark Henley/Panos). Elsewhere in the issue, Peter Aldhous reports on how China plans to cope with its exploding need for energy."
https://openalex.org/W1972181361,"The innate immune system of mammals provides a rapid response to repel assaults from numerous infectious agents including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. A major component of this system is a diverse combination of cationic antimicrobial peptides that include the alpha- and beta-defensins and cathelicidins. In this study, we show that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and three of its analogs induced expression of the human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) gene. This induction was observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), immortalized keratinocyte, and colon cancer cell lines, as well as normal human bone marrow (BM) -derived macrophages and fresh BM cells from two normal individuals and one AML patient. The induction occurred via a consensus vitamin D response element (VDRE) in the CAMP promoter that was bound by the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Induction of CAMP in murine cells was not observed and expression of CAMP mRNA in murine VDR-deficient bone marrow was similar to wild-type levels. Comparison of mammalian genomes revealed evolutionary conservation of the VDRE in a short interspersed nuclear element or SINE in the CAMP promoter of primates that was absent in the mouse, rat, and canine genomes. Our findings reveal a novel activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and the VDR in regulation of primate innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2077132193,"In eukaryotic cells, transcription of every protein-coding gene begins with the assembly of an RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex (PIC) on the promoter. The promoters, in conjunction with enhancers, silencers and insulators, define the combinatorial codes that specify gene expression patterns. Our ability to analyse the control logic encoded in the human genome is currently limited by a lack of accurate information regarding the promoters for most genes. Here we describe a genome-wide map of active promoters in human fibroblast cells, determined by experimentally locating the sites of PIC binding throughout the human genome. This map defines 10,567 active promoters corresponding to 6,763 known genes and at least 1,196 un-annotated transcriptional units. Features of the map suggest extensive use of multiple promoters by the human genes and widespread clustering of active promoters in the genome. In addition, examination of the genome-wide expression profile reveals four general classes of promoters that define the transcriptome of the cell. These results provide a global view of the functional relationships among transcriptional machinery, chromatin structure and gene expression in human cells."

https://openalex.org/W2060179384,"Mitochondrial oxidative damage contributes to a wide range of pathologies, including cardiovascular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, protecting mitochondria from oxidative damage should be an effective therapeutic strategy. However, conventional antioxidants have limited efficacy due to the difficulty of delivering them to mitochondria in situ. To overcome this problem, we developed mitochondria-targeted antioxidants, typified by MitoQ, which comprises a lipophilic triphenylphosphonium (TPP) cation covalently attached to a ubiquinol antioxidant. Driven by the large mitochondrial membrane potential, the TPP cation concentrates MitoQ several hundred-fold within mitochondria, selectively preventing mitochondrial oxidative damage. To test whether MitoQ was active in vivo, we chose a clinically relevant form of mitochondrial oxidative damage: cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. Feeding MitoQ to rats significantly decreased heart dysfunction, cell death, and mitochondrial damage after ischemia-reperfusion. This protection was due to the antioxidant activity of MitoQ within mitochondria, as an untargeted antioxidant was ineffective and accumulation of the TPP cation alone gave no protection. Therefore, targeting antioxidants to mitochondria in vivo is a promising new therapeutic strategy in the wide range of human diseases such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and Friedreich's ataxia where mitochondrial oxidative damage underlies the pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2006311748,"NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to the promoter sequence ""antioxidant responsive element (ARE)"" leading to coordinated up-regulation of ARE-driven detoxification and antioxidant genes. Since the expression of a wide array of antioxidant and detoxification genes are positively regulated by the ARE sequence, Nrf2 may serve as a master regulator of the ARE-driven cellular defense system against oxidative stress. In support of this, numerous studies have shown that Nrf2 protects many cell types and organ systems from a broad spectrum of toxic insults and disease pathogenesis. This Nrf2-conferred, multi-organ protection phenomenon raises an interesting question about how a single protein can protect many different organs from various toxic insults. A possible molecular mechanism explaining this phenomenon is that Nrf2 protects many different cell types by coordinately up-regulating classic ARE-driven genes as well as cell type-specific target genes that are required for the defense system of each cell type in its unique environment. This hypothesis is supported by microarray data indicating the protective role of Nrf2 is conveyed through both known ARE-driven genes and novel cell type-specific genes. The widespread nature of Nrf2 may have an important therapeutic potential, allowing prevention of carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2137574569,"To search for novel transcriptional pathways that are activated in skeletal muscle after endurance exercise, we used cDNA microarrays to measure global mRNA expression after an exhaustive bout of high-intensity cycling (approximately 75 min). Healthy, young, sedentary males performed the cycling bout, and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken from the vastus lateralis before, and at 3 and 48 h after exercise. We examined mRNA expression in individual muscle samples from four subjects using cDNA microarrays, used repeated-measures significance analysis of microarray (SAM) to determine statistically significant expression changes, and confirmed selected results using real-time RT-PCR. In total, the expression of 118 genes significantly increased 3 h postcycling and 8 decreased. At 48 h, the expression of 29 genes significantly increased and 5 decreased. Many of these are potentially important novel genes involved in exercise recovery and adaptation, including several involved in 1) metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis (FOXO1, PPARdelta, PPARgamma, nuclear receptor binding protein 2, IL-6 receptor, ribosomal protein L2, aminolevulinate delta-synthase 2); 2) the oxidant stress response (metalothioneins 1B, 1F, 1G, 1H, 1L, 2A, 3, interferon regulatory factor 1); and 3) electrolyte transport across membranes [Na+-K+-ATPase (beta3), SERCA3, chloride channel 4]. Others include genes involved in cell stress, proteolysis, apoptosis, growth, differentiation, and transcriptional activation, as well as all three nuclear receptor subfamily 4A family members (Nur77, Nurr1, and Nor1). This study is the first to characterize global mRNA expression during recovery from endurance exercise, and the results provide potential insight into 1) the transcriptional contributions to homeostatic recovery in human skeletal muscle after endurance exercise, and 2) the transcriptional contributions from a single bout of endurance exercise to the adaptive processes that occur after a period of endurance exercise training."
https://openalex.org/W1977748966,"Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is a popular domestic analgesic and antipyretic agent with a weak anti-inflammatory action and a low incidence of adverse effects as compared with aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Here we show that acetaminophen, following deacetylation to its primary amine, is conjugated with arachidonic acid in the brain and the spinal cord to form the potent TRPV1 agonist N-arachidonoylphenolamine (AM404). This conjugation is absent in mice lacking the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase. AM404 also inhibits purified cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 and prostaglandin synthesis in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. This novel metabolite of acetaminophen also acts on the endogenous cannabinoid system, which, together with TRPV1 and COX, is present in the pain and thermoregulatory pathways. These findings identify fatty acid conjugation as a novel pathway for drug metabolism and provide a molecular mechanism for the occurrence of the analgesic N-acylphenolamine AM404 in the nervous system following treatment with acetaminophen.

Acetaminophen was introduced into clinical medicine more than a century ago, but its mechanism of action is still a matter of debate. The analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are believed to depend on their ability to inhibit COX 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; FAAH, fatty acid amide hydrolase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride.

However, acetaminophen differs from most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in that it is a weak anti-inflammatory agent with a low incidence of COX-related adverse effects (2Insel P.A. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. 9th. McGraw-Hill, New York1996: 617-657Google Scholar, 3Clissold S.P.

Such a peroxide-dependent inhibition of COX could explain why acetaminophen does not suppress inflammation and platelet activity (5Hanel A.M. Lands W.E. Biochem.

However, final proof that the analgesic and antipyretic effects of acetaminophen are dependent on COX is still lacking. There are also indications that the analgesic effect of acetaminophen is mediated by molecular targets distinct from COX (8Hunskaar S. Hole K.

After 20 min, the animals were killed to collect brain, liver, spinal cord, and arterial blood. The tissues were homogenized in Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 7.6) containing EDTA (1 mm). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF; 0.1 mm) and ascorbic acid (0.3 mm) were also present in the Tris buffer and added to the blood samples to prevent degradation of fatty acid amides and p-aminophenol, respectively. Aliquots (200 μl) of blood and homogenates were precipitated with 1 ml of ice-cold acetone containing 1 μm2H8-labeled anandamide as internal standard. The samples were kept on ice until the acetone phase was vacuum evaporated.Tissue Homogenate ExperimentsThe brain, liver, spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia from Wistar-Hannover rats (female; 200–300 g) or FAAH gene knock-out mice and their homozygous controls (female and male; 25–30 g) were homogenized in a Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 7.6) containing EDTA (1 mm) at volumes of 5–10 ml/g tissue. We carried out experiments in aliquots of 200 μl homogenate at 37 °C as further explained in the text. The reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold acetone containing 1 μm [2H8]anandamide. The samples were kept on ice until the acetone phase was vacuum evaporated.Rat Purified FAAH Enzyme AssayThe enzyme assay was performed in triplicate with rat purified FAAH (>95% purity), containing an N-terminal His6 tag and a truncation of amino acid residues 1–29, which constitute a predicted transmembrane domain (30Patricelli M.P. Lashuel H.A. Giang D.K. Kelly J.W. Cravatt B.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15177-15187Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The amount of FAAH protein in the assay was 100 nm. Reactions were conducted in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, with 5 mm p-aminophenol and 100 μm arachidonic acid. Both substrate stocks were prepared in ethanol, which was not >5% of the total volume of 300 μl. The reaction was initiated by addition of FAAH or Tris buffer for controls. At each time point (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min), 50 μl of the reaction was removed and quenched by addition to 300 μl of 0.1 m hydrochloric acid. It was extracted in 300 μl of ethyl acetate, which was removed and concentrated to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The initial rate of formation of AM404 was obtained from a linear fit of time (0–20 min) versus AM404 produced.Quantitative AnalysesFor in vivo and tissue homogenate experiments, the extraction residues were reconstituted in 100 μl of methanol except for p-aminophenol, for which 100 μl of 0.5% acetic acid was used. The quantitative analyses were performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 200 liquid chromatography system with autosampler (Applied Biosystems) coupled to an API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS-SCIEX). All mobile phases were water-methanol gradients containing 0.5% acetic acid, and the flow rate was 200 μl/min except for arachidonic acid, where it was 400 μl/min. In experiments with rat purified FAAH, the residue was reconstituted in 50 μl of ethanol. The quantitative analyses were performed on a Hewlett-Packard series 1100 LC with a mass spectrometer detector.AM404 and Anandamide—Sample aliquots of 5 μl were injected on a Genesis C8 column (20 × 2.1 mm; Jones Chromatography). Initially, the mobile flow was 25% water for 5.5 min. Then a linear gradient to 100% methanol was applied in 0.2 min, and the mobile phase was kept at 100% methanol for 2.3 min, after which the column was reconditioned in 25% water for 2 min. The electrospray interface was operating in the positive ion mode at 370 °C, the ion spray voltage was 4500 volts, and the declustering potential was 40 volts. m/z 396.1/109.8 with a collision energy of 27 volts was used for the determination of AM404, whereas m/z 348.2/61.6 with a collision energy of 35 volts was used for the determination of anandamide. m/z 356.4/62.2 with a collision energy of 35 volts was used for the internal standard, 2H8-labeled anandamide. In experiments with rat purified FAAH, sample aliquots of 40 μl were injected on a Haisil C4 column (150 × 4.6 mm; Higgins Analytical, Inc.). A linear gradient elution was applied from 100% buffer A (95:5 water/methanol with 0.1% formic acid) to 100% buffer B (60:35:5 isopropanol/methanol/water with 0.1% formic acid) in 30 min. The MH+ (396.6) and MNa+ (418.6) mass peaks were extracted and integrated for quantification of AM404.p-Aminophenol—Sample aliquots of 2 μl were injected on a Genesis phenyl column (150 × 2.1 mm; Jones Chromatography). The mobile flow was initially 97% water for 2 min. Then a linear gradient to 100% methanol was applied in 1 min and the mobile phase was kept at 100% methanol for 2 min, after which the column was reconditioned in 97% water for 3 min. The electrospray ion source was set at 450 °C and used in the positive ion mode. The ion spray voltage and declustering potential were set to 4500 volts and 55 volts, respectively. m/z 109.9/64.6 with a collision energy of 31 volts was used for the quantitative determinations of p-aminophenol.Acetaminophen—Sample aliquots of 5 μl were injected on a Genesis C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm; Jones Chromatography). The mobile flow was initially 90%, and a linear gradient to 80% methanol was immediately applied in 5 min. The mobile phase was kept at 80% methanol for 1 min, after which the column was reconditioned in 90% water for 3 min. The electrospray ion source was set at 370 °C and used in the positive ion mode. The ion spray voltage and declustering potential were set to 4500 volts and 55 volts, respectively. m/z 151.9/109.8 with a collision energy of 25 volts was used for the quantitative determinations of acetaminophen.[2H8]Arachidonic Acid—Sample aliquots of 5 μl were injected on a Genesis C18 column (50 × 2.1 mm; Jones Chromatography). High performance liquid chromatography was operated isocratically at 20% water and 80% methanol. The electrospray ion source was operating in the negative ion mode at 370 °C, the ion spray voltage was –3000 volts, and the declustering potential was –120 volts. m/z 310.8/267.0 with a collision energy of –22 volts was used for the quantitative determinations.COX-1 and COX-2 AssaysCOX-1 activity and COX-2 activity were determined in the presence of 10 μm arachidonic acid using a COX (ovine) inhibitor screening assay (Cayman). Drugs were incubated with the enzyme preparation 8 min before the application of arachidonic acid. Prostaglandin formation was used as a measure of COX activity and quantified via enzyme immunoassay.COX-2 Activity in RAW264.7 MacrophagesRAW264.7 cells, obtained from American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (all from Sigma). Experiments were performed on confluent cells grown in 6-well Falcon plates (passages 3–6) and then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 μg/ml) for 18 h (37 °C, 5% CO2) to induce COX-2. The medium was replaced with fresh medium, and test substances or vehicles (0.1% Me2SO for AM404 and NS-398; distilled water for indomethacin) were added 1 h before the cells were further exposed to arachidonic acid (1 μm) or its vehicle (0.1% Me2SO) for 1 h. Aliquots of the medium were removed, and the prostaglandin E2 content was determined using a monoclonal enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman).Recording of TensionExperiments were performed on mesenteric arteries from female Wistar-Hannover rats (250 g) as described (31Zygmunt P.M.

Briefly, the arteries were cut into ring segments and mounted in tissue baths containing aerated physiological salt solution (5% CO2 and 95% O2 at 37 °C, pH 7.4). Experiments were carried out in the presence of NG-nitro-l-arginine (0.3 mm) and indomethacin (10 μm) to eliminate any contribution of nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase products, respectively. We studied relaxant responses in preparations contracted with phenylephrine. When stable contractions were obtained, substances were added cumulatively to determine concentration-response relationships.Calculations and StatisticsData are presented as means ± S.E. (vertical lines in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), and n indicates the number of animals unless stated otherwise. GraphPad Prism 3.0 software was used for curve fitting (non-linear regressions) and calculations of pEC50 values. A Mann-Whitney U test or Student's t test on log-transformed values was used for statistical analysis. Statistical significance was accepted when p < 0.05.Fig. 3The formation of AM404 is dependent on the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). A and B, rat brain homogenates were incubated for 1 h with p-aminophenol plus arachidonic acid (each 100 μm) to generate AM404 (n = 4) (A) or [2H8]-anandamide (10 μm) to study its hydrolysis (B). Prior incubation for 1 h with the FAAH inhibitor PMSF (100 μm) prevents the production of AM404 (n = 4) and the formation of [2H8]arachidonic acid ([2H8]AA), the breakdown product of anandamide (n = 4). C, time-dependent formation of AM404 when p-aminophenol (5 mm) and arachidonic acid (100 μm) are incubated with rat purified FAAH (filled circles) but not with its vehicle (open circles; n = 3–6). D, in brain homogenates from FAAH–/– mice or their control littermates (FAAH+/+) incubated with p-aminophenol (100 μm) for 1 h (n = 5), AM404 could only be detected in FAAH+/+ mice. E, treatment of rats with PMSF (10 mg/kg subcutaneously) but not vehicle (control) for 20 min before exposure to acetaminophen (300 mg/kg intraperitoneally) for 20 min abolishes the AM404 production as measured in brain (n = 5). F, no AM404 could be detected in brains from FAAH–/– mice exposed to acetaminophen (300 mg/kg intraperitoneally) for 20 min (n = 5). G, the formation of p-aminophenol from acetaminophen (300 mg/kg intraperitoneally; 20 min) is partially inhibited in brain of rats pretreated with PMSF (10 mg/kg subcutaneously) for 20 min (n = 5).

A, AM404 causes concentration-dependent inhibition of COX-1 (open circles) and COX-2 (filled circles) activity in isolated enzyme preparations (n = 4–5). Indomethacin (10 μm) and the COX-2 selective inhibitor NS-398 (10 μm) also abolished COX-1 (6 ± 0.4%, n = 4) and COX-2 (11 ± 2%, n = 6) activity, respectively (not shown). COX activity was measured as prostaglandin (PG) formation in the presence of 10 μm arachidonic acid. B, AM404 reduces the formation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in RAW264.7 macrophages. Cells were exposed to LPS for 18 h to induce COX-2 activity. The medium was replaced with fresh medium, and cells were incubated with different concentrations of AM404, the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398, or the non-selective COX-inhibitor indomethacin (Indo) for 1 h. Arachidonic acid (AA) was then added to the medium for another 1 h, after which the prostaglandin E2 content was determined. The data are obtained from six to eight independent experiments performed in duplicate or triplicate and expressed as a percentage of the maximal prostaglandin E2 formation in LPS-stimulated cells. *, p < 0.001 compared with maximal prostaglandin E2 production.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6AM404 but neither acetaminophen nor p-aminophenol acts on native TRPV1 receptors in rat-isolated mesenteric arteries. A, AM404 is a potent vasodilator (open circles) of arterial segments contracted with phenylephrine (n = 11). The action of AM404 is inhibited by the competitive TRPV1 receptor antagonist capsazepine (3 μm; filled circles; n = 5) and the non-competitive TRPV1 receptor antagonist ruthenium red (1 μm; diamonds; n = 4). AM404 was unable to relax arteries pre-treated with capsaicin (1 μm) for 30 min (n = 4; not shown), causing desensitization and/or depletion of sensory neuropeptides (31Zygmunt P.M. Petersson J.

The broken line with triangles shows the relaxant effect of “endogenous” AM404 from rat homogenates incubated with p-aminophenol (mean of four arterial segments from the same rat). Endogenous AM404 was purified using liquid chromatography and quantified by liquid chromatography along with tandem mass spectrometry as described. Tension traces show relaxant responses to increasing concentrations of exogenous (upper trace) and endogenous (lower trace) AM404. B, concentration-response curves for capsaicin in arterial segments contracted with phenylephrine after treatment with 1 mm acetaminophen (triangles), 100 μm p-aminophenol (squares), or vehicle (circles) for 30 min (n = 5). The experiments with p-aminophenol were performed in the presence of ascorbic acid to prevent its decomposition.

[2H8]Anandamide, [2H8]arachidonic acid, and NS-398 were from Cayman. Anandamide (Biomol) and arachidonic acid (Sigma) were all dissolved in and diluted with ethanol. Me2SO was substituted for ethanol as a solvent in studies with RAW264.7 macrophages. The batch of acetaminophen contained either no or <0.001% (w/w) of p-aminophenol, as determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.RESULTSDeuterium-labeled AM404 and p-aminophenol were detected in rat brain 20 min after an intraperitoneal injection of deuterium-labeled acetaminophen (Fig. 1). We could not, however, detect the corresponding non-deuterium-labeled compounds in these animals (data not shown). The formation of AM404 and p-aminophenol from acetaminophen was dose-dependent (Table I). After the injection of 300 mg/kg acetaminophen, AM404 could be detected in the spinal cord in two of five animals but was absent in liver and blood (Fig. 2A). p-Aminophenol was present in all tissues, of which the liver contained the highest level (Fig. 2A). AM404 and p-aminophenol could not be detected in vehicle-treated animals (n = 4).Fig. 1Acetaminophen is metabolized to the primary amine p-aminophenol, which is further conjugated with arachidonic acid to form the bioactive fatty acid amide N-arachidonoyl phenolamine (AM404).

https://openalex.org/W2023274935,"β-Secretase (BACE1) is the rate-limiting protease for the generation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in Alzheimer disease. Mice in which the bace1 gene is inactivated are reported to be healthy. However, the presence of a homologous gene encoding BACE2 raises the possibility of compensatory mechanisms. Therefore, we have generated bace1, bace2, and double knockout mice. We report here that BACE1 mice display a complex phenotype. A variable but significant number of BACE1 offspring died in the first weeks after birth. The surviving mice remained smaller than their littermate controls and presented a hyperactive behavior. Electrophysiologically, subtle alterations in the steady-state inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels in BACE1-deficient neurons were observed. In contrast, bace2 knockout mice displayed an overall healthy phenotype. However, a combined deficiency of BACE2 and BACE1 enhanced the bace1–/– lethality phenotype. At the biochemical level, we have confirmed that BACE1 deficiency results in an almost complete block of Aβ generation in neurons, but not in glia. As glia are 10 times more abundant in brain compared with neurons, our data indicate that BACE2 could indeed contribute to Aβ generation in the brains of Alzheimer disease and, in particular, Down syndrome patients. In conclusion, our data challenge the general idea of BACE1 as a safe drug target and call for some caution when claiming that no major side effects should be expected from blocking BACE1 activity. β-Secretase (BACE1) is the rate-limiting protease for the generation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in Alzheimer disease.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 1The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; Aβ, amyloid β-peptide; APP, amyloid precursor protein; SFV, Semliki Forest virus; APPwt, wild-type APP; APPsw, Swedish APP mutation; APPfl, Flemish APP mutation; MEM, minimal essential medium; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus. is the most common cause of dementia for which neither a good diagnostic test nor an effective treatment is available yet. The most widely accepted hypothesis states that AD is initially triggered by the abnormal accumulation and possibly deposition of the small amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) in different brain regions, which in turn initiates a pathogenic cascade that ultimately leads to neuronal death, AD pathology, and dementia. Aβ is cleaved from a long membrane-bound precursor, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), by two consecutive cleavages. β- and γ-secretases are the enzymes that liberate the N and C termini of Aβ, respectively, and are the subject of intense investigation because of their relevance as candidate therapeutic targets to treat AD. BACE1 and BACE2 are two highly homologous membrane-bound aspartyl proteases that can process APP at the β-secretase site (1Hussain I. Powell D. Howlett D.R. Tew D.G. Meek T.D. Chapman C. Gloger I.S.

Both BACE1 and BACE2 can cleave APP in vitro not only at Asp1 (numbering considering the first amino acid of Aβ as position 1), but also at internal sites within the Aβ region. BACE1 cleaves between amino acids 10 and 11 of Aβ, resulting in an N-terminally truncated peptide that is considered more amyloidogenic and more neurotoxic than full-length Aβ (14Pike C.J.

However, these in vitro observations cannot rule out a possible contribution of BACE2 to the Aβ pool in brain, and it has even been suggested that BACE2-mediated APP cleavage might play a role in the development of AD in individuals carrying the Flemish familial AD mutation in APP (8Farzan M. Schnitzler C.E. Vasilieva N. Leung D. Choe H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

From a therapeutic point of view, there are increasing concerns with using γ-secretase inhibitors to treat AD. γ-Secretase processes a growing number of membrane proteins, and blocking their cleavage is likely to have toxic side effects. Indeed, administration of a potent γ-secretase inhibitor to mice results in marked defects in lymphocyte development and in intestinal villi and mucosa (22Wong G.T. Manfra D. Poulet F.M. Zhang Q. Josien H. Bara T. Engstrom L. Pinzon-Ortiz M.C. Fine J.S. Lee H.J. Zhang L. Higgins G.A. Parker E.M. J. Biol.

In contrast, BACE1 appears to be a promising drug target because genetic ablation of the bace1 gene in mice does not seem to be associated with any gross abnormality (9Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D.

Moreover, BACE1 deficiency could prevent the learning and memory impairments and the cholinergic dysfunction observed in a transgenic mouse model for AD (24Ohno M. Sametsky E.A. Younkin L.H. Oakley H. Younkin S.G. Citron M. Vassar R. Disterhoft J.F. Neuron. 2004; 41: 27-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Although BACE1 function might still be required under particular conditions that may have escaped detection, these results highlight BACE1 as one of the best available drug targets for AD. At this point, however, it cannot be excluded that BACE1 has important functions in vivo and that the apparent lack of phenotype in bace1 knockout mice is due to the activation of compensatory mechanisms or to genetic redundancy. Because of their high homology, BACE2 is the best candidate protease to compensate for the absence of BACE1 function. Based on this homology, it is also likely that active-site inhibitors for BACE1 will affect, in addition, BACE2 protease activity. To better understand the biological functions of BACE1 and BACE2, to analyze possible overlapping functions of these two proteases, and to attempt to predict the consequences of blocking BACE function in vivo, we generated mice with inactivated bace1 and/or bace2 genes. Unexpectedly and in contrast to what has been published for bace1 knockout mice, we observed a phenotype associated with BACE1 deficiency, viz. a higher mortality rate early in life. bace2 knockout mice were fertile and viable, with no major phenotypic alteration. Most important, mice with inactivated bace1 and bace2 genes were fertile and viable, but presented neonatal mortality that was even higher than that of the monogenic bace1 line. These results suggest that BACE2 indeed partially compensates for the absence of BACE1 in bace1 knockout mice and that therapeutic inhibition of BACE function may result in adverse side effects. Antibodies—The C terminus-specific antibody for mouse BACE1 (B48) was raised in New Zealand White rabbits using synthetic peptide CLRHQHDDFADDISLLK. Rabbit antibodies B7/8 raised against Aβ (25De Strooper B. Simons M. Multhaup G. Van Leuven F. Beyreuther K. Dotti C.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4932-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and B63 raised against the C terminus of human APP (26Esselens C. Oorschot V. Baert V. Raemaekers T. Spittaels K. Serneels L. Zheng H. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Klumperman J. Annaert W. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) have been described. Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody was from Sigma. The N terminus-specific antibody for human Aβ (82E1) was from IBL Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Plasmid Construction—cDNAs to be expressed in non-neuronal cells were subcloned into a derivative of the eukaryotic expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) that contains a larger polylinker (pSG5**; polylinker EcoRI, SpeI, SacII, HindIII, NotI, XhoI, SmaI, SacI, BamHI, and BglII). BACE1 cDNA was amplified from mouse brain RNA using primers 5′-GGATTCATGGCCCCAGCGCTGCACTGGCT-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCTCACTTGAGCAGGGAGATGTCATC-3′ (with the SacI site underlined) and directly cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The SacI-SacII fragment was subsequently subcloned into the SacI-SacII sites of pSG5**. BACE2 cDNA was amplified from mouse pancreas cDNA using primers 5′-ATGGGCGCGCTGCTTCGAGCAC-3′ and 5′-TCATTTCCAGCGATGTCTGAC-3′ and cloned into the pGEM-T vector. The XmaIII fragment of pGEM-T-mBACE2 was subsequently subcloned into the SmaI site of pSG5**. For cloning of BACE2 cDNA containing a deletion of exon 6 (BACE2ΔE6), two subfragments of the cDNA were separately amplified using primers that contain the deletion. The 5′-fragment was amplified using T7 as the forward primer and 5′-AGAAAACTCTGGAATCTCTCTGCAGTCCAGGTTGAGGTTCTGG-3′ as the reverse primer. The 3′-fragment was amplified using primers 5′-CTGGACTGCAGAGAGATTCCAGAGTTTTCTGATGGCTTCTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCAATAAACAAGTTCTGCT-3′. The purified 5′- and 3′-subfragments were mixed together and PCR-amplified using the T7 and 5′-GCTGCAATAAACAAGTTCTGCT-3′ primers. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the same sites of pSG5**. Cloning of bace2 and bace2ΔE6 containing a C-terminal FLAG epitope was done by PCR amplification on pSG5**BACE2 and pSG5**-BACE2ΔE6, respectively, using primers 5′-CGGAATTCCACCATGGGCGCGCTGCTTCGAGCA-3′ (with the EcoRI site underlined) and 5′-CGGGATCCTCATTTATCGTCGTCATCCTTGTAGTCTTTCCAGCGATGTCTGACTAGT-3′ (with the BamHI site underlined and the FLAG epitope in italics). PCR products were digested with EcoRI-BamHI and cloned into the same sites of the pSG5** vector. All constructs were verified by sequencing. For expression in neuronal and glial cells, cDNAs were cloned into Semliki Forest virus (SFV) type 1. Cloning of SFV-APPwt, SFV-APPsw, and SFV-APPfl has been described previously (27Simons M. De Strooper B. Multhaup G. Tienari P.J. Dotti C.G. Beyreuther K. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 899-908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tienari P.J. De Strooper B. Ikonen E. Ida N. Simons M. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Beyreuther K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1996; 61: 575-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary Cultures and Cell Lines—Medium, serum, and supplements for maintenance of cells were obtained from Invitrogen. COS cells and adult mice fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (1:1) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Primary neuronal cultures were generated from trypsinized brains obtained from day 14 embryos and maintained in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 and 0.5 μm l-glutamine. Cytosine arabinoside (5 μm) was added 24 h after plating to prevent non-neuronal (glial) cell proliferation. For glial cell cultures, Neuro-basal medium was replaced with minimal essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 0.225% NaHCO3, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.6% glucose (MEM-HS). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. DNA Transfer and Metabolic Labeling—COS cells were plated in 6-cm2 plates 1 day before transfection. Approximately 70–80% confluent cells were transfected with a total of 2 μg of DNA (1 μg of APP and 1 μg of BACE plasmids) and 6 μl of FuGene 6 (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, cells were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h; the conditioned medium was collected; and cells were directly lysed in double immunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Neurons were maintained in Neurobasal medium, and ∼48 h after the addition of cytosine arabinoside, they were infected with recombinant SFV. Glial cells were maintained for ∼1 week in MEM-HS, passaged at least once, and infected with recombinant SFV ∼48 h after trypsinization. (This treatment ensured the absence of neurons in the culture.) For both neurons and glial cells, a 10-fold dilution of SFV encoding APPwt, APPsw, or APPfl was added to the cultures, and infection was allowed to proceed for 1 h. The conditioned medium containing the virus was then replaced with fresh medium, and cells were further incubated for 2 h. Cells were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 4 h; the conditioned medium was collected; and the cells were directly lysed in double immunoprecipitation assay buffer. Mouse fibroblasts were plated in 12-well plates 1 day before infection (∼300,000 cells/well). A 1:4 dilution of adenovirus encoding APPsw was added to the medium, and cells were further incubated for 48 h. Metabolic labeling was subsequently done as described above. Analysis of APP Processing—Full-length APP and C-terminal fragments were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using antibody B63. Aβ was immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium using antibody B7/8. Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the mixtures, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with rotation. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times with double immunoprecipitation assay buffer and once with 0.3× Tris-buffered saline and then solubilized with NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer. Samples were heated for 10 min at 70 °C and electrophoresed on 4–12% precast gels (Novex). Radiolabeled bands were detected using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of APP Processing Using Antibody 82E1—Neurons and glial cells were infected with recombinant SFV for 1 h as described above. The medium was subsequently replaced with Neurobasal medium (neurons) or MEM-HS (glial cells), and cells were further incubated for 6 h. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (Trasylol, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 mm EDTA) and 1% Triton X-100. Samples of cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibody B63. Aβ was immunoprecipitated from the conditioned medium using antibody B7/8 and detected by Western blotting using antibody 82E1. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Analysis—COS cells were transfected with 2 μg of either empty vector or vector encoding BACE1-FLAG, BACE2-FLAG, or BACE2ΔE6-FLAG using 6 μl of FuGene 6. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were scraped in buffer containing 5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100, and protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent. Proteins (∼400 μg) were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C with antibody B48 (BACE1-transfected cells) or anti-FLAG antibody (BACE2-transfected cells) and protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and twice with Tris-buffered saline. BACE activity was subsequently measured in an in vitro assay (Panvera P2985) by fluorescence resonance energy transfer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, an APP-based peptide substrate carrying the Swedish mutation and containing a fluorescence donor and a quencher acceptor at each end was used. The intact substrate is weakly fluorescent and becomes highly fluorescent upon enzymatic cleavage. BACE immunoprecipitates were directly resuspended in 20 μl of assay buffer provided with the kit, and after substrate addition, excitation and emission were measured using VICTOR2 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model 1420 multilabel counter). Pup Exchange—A total of eight BACE1 homozygous and eight wild-type couples were used for the experiment. Coupling was synchronized, and pups were exchanged during the first day of birth. The number of pups was followed until weaning. Electrophysiological Recordings—Acutely isolated pyramidal cell somata were prepared from the sensorimotor cortex of anesthetized and then decapitated wild-type and bace1–/– mice (23–30 days of age) using an established method of combined enzymatic/mechanic dissociation (29Alzheimer C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 479: 199-205Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly prepared neocortical slices were incubated for 30 min in warmed (29 °C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid and then maintained at room temperature. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid was constantly gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and contained 125 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm d-glucose (pH 7.4). Small pieces of sliced tissue (∼2 × 2 mm) were incubated for 45 min at 29 °C in HEPES-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm d-glucose (pH 7.4)) containing 19 units/ml papain. All recordings were made at room temperature (19–20 °C). Current signals from acutely isolated pyramidal cell somata recorded in whole cell voltage clamp mode were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz (–3 dB) using an Axopatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with a Digidata 1322A interface and pClamp 9 software (all from Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA). Access resistance in the whole cell configuration was 10–15 megaohms before series resistance compensation (75–80%). To improve voltage control, Na+ currents were investigated in a low Na+ bathing solution containing 15 mm NaCl, 115 mm choline chloride, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1.6 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm CdCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 10 mm d-glucose (pH 7.4). Patch pipettes were filled with 105 mm CsF, 20 mm triethanolamine chloride, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mm HEPES, 9mm EGTA, and 2 mm Na2ATP (pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Data were statistically analyzed (Student's t test, significance set at p < 0.05) using Origin Pro7 software. Substances were purchased from Sigma. Animals—A panel of 69 male mice (25 wild-type, 23 heterozygous, and 21 bace1 knockout littermate mice, aged 3–9 months) was used to assess anxiety-related behavior in the open field test and elevated zero maze and depression-related behavior in the tail suspension test and forced swim test. Animals were individually housed and kept under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle (lights on at 6:00 a.m.) in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with food and water ad libitum. All experiments were conducted during the light phase of the light/dark cycle with 1 week between experiments. Open Field Test—Locomotor activity was monitored using a Truscan© system (Coulbourn Instruments Inc., Allentown, PA). The animal was placed in the center of the activity field arena, which is a transparent plexiglas cage (260 (width) × 260 (depth) × 400 (height) mm) equipped with two photo beam sensor rings to register horizontal and vertical activities. Testing lasted 30 min. Elevated Zero Maze—Elevated zero maze testing was performed as described by Crawley (30Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse? Behavioral Phenotyping of Transgenic and Knockout Mice. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). The zero maze consists of an annular platform (diameter, 50 cm; and width, 5 cm). The animals were allowed to freely explore the maze for 5 min, and their behavior was recorded and analyzed using the Ethovision Pro video tracking system (Noldus Information Technology, Wageningen, The Netherlands). Tail Suspension Test—Mice were suspended by their tail on a hook in a test chamber using adhesive tape. Total duration of immobility was measured over a period of 6 min using the VideoTrack system (Viewpoint, Champagne au Mont d'Or, France). Mice that curled up toward their tail or that fell off during testing were excluded from analysis. Forced Swim Test—A mouse was placed in a cylinder (inner diameter, 10 cm) filled with water to a height of 10 cm at a temperature of 25 ± 1 °C. The mouse was exposed to swim stress for 6 min. Total duration of immobility was measured using the VideoTrack system. One animal was excluded from analysis because it had a very high fat mass and had difficulties staying afloat. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or by Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance on ranks in case data were not normally distributed, followed by post hoc Tukey's test (oneway analysis of variance) or Dunn's method (Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance on ranks) if appropriate. Lethal Phenotype in bace1 Knockout Mice—Several groups have reported the generation of bace1 knockout mice (9Cai H. Wang Y. McCarthy D. Wen H. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2043160859,"Mutations in the Src homology 2 (SH2)-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 (PTPN11) underlie half of the cases of the autosomal dominant genetic disorder Noonan syndrome, and somatic Shp2 mutations are found in several hematologic and solid malignancies. Earlier studies of small numbers of mutants suggested that disease-associated mutations cause constitutive (SH2 binding-independent) activation and that cancer-associated mutants are more active than those associated with Noonan syndrome. We have characterized a larger panel of Shp2 mutants and find that this activity-centric model cannot explain the behaviors of all pathogenic Shp2 mutations. Instead, enzymatic, structural, and mathematical modeling analyses show that these mutants can affect basal activation, SH2 domain-phosphopeptide affinity, and/or substrate specificity to varying degrees. Furthermore, there is no absolute correlation between the mutants' extents of basal activation and the diseases they induce. We propose that activated mutants of Shp2 modulate signaling from specific stimuli to a subset of effectors and provide a theoretical framework for understanding the complex relationship between Shp2 activation, intracellular signaling, and pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2033130157,"Sexual reproduction can lead to major conflicts between sexes and within genomes. Here we report an extreme case of such conflicts in the little fire ant Wasmannia auropunctata. We found that sterile workers are produced by normal sexual reproduction, whereas daughter queens are invariably clonally produced. Because males usually develop from unfertilized maternal eggs in ants and other haplodiploid species, they normally achieve direct fitness only through diploid female offspring. Hence, although the clonal production of queens increases the queen's relatedness to reproductive daughters, it potentially reduces male reproductive success to zero. In an apparent response to this conflict between sexes, genetic analyses reveal that males reproduce clonally, most likely by eliminating the maternal half of the genome in diploid eggs. As a result, all sons have nuclear genomes identical to those of their father. The obligate clonal production of males and queens from individuals of the same sex effectively results in a complete separation of the male and female gene pools. These findings show that the haplodiploid sex-determination system provides grounds for the evolution of extraordinary genetic systems and new types of sexual conflict."

Although previous studies have suggested direct interactions between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling pathways, the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. In particular, direct evidence for Ca2+-regulated cAMP production in living cells is incomplete. Genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors have made possible real-time imaging of spatial and temporal gradients of intracellular cAMP concentration in single living cells. Here, we used confocal microscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and insulin-secreting MIN6 cells expressing Epac1-camps, a biosynthetic unimolecular cAMP indicator, to better understand the role of intracellular Ca2+ in cAMP production. We report that depolarization with high external K+, tolbutamide, or glucose caused a rapid increase in cAMP that was dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by nitrendipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, or 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine, a P-site antagonist of transmembrane adenylate cyclases. Stimulation of MIN6 cells with glucose in the presence of tetraethylammonium chloride generated concomitant Ca2+ and cAMP oscillations that were abolished in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ and blocked by 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase. Simultaneous measurements of Ca2+ and cAMP concentrations with Fura-2 and Epac1-camps, respectively, revealed a close temporal and causal interrelationship between the increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and cAMP levels following membrane depolarization. These findings indicate highly coordinated interplay between Ca2+ and cAMP signaling in electrically excitable endocrine cells and suggest that Ca2+-dependent cAMP oscillations are derived from an increase in adenylate cyclase activity and periodic activation and inactivation of cAMP-hydrolyzing phosphodiesterase.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4577-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In Rana esculenta ventricular cells, simultaneous detection of cAMP with FlCRhR and whole cell L-type Ca2+ current by patch-clamp electrophysiology indicated that increases in cAMP production activate Ca2+ channel conductance (16Goaillard J.-M. Vincent P. Fischmeister R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 530: 79-91Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Spontaneous Ca2+ and cAMP increases have been observed in embryonic Xenopus neurons loaded with Fluo-4, a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, and FlCRhR (17Gorbunova Y.V. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 2002; 418: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The cells generate three to four pulses of cAMP/h, each lasting 3-7 min. cAMP accumulation appears to affect Ca2+ spiking; the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ transients (3-10/h) is increased by application of forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase (AC), and decreased by inhibition of protein kinase A with KT5720. Stimulation of neurons with pulses (12/min) of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) also increases Ca2+ spike frequency. On the other hand, elimination of the spontaneous Ca2+ transients inhibits cAMP production, whereas transient Ca2+ spikes evoked by pulses of 100 mm KCl generate cAMP transients in embryonic Xenopus neurons. Although these elegant studies suggested a role for AC and protein kinase A in mediating the cAMP-induced effects on Ca2+ signaling and confirmed that the formation of cAMP is Ca2+-dependent, the temporal interrelationships were not directly established in these experiments because the two signals were not measured simultaneously. We sought to better understand the temporal and causal interrelationships between Ca2+ and cAMP signals by real-time imaging. To accomplish this, we developed a new methodology that allows simultaneous measurements of Ca2+ and cAMP in single cells. We show in insulin-secreting MIN6 β-cells expressing Epac1-camps, a biosynthetic FRET-based cAMP sensor (18Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that cAMP and Ca2+ signals are tightly coupled. The data suggest that increased production of cAMP following stimulation with secretagogues is dependent on Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. We also observed rapid and transient Ca2+-induced cAMP oscillations. Our findings indicate that Ca2+ and cAMP signals interact as a coordinated network capable of producing diverse temporal signaling patterns in electrically excitable endocrine cells. Cell Culture—MIN6 cells (passages 18-30) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol and maintained in a humidified incubator with 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C.

Transfection efficiencies ranged between 5 and 20%. FRET Measurements and Ca2+ Imaging—Imaging experiments were conducted 48-96 h after transfection. The growth medium was removed and replaced with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution containing 119 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3 or 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.40), and 2 mm glucose. Coverslips were placed into a heated microperifusion chamber mounted on the specimen stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE-2000U) equipped with a CARV spinning disk confocal system (Atto Bioscience Inc.). Cells were constantly superfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (2-5 ml/min) at 37 °C. For imaging Epac1-camps FRET, cells were visualized with a Nikon Super Fluor ×40 oil immersion or Nikon Plan Apo ×60 oil immersion objective. The Epac1-camps excitation wavelength was 440 nm and was attenuated 50-90% using neutral density filters. Dual emission ratio imaging at 485 nm (FRET donor, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP)) and 535 nm (FRET acceptor, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP)) was accomplished using a computer-controlled high speed filter wheel (Lambda 10-2 optical filter changer, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA); the time for changing emission filters was 60-80 ms. Images (50-250-ms exposure) were captured with a 16-bit Cascade 650 digital camera (Roper Instruments) at 10-s intervals. Epac1-camps FRET decreases with increasing cAMP concentration; an increase in the 485/535 nm FRET emission ratio is indicative of an increase in cytoplasmic cAMP concentration ([cAMP]c) (18Nikolaev V.O.

For simultaneous measurements of intracellular Ca2+ and cAMP levels, we used Fura-2 to detect cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) (19Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Spectral separation of Epac1-camps and Fura-2 excitation and emission permits simultaneous imaging of [cAMP]c and [Ca2+]c in single cells. The combination of Fura-2 and the FRET-based Ca2+ biosensor D1ER, which consists of ECFP and citrine (a variant of EYFP), has been used by Tsien and co-workers (20Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) to simultaneously measure [Ca2+]c and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ concentration in HeLa and MCF-7 cells. For concurrent [cAMP]c and [Ca2+]c measurements, MIN6 cells transiently transfected with Epac1-camps were loaded with 500 nm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 15-20 min at 37 °C. A Nikon Super Fluor ×40 oil immersion objective was used for these studies. 340- and 380-nm excitation filters and a 530-nm emission filter were used for Fura-2 dual excitation ratio imaging. A 455-nm dichroic filter (Chroma Technology Corp.) was used for Epac1-camps and Fura-2. Loading cells with Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester did not affect maximum Epac1-camps responses following application of 10 μm forskolin and 100 μm IBMX, and conversely, Fura-2 detection of Ca2+ was not affected by Epac1-camps. Imaging data acquisition and analysis were accomplished using MetaMorph/MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp.) and OriginPro 7E (OriginLab Corp.). Emission intensities were background-subtracted. Data are expressed as the ratio of FRET donor and acceptor emission (485/535 nm ratio) and the Fura-2 340 and 380 nm excitation (340/380 nm ratio). In addition, data were normalized to the average base-line values of the 485/535 and 340/380 nm ratios (485/535 and 340/380 nm relative ratios, respectively) to facilitate comparisons between responses in different cells. Data summaries are expressed as means ± S.E. PCR and Nucleotide Sequence Analysis—Total RNA from MIN6 cells was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc.). The RNA quality and quantity were determined in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, Cambridge, UK). First-strand cDNA was generated with a reverse transcription system kit (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using oligo(dT) primers following the manufacturer's protocol. Specific cDNA sequences were amplified in GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using REDTaq ReadyMix PCR Reaction Mix (Sigma). Amplified PCR products were run on 1.2% agarose gel and further characterized by DNA sequencing and BLAST analysis against the GenBank™ Data Bank. cAMP Biosensor Expression and Function in MIN6 Cells—We transfected MIN6 cells with Epac1-camps, a biosynthetic FRET-based sensor that contains a single cAMP-binding domain of human Epac1 (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP 1) fused between ECFP and EYFP (18Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Fluorescence from individual cells was easily detected 24 h after transfection. The intensity of fluorescence emission from ECFP and EYFP was 2-8-fold higher than autofluorescence from untransfected cells. As in Chinese hamster ovary cells and mouse primary neurons and peritoneal macrophages (18Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L. Hannawacker A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37215-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar), Epac1-camps was distributed throughout the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus in MIN6 cells (Fig. 1A). The unimolecular biosynthetic cAMP indicators, including Epac1-camps, Epac2-camps, ICUE1, ICUE2, and cyan fluorescent protein-Epac-yellow fluorescent protein (18Nikolaev V.O. Bünemann M. Hein L.

A. 2004; 101: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), rely on cAMP-dependent FRET between chromophores of two mutants of green fluorescent protein as the basis for optical measurements of intracellular cAMP gradients. The green fluorescent protein mutants in Epac1-camps are ECFP and EYFP. Binding of cAMP to Epac induces a conformational change in Epac1-camps that increases the distance between ECFP and EYFP. As [cAMP]c rises, FRET between ECFP and EYFP declines, causing fluorescence emission from ECFP to increase and from EYFP to decrease. The ratio of ECFP (FRET donor) and EYFP (FRET acceptor) fluorescence emission is indicative of [cAMP]c. FRET between ECFP and EYFP in individual MIN6 cells was measured by spinning disk confocal microscopy. We observed heterogeneity of the FRET emission intensity ratio in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1A). This raises the possibility that the FRET ratio heterogeneity might reflect regional variation in [cAMP]c and suggests that MIN6 β-cell cAMP is regulated by different mechanisms in distinct subregions. More work will need to be done to explore these hypotheses. We tested the function of the sensor by measuring responses to reagents that stimulate cAMP production. Approximately 60 s (n = 20 cells) after application of 10 nm exendin-4, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that increases cAMP, Epac1-camps FRET decreased (Fig. 1B), and the FRET donor/acceptor emission ratio increased (Fig. 1C). The FRET ratio increased to maximum levels that were ∼20-30% greater than base-line values (Fig. 1D). A similar response was elicited by 10 μm forskolin, an activator of AC (Fig. 1E). Effect of Secretagogues on cAMP Formation—We used Epac1-camps to determine the effect of secretagogues on [cAMP]c. Depolarization with 20 mm KCl (Fig. 2A) or 100 μm tolbutamide (Fig. 2B) caused a monophasic increase in cAMP. Stimulation with 20 mm glucose also increased production of cAMP in MIN6 cells (Fig. 2C). We tested whether the secretagogue-induced cAMP formation was due to activation of AC by measuring the effect of 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine (DDA), a P-site inhibitor of membrane-bound AC isoforms. DDA inhibited cAMP formation stimulated by high K+, tolbutamide, and glucose by 62, 63, and 66%, respectively (Fig. 2D). Role of Calcium in cAMP Production in MIN6 Cells—Because it is well known that secretagogue stimulation increases [Ca2+]c, we next determined whether the cAMP responses are Ca2+-dependent. The increases in [cAMP]c evoked by KCl (Fig. 3A), tolbutamide (Fig. 3B), and glucose (Fig. 3C) were abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+ and by nitrendipine, a blocker of L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Curve integration analysis indicated that cAMP production by high K+, tolbutamide, and glucose was reduced by 114, 83, and 97%, respectively, when experiments were conducted in Ca2+-free solutions (Fig. 3E). Ca2+ channel blockade with nitrendipine inhibited secretagogue-induced cAMP accumulation to similar levels (Fig. 3E). The contribution of intracellular Ca2+ store discharge to cAMP production was also assessed. Application of carbachol, a muscarinic agonist that stimulates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation and release of Ca2+ sequestered within the endoplasmic reticulum, in either the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+ increased cAMP formation to levels ∼10-20% of those caused by high K+ or tolbutamide (Fig. 3, D and E). In some cells bathed in Ca2+-free solutions, carbachol evoked a transient decrease in cAMP (17 of 48 cells), suggesting that transient release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum activates phosphodiesterase (PDE) or inhibits AC. Reconstitution of extracellular Ca2+ following intracellular Ca2+ store depletion by carbachol stimulation in Ca2+-free solutions increased cAMP production (data not shown), suggesting a role of Ca2+ entry through store-operated Ca2+ channels in mediating cAMP signaling in MIN6 cells. Our data indicate that secretagogue-induced elevation of cAMP concentration is a Ca2+-dependent signaling event requiring the influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and suggest that mobilization of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores plays a limited role in cAMP production. Simultaneous Imaging of Cytoplasmic Calcium and cAMP—We determined the temporal interrelationships between cAMP and Ca2+ signaling by concurrent imaging of Epac1-camps FRET and Fura-2 dual wavelength ratiometric excitation microscopy. Fura-2 and Epac1-camps fluorescence was easily distinguished in MIN6 cells (Fig. 4A). In five independent experiments (n = 24 cells), stimulation with forskolin increased [cAMP]c and caused little or no change in [Ca2+]c (Fig. 4B). The magnitude and temporal pattern of the forskolin-induced cAMP response in cells loaded with the Ca2+ indicator were similar to those observed in cells expressing only Epac1-camps (Fig. 1E), indicating that the presence of Fura-2 did not affect cAMP biosensor function or interfere with Ca2+-dependent cAMP production. Application of 20 mm KCl increased both [Ca2+]c and [cAMP]c. The Ca2+ response preceded cAMP accumulation in every cell we imaged (n = 43) (Fig. 4C). The amount of time before the initial rises in [Ca2+]c and [cAMP]c was significantly different, occurring 47 ± 5 and 115 ± 9 s (p < 0.001), respectively, following addition of high K+. Both signals rose to a new steady-state concentration and returned to base-line levels after K+ was lowered. Similar monophasic responses were elicited by 100 μm tolbutamide (Fig. 4D), a sulfonylurea drug that increases [Ca2+]c by activating β-cell Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels consequent to closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and membrane depolarization. The rise in [cAMP]c induced by tolbutamide lagged significantly behind the increase in [Ca2+]c (59 ± 5 and 35 ± 5 s, respectively (n = 15 cells); p < 0.001). Glucose stimulation also increased [cAMP]c; the delay between the Ca2+ and cAMP elevation was not statistically significant (264 ± 12 and 262 ± 14 s for [cAMP]c and [Ca2+]c, respectively (n = 34 cells); p > 0.05) (Fig. 4E). Interplay between Intracellular Calcium and cAMP Oscillations—The data indicate a close temporal and causal interrelationship between increases in [Ca2+]c and cAMP accumulation. This raises the possibility that Ca2+ oscillations elicit cAMP oscillations. In β-cells, stable and voltage-dependent Ca2+ oscillations with periodicities ranging between 0.5 and 10/min can be generated by glucose and other secretagogues. The combination of glucose stimulation in the presence of tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA), an inhibitor of K+ channels, induces depolarization-dependent Ca2+ oscillations in rodent islets of Langerhans and insulin-secreting β-cell-like cell lines (23Roe M.W. Worley III, J.F. Mittal A.A. Kuznetsov A. DasGupta S. Mertz R.J. Witherspoon III, S.M. Blair N. Lancaster M.E. McIntyre M.S. Shehee W.R. Dukes I.D. Philipson L.H. J. Biol.

Application of 20 mm glucose and 20 mm TEA elicited rapid oscillations in [Ca2+]c and [cAMP]c (Fig. 5A). The mean ± S.E. frequency of the coupled Ca2+ and cAMP oscillations was 0.50 ± 0.02/min (30.2 ± 1.2/h, n = 32 cells). Ca2+ oscillations were characterized by transient increases that returned to near base-line levels during the interspike phase. However, cAMP oscillations did not return to base-line levels. The transient spikes in [Ca2+]c coincided with rapid decreases in [cAMP]c (Fig. 5B). During the quiescent period between Ca2+ oscillations, [cAMP]c gradually increased (Fig. 5B). To ascertain the role of extracellular Ca2+ in regulating [cAMP]c oscillations, we superfused the cells with Ca2+-free solutions (Fig. 5C) or applied nitrendipine (Fig. 5D), which caused rapid cessation of the Ca2+ oscillations and decreased [Ca2+]c. Under these conditions, cAMP oscillations were also ablated; however, unlike [Ca2+]c, [cAMP]c increased. These findings suggest Ca2+-dependent activation of cAMP-hydrolyzing PDE by periodic and transient spikes of Ca2+ entry. We tested this hypothesis by administering 100 μm IBMX during the oscillations (Fig. 5E). As observed with low Ca2+ solutions, IBMX abolished cAMP oscillations and increased [cAMP]c. DDA (50 μm) also inhibited cAMP oscillations, but did not increase [cAMP]c (Fig. 5F). Neither IBMX nor DDA inhibited Ca2+ oscillations. This indicates that the effects of these reagents on cAMP signaling did not stem from nonspecific effects on intracellular Ca2+. Expression of Adenylate Cyclase and Phosphodiesterase Isoforms in MIN6 Cells—To identify the AC and PDE isoforms involved in the regulation of Ca2+-dependent cAMP signals in MIN6 β-cells, we used reverse transcription-PCR. We detected transcripts for Ca2+-activated AC-I and AC-VIII isoforms as well as AC-IV-VII and AC-IX (see supplemental Fig. S1). A member of the Ca2+-activated PDE1 family, PDE1C, was also expressed in MIN6 cells along with several other PDE isoforms, including PDE3A, PDE3B, PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, PDE7B, and PDE10A (see supplemental Fig. S1). The plasticity and diversity of cellular signals elicited by extracellular stimuli are determined by information encoded in specific patterns of spatial and temporal changes in Ca2+ and cAMP concentrations. Although it has long been suspected that these two major second messengers are dynamically integrated (1Rasmussen H. Calcium and cAMP as Synarchic Messengers.

Biol. 1977; 66: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), most studies have employed biochemical methods that lack sufficient temporal resolution necessary to simultaneously monitor cross-talk between cAMP and Ca2+ signal transduction cascades in single intact living cells. In this study, we combined a genetically encoded FRET-based cAMP biosensor approach and intracellular Ca2+ imaging with Fura-2 to determine the temporal and causal interrelationships between the cAMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways. Our data demonstrate a contribution of monophasic and oscillating Ca2+ signals to cAMP information encoding in electrically excitable insulin-secreting MIN6 β-cells. Acute depolarization of MIN6 cells with high K+, tolbutamide, or glucose caused a monophasic increase in cAMP. This agrees with other studies demonstrating that high K+, applied either as a single-step increase or in pulsatile fashion, induces cAMP accumulation in PC12 cells and Xenopus neurons (17Gorbunova Y.V. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 2002; 418: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Agnihotri N. Kisaalita W.S. Keith C.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In MIN6 cells, the depolarization-induced accumulation of cAMP was significantly inhibited by DDA, suggesting that secretagogues stimulate membrane-bound AC activity. That Ca2+ plays a central role in stimulating AC was indicated by attenuation of cAMP formation following removal of extracellular Ca2+ or application of nitrendipine, an inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. This likely means that a Ca2+-independent mechanism mediated by depolarization alone, voltage-dependent influx of Na+, or K+ conductance does not contribute to an increase in MIN6 cell cAMP, as has been proposed in Paramecium, Lytechinus pictus sperm, and neonatal rat cerebellar cells (27Schultz J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2111527211,"MUC1, a glycoprotein overexpressed by a variety of human adenocarcinomas, is a type I transmembrane protein (MUC1/TM) that soon after its synthesis undergoes proteolytic cleavage in its extracellular domain. This cleavage generates two subunits, α and β, that specifically recognize each other and bind together in a strong noncovalent interaction. Proteolysis occurs within the SEA module, a 120-amino acid domain that is highly conserved in a number of heavily glycosylated mucin-like proteins. Post-translational cleavage of the SEA module occurs at a site similar to that in MUC1 in the glycoproteins IgHepta and MUC3. However, as in the case of other proteins containing the cleaved SEA module, the mechanism of MUC1 proteolysis has not been elucidated. Alternative splicing generates two transmembrane MUC1 isoforms, designated MUC1/Y and MUC1/X. We demonstrated here that MUC1/X, whose extracellular domain is comprised solely of the SEA module in addition to 30 MUC1 N-terminal amino acids, undergoes proteolytic cleavage at the same site as the MUC1/TM protein. In contrast, the MUC1/Y isoform, composed of an N-terminally truncated SEA module, is not cleaved. Cysteine or threonine mutations of the MUC1/X serine residue (Ser-63) immediately C-terminal to the cleavage site generated cleaved proteins, whereas mutation of the Ser-63 residue of MUC1/X to any other of 17 amino acids did not result in cleavage. In vitro incubation of highly purified precursor MUC1/X protein resulted in self-cleavage. Furthermore, addition of hydroxylamine, a strong nucleophile, markedly enhanced cleavage. Both these features are signature characteristics of self-cleaving proteins, and we concluded that MUC1 undergoes autoproteolysis mediated by an N → O-acyl rearrangement at the cleavage site followed by hydrolytic resolution of the unstable ester and concomitant cleavage. It is likely that all cleaved SEA module-containing proteins follow a similar route.

For MUC1, the incipient event probably involves ligand binding to the MUC1 extracellular domain, leading to allosteric changes on the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain resulting in phosphorylation. The reversible binding of the MUC1 α- and β-subunits may constitute this ligand-receptor interaction (30Wreschner D.H. McGuckin M.A. Williams S.J. Baruch A. Yoeli M. Ziv R. Okun L. Zaretsky J.

Understanding the proteolytic cleavage mechanism that generates the two interacting MUC1 subunits is an important prerequisite to understanding the role of MUC1 in tumor biology and signal transduction. To learn more about this mechanism, we sought a system that would be amenable to a detailed molecular analysis of the SEA module-mediated cleavage. In the present study we show that the MUC1 alternative splice form, MUC1/X (19Baruch A. Hartmann M. Zrihan-Licht S. Greenstein S. Burstein M. Keydar I. Weiss M. Smorodinsky N. Wreschner D.H. Int. J.

The BOS10B3 antibody is a mouse monoclonal antibody, previously generated by us (44Hartman M. Baruch A. Ron I. Aderet Y. Yoeli M. Sagi-Assif O. Greenstein S. Stadler Y. Weiss M. Harness E.

Cell Culture—Cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2, in culture media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 25 μg/ml streptomycin. DA3 mouse mammary tumor cells and human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Expression constructs were transfected into the cells using the calcium phosphate procedure. Cloning of MUC1/X and MUC1/Y in Maltose-binding Protein (MBP) Expression Vector—The MBP-MUC1/X and MBP-MUC1/Y fusion proteins (MBP-Xex-FLAG and MBP-Yex-FLAG) are depicted in Fig. 3, inset F, and described in the legend to the figure. For the construction of the MBP bacterial expression vectors, a cDNA fragment encoding the extracellular domain either of MUC1/X or of MUC1/Y was amplified using pCL-MUC1/X or pCL-MUC1/Y as template DNAs. Reverse and forward DNAs were used that introduced a FLAG epitope at the C terminus of the MBP fusion protein as well as appropriate restrictions sites for ligation to the bacterial MBP expression vector pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs). DNA sequencing confirmed the identities of all expression constructs. The pMAL-c2X-MUC1 vectors were electroporated into MC1061-competent bacteria. Purification of Recombinant Bacterial MBP Fusion Proteins—Recombinant bacteria, grown in LB medium and induced with IPTG, were lysed by sonication and the recombinant bacterial MBP-MUC1-FLAG fusion proteins (see Fig. 3, inset F) purified from the supernatant using amylose-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) as described by the manufacturer. Generation of Stable DA3 Mouse Mammary Tumor Cell Transfectants Expressing MUC1/X and MUC1/Y—DA3 cells were cotransfected with the eukaryotic expression plasmid pCL-MUC1/X (or pCL-MUC1/Y) and pSV2neo (coding for neomycin resistance). Stable transfectants were selected with neomycin. Transfectants expressing the MUC1 proteins were identified by immunoblot analysis of cell lysates using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against the MUC1 cytoplasmic domain. Generation of MUC1/X and MUC1/Y Eukaryotic Expression Constructs and Fusion Proteins—The MUC1 fusion proteins employed in this study, designated FLAG-Yex-hFc and FLAG-Xex-hFc, are depicted and described in Fig. 1. Standard molecular biology methods were used to generate all constructs. Cloning was conducted with the eukaryotic expression vector pCMV3 (Sigma) via selected restriction sites. This vector codes for the prepro-trypsin signal peptide followed by sequences coding for the FLAG (DYKDDDDK) epitope. DNA coding for the human Fc fragment (hFc) was inserted 3′ to the DNA coding for the FLAG epitope. This allowed cDNAs coding for MUC1 proteins to be inserted, in-frame, between DNA coding for the FLAG epitope (on the 5′ side) and DNA coding for hFc (on the 3′ side) of the pCMV3 vector. Briefly, reverse and forward primer oligonucleotides were used with pCL-MUC1/X or pCL-MUC1/Y as templates to PCR-amplify cDNAs coding for the extracellular domains of MUC1/X or MUC1/Y. This also introduced appropriate restrictions sites for ligation of the MUC1 cDNAs into pCMV3 DNA. cDNA fragments encoding the MUC1/X or MUC1/Y extracellular domains were subcloned in-frame into the pCMV3 (5′FLAG–hFc3′) vector. To facilitate generation of the mutant FLAG-Xex-hFc proteins containing deletions within the extracellular domain of MUC1/X, an EcoRI restriction site was introduced at nucleotides 210–216 within the MUC1 sequence (see Fig. 2) by changing the sequence “gaatgc” to the EcoRI site “gaattc.” To generate deletion mutants, appropriate forward and reverse primers containing the desired point mutation or deletion were used to PCR-amplify MUC1/X cDNA fragments that were then cloned into the pCMV3 (5′FLAG–hFc3′) vector. MUC1/X mutants harboring point mutations at the cleavage site were generated by PCR using reverse primers comprising the desired mutation at the cleavage site and extending to the KpnI site at nucleotides 1165–1170 together with an appropriate forward primer comprising the introduced EcoRI site at nucleotides 210–216. DNA sequencing confirmed the identities of all expression constructs. Generation of DA3 Mouse Mammary Tumor Cell and HEK293 Transfectants Expressing FLAG-MUC1/Xex-hFc and FLAG-MUC1/Yex-hFc Fusion Proteins and Purification of hFc-tagged Fusion Proteins—DA3 (mouse mammary tumor) or HEK293 (human kidney) cells were transiently transfected using calcium phosphate with the eukaryotic pCMV3 expression vectors (6 μg of DNA/25-cm2 flask) coding for the FLAG-Xex-hFc, FLAG-Yex-hFc, or mutant MUC1/X proteins. For obtaining stable transfectants, neomycin was added to the culture medium, and neomycin-resistant clones were isolated. Conditioned culture media containing the secreted MUC1 fusion proteins were collected 2–3 days following transfection and spun at 15,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and stored at -75 °C. The C-terminally hFc-tagged FLAG-Xex(Yex)-hFc proteins were purified by protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column purification. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE for protein separation was performed as described previously (20Levitin F. Baruch A. Weiss M. Stiegman K. Hartmann M.L. Yoeli-Lerner M. Ziv R. Zrihan-Licht S. Shina S. Gat A.

Transfer of Proteins to Nitrocellulose Membranes, Immunoblotting, and Other Protein Analyses—Proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were electrotransferred at 0.5 A for 2 h onto nitrocellulose filter paper in transfer buffer. Blots were blocked in 5% skimmed milk followed by incubation with primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-FLAG or BOS10B3). Bound primary antibody was detected with a secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The hFc-tagged proteins were directly analyzed with HRP-conjugated goat anti-hFc antibodies followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. For glycosidase treatment, protein A-purified proteins were incubated with 1 unit of PNGase F (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hydroxylamine Treatment of Mutant FLAG-Xex-hFc Proteins—Protein A-purified mutant FLAG-Xex-hFc proteins were incubated at 37 °C in cleavage buffer with hydroxylamine (150 mm), and following various incubation times samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. ELISA for Determining MUC1 Cleavage (see Fig. 6)—ELISAImmuno-Assay plates (Costar) were coated with polyclonal goat anti-human Fc antibodies (G-α-hFc, 4 μg/ml) followed by washing with PBS/Tween 20 (0.05%) and blocking with PBS/Tween + 5% skimmed milk (Blotto). Spent culture media containing FLAG-Xex(or Yex)-hFc proteins (mutant and wild type, see Figs. 1, 5, 6, 8, and 9 for descriptions of these proteins) was then applied to the wells to allow for binding of the FLAG-Xex(Yex)-hFc proteins. Following incubation, samples were removed, and the wells washed with PBS/Tween. Wells were then incubated either for 30 min with PBS alone or with PBS + 0.1% SDS followed by PBS/Tween washing. As described under “Results,” SDS treatment does not interfere with the binding of the well coated G-α-hFc to the hFc portion of the MUC1 fusion proteins, but it does result in the dissociation of the MUC1 α- and β-subunit (27Ligtenberg M.J.

Protein remaining bound to the well was then assessed either with HRP-G-α-hFc or with mouse monoclonal antibody BOS10B3 followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody.FIGURE 5Cleavage of FLAG-Xex-hFc fusion protein in eukaryotic cells and absence of FLAG-Yex-hFc cleavage.

The MUC1 fusion proteins were purified from conditioned media (culture medium) using protein A-agarose beads. The blots were probed first with HRP-conjugated anti-human Fc. Following ECL development (A, left panel), the blot (without stripping) was sequentially probed with anti-FLAG antibodies (A, right panel). Anti-hFc as well as anti-FLAG probings (lanes 2 and 2′) detect FLAG-Yex-hFc protein at identical locations (about 50–55 kDa, indicated by filled circle-ended arrow). In contrast, anti-hFc probing of FLAG-Xex-hFc shows a doublet (bracketed, indicated by ↔) migrating with a relative mass of about 37 kDa (lanes 1) representing the βex-hFc cleaved proteins.

Kobayashi K. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 47: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the argininosuccinate synthetase deficiency in adult-onset type II citrullinemia was because of the lack of aspartate, one of the two substrates of argininosuccinate synthetase, which is produced in mitochondria and transported to cytosol via citrin (4Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrústegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). During embryogenesis, aralar and citrin have a widely overlapping expression pattern, and the full expression of aralar is only attained postnatally (8Begum L. Jalil M.A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M.

Aralar, expressed in almost every tissue except the adult liver (1del Arco A. Satrústegui J. J. Biol.

J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3312-3320Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is the only AGC isoform present in the adult central nervous system. Aralar expression in the central nervous system is restricted to neurons (9Ramos M. del Arco A. Pardo B. Martínez-Serrano A. Martinez-Morales J.R. Kobayashi K. Yasuda T. Bogónez E. Bovolenta P. Saheki T. Satrústegui J. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 143: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has no expression in white matter and low levels in cultured glial cells (10del Arco A.

Neuronal maturation is associated with an increase in aralar expression and a prominent rise in MAS function (9Ramos M. del Arco A. Pardo B. Martínez-Serrano A. Martinez-Morales J.R. Kobayashi K. Yasuda T. Bogónez E. Bovolenta P. Saheki T. Satrústegui J. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 143: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Here, we describe a new function of aralar discovered after the generation of aralar-deficient (Aralar-/-) mice. In addition to a total lack of muscle and brain MAS activity, and a drastic fall in respiration on glutamate plus malate, Aralar-/- mice had severe growth defects, a restricted lifespan, and developed motor coordination deficits along with an impaired myelination. Dysmyelination in Aralar-/- mice is associated with a deficient synthesis of myelin lipids and a striking reduction in the levels of aspartate and N-acetylaspartate (NAA), a metabolite produced in neuronal mitochondria and microsomes (11Patel T.B. Clark J.B. Biochem. J. 1979; 184: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12Madhavarao C.N. Chinopoulos C. Chandrasekaran K. Namboodiri M.A. J.

Our results reveal that the neuronal AGC is required for the synthesis of aspartate and NAA in the adult mammalian brain, suggesting that aralar deficiency in humans could have impact in the brain levels of these metabolites and their derivatives. Generation of Aralar-/- Mice—Gene trapping was performed at Lexicon Genetics (The Woodlands, TX) in SVJ129 ES cells using the insertion vector that was based on the gene trap technology of Lexicon (17Zambrowicz B.P. Friedrich G.A. Buxton E.C. Lilleberg S.L. Person C. Sands A.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Slc25a12+/- ES cells were injected into C57BL blastocysts, and chimeric mice were bred to C57BL (albino) wild-type mice. Subsequent breeding was with SVJ129/C57BL albino hybrids to maintain background. The resulting Slc25a12+/- (Aralar+/-) offspring were interbred to produce slc25a12-/- (Aralar-/-) mice. Mice were kept in climate-controlled quarters at 23 °C with free access to water and food, and a 12-h/day light cycle. The experimental protocols fulfilled the requirements of the Committee for Animal Experimentation, Kagoshima University, and European guidelines. Determination of Insertion Site of the Trap Vector—One targeted allele of the slc25a12 gene (OmniBank OST clone 123999) was obtained from a library of randomly targeted embryonic stem cell lines at Lexicon Genetics. Because the insertion was in intron 13, which is larger than 20 kb, we searched for mouse genomic clones containing sequences downstream of exon 13 or upstream of exon 14 of slc25a12, and found the AZ431829 clone with the 5′-sequence of exon 14 (Fig. 1A). PCR of genomic DNA from the Slc25a12+/- mice as template with a forward primer derived from BTK in the gene trap vector and a reverse primer derived from 5′-end sequence of exon 14 of slc25a12 yielded a 3.5-kb band. Comparison of the sequences of the 3.5-kb fragment and AZ431829 revealed the precise insertion site of the trap vector. Genotyping—After determining the insertion site of the trap vector (see Fig. 1A), the slc25a12 genotype was determined by PCR using genomic DNA from mice ear with the following primers: sense primer-a (mAra 3′LTR-F3: 5′-GTTCTCTAGAAACTGCTGAGG-3′) for mutated alleles, sense primer-b (mAra int-13F1: 5′-GATGTGAGAACTCACCAGTGT-3′) for wild-type alleles, and antisense primer-c (mAra int-13B: 5′-ACCACCACCAGCGTGTCAGC-3′) for both mutant and wild-type alleles. Mutant (406 bp) fragments and wild-type (271 bp) were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel (Fig. 1B). Both PCR products were verified by sequencing. Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from mouse tissues by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (18Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62898) Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described by Begum et al. (8Begum L. Jalil M.A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Li M.X. Yasuda T. Horiuchi M. del Arco A. Satrústegui J. Saheki T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1574: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, tissues were homogenized with 9 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.2% cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol and proteinase inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 12 μg/ml chymostatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). In the presence of SDS, the same volume (3.3 μl) of homogenate was subjected to electrophoresis on two gels (10% polyacrylamide). One gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and the other was used for protein transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Cross-reactive immune materials for aralar, citrin, myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MOBP), neurofilament middle chain (NF-M), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were detected by using anti-human N-half aralar lgG (1del Arco A. Satrústegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), anti-human N-half citrin IgG (6Yasuda T. Yamaguchi N. Kobayashi K. Nishi I. Horinouchi H. Jalil M.A. Li M.X. Ushikai M. Iijima M. Kondo I. Saheki T. Hum. Genet. 2000; 107: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and commercial antibody for MBP (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA), MOBP (Chemicon International Inc.), NF-M (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and GFAP (Chemicon International Inc.), respectively, as a first antibody, with anti-rabbit IgG goat Fab′-peroxidase conjugate or donkey anti-sheep/goat immunoglobins (peroxidase conjugate) as a second antibody. Density of the bands was quantified with ScionImage for Windows β4.0.2, based on NIH Image for Macintosh by Wayne Rasband of the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, modified for use with Windows. Preparation of Mitochondria—Skeletal muscle and brain mitochondria from 15-17-day-old mice were obtained as described by Rolfe et al. (19Rolfe D.F. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and Ramos et al. (9Ramos M. del Arco A. Pardo B. Martínez-Serrano A. Martinez-Morales J.R. Kobayashi K. Yasuda T. Bogónez E. Bovolenta P. Saheki T. Satrústegui J. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 143: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), respectively. Mitochondrial fractions (10-20 mg of protein/ml), containing synaptosomes and free mitochondria (20Martínez-Serrano A. Satrústegui J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), were suspended in mannitol/sucrose/potassium medium containing 75 mm mannitol, 25 mm sucrose, 5 mm phosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. Oxygen Uptake Measurements—Respiration rates were determined with a Clark-type oxygen electrode in 0.5 ml of mannitol/sucrose/potassium medium with 1 mm EGTA, skeletal muscle mitochondria (0.1-0.2 mg of protein), and substrates for site I (5 mm pyruvate + 5 mm malate, or 5 mm glutamate + 5 mm malate) or site II (5 mm succinate in the presence of 2 μm rotenone). State 3 respiration was obtained after the addition of 0.5 mm ADP. The respiratory control ratio was the quotient between state 3 and state 4 respiration rates. Respiration with brain mitochondrial fractions (0.15-0.25 mg) was determined in the same way except that 100 μm digitonin was present in the assay to permeabilize synaptosomes. MAS Activities and Aspartate Formation in the Mitochondria—MAS activity was assayed based on the method of Cheeseman and Clark (21Cheeseman A.J. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial fractions (around 20 μg of protein for skeletal muscle, 0.1-0.15 mg of protein for brain) were suspended in 3 ml of mannitol/sucrose/potassium medium, and MAS was reconstituted in the presence of 4 units/ml aspartate aminotransferase, 6 units/ml malate dehydrogenase, 66 μm NADH, 5 mm aspartate, 5 mm malate, 0.5 mm ADP, 200 nm ruthenium red, and 16 μm CaCl2. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 mm glutamate and was determined from the decay in NADH fluorescence (excitation at 340 nm, emission at 465 nm). Aspartate formation in mitochondria was assayed essentially as described by Sinasac et al. (22Sinasac D.S. Moriyama M. Jalil M.A. Begum L. Li M.X. Iijima M. Horiuchi M. Robinson B.H. Kobayashi K. Saheki T. Tsui L.-C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Behavioral Analyses—Behavioral tests were carried out in mice between 10 and 20 days. Neuromuscular strength was evaluated with an inverted wire hanging test (23Takeda Y. Akasaka K. Lee S. Kobayashi S. Kawano H. Murayama S. Takahashi N. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Asano M. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Watanabe K. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 252-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mice were placed on the floor of wire net with 1.6 mm of wire diameter and 15 mm of gap between wires (WH-3002 Chamber, O'Hara & Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), so that mice could grip the wires with all four paws, and then the wire net was turned upside down. Time to fall was recorded. Each mouse underwent 6 trials. Balance coordination and neuromuscular strength were further evaluated with the bar test (24Sereda M. Griffiths I. Puhlhofer A. Stewart H. Rossner M.J. Zimmerman F. Magyar J.P. Schneider A. Hund E. Meinck H.M. Suter U. Nave K.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1049-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Mice were placed on a round metal bar with a diameter of 1.5 cm and 23 cm long that was positioned 25 cm high above the floor, and the time that the mice remained on the bar was monitored. Data were average times of 6 trials per mouse. Histology and Immunocytochemistry—Mice at 18-20 days were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 50 ml of heparinized physiological saline followed by 200 ml of fixative solution containing 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% picric acid at room temperature. The brains were removed and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 3 days at 4 °C. The brain was cryoprotected in 20% phosphate-buffered sucrose solution. Serial 40-μm thick coronal sections were cut with a freezing microtome and immersed in phosphate-buffered saline. Myelin in one series of sections was stained according to the method of Heidenhain-Woelcke (25Heidenhain M. Zeitschrift für wissenschaftliche Mickroskopie und fur mikroskopische Technik. 1896; 13: 186Google Scholar), and cell somata in another series were stained with 1% cresyl fast violet solution. The immunocytochemical detection of MBP was performed with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase detection system in other serial sections. To ensure penetration of antibodies, the sections were preincubated in a solution of 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline after blocking of endogenous peroxidase. Free-floating sections were then incubated for 3 days at 4 °C with rabbit antibody to MBP diluted 1:1,200 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% Triton X-100. The sections were incubated in a 1:2,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG (E.-Y. Laboratories, San Mateo, CA) for 1 day at 4 °C and in a 1:2,000 dilution of peroxidase-antiperoxidase solution (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for 1 day at 4 °C. The primary, secondary, and third antibodies were diluted to appropriate concentrations in 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum. Between incubation steps, sections were thoroughly washed with phosphate-buffered saline. For visualization of peroxidase, the sections were treated for 9 min at room temperature with 0.02% diaminobenzidine in 0.003% hydrogen peroxidase. Finally, the sections were mounted onto gelatin-chrome alum-coated glass slides, air dried, dehydrated with ethanol, cleared in xylene, and covered-slipped. Number of animals histologically examined was 6 for each genotype. Immunocytochemical controls for specificity in which antigen-absorbed antibody was used showed no immunostaining. Neuronal Cell Culture—Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from 16-day-old mouse embryos as described previously (9Ramos M. del Arco A. Pardo B. Martínez-Serrano A. Martinez-Morales J.R. Kobayashi K. Yasuda T. Bogónez E. Bovolenta P. Saheki T. Satrústegui J. Dev. Brain Res. 2003; 143: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and grown in a serum-free defined medium, as described by Ruiz et al. (26Ruiz F. Alvarez G. Pereira R. Hernandez M. Villalba M. Cruz F. Cerdan S. Bogonez E. Satrústegui J. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1277-1282PubMed Google Scholar). In these culture conditions, neurons represented more than 90% of the cell population. Determination of Metabolites in Brain and Cultured Neurons—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the brain was immediately removed from the skull on dry ice and homogenized with 4 volumes of 3% sulfosalicylic acid or 5% perchloric acid. The sulfosalicylic acid supernatant was used for amino acid analysis with a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). NAA and N-acetylaspartylglutamate were extracted from brain by homogenization with methanol and purification with a Bio-Rad AG-50Wx8 column, as described by Bjartmar et al. (27Bjartmar C. Battistuta J. Terada N. Dupree E. Trapp B.D. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 51: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The eluate was analyzed by HPLC with UV detection at 206 nm using a SAX anion exchange column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Waters) at room temperature (28Demougeot C. Garnier P. Mossiat C. Bertrand N. Giroud M. Beley A. Marie C. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 408-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Cultured neurons were mechanically detached and extracted with 3% perchloric acid. The extracts were dissolved in 0.1 m potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 0.025 m potassium chloride, pH 4.5, filtered (0.45 μm), and applied to HPLC for NAA analysis. Total lipid fractions were isolated and dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) as 1 ml/100 mg wet weight of brain and 2 ml/100 mg wet weight of sciatic nerve. 20 μl/lane (brain) and 10 μl/lane (sciatic nerve) were applied to high-performance thin-layer chromatography 60 plates and chromatographed in chloroform/methanol/water (70:30:3). Bands were visualized by copper acetate spray and heating (29Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the quantification of lipid components, cholesterol in lipid was assayed enzymatically (Cholesterol E-Test Wako, Osaka, Japan), and galactose was determined with orcinol after hydrolysis (30Bird T.D. Farrell D.F. Sumi S.M. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 31Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1956; 1: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The galactocerebroside content was calculated by multiplying the galactose value by 4. Phospholipids were determined as phosphorus after hydrolysis by the method of Baumann et al. (32Baumann N.A. Jacque C.M. Pollet S.A. Harpin M.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 4: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For computation of total phospholipid, an average molecular weight of 718 was used. The phospholipid content was calculated by multiplying the phosphorus value by 22.4. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Differences among multiple groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey-Kramer or Bonferroni tests. Differences between the two groups were tested by the unpaired Student's t test. JMP software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used for the statistical analysis. Generation of Aralar-/- Mice—The original Aralar+/- founder mice were created by using a gene-trapping method (17Zambrowicz B.P. Friedrich G.A. Buxton E.C. Lilleberg S.L. Person C. Sands A.T. Nature. 1998; 392: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Wild-type (Aralar+/+) and Aralar-/- mice were derived by breeding the Aralar+/- founder mice, which are in a hybrid genetic background (50% C57BL/6 albino and 50% 129SvEvBrd strains). Of the total 92 mouse embryos (at E15-E17) derived from inter-crosses of heterozygote mice, the proportions of Aralar+/+, Aralar+/-, and Aralar-/- genotypes were 26, 49, and 25%, respectively, indicating that the lack of aralar does not affect fetal development up to embryonic day 17. On the other hand, at 10 to 15 days of age out of 94 Aralar-/- mice expected, only 54 were found (p < 0.001). Many Aralar-/- mice died between E18 and 15 days postnatal at the time when the pattern of aralar-specific expression is established (8Begum L. Jalil M.A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Li M.X. Yasuda T.

Aralar mRNA and Protein Levels in Aralar-/- Mice—The two major aralar transcripts of 2.8 and 3.3 kb (1del Arco A. Satrústegui J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23327-23334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 8Begum L. Jalil M.A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Li M.X. Yasuda T. Horiuchi M. del Arco A. Satrústegui J.

Brain Res. 2003; 143: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and a third minor band of about 6.6 kb were detected in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of Aralar+/+ and Aralar+/- mice, and not in Aralar-/- mice (Fig. 1C). A faint 2.6-kb band found in Aralar+/- and Aralar-/- tissues was identified as fusion mRNA composed of the 5′-portion of aralar and the gene for neomycin resistance. Citrin mRNA levels were not different among the three genotypes. Western blot analysis revealed a total loss of aralar protein in the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle of Aralar-/- mice and about half of the wild-type levels in Aralar+/- mice (Fig. 1D), confirming the functional disruption of the slc25a12 gene in the null mice. The same amount of citrin peptide was detected in the heart of all genotypes. Respiration, MAS Activity, and Aspartate Formation in Skeletal Muscle and Brain Mitochondria—Skeletal muscle and brain mitochondria from Aralar-/- mice did not show any difference in the respiratory rate or respiratory control ratio with succinate as substrate (Fig. 1E) indicating that aralar deficiency did not have any effect on overall mitochondrial function. Respiration rate with glutamate plus malate, studied in skeletal muscle, revealed a dramatic decrease in Aralar+/- and Aralar-/- mice, specially in state 3, to about 50 and 12% of that in Aralar+/+ mice, respectively (Fig. 1E, i), but, no significant difference was found when using pyruvate plus malate. MAS activity in skeletal muscle and brain mitochondria was halved in Aralar+/- mice and was extremely low in Aralar-/- mice (Fig. 1F). Aspartate formation from glutamate and malate by isolated brain mitochondria was reduced accordingly: 100 ± 4.2, 69.2 ± 5.1, and 16.0 ± 2.0 nmol per min/mg of protein in Aralar+/+, Aralar+/-, and Aralar-/- mice, respectively. General Phenotype of Aralar-/- Mice—As shown in Fig. 2A, Aralar-/- mice were smaller than Aralar+/+ and Aralar+/- mice from 6 days of age and growth-retarded thereafter. Their life expectancy was greatly reduced: almost none survived beyond 22 days, and they had a 59% weight reduction at death (Fig. 2A). At 10 days, all the tissue weights of Aralar-/- mice were significantly lower than those of Aralar+/+ and Aralar+/- mice, which were the same (Fig. 2B). Behavioral Analysis—In the wire hanging test that evaluates neuromuscular strength (23Takeda Y. Akasaka K. Lee S. Kobayashi S. Kawano H. Murayama S. Takahashi N. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Asano M. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Watanabe K. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 56: 252-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Aralar+/+ mice gradually increased the time to fall between 10 and 16 days, with a clear overshoot in performance from then onwards. Aralar-/- mice behaved as Aralar+/+ mice until 14 days, but showed a much smaller increase in performance thereafter (Fig. 2C). In the bar test that examines balance coordination and neuromuscular strength (24Sereda M. Griffiths I. Puhlhofer A. Stewart H. Rossner M.J. Zimmerman F. Magyar J.P. Schneider A. Hund E. Meinck H.M. Suter U. Nave K.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1049-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), Aralar+/+ mice increased the time on the bar in a linear way from 13 days onwards, a time at which motor coordination is established (23Takeda Y. Akasaka K. Lee S. Kobayashi S. Kawano H. Murayama S. Takahashi N. Hashimoto K. Kano M. Asano M. Sudo K. Iwakura Y. Watanabe K. J.

https://openalex.org/W1981388992,"The exceptional wakefulness of newborn whales and dolphins has no ill-effect on their development. All mammals previously studied take maximal rest or sleep after birth, with the amount gradually decreasing as they grow to adulthood1,2, and adult fruitflies and rats die if they are forcibly deprived of sleep3,4. It has therefore been assumed that sleep is necessary for development and serves a vital function in adults. But we show here that, unlike terrestrial mammals, killer-whale and bottlenose-dolphin neonates and their mothers show little or no typical sleep behaviour for the first postpartum month, avoiding obstacles and remaining mobile for 24 hours a day. We find that neonates and their mothers gradually increase the amount of time they spend resting to normal adult levels over a period of several months, but never exceed these levels. Our findings indicate either that sleep behaviour may not have the developmental and life-sustaining functions attributed to it, or that alternative mechanisms may have evolved in cetaceans."

Scavenger receptors (SRs) are among the receptors mediating the uptake of fibrillar Aβ in vitro. However, little is known about the function of the astrocytes surrounding the plaques or the nature of their interaction with Aβ. It is unknown whether glial cells bind to nonfibrillar Aβ and if binding of astrocytes to Aβ depends on the same Scavenger receptors described for microglia. We determined the binding of glia to Aβ by an adhesion assay and evaluated the presence of scavenger receptors in glial cells by immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry of brain sections, and immunoblot. We found that astrocytes and microglia from neonatal rats adhered in a concentration-dependent manner to surfaces coated with fibrillar Aβ or nonfibrillar Aβ. Fucoidan and poly(I), known ligands for SR-type A, inhibited adhesion of microglia and astrocytes to Aβ and also inhibited Aβ phagocytosis. In contrast, a ligand for SR-type B like low density lipoprotein, did not compete glial adhesion to Aβ. Microglia presented immunodetectable SR-BI, SR-AI/AII, RAGE, and SR-MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure, a member of the SR-A family). Astrocytes presented SR-BI and SR-MARCO. To our knowledge, this is the first description of the presence of SR-MARCO in astrocytes. Our results indicate that both microglia and astrocytes adhere to fibrillar and nonfibrillar Aβ. Adhesion was mediated by a fucoidan-sensitive receptor. We propose that SR-MARCO could be the Scavenger receptor responsible for the adhesion of astrocytes and microglia to Aβ.

Scavenger receptors (SRs) participate in the binding and uptake of many structurally unrelated substances, including fAβ, thrombospondin-1, anionic polysaccharides, polynucleotides, chemically modified proteins (e.g. oxidized LDL, acetyl-LDL, glycated collagen, and maleylated albumin), apoptotic cells, and bacteria (2Husemann J.

Scavenger receptors have been implicated in microglial binding to Aβ. However, their participation has not been adequately characterized in astrocytes. Astrocytes serve important metabolic and supportive functions in the central nervous system. Under physiological conditions, they maintain the functional integrity of synapses and produce some of the glycoproteins of the extracellular matrix (9McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 21: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). They regulate glutamate and water balance and have a role in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier tight junctions. Astrocytes express several chemokines, cytokines, and their receptors and have phagocytic and proteolytic activity (10Johnstone M. Gearing A.J. Miller K.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 93: 182-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 11Tezel G. Hernandez M.R. Wax M.B.

Whether normal adult astrocytes can perform phagocytosis remains an unresolved issue. However, there is some evidence that under certain conditions astrocytes are capable of phagocytosis (13Vinores S.A. Herman M.M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 43: 169-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 14Bechmann I. Nitsch R. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In contrast to microglia, only SR-BI seems to be expressed by astrocytes from adult mouse and human brains (15Husemann J. Silverstein S.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 158: 825-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although there are reports suggesting that astrocytes also express the mannose receptor (16Burudi E.M. Riese S. Stahl P.D. Regnier-Vigouroux A. Glia. 1999; 25: 44-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Under pathological conditions, like injury of the nervous system, the activation of astrocytes has been associated with changes in the expression of cytoplasmatic proteins, surface proteins, and soluble factors, such as chemokines (10Johnstone M.

A. 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). In AD brains, microglia are activated at the site of deposition of Aβ (27Sasaki A. Yamaguchi H. Ogawa A. Sugihara S. Nakasato Y. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl.). 1997; 94: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and astrocytes are most closely associated with plaques with a dense amyloid core and activated microglia (28Pike C.J.

Activated astrocytes surrounding amyloid plaques or exposed to fAβ in vitro increase the expression of inducible nitricoxide synthase (30Wallace M.N. Geddes J.G. Farquhar D.A. Masson M.R. Exp.

It is unknown which receptor mediates the activation of astrocytes by Aβ. SR-MARCO is a newly described SR. It was initially characterized as a bacteria binding receptor. However, it also binds modified LDL; therefore, it is considered a member of the SR-A family (32Elomaa O. Kangas M. Sahlberg C. Tuukkanen J. Sormunen R. Liakka A. Thesleff I. Kraal G. Tryggvason K. Cell. 1995; 80: 603-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 33Gough P.J. Gordon S. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). There is little information regarding the expression of SR-MARCO in the central nervous system, although its presence in microglial cells was recently described (34Re F. Belyanskaya L. Riese R.J. Cipriani B. Fischer F.R. Granucci F. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Brosnam C. Stern L.J. Strominger J.L. Santambrogio L. J.

Blood. 2003; 102: 2940-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that astrocytes from adult mice bind Aβ by receptors sharing characteristics with SRs. However, the results suggested that SR-BI did not bind fAβ (36Wyss-Coray T. Loike J.D. Brionne T.C. Lu E. Anankov R. Yan F. Silverstein S.C. Husemann J. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of microglial cells and astrocytes to fibrillar versus nonfibrillar Aβ has been poorly examined. Here we report that astrocytes from neonatal rats adhered to surfaces coated with fAβ and nonfibrillar Aβ (nfAβ). Binding to Aβ was almost completely inhibited by fucoidan and poly(I). Furthermore, we found that SR-MARCO was present both in astrocytes and microglia, and its expression by astrocytes was confirmed on sections of adult rat brain. We propose that SR-MARCO could be responsible for the interaction of astrocytes and microglia with Aβ. Chemicals and Reagents—Fucoidan, poly(C), poly(I), poly-l-lysine, bovine serum albumin (BSA), lidocaine, and trypsin EDTA were purchased from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and penicillin/streptomycin were obtained from Invitrogen. Tissue culture dishes and plastic ware were obtained from Falcon (Franklin Lakes, NJ) and Nalgene Nunc (Rochester, NY). The cytotoxicity detection kit (LDH) was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma or Merck. The Aβ-(1-42) was a generous gift from Dr. Heinz Döbeli (Hoffmann-La Roche, Switzerland). Glial Primary Cultures—Astrocytes and microglial cultures were prepared from brains of 1-2-day-old neonatal rats (37Hayes G.M. Woodroofe M.N. Cuzner M.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 1988; 19: 177-189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Newborns were anesthetized with ether and decapitated. Cortices were minced and incubated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in Hanks' solution (0.4 g/liter KCl, 0.06 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.048 g/liter Na2HPO4, 8 g/liter NaCl, 1 g/liter d-glucose, and 3.5 g/liter NaHCO3) for 15 min and mechanically dissociated. Cells were seeded in 75-cm2 culture flasks coated with poly-l-lysine (one brain per flask) in complete medium (DMEM/F-12, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and incubated at 37 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere with 5% CO2. After 14-28 days of culture, the flasks were treated with 12 mm lidocaine and shaken at 37 °C for 1 h to detach the microglia. Astrocytes were obtained by trypsinization of the astrocytes remaining in the flask. This procedure yielded a highly enriched astrocyte culture (95% or more) and microglial cultures over 99% pure. The cell type of cultures was evaluated by labeling with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated lectin Griffonnia simplicifolia (1:200; Sigma), which recognizes microglia, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako, Denmark) to identify astrocytes. Cell Adhesion Assay—A 96-well tissue culture plate was coated with a nonadherent matrix (NAMx), collagen IV for microglia or BSA for astrocytes. Wells were treated with 30 μl of 50 μg/ml collagen IV or 50 μl of 1 mg/ml BSA in distilled water at 37 °C for 1 h, washed once with distilled water, and air-dried under sterile conditions. Then β-amyloid fibrils (0.1-2.5 μg) were added and air-dried. For the adhesion assay, 3 × 104 cells/well were plated in 100 μl of DMEM/F-12 plus 1 mg/ml BSA in a 96-well plate and placed in an incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1 h. The plate was then washed three times with DMEM/F-12 or PBS. The number of adherent cells was determined by the LDH assay. 3-7 independent experiments were carried out in quadruplicate. Ligand Competition Assay—Glial cells (5 × 104 cells/ml) were preincubated in suspension in DMEM/F-12 plus 1 mg/ml BSA with different known ligands for scavenger receptors for 30 min: 200 μg/ml fucoidan (SR-A ligand), 100 μg/ml LDL (SR-BI ligand), 100 μg/ml oxidized LDL (oxLDL; SR-A and SR-BI ligand), 200 μg/ml Mel-BSA (SR-A and SR-B ligand), 200 μg/ml poly(I) (SR-A ligand), 200 μg/ml poly(C) (negative control for poly(I) adhesion assays). After preincubation, the cells were plated on Aβ-coated wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Because preincubation with the competing ligands may result in the endocytosis of cell surface proteins, including receptor complexes, cells were preincubated with competing ligands also at 4 and 20 °C to block endocytosis. Wells were washed with PBS, and the number of cells was determined using the LDH assay. Each condition was tested in three independent experiments in quadruplicate. Binding Inhibition Assay: Immune Neutralization of SR-MARCO— Astrocytes cultures were pretreated for 30 min with or without 20 μg/ml rat anti-mouse-SR MARCO IgG (MCA 1849; Serotec) or rat anti-mouse-SR-A IgG (clone 2F8; MCA 1322; Serotec) as control antibody (38van der Lann L.J.W. Döpp E.A. Haworth R. Pikkarainen T. Kangas M. Elomaa O. Dijkstra C.D. Gordon S. Tryggvason K. Kraal G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar) before adding the astrocytes to the 96-well tissue culture plate coated as previously described. After 1 h of adhesion, the cells were washed three times with DMEM/F-12 or PBS. The number of adherent cells was determined by the LDH assay. Three independent experiments were carried out in quadruplicate. Quantification of Adherent Cells (LDH Assay)—The total content of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was determined as an indicator of the number of attached cells. Attached cells were also quantified by the incorporation of neutral red, with equivalent results (data not shown). LDH content was chosen because it was more sensitive for discrimination of low cell numbers. In brief, after the cell adhesion assay, culture dishes were extensively washed. Adherent cells were lysed with 100 μl of 2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cell extract was mixed with LDH reaction mixture (1:1). The mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 20-30 min. The reaction was stopped with 0.2 n HCl. Absorbencies at 490 and 630 nm were measured in a microplate reader. Standard curves were generated by plating 0.5-30 × 103 cells and processed in parallel with each LDH assay. Preparation of Fibrillar and Nonfibrillar β-Amyloid—To generate fAβ, Aβ-(1-42) was resuspended in Tris buffer and incubated in constant agitation at room temperature for 3-4 days (39Jarret J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar, 40Alvarez A. Opazo C. Alarcón R. Garrido J. Inestrosa N.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 348-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The Aβ suspension was centrifuged at 23,000 × g, 4 °C for 1 h. Pellet and supernatant correspond to insoluble fAβ and soluble nfAβ forms, respectively. Samples were run in a Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE (41Schägger H. van Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked, and then probed with the anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody BAP-18 (kindly provided by Dr. H. Döbeli, Hoffmann-La Roche, Switzerland) (42von Bernhardi R. Ramírez G. Matile H. Döbeli H. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 14: 946-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blot was then incubated with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The signal was detected with the chemiluminescence reagent plus kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and captured with a Fuji medical x-ray film. Intensity of the bands was quantified with NIH Image J public domain software available on the World Wide Web at the National Institutes of Health home page. Congo Red Binding Assay—The assay was established with modifications according to protocols previously established (43Nilsson K.P.R. Herland A. Hammarström P. Iganäs O. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3718-3724Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In brief, fAβ and nfAβ (1 μg) were added to the nonadherent matrix and air-dried. The wells were incubated with a solution of 5 μm Congo red (in 20 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 1-24 h at room temperature before the total absorbance was measured at 492 and 540 nm. The amount of Congo red bound to the matrix was used to estimate the quantity of fibrils in the matrix, according to the following: mol of Congo red bound to the matrix = (A540 nm/25,295) - (A492 nm/46,306). As negative control, Congo red binding to nonadherent matrix was also assayed. Preparation of Native and Oxidized Lipoproteins—LDLs (1.019-1.063) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of plasma obtained from healthy normolipidemic volunteers anticoagulated with EDTA. Before oxidation, EDTA was removed by dialysis against PBS and sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter. To oxidize LDL, 1 mg/ml lipoprotein was incubated in 5 μm CuSO4 in PBS at 37 °C for 24 h. Oxidation was stopped by the addition of 100 μm EDTA, followed by dialysis in PBS containing 0.3 mm EDTA for 4 × 24 h. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (44Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation was visualized by the increase of the electromobility of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) relative to the native LDL (45Lenz M.L. Hughes H. Mitchell J.R. Via D.P. Guyton J.R. Taylor A.A. Gotto A.M. Smith C.V. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Astrocytes, microglia, and mixed glial cultures (50/50) were plated at a density of 2 × 104 cells/glass coverslip in 24-well plates. Cells were washed in PBS with 1 mm Ca2+ and fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 5 min. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with the primary antibodies in blocking solution: polyclonal rabbit anti-GFAP (1:200; Dako), monoclonal mouse anti-vimentin (1:200; Dako), polyclonal rabbit anti-SR-BI (1:1000; Novus Biologicals), rat anti-SR-AI/AII IgG (1:50; Clone 2F8; Serotec), polyclonal goat anti-RAGE (1:50; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or lectin Alexa-488 (1:200; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For the identification of the novel expression of SR-MARCO in astrocytes, two separate antibodies from independent sources were tested: rat anti-mouse MARCO (MCA 1849, 1:100; Serotec) and monoclonal mouse anti-MARCO (1:100; BD Biosciences). Because reports suggested a possible cross-reactivity of the monoclonal mouse anti-MARCO with tubulin, live cells were stained in order to restrict labeling to extracellular epitopes. Except for the samples labeled with lectin, coverslips were washed in PBS and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody (all from Molecular Probes) diluted 1:100 in blocking solution: Alexa 488-anti-rabbit, Alexa 488-anti-mouse, Alexa 546-anti-rabbit, Alexa 546-anti-rat, or Alexa 546-anti-goat, at room temperature for 2-4 h. Coverslips were washed in PBS and water. Finally, samples were mounted in fluorescence mounting medium (Dako). As a standard practice, to discard the possibility of nonspecific binding, control assays where the primary antibody was omitted were run in parallel. Double Immunolabeling on Live Cells—In order to demonstrate cell surface labeling by anti-MARCO, we stained live cells. Cells were plated on glass coverslips as described above. Rat anti-mouse MARCO (MCA 1849; 1:100; Serotec) or monoclonal mouse anti-MARCO (1:100; BD Biosciences) was added to the culture media and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell cultures were washed with PBS plus 0.1 mm Ca2+/Mg2+ and then fixed with methanol at -20 °C for 30 min. Cells were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and then incubated with rabbit anti-GFAP (1:200) or Alexa 488-lectin (1:200) at 4 °C overnight. After they were washed, samples were incubated with the secondary antibody: Alexa 546-anti-mouse or Alexa 546-anti-rat (1:100; Molecular Probes) for MARCO and FITC-anti-rabbit (1:100; Molecular Probes) for GFAP at room temperature for 2 h. The samples were rinsed with PBS and mounted in mounting medium (Dako). Immunohistochemical Staining of Brain Sections—Brains from juvenile (150 g) and adult (250 g) rats were obtained after fixation through cardiac perfusion with 4% p-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Those brains were post-fixed in 4% p-formaldehyde for 24 h, and the brains of neonatal rats were fixed for 12 h and then transferred to 15% sucrose at 4 °C. Cryosections were prepared at 8-20 μm and stored at -80 °C until use. Immunohistochemistry was performed on attached and free floating sections using the anti-SR-MARCO MCA 1849 antibody. Double staining was carried out using an antibody against GFAP to identify astrocytes. Sections were incubated in blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 10% goat serum, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.02% azide) for 1 h. Immunodetection was performed by incubation in primary antibodies diluted 1:50 in blocking solution at 4 °C for 48 h. Sections were washed four times with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:100 in blocking solution at room temperature for 2 h, and washed again with PBS. Specific staining was absent if primary antiserum was omitted. Immunoblot Analysis—Glial cell cultures were prepared as indicated in the description of cell culture methods. Cells were harvested and lysed in an ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by the BCA method. The lysates (same amount of protein for the different samples of each independent experiment) were dissolved in sample buffer (80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 2% 2-mercapthoethanol, 0.02% Coomassie Blue G250) and were heated in a boiling water bath for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was performed with 7.5 and 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After electrophoretic transfer, the membrane was treated with the blocking buffer (PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20, 10% goat serum). The membrane was then incubated with the primary antibody in blocking buffer: anti-SR-A antibody (1:500, Clone 2F8; Serotec), anti-SR-B antibody (1:2000; Novus Biologicals), anti-SR-MARCO antibodies (1:1000, MCA 1849 (Serotec) and 1:1000, clone 22 (BD Bioscience)) or anti-RAGE antibody (1:500; N-16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The primary antibody was rinsed and the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rat IgG, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG, or horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG in blocking buffer as the secondary antibody, depending on the primary antibody previously used. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The molecular mass was estimated with a molecular mass marker kit (Invitrogen). Lysates obtained from adrenal gland (SR-B), liver (SR-A and SR-MARCO), and lung (RAGE) were used as positive controls. Aβ Removal Assays—Glass slides in 24-wells plates were overlaid with poly-l-lysine and later a central spot of Cy3-Aβ or plain nfAβ until dried, washed with sterile water, and air-dried. 2 × 104 astrocytes were plated on the coated glass slides and incubated for up to 2 days at 37 °C. For the experiments with Cy3-Aβ, cells were fixed in 5% formalin at room temperature for 25 min, and nuclei were stained with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (B2883; Sigma). When unlabeled nfAβ was used, cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% p-formaldehyde in PBS and permeated with PBS plus 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells were blocked with 5% goat serum in PBS and then incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; 1:200; Dako) as identity marker for astrocytes and a monoclonal antibody anti-Aβ amyloid (BAP-18; 1:200) at 4 °C overnight and the corresponding secondary antibody (Molecular Probes): Alexa-546-conjugated anti-mouse (1:100) and Alexa-488-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:100) at room temperature for 2-4 h. Nuclei were also stained with 0.1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258. Statistical Analysis—The statistical significance of the differences in adhesion between the different substrate and competition assays was analyzed with the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical significance was established for p < 0.05. The purity of the cells for the adhesion assays was evaluated by immunocytochemistry with cell identity markers. Microglial cells were over 99% pure, and astrocytes contained less than 5% of contaminating microglia. Binding of Astrocytes and Microglia of Neonatal Rat to Different Matrices—We compared the adhesion of astrocytes and microglia with different matrices (Fig. 1A). After 1 h of assay, astrocyte adhesion was maximal on poly-l-lysine and minimal on BSA (6 ± 2% cells) (Fig. 1A). Microglial adhesion to poly-l-lys"

The purpose of this study was to identify candidate biomarkers overexpressed in adipose tissue of obese subjects that could link expanded fat mass to atherosclerosis. We compared gene expression profile in subcutaneous adipose tissue (scWAT) of 28 obese and 11 lean subjects using microarray technology. This analysis identified 240 genes significantly overexpressed in scWAT of obese subjects. The genes were then ranked according to the correlation between gene expression and body mass index (BMI). In this list, the elastolytic cysteine protease cathepsin S was among the highly correlated genes. RT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed the increase in cathepsin S mRNA (P=0.006) and protein (P<0.05) in obese scWAT. The circulating concentrations of cathepsin S were also significantly higher in obese than in nonobese subjects (P<0.0001). Both cathepsin S mRNA in scWAT and circulating levels were positively correlated with BMI, body fat, and plasma triglyceride levels. In addition, we show that the proinflammatory factors, lipopolysaccharide, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha increase cathepsin S secretion in human scWAT explants. This study identifies cathepsin S as a novel marker of adiposity. Since this enzyme has been implicated in the development of atherosclerotic lesions, we propose that cathepsin S represents a molecular link between obesity and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2119467972,"The purpose of this study is to identify novel proteins released by cancer cells that are involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling using small-volume samples and automated technology. We applied multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), which incorporates two-dimensional capillary chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry to small quantities of serum-free supernatants of resting or phorbol ester-activated Suit-2 pancreatic cancer cells. Selected markers were validated in additional pancreatic cancer cell lines, primary cancers, and xenografted cancer cells. MudPIT analysis of 10 microl of supernatants identified 46 proteins, 21 of which are classified as secreted, and 10 have never been associated with pancreatic cancer. These include CSPG2/versican, Mac25/angiomodulin, IGFBP-1, HSPG2/perlecan, syndecan 4, FAM3C, APLP2, cyclophilin B, beta2 microglobulin, and ICA69. Evidence that cancer cells release these proteins in vivo was obtained for CSPG2/versican and Mac25/angiomodulin by immunohistochemistry on both primary pancreatic cancers and in a model consisting of Suit-2 cells embedded in an amorphous matrix and implanted in athymic mice. MudPIT allowed efficient and rapid identification of proteins released by cancer cells, including molecules previously undescribed in the type of cancer analyzed. Our finding that pancreatic cancer cells secrete a series of proteoglycans, including versican, perlecan, syndecan 1 and 4, challenges the common view that fibroblasts of tumor stroma are the sole source of these molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2060393626,"The molecular basis of the origin of life is one of the most fundamental questions in modern biology. While the ""RNA world"" hypothesis offers a very sensible model for the evolvement of the current biochemical networks, there is a lack of knowledge about the early steps that led to the formation of the first RNA molecules. This issue is essential as it is practically impossible that complex molecules as functional RNA oligonucleotides had evolved spontaneously. It was recently demonstrated that peptide molecules as simple as dipeptides can self-assemble into well-ordered tubular, fibrilar, and closed-cage structures. Other studies have confirmed the ability of dipeptides to act as catalysts and the capability of other peptides, as short as tripeptides, to serve as a template for nucleotide binding and orientation. Unlike complex RNA molecules, the spontaneous formation of functional short peptides in the primordial earth conditions is very likely. We suggest a novel mechanism for the origin of life that is based on the ability of short peptides to form encapsulated structures, catalyst chemical reaction, and serve as highly ordered template for the assembly of nucleotides. This model may explain the early events that led to the formation of the current biochemical machinery that combines the elaborated and coordinated interaction between nucleic acids and proteins to allow the function of living systems."
https://openalex.org/W1995147812,"Smoking is a significant risk factor for development of atherosclerosis. However, the pathophysiology of smoking-mediated vessel wall damage is not understood. With tools ranging from analytical chemistry to cell biology, we show that cigarette smoke contains metals that catalyze the direct oxidation of cellular proteins by smoke oxidants. Oxidation of cellular proteins causes a loss of microtubule function, culminating in microtubule depolymerization and proteasome-dependent degradation of alpha-tubulin. As a consequence of the microtubule collapse, cytoskeletal structures as well as intermediate filaments break down, leading finally to a contraction of vascular endothelial cells. We observed a smoke extract-induced, calpain-dependent degradation of the intracellular form of platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1/CD31, as well as a release of P-selectin/CD62P, IL-6, and IL-8 from endothelial cells into the supernatant. Increased levels of soluble CD62P and IL-6 are well known to be associated with smoking in humans. Increased permeability of the vascular endothelium is a crucial event in atherogenesis. This work highlights the compounds and mechanisms by which cigarette smoke induces leakiness of the vascular endothelium."

https://openalex.org/W1979091254,"We recently reported that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastric lesions involve NSAID-induced apoptosis of gastric mucosal cells, which in turn involves the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, in particular the up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous transcription factor (CHOP). In this study, we have examined the molecular mechanism governing this NSAID-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of gastric mucosal cells. Various NSAIDs showed membrane permeabilization activity that correlated with their apoptosis-inducing activity. Various NSAIDs, particularly celecoxib, also increased intracellular Ca2+ levels. This increase was accompanied by K+ efflux from cells and was virtually absent when extracellular Ca2+ had been depleted. These data indicate that the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels that is observed in the presence of NSAIDs is due to the stimulation of Ca2+ influx across the cytoplasmic membrane, which results from their membrane permeabilization activity. An intracellular Ca2+ chelator partially inhibited celecoxib-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, reduced the magnitude of the celecoxib-induced decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and inhibited celecoxib-induced apoptotic cell death. It is therefore likely that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels is involved in celecoxib-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting apoptosis. An inhibitor of calpain, a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, partially suppressed mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in the presence of celecoxib. Celecoxib-dependent CHOP-induction was partially inhibited by the intracellular Ca2+ chelator but not by the calpain inhibitor.

Ray W.A. Daugherty J.R. Griffin M.R. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1995; 141: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory action of NSAIDs is mediated through their inhibitory effect on cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. COX is an enzyme essential for the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), which have a strong capacity to induce inflammation. On the other hand, NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal complications (2Hawkey C.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 521-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), with about 15-30% of chronic users of NSAIDs suffering from gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding (3Barrier C.H. Hirschowitz B.I. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 926-932PubMed Google Scholar, 4Gabriel S.E. Jaakkimainen L. Bombardier C. Ann. Intern.

Gastroenterol. 1990; 12: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The inhibition of COX by NSAIDs at gastrointestinal mucosa was previously thought to be the sole explanation for the gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs because PGs have a strong protective effect on gastrointestinal mucosa (7Vane J.R. Botting R.M. Scand. J. Rheumatol. Suppl. 1996; 102: 9-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Miller T.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: G601-G623PubMed Google Scholar). However, now it is believed that the induction of gastrointestinal lesions by NSAIDs involves additional mechanisms, since the increased incidence of gastrointestinal lesions and the decrease in PG levels induced by NSAIDs do not always occur in parallel (9Ligumsky M. Golanska E.M. Hansen D.G. Kauffman G.J. Gastroenterology. 1983; 84: 756-761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10Ligumsky M. Sestieri M. Karmeli F. Zimmerman J. Okon E. Rachmilewitz D. Gastroenterology. 1990; 5: 1245-1249Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that NSAIDs induce cell death (apoptosis and necrosis) in primary cultures of gastric mucosal cells in a manner independent of COX inhibition (11Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1092-G1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Mio M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we recently suggested that both COX inhibition and NSAID-induced cell death at gastric mucosa are required for NSAID-induced gastric lesions in vivo (12Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Mio M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the mechanisms governing NSAID-induced cell death is important for understanding the mechanisms by which NSAIDs cause gastric lesions and may allow the development of new safer NSAIDs. We recently showed that all of the NSAIDs tested have membrane permeabilization activity, which is implicated in NSAID-induced apoptosis and necrosis (13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the membrane permeabilization activity of NSAIDs causes cell death and in particular apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells remains unknown. Accumulation of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induces the ER stress response, otherwise known as the unfolded protein response. Cells initially adapt to the accumulation of unfolded proteins by inducing the expression of ER-resident molecular chaperones such as glucose-regulated protein 78 (14Kaufman R.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar, 15Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar, 16Liu H.

Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, if this adaptation does not prove sufficient, the apoptotic response is initiated, which is primarily the induction of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous transcription factor (CHOP) (18Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1690) Google Scholar). We recently reported that various NSAIDs induce not only glucose-regulated protein 78 but also CHOP expression. In addition to this, we showed, using CHOP-deficient mice and a dominant negative form of CHOP, that this CHOP induction is essential for NSAID-induced apoptosis (19Tsutsumi S. Gotoh T. Tomisato W.

Therefore, NSAIDs seem to induce apoptosis by acting as ER stressors. However, the mechanism by which NSAIDs induce the ER stress response has remained unknown. Other groups have pointed out the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in NSAID-induced apoptosis; some NSAIDs (such as celecoxib) stimulate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and decrease the mitochondrial membrane potential (20Ding H. Han C. Zhu J. Chen C.S. D'Ambrosio S.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Z. Lai G.H. Sirica A.E. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Various mechanisms have been proposed for NSAID-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, such as inactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1/Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (20Ding H. Han C. Zhu J. Chen C.S. D'Ambrosio S.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2005; 113: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Z. Lai G.H. Sirica A.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11397-11403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). However, data in these studies have some contradictions (may be due to differences in cell species), and the mechanisms by which NSAIDs cause mitochondrial dysfunction have also not been fully characterized. Increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels, due to cellular Ca2+ overload or perturbation of intracellular Ca2+ compartmentalization, trigger apoptosis. For example, many apoptotic stimuli, such as activation of surface antigen receptors, increase the intracellular Ca2+ level, and compounds that directly increase the intracellular Ca2+ level (Ca2+ ionophores and inhibitors for sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA)) have been shown to induce apoptosis (23Jiang S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27217-27226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Various mechanisms have been proposed for the Ca2+-induced apoptosis pathway, such as activation of protein kinase C, opening of permeability transition pores in mitochondria, and stimulation of reactive oxygen species synthesis (26Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 27Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Ferrari D. Chami M. Szabadkai G. Magalhaes P.J.

Commun. 2003; 304: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, calpain, a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, plays an important role in the Ca2+-induced apoptosis pathway. Calpain activates or inhibits Bax and Bid or Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, respectively, by their cleavage, resulting in stimulation of the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Then cytochrome c activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 and induces apoptosis. It is also suggested that calpain directly activates some caspases (26Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B.

On the other hand, recent reports show that Ca2+ ionophores induce the ER stress response and CHOP expression, suggesting that increases in the intracellular Ca2+ level can induce the ER stress response and CHOP expression (26Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Nicotera P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 552-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar, 33Nozaki S. Sledge Jr. G.W. Nakshatri H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2178-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Permeabilization of cytoplasmic membranes causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels by stimulating Ca2+ influx across the cytoplasmic membrane. Some NSAIDs were shown to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels (13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 34Johnson A.J. Hsu A.L. Lin H.P. Song X. Chen C.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 831-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels are involved in NSAID-induced apoptosis (i.e. that the increased intracellular Ca2+ level connects the membrane permeabilization and CHOP induction activities of NSAIDs). Furthermore, it is also possible that activation of calpain connects the increases in intracellular Ca2+ levels to mitochondrial dysfunction in the presence of NSAIDs. In this study, we showed, in primary cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells, that all NSAIDs tested increased intracellular Ca2+ levels, which accompanied the induction of apoptosis. An intracellular Ca2+ chelator partially inhibited CHOP induction, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptotic cell death in the presence of celecoxib (the most potent NSAID for apoptosis induction). Furthermore, an inhibitor of calpain partially suppressed the mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic cell death but did not affect CHOP induction in the presence of celecoxib. These results suggest that the celecoxib-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels and the resulting calpain activation and CHOP induction are involved in celecoxib-induced apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells.

Guinea pig gastric mucosal cells prepared under these conditions have previously been characterized, with the majority (about 90%) of cells identified as pit cells (35Tomisato W. Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). NSAIDs were dissolved in Me2SO or Na2CO3 (for indomethacin only) and control experiments (without NSAIDs) were performed in the presence of the same concentrations of Me2SO or Na2CO3. Cells were exposed to NSAIDs by changing the medium. Cell viability was determined by the MTT method. Apoptotic chromatin condensation was monitored as described previously (36Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with PBS, stained with 10 μg/ml Ho 342, and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Immunoblotting Analysis—Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (36Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the samples was determined by the Bradford method. The samples were electrophoresed on polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, and the proteins were then transferred to membranes and detected using antibodies. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay—Mitochondrial membrane potential was assayed using a fluorometric mitochondrial permeability assay kit (Trevigen) (36Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treatment with NSAIDs, cells were treated with DePsipher (5 μg/ml) for 20 min at 37 °C and observed under a fluorescence microscope using 590 nm for red emission and 530 nm for green emission. Measurement of the Intracellular Ca2+ Level—Intracellular Ca2+ levels were monitored as described (37Kao J.P. Harootunian A.T. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8179-8184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were washed with assay buffer (115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, and 13.8 mm glucose). For Ca2+-free conditions, the modified assay buffer (115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES, and 13.8 mm glucose) was used instead of the normal assay buffer. The cells were then incubated with 4 μm fluo-3/AM in assay buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.04% pluronic F127, and 2 mm probenecid, for 40 min at 37 °C. After washing twice with assay buffer, cells were suspended in assay buffer supplemented with 2 mm probenecid. Cells were transferred to a water-jacketed cuvette (1.6 × 106 cells/cuvette), and the fluo-3 fluorescence was then measured with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorophotometer by recording excitation signals at 490 nm and the emission signal at 530 nm at 1-s intervals. Maximum and minimum fluorescence values (Fmax and Fmin) were obtained by adding 10 μm ionomycin and 10 μm ionomycin under Ca2+-free conditions, respectively. The intracellular Ca2+ level was calculated according to the equation, [Ca2+]i = Kd(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where Kd is the apparent dissociation constant (400 nm) of the fluorescent dye-Ca2+ complex. Membrane Permeability Assay—Permeabilization of calcein-loaded liposomes was assayed as described previously (13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Liposomes were prepared using the reversed-phase evaporation method. Egg phosphatidylcholine (10 μmol, 7.7 mg) was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v), dried, dissolved in 1.5 ml of diethyl ether, and added to 1 ml of 100 mm calcein-NaOH (pH 7.4). The mixture was sonicated to obtain a homogenous emulsion. The diethyl ether solvent was removed, and the resulting suspension of liposomes was centrifuged and washed twice with fresh buffer A (10 mm potassium buffer, containing 150 mm NaCl) to remove untrapped calcein. The final liposome precipitate was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A. A 0.3-ml aliquot of this suspension was diluted with 19.7 ml of buffer A, and 400 μl of this diluted suspension was then incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of the NSAID under investigation. The release of calcein from liposomes was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity at 520 nm (excitation at 490 nm). Assay for K+ Efflux from Cells—K+ efflux from cells was monitored as described previously (38Katsu T. Kobayashi H. Hirota T. Fujita Y. Sato K. Nagai U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 899: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were washed twice with buffer A and then suspended in fresh buffer A (6 × 106 cells/ml). After incubation with NSAIDs for 30 min at 37 °C, K+ efflux from cells was measured with a K+ ion-selective electrode. Assay for Caspase Activity—The activity of caspase-3 was determined as described previously (36Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged, after which the supernatants were incubated with fluorogenic peptide substrates (acetyl-DEVD-methylcoumarin amide) in reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 37 °C. The release of aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. One unit of protease activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 pmol of AMC/min. Assay for Calpain Activity—The activity of calpain was determined as described previously (30Mandic A. Viktorsson K. Strandberg L. Heiden T. Hansson J. Linder S. Shoshan M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed by Hanks' solution, and suspended with the same solution at 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Suspensions were incubated with fluorogenic peptide substrates succinyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-valyl-l-tyrosine 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide for 3 min at 37 °C. The release of AMC was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. Statistical Analyses—All values are expressed as the means ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance, followed by Scheffe's multiple comparison, was used for evaluation of differences between the groups. Student's t test for unpaired results was performed to evaluate differences between two groups. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. Close Relationship between NSAID-induced Apoptosis and Membrane Permeabilization—We recently reported that some NSAIDs (celecoxib, mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid, nimesulide, and flurbiprofen) cause not only apoptosis in primary cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells but also membrane permeabilization in calcein-loaded liposomes (13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between the apoptosis-inducing and membrane permeabilization activities of NSAIDs, in this study, we have examined these activities of other NSAIDs. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of primary cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells with celecoxib for 16 h decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, and this is consistent with our previous results (13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Each of the NSAIDs tested here (indomethacin, diclofenac, etodolac, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen) also decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. Because cell death under these conditions was accompanied by apoptotic DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation (data not shown), it is most likely mediated by apoptosis. Two subtypes of COX, COX-1 and COX-2, are responsible for the majority of COX activity in gastric mucosal and inflammatory tissues, respectively, and recently a number of COX-2-selective NSAIDs have been developed (39Vane J. Nature. 1994; 367: 215-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Among the NSAIDs tested in Fig. 1A, etodolac and celecoxib have selectivity for COX-2. No relationship was evident between NSAID-induced apoptosis and selectivity for COX-2 (Fig. 1A). We also confirmed that exogenously added PGE2 (either native PGE2 or 16,16-dimethyl-PGE2) did not affect NSAID-induced apoptosis even at a higher concentration of PGE2 in the culture medium than is present endogenously (10-9 m) (data not shown). These data show that NSAID-induced apoptosis is independent of COX-inhibition by NSAIDs and are consistent with our previous conclusion (12Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Mio M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Calcein fluoresces very weakly at high concentrations due to self-quenching, so the addition of membrane-permeabilizing drugs to a medium containing calcein-loaded liposomes should cause an increase in fluorescence by diluting out the calcein (13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, not only celecoxib but also other NSAIDs increased the calcein fluorescence, suggesting that they have membrane permeabilization activity. Combining the results from the previous (13Tomisato W. Tanaka K. Katsu T. Kakuta H. Sasaki K. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Aburaya M. Li D. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Yokomizo K. Mizushima T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and present studies, we obtained dose-response curves of 10 different NSAIDs for both induction of apoptosis and membrane permeabilization. To examine the relationship between NSAID-induced apoptosis and membrane permeabilization, we determined ED50 values of the 10 NSAIDs for apoptosis (concentrations of NSAIDs required for 50% inhibition of cell viability by apoptosis) and ED20 values for membrane permeabilizati"
https://openalex.org/W2080733049,"A clear parallelism between the different steps in human embryo-endometrial apposition/adhesion/invasion and leukocyte-endothelium rolling/adhesion/extravasation can be established. During human implantation and leukocyte trafficking, a first wave of soluble mediators regulates the expression and functional activity of adhesion molecules such as L-selectin and integrins, which mediate both processes. Apical surfaces of human endometrial epithelium and endothelium are key elements for the initiation of molecular interactions to capture the blastocyst or leukocyte, respectively. Subsequently, the blastocyst and the leukocyte migrate through the epithelium and endothelium toward their final destination, the endometrial stroma, to initiate placentation or the inflammatory foci as part of the immune response. Similarities between the intermediate molecular mechanisms of these two physiologically unrelated processes are discussed."

Here we studied the activation of mouse TRPC5 expressed in Chinese hamster ovary and human embryonic kidney 293 cells by agonist stimulation of several receptors that couple to the phosphoinositide signaling cascade and the role of calmodulin (CaM) on the activation. We showed that exogenous application of 10 μm CaM through patch pipette accelerated the agonist-induced channel activation by 2.8-fold, with the time constant for half-activation reduced from 4.25 ± 0.4 to 1.56 ± 0.85 min. We identified a novel CaM-binding site located at the C terminus of TRPC5, 95 amino acids downstream from the previously determined common CaM/IP3R-binding (CIRB) domain for all TRPC proteins. Deletion of the novel CaM-binding site attenuated the acceleration in channel activation induced by CaM. However, disruption of the CIRB domain from TRPC5 rendered the channel irresponsive to agonist stimulation without affecting the cell surface expression of the channel protein. Furthermore, we showed that high (>5 μm) intracellular free Ca2+ inhibited the current density without affecting the time course of TRPC5 activation by receptor agonists. These results demonstrated that intracellular Ca2+ has dual and opposite effects on the activation of TRPC5. The novel CaM-binding site is important for the Ca2+/CaM-mediated facilitation, whereas the CIRB domain is critical for the overall response of receptor-induced TRPC5 channel activation.

These initial findings prompted the search for mammalian homologues, leading to the identification of seven TRP genes with different degrees of sequence similarity to the original insect Trp gene (3Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These genes are now designated TRP-Canonical or TRPC, symbolizing their close similarity to the original Drosophila Trp. Many recently discovered cation channels are found to share some limited homology with the TRPCs. These include TRPVs (similar to the vanilloid receptor), TRPMs (named after the first identified member, melastatin), and TRPPs (named after PKD2 for polycystic kidney disease), etc. Together, there are at least 28 non-allelic TRP genes in the mammalian genome. The TRP channels serve diverse functions in many tissues from somatosensory to cardiovascular systems (4Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar).TRPC5 is a member of the TRPC family of Ca2+-permeable nonselective cationic channels. It has drawn attention recently because of its role in modulating hippocampal growth cone motility and neurite elongation in the mammalian brain (5Greka A. Navarro B. Oancea E. Duggan A. Clapham D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The TRPC5 channel activity is induced upon stimulation of the phosphoinositide signaling cascade by receptors that stimulate phospholipase C; however, the exact mechanism of channel activation remains controversial (6Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The activation of TRPC5 is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ at both the extracellular and the intracellular sides of the plasma membrane (7Jung S. Muhle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G.

Physiol. (Lond.). 2004; 559: 739-750Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although the extracellular effect of Ca2+ has been shown to be mediated by the acidic residues, Glu543, Glu595, and Glu598, located at the putative pore loop of the TRPC5 protein (7Jung S. Muhle A. Schaefer M. Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3562-3571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), the mechanism for the intracellular Ca2+ dependence of TRPC5 remains to be elucidated.Calmodulin (CaM) is a common intracellular mediator of many Ca2+-dependent regulations. All TRPC proteins possess a C-terminal CaM-binding domain that also interacts with an N-terminal sequence of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) (6Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that IP3R and CaM compete with each other for binding to the common CaM/IP3R-binding (CIRB) site of the TRPC. In functional studies, the TRPC-binding region of the IP3R activated and Ca2+/CaM inhibited the activation of TRPC3 and TRPC4. Moreover, TRPC channels were activated by removing or inactivating CaM from excised inside-out membrane patches, indicating that displacement of the inhibitory CaM from the common CIRB site is sufficient for the activation of TRPC channels (11Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we have shown that CaM increased the delay between the release of Ca2+ from internal storage compartments and the activation of Ca2+ influx via endogenous TRPC1 channels in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which were subjected to the regulation by IP3R and CaM in a similar fashion as the exogenously expressed TRPC3 and TRPC4 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (12Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Additional C-terminal CaM-binding domains outside of the CIRB sites have been found on TRPC proteins (6Plant T.D. Schaefer M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 13Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Unlike the CIRB sites, these sites are not conserved among all TRPC channels, and they do not bind to IP3Rs. The second CaM-binding (CBII) site of TRPC1 has been shown to be involved in the slow Ca2+-induced channel inactivation (13Singh B.B. Liu X. Tang J. Zhu M.X. Ambudkar I.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).In the present study we have identified the CBII site from mouse TRPC5 (mTRPC5). We have explored the specific roles of the CIRB and CBII sites in the modulation of channel activity after activation of receptors that stimulate the phosphoinositide signaling cascade by selectively disrupting each CaM-binding site from mTRPC5 and heterologous expression of the wild type and mutant channels in CHO and HEK293 cells. We show for the first time that intracellular application of CaM accelerated the activation of mTRPC5 by receptor agonists. Although mutations in the CIRB site rendered the channel inactive, deletion of the CBII site attenuated the Ca2+/CaM-induced acceleration of receptor-evoked mTRPC5 activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Solutions—All salts were of analytical grade purchased from Sigma. GTP and ATP were also obtained from Sigma. Bovine brain calmodulin, bradykinin, human thrombin, the CaM inhibitors N-aminohexyl-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide (W7) and trifluoperazine dimaleate (TFP), and histamine were purchased from Calbiochem. The pipette (intracellular) solution contained (mm) the following: 130 potassium aspartate, 5 KCl, 10 EGTA or HEDTA, 7.39 (0.4 μm free, with EGTA), 5.07 (5 μm free with HEDTA), or 6.73 (10 μm free with HEDTA) CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 1 ATP, 2 GTP, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. Free pipette Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the MaxChelator program (see below). The extracellular (bath) solution contained (mm) the following: 130 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1.7 Mg2SO4, 5 glucose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2.DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—Complementary DNA for the open reading frame of mTRPC5 was subcloned in pIRESneo (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) vector. Mutageneses were performed using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Constructs for maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins that contained different fragments of mTRPC5 were made in the pAGA3 vector as described previously (14Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). cDNA for the guinea pig histamine type 1 receptor (H1R) in pcDNA3 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Schaefer (Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin) and that for the human type 2 bradykinin receptor (Bk2R) was a generous gift from Dr. William W. Schilling (Case Western Reserve University).Analysis of the Expression of mTRPC5 mRNA by RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from wild type cells and cells transfected with mTRPC5 and the mTRPC5 mutants using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Approximately 500 ng of total RNA was used as the template for RT-PCR, which was carried out using the ONEStep system with Superscript II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocols. The reaction was performed on a TC-512 thermal cycler (TECHNE, Cambridge, UK) using 30 cycles of the following PCR protocol: 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. The primers used for mTRPC5 were 5′-CTATGAGACCAGAGCTATTGATG (forward) and 5′-CTACCAGGGAGATGACGTTGTATG (reverse), which amplify a 220-bp-long product. For glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the primers used were 5′-GACATCAAGAAGCTGGTGAAGC (forward) and 5′-TACTCCTTGGAGGCCATGTAG (reverse), which amplify a 236-bp-long product. The PCR products were sequenced to identify the products, run on a 2% agarose gel, and stained with ethidium bromide. The gel was analyzed with a Typhoon 8600 Imager (Amersham Biosciences).CaM Binding Assay—Fragments of mTRPC5 fused to the C terminus of MBP were prepared by in vitro synthesis using the transcription- and translation-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]Met and [35S]Cys as described previously (11Zhang Z.

The 35S-labeled proteins were incubated with CaM-Sepharose at room temperature for 30 min in a binding solution that contained 120 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5% Lubrol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After several washes, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and then revealed by x-ray autoradiography as described (11Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A.

For studying Ca2+ dependence of mTRPC5-CaM binding, 10 mm EGTA or HEDTA and the desired concentrations of CaCl2 (calculated using the MaxChelator program (www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/maxc.html)) were included in the binding solution, and the apparent affinity (K1/2) for Ca2+ was determined as described (14Tang J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).Cell Surface Biotinylation Assay—Transfection, biotinylation, and streptavidin precipitation were performed as described previously (15Wang C. Hu H.Z. Colton C.K. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37423-37430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed using anti-mTRPC5 antibodies (Alomone Labs, Jerusalem, Israel). Sample loading for the crude cell lysate and streptavidin precipitated portion represents 12 and 355 μg, respectively, of total proteins in cell lysates. Identical exposure time was used to reveal the chemiluminescent signals for the mTRPC5 proteins in crude lysates and streptavidin-precipitated samples.Fluorescence-based Membrane Potential Measurements—HEK293 cells were cotransfected with mTRPC5 and H1R in wells of a 96-well plate as described previously (16Hu H.Z. Gu Q. Wang C. Colton C.K. Tang J. Kinoshita-Kawada M. Lee L.Y. Wood J.D. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35741-35748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). One day after the transfection, cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution and then incubated for 30 min with 80 μl of FLIPR membrane potential dye (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) diluted in the Hanks' solution. Changes in membrane potential were measured at 32 °C using a fluid handling integrated fluorescence plate reader, FlexStation (Molecular Devices). Histamine was diluted in Hanks' solution at 300 μm, and 40 μl were delivered to the sample plate by the integrated robotic 8-channel pipettor at 20 s after readings began. Samples were excited at 530 nm, and emission of 565 nm was collected from the bottom of the plate at 0.67 Hz.Stable Cell Lines—HEK293 and CHO cells were transfected with bicistronic plasmids containing the wild type mTRPC5 or the mutants described in this study followed by an internal ribosome entry site and the gene conferring resistance to neomycin. Cells were maintained in 1 mg/ml G418 for 1 month and later assayed by RT-PCR to confirm the presence of the mRNA for mTRPC5 and aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. Stably transfected cell clones were isolated by progressive dilution and tested for mTRPC5 expression. Cells (both CHO and HEK293) were transfected also with a similar bicistronic plasmid containing the cDNA for Bk2R and the gene conferring resistance to puromycin. Clonal cell lines expressing both mTRPC5 and Bk2R were isolated using the two selection markers, neomycin and puromycin.Whole-cell Measurements of mTRPC5 Currents—The whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was utilized to study mTRPC5-mediated currents as described previously (12Vaca L. Sampieri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42178-42187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated on glass coverslips and mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope (Nikon Instruments, Japan). The amplifier used was the Axopatch 200A (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Pipette resistance was 10–12 megohms when tested with pipette and bath solutions. Whole-cell resistances were in the range of 1–2 gigohms, and cell capacitance ranged from 10 to 12 picofarads for CHO and 12 to 16 picofarads for HEK293 cells. Cells were held at the holding potential of –80 mV and repetitively stepped to –120 through +60 mV for 500 ms each in a 20-mV increment once every second. Receptor agonists were applied through bath perfusion, and CaM was introduced intracellularly by dialysis through the patch pipette.Data Analysis and Curve Fitting—All data were plotted and fitted using Sigmaplot 8 (SYSTAT, Point Richmond, CA). To obtain activation time constants, the mean outward current was plotted over time for the duration of the experiments under the different experimental conditions indicated in each figure legend. Data were fitted to sigmoidal Equation 1 as follows: f=a/(1+exp(-(x-x0)/b))(Eq. 1) where a indicates the maximum outward current value (top asymptote); b indicates the minimum outward current value (bottom asymptote); X0 indicates time constant for half-activation, and x indicates the time explored for each data point.RESULTSTime Course of the Activation of mTRPC5 by Agonists— Agonist stimulation of CHO cells stably expressing the wild type mTRPC5 channel results in a time-dependent activation of outwardly rectifying currents (Fig. 1). We followed current activation in the presence of agonists for 15 min (only the first 8 min are shown). The current reached a steady-state level after ∼7 min in the continuous presence of the agonists. After this period of time, 30% of the cells showed a small (about 5%) reduction of current amplitude. This phenomenon was not further studied in the present work.Fig. 1A shows a family of currents evoked by voltage pulses from a holding potential of –80 to –120 mV through +60 mV in 20-mV steps. Thrombin (1 unit) induced activation of an outwardly rectifying current with the reversal potential near 0 mV (–6 ± 4 mV, n = 25). The time course of the current-voltage (I-V) relationships is illustrated in Fig. 1B. The gray rectangle in Fig. 1B shows the limit of current induced by the agonist in cells not expressing mTRPC5. Notice that basal current level (before agonist stimulation) in mTRPC5-expressing cells was slightly higher when compared with wild type cells (∼10% more current). Although this current may reflect mTRPC5 channel activity, this was not further explored in the present study.To confirm the expression of mTRPC5, we performed RT-PCR experiments with total RNA obtained from control cells (wild type CHO cells) and cells expressing mTRPC5. The inset in Fig. 1B shows that that only mTRPC5-transfected cells contained the mTRPC5 transcript.The time course of mTRPC5 current activation was independent of the agonist and receptor utilized. Fig. 1 only illustrates the response to thrombin. We have compared the responses to thrombin and bradykinin (Bk) at concentrations that gave the maximal response (1 unit and 100 nm, respectively) in CHO cells stably expressing mTRPC5, and we obtained similar time constant values for half-activation of the outward current of 4.25 ± 0.4 and 4.01 ± 0.7 min, respectively.Calmodulin Accelerates the Time Course of the Activation of mTRPC5—In order to examine how CaM affects the activation of mTRPC5, we introduced CaM into mTRPC5-expressing cells by including the Ca2+-binding protein in the patch pipette. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, addition of CaM (10 μm) to the pipette resulted in a faster activation of mTRPC5 currents. Plotting the activation time courses for the outward currents in the absence (Fig. 2B, gray circles) and presence (black circles) of the exogenously applied CaM yielded activation curves that can be fitted with the sigmoidal equation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The time constant for half-activation was reduced from 4.25 ± 0.4 min (n = 17) in the absence of exogenous CaM to 1.56 ± 0.85 min with 10 μm CaM in the pipette. This effect was obtained with thrombin and Bk in CHO cells. Similar results were found in HEK293 cells stimulated with Bk (cells expressing mTRPC5 and Bk2R, see under “Experimental Procedures”). Time constants for outward currents in the absence and presence of CaM were comparable across cell lines and agonists tested (Table I). Because inward currents were relatively small compared with the amplitude of outward currents, and because they were difficult to separate from endogenous inward currents (this was especially difficult with HEK293 cells that showed larger inward currents than CHO cells), all the analyses in this study were conducted only on the outward currents.Fig. 2CaM accelerates the agonist-stimulated activation of mTRPC5 currents. A, comparison of the time course of current activation in the presence (black) and absence (gray) of 10 μm CaM in the patch pipette. Current amplitudes at +60 (upward bars) and –120 mV (downward bars) are shown in averages ± S.D. from 17 cells. B, time course of outward current at +60 mV in the presence and absence of CaM.

Open table in a new tab Identification of Two CaM-binding Sites at the C Terminus of mTRPC5—The above results suggest that CaM plays an important role in facilitating the receptor-induced activation of mTRPC5 channels. We have reported previously (14Tang J. Lin Y. Zhang Z. Tikunova S. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21303-21310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) the presence of a conserved common CIRB site at the near C-terminal regions of all TRPC proteins. For mTRPC5, the CIRB site lies in between Glu701 and Lys733 and requires higher Ca2+ concentrations (apparent K1/2 = 44.2 μm) for binding to CaM than the CIRB sites of other TRPC proteins. We also reported that the rest of the mTRPC5 C terminus downstream from the CIRB site (Gly762–Leu975, clone J1170 in Fig. 3A) bound to CaM as well. To narrow down the CBII site of mTRPC5, we have tested a large number of smaller fragments generated from J1170 by using an in vitro pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 3, the minimal binding site for CaM is confined to a stretch of 27 residues, Pro828–Asn854, 95 amino acids downstream from the CIRB site. The isolated mTRPC5 CBII fragment bound to CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 3D) with an apparent K for Ca2+ 1/2 of 3.1 ± 0.2 μm (n = 3). This value is lower than the previously determined K1/2 value (44.2 μm) of Ca2+ for CaM binding to the mTRPC5 CIRB site but within the range of those values (1.6–12.9 μm) for the CIRB sites of other TRPC isoforms (14Tang J.

The loss of CaM binding in these mutants was confirmed by in vitro binding studies (Fig. 4B). Receptor-mediated activation of mTRPC5 currents was studied after coexpression of the full-length clones of the mutated mTRPC5 with Bk2R or by stimulation of the endogenous thrombin receptor in CHO. As shown in Fig. 4C, without CaM in the pipette, the activation of mTRPC5ΔCBII was slightly delayed as compared with the wild type mTRPC5. Inclusion of 10 μm CaM in the pipette only weakly accelerated the activation of the mutant channel, indicating that CBII is important for the Ca2+/CaM-mediated facilitation of mTRPC5 activation. After fitting the outward current, the time constants for mTRPC5ΔCBII of 6.04 ± 0.5 (control) and 5.48 ± 0.7 min (with 10 μm CaM) were obtained.Fig. 4Deletion of CBII site attenuated the Ca2+/CaM-induced facilitation of receptor-induced mTRPC5 channel activation.

Tamoxifen, (TMX) a widely used anti-breast cancer drug, can induce NASH and changes in plasma cholesterol levels through mechanisms that are unclear. We studied primary actions of TMX using a short-term treatment (5 days) that induces microvesicular hepatic steatosis and marked hypercholesterolemia in male rats. Using a combined approach of gene expression profiling and NMR-based metabolite analysis, we found that TMX-treated livers have increased saturated fatty acid content despite changes in gene expression, indicating decreased de novo lipogenesis and increased fatty acid oxidation. Our results show that TMX predominantly down-regulates FAS expression and activity as indicated by the accumulation of malonyl-CoA, a known inhibitor of mitochondrial β-oxidation. In the face of a continued supply of exogenous free fatty acids, the blockade of fatty acid oxidation produced by elev..."
https://openalex.org/W2159025943,"Globoid cell leukodystrophy (GLD) or Krabbe disease is a devastating, degenerative neurological disorder caused by mutations in the galactosylceramidase (GALC) gene that severely affect enzyme activity. Currently, treatment options for this disorder are very limited. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has been shown to be effective in lysosomal storage disorders with predominantly peripheral manifestations such as type I Gaucher's and Fabry's disease. Little however is known about the possible benefit of ERT in GLD, which has a substantial central nervous system component. In this study, we examined the effect of peripheral GALC injections in the twitcher mouse model of the disease. Although we were unable to block the precipitous decline that normally occurs just before death, we did observe significant early improvements in motor performance, a substantial attenuation in the initial failure to thrive, and an increase in life span. Immunohistochemical and activity analyses demonstrated GALC uptake in multiple tissues, including the brain. This was associated with a decrease in the abnormal accumulation of the GALC substrate psychosine, which is thought to play a pivotal role in disease pathology. These results indicate that peripheral ERT is likely to be beneficial in GLD."

These findings highlight the importance of understanding the intermediates formed in the inactivation process of inhibitor-resistant β-lactamases and suggest how strategic chemical design can lead to novel ways to inhibit β-lactamases. Among Gram-negative bacteria, β-lactamase enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) are the principal agents of bacterial resistance to penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics. β-Lactamases hydrolyze β-lactams and render them ineffective before they reach their targets, the penicillin-binding proteins. This two-step process requires the presence of a strategically located water molecule in the active site (1Helfand M.S. Bonomo R.A. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Dis. 2003; 3: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To combat the critical problem of β-lactamase-mediated resistance, two approaches were undertaken: design β-lactams resistant to the hydrolytic action of β-lactamases or find inhibitors of these enzymes (2Charnas R.L.

Currently, tazobactam 1, sulbactam 2, and clavulanic acid 3 are the only β-lactamase inhibitors used in combination with β-lactams for the treatment of infections by bacteria that possess class A β-lactamases (Fig. 1) (6Gorbach S.L. Intensive Care Med. 1994; 20: S27-S34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Administered with a β-lactam, β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and ticarcillin/clavulanate) have had a significant impact on the treatment of a wide variety of infections. TEM-1 and SHV-1 are class A β-lactamases commonly found in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, pathogens responsible for urinary tract, respiratory tract, and bloodstream infections (6Gorbach S.L. Intensive Care Med. 1994; 20: S27-S34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the past decade, single amino acid substitutions in these enzymes have given rise to β-lactamases that are resistant to inactivation by inhibitors (the inhibitor-resistant TEMs). To date, 22 TEM and 3 SHV β-lactamases are described in nature that confer this phenotype (www.lahey.org/studies/webt.asp) (7Knox J.T. Antimicrob.

Despite a significant decrease in affinity for inhibitors and a decrease in efficiency of inactivation (kinact/KI, 100-fold for tazobactam and 420-fold for clavulanate), the S130G enzyme is eventually inhibited by both compounds. Our previous mass spectrometry studies of SHV-1 and SHV S130G β-lactamases with tazobactam suggested that a hydrated aldehyde (Δ+88) was an important intermediate formed in the inactivation of SHV-1, whereas an aldehyde (Δ+70) was the predominant intermediate in the inactivation of S130G. Because we saw higher resistance to inactivation for S130G with clavulanate, we asked whether inactivation by this compound occurs via an alternate pathway to the one followed by SHV-1 β-lactamase. In this report, we continue our analysis of the S130G substitution and examine the inactivation of S130G and SHV-1 β-lactamases with clavulanate.

Preparation and Purification of SHV-1 and S130G-substituted β-Lactamases—The E. coli DH10B strains possessing the SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases were previously described (19Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Bonomo R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In all instances, purified SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases were prepared by isoelectric focusing using an established method (15Helfand M.S. Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Anderson V.E. Bonomo R.A.

Inactivation of SHV-1 and S130G-substituted β-Lactamases by Clavulanic Acid for LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS Studies—Lithium clavulanic acid, a kind gift from Glaxo Smith Kline (Research Triangle Park, NC), was dissolved in high performance liquid chromatography grade water and mixed with the study β-lactamases in a molar ratio of 1000:1 (inhibitor:enzyme) at room temperature for 30 min. We chose this ratio of inhibitor, I, to enzyme, E, to be consistent with our previous studies with tazobactam and to ensure complete inactivation (18Pagan-Rodriguez D. Zhou X. Simmons R. Bethel C.R.

Our time of inactivation, 30 min, approximates the generation time of E. coli. Next, the inhibited enzymes were analyzed by the LC-ESI/MS method described herein. The LC-ESI/MS analyses were performed using a Micromass (Beverly, MA) QUATTRO II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization interfaced to an Agilent (Colorado Springs, CO) 1100 series high performance liquid chromatography system as described previously (18Pagan-Rodriguez D.

A C4 reverse phase column (1 × 150 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) purchased from Vydac (Hesperia, CA) was used to purify each apoenzyme and inactivated β-lactamase from unbound clavulanate (molecular mass = 199.3 Da). The mobile phase was a gradient mixture of A (0.3% acetic acid in water) and B (0.3% acetic acid in acetonitrile) with a flow rate through the column of 45 μl/min. The gradient timetable was 2% B at 0 min and 80% B at 30 min, and the total run time was 60 min. The parameters for the LC-ESI/MS were: ionization mode, positive; cone voltage, 70 V; N2 used both as a nebulizing and as a drying gas; the source temperature, 70 °C; capillary voltage, 3.5 KV, and the spectra were obtained scanning over 800–2400 Da. The Omniflex MALDI-TOF/MS from Bruker (Billerica, MA) was also used (see below). Proteolysis—The uninhibited and clavulanic acid-inactivated β-lactamases were first denatured with 8 m urea at 50 °C for 30 min. The pH of the denaturation mixture was adjusted to 8 using 0.4 m NH4HCO3. After a 1:4 dilution with water, sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) was added to the mixture at a β-lactamase:trypsin ratio of 25:1 (w/w) and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The mixture was frozen to -40 °C to terminate proteolysis. The digestion products were analyzed by LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS (18Pagan-Rodriguez D. Zhou X. Simmons R. Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M.

LC-ESI/MS for the Tryptic Digests—The tryptic digests of the uninhibited and clavulanic acid-inactivated β-lactamases were separated on a C18 column (1 × 150 mm, 5 μm, 300 Å) (Vydac). The mobile phase was a gradient mixture of A (0.3% acetic acid in water) and B (0.3% acetic acid in acetonitrile) from 2% B to 80% B in 70 min with a flow rate through the column of 35 μl/min. The total run time was 120 min. The ESI/MS parameters were the same as described above, except that the cone voltage was 45 V and the scanning range was 300–1700 Da. MALDI-TOF/MS of the Tryptic Digests—The tryptic digests were analyzed using an Omniflex MALDI-TOF/MS. Positive ionization and reflectron modes were used. The experimental parameters were as follows: laser power 60%, voltage 76.4%, and ion focus 9.2. The matrix was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. The internal standard consisted of bradykinin, rennin substrate, and adrenocorticoid hormone fragments 18–39 and 7–38 (Sigma). The samples were de-salted using C18 Zip-Tips from Millipore before mixing with the matrix. Kinetics—The time course of inactivation and recovery of SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases were determined by measuring residual activity at room temperature, 25 °C, using an Agilent™ 8453 Diode Array spectrophotometer. Kinetic studies were modeled after established methods (2Charnas R.L. Fisher J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 3Charnas R.L. Knowles J.R.

Each assay was performed using purified β-lactamase in 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, in a 1-ml quartz cuvette (2Charnas R.L. Fisher J. Knowles J.R.

UV difference spectra (absorption spectra of clavulanate reacted with SHV-1 or S130G β-lactamase versus spectra of SHV-1 or S130G, in a 200:1 I:E ratio) were measured from λ = 190 to 350 nm. LC-ESI/MS and the Inhibition of SHV-1 β-Lactamase with Clavulanic Acid—SHV-1 and clavulanic acid-inhibited SHV-1 β-lactamases were first characterized using LC-ESI/MS. The deconvoluted mass spectra for the chromatographic peaks of SHV-1 and SHV-1 β-lactamase inactivated with clavulanate are shown in Fig. 2, a and b. Multiple peaks are identified in Fig. 2b. The molecular masses of the apoenzyme and clavulanate-inhibited SHV-1 β-lactamases measured by LC-ESI/MS are: 28,874 ± 3 Da (SHV-1); 28,923 ± 3 (+Δ 49 ± 6); 28,946 ± 3 Da (+Δ 72 ± 6); 28,962 ± 3 (+Δ 88 ± 6); 28,987 ± 3 (+Δ 113 ± 6); and 29,048 ± 3(+Δ 174 ± 6). These additional masses are less than the molecular mass of clavulanic acid (199.3 Da) directly added to SHV-1, indicating that fragments of the inhibitor are covalently attached and modified in the clavulanic-SHV-1 complexes. The mass increments are very reminiscent of the increases seen in the clavulanic acid inactivation of TEM-2 by Brown et al. (21Brown R.P. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J.

We note that two of the products (113 ± 6 and 174 ± 6 Da adducts) were not identified in the above studies or with the inactivation of SHV-1 or S130G β-lactamases by tazobactam (18Pagan-Rodriguez D.

LC-ESI/MS and the Inhibition of S130G β-Lactamase by Clavulanic Acid—S130G and clavulanic acid-inhibited S130G variants of SHV-1 β-lactamase were studied in the same manner as the SHV-1 apoenzyme. Using LC-ESI/MS, we determined that the S130G β-lactamase had a uniform mass increase of 70 ± 6 Da from 28,839 ± 3 to 28,909 ± 3 Da (Fig. 3, a and b) after inhibition with clavulanic acid. This is the identical mass increase seen with the tazobactam inactivation of S130G β-lactamase (18Pagan-Rodriguez D. Zhou X. Simmons R. Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Helfand M.S. Jin Z. Guo B. Anderson V.E.

Identifying the Amino Acid Residues Modified by Clavulanic Acid in SHV and S130G β-Lactamase Using Tryptic Digestion and MALDI-TOF/MS Analysis—To gain insight into the mechanism and pathway of inactivation, the apo-form and clavulanic acid-inhibited SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases were digested with trypsin, and the tryptic digests were analyzed with LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS. Our goal here was to identify the amino acid site(s) of modification in the SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamases. Twenty-four peptides were identified by LC-ESI/MS from the tryptic digest of SHV-1 and 25 peptides were identified by LC-ESI/MS of SHV inhibited by clavulanic acid (TABLE ONE). Using the theoretical digestion of SHV-1 β-lactamase as a guide, we assigned 18 peptides by MALDI-TOF/MS of SHV-1 digested by trypsin, whereas 22 peptides were assigned by MALDI-TOF/MS analysis of SHV-1 inactivated by clavulanate (TABLE ONE). Fig. 4, a and b, shows the expanded MALDI-TOF/MS spectra for the tryptic digest of the apo-SHV-1 and clavulanate-inhibited SHV-1 β-lactamase with signals from the [M + H] ions of 988.46 and 1459.70, respectively. As we observed in the MALDI-TOF/MS analysis of SHV-1 inactivated by tazobactam, the relative signal intensities of peptide 11 that contains residues 66–73 (M + H, 988.46) and peptide 20 spanning residues 62–73 (M + H, 1459.70) were significantly decreased after clavulanic acid inhibition of SHV-1 β-lactamase. We noted the appearance of a peak (M + H, 1060.30) in the MALDI-TOF/MS for the digest of the clavulanate-inhibited SHV-1 that was not evident in the apo-SHV-1 β-lactamase analysis (Fig. 4a, TABLE ONE, peptide 11a). The mass difference between this peak and the diminished peptide peak at 988.46 m/z (residues 66–72) is 72 Da and is in agreement with one of the mass increases of SHV-1 after inhibition by tazobactam (see also LC-ESI/MS spectra above). For the peptide spanning amino acids 62–73 (M + H, 1459.70, peptide 20), the decrease in intensity is accompanied by the appearance of three new mass increments (M + H, 1507.60, 1520.80, and 1529.10) (peptides 21a, 21b, and 21c, respectively) (Fig. 4b, TABLE ONE). These mass increases correspond to: 47.90 Da, peptide 21a; 61.10 Da, peptide 21b; and 69.40 Da, peptide 21c. Two of the mass increments (Δ 47.90 and 69.40) are in close agreement with the LC-ESI/MS determination (49 ± 6 and 72 ± 6 Da); the nature of the 61.10-Da intermediate remains unexplained.TABLE ONESHV-1 and clavulanic acid inhibited SHV-1 β-lactamase peptides identified with LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS Twenty-four peptides were identified by LC-ESI/MS of SHV-1 β-lactamase.

Eighteen peptides were assigned by MALDI-TOF/MS of SHV-1 β-lactamase and 22 peptides were identified with SHV-1 β-lactamase inactivated with clavulanate. The amino acid assignments were made using Protein Prospector software, based upon theoretical digestion with trypsin.

In the digests containing S130G and S130G inhibited by clavulanic acid, 24 peptides were also identified by LC-ESI/MS for S130G and 22 peptides were seen in the digest of S130G inactivated by clavulanate (TABLE TWO). By MALDI-TOF/MS, 18 peptides were assigned after digestion of the apo-S130G and 16 were assigned in the clavulanate-inhibited S130G β-lactamase. The expanded MALDI-TOF/MS of trypsin-digested S130G showed a decrease in digested fragments containing residues 66–73 (M + H, 988.40) and 62–73 (M + H, 1459.70) (Fig. 5, a and b). Taken together, these data are consistent with the observation that the modification sites of SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamase inactivated by clavulanate are primarily located between residues 66–73 and 62–73 of the SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamase (at the active site Ser70). A limitation here is the inability of MALDI-TOF/MS to demonstrate a corresponding increase in peptide signal intensity as with SHV-1 inactivated with clavulanate (Fig. 4, a and b).TABLE TWOS130G β-lactamase and clavulanate inhibited S130G β-lactamase peptides identified with LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS For S130G, 24 peptides were identified and mass determined by LC-ESI/MS. When S130G β-lactamase is inactivated by clavulanate, 22 peptides are identified by LC-ESI/MS. Eighteen peptides were assigned by MALDI-TOF/MS. When S130G is inactivated by clavulanate, 16 peptides were identified. The amino acid assignments were made as in Table I.

Fisher J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20Bush K. Macalintal C. Rasmussen B.A. Lee V.J. Yang Y. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 37: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This peak was noticeably delayed when a similar concentration of S130G β-lactamase was inactivated with clavulanate (Fig. 6, a and b). The peak absorption at 280 nm in the clavulanate inactivation of SHV-1 occurred at 15 min and diminished slightly by 60 min. For S130G β-lactamase, the peak absorption at 280 nm occurred at 60 min. Concomitant with changes observed at 280 nm, we noted spectral changes at 227 nm that followed a different pattern. We observed that the 227-nm peak absorbance was maximal at 12 s and decreased during the next 60 min for the SHV-1 β-lactamase (Fig. 6a). The 227-nm peak was not prominent in the UV difference spectra of the S130G enzyme inactivated by clavulanate (Fig. 6b). Measurement of residual activity indicated that there is some recovery of reactivity when a 20:1 I:E ratio of clavulanate inactivates SHV-1 (38 to 46%) (Fig. 7). In contrast, no recovery was seen with the inactivation of S130G with clavulanate during this time period. Insights into the mechanism of inactivation of SHV-1 and S130G β-Lactamases by Clavulanate—Under these conditions, the inactivation of the inhibitor-susceptible SHV-1 enzyme by clavulanate yielded different intermediates than we observed with tazobactam (18Pagan-Rodriguez D.

In distinction, only a single adduct is found when S130G β-lactamase is inactivated by clavulanate under these conditions. This was evident using LC-ESI/MS and MALDI-TOF/MS. Interpretation of these data in light of established paradigms allows us to propose the following contrasting mechanisms to explain the pathway to inactivation of SHV-1 and S130G β-lactamase by clavulanate (21Brown R.P. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Yang Y. Janota K. Tabei K. Huang N. Siegel M.M. Lin Y.I. Rasmussen B.A. Shlaes D.M. J.

In the case of SHV-1 β-lactamase inactivated by clavulanate, the Ser70-OH of SHV-1 attacks the carbon of the carbonyl group in theβ-lactam ring (Fig. 8). Thisleadstotheacyl-enzyme4thatundergoesfurtherreactionto5togenerate a linear imine species 6 (highlighted in red) after oxonium ring opening and departure of the oxygen from C-5. This imine proceeds next to a cis- and trans-enamine (β-aminocrylate), 7 and 11, via rearrangement. Based upon earlier studies, we propose that the absorption peak at 280 nm represents isomerizationtothetrans-enamine(cis-enaminepeakisatλ =295nm,trans-enamineat λ = 280) (24Cartwright S.J. Coulson A.F. Nature. 1979; 278: 360-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Chen C.C. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Formation of the trans-enamine is favored because it relieves the strain imposed upon the first and fourth atoms defining the cis-double bond, the carbonyl oxygen atom (25Chen C.C. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). From the intermediate 6, an aldehyde can also be formed 13 (Δ+70). This aldehyde can be hydrated to 14 (Δ+88). Alternatively, 13 may react with Ser130-OH to yield the putative “bridged species,” 15 (Δ+52) by proceeding through a hemiacetal 13a (21Brown R.P. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Intermediate 16 is next formed with hydration of the bridged species. Intermediate 16 would be reminiscent of the intermediate seen in the inactivation of SHV-1 by tazobactam. As shown, the decarboxylated imine 12a (Δ+156) can tautomerize to 12b, and be hydrated to two different intermediates, 12c and 12d (Δ+174). Hydration of 12d yields 13 (the aldehyde) directly. In an alternative path, the cis-enamine 7 may decarboxylate to form 8. This could be assisted by an active site Lys. The decarboxylated cis-enamine can exist in equilibrium with the decarboxylated imine 9. Alternatively, the decarboxylated imine can be generated from the enolate 6a. If an active site Lys would accept the -CO2 (Δ+44) and an aldehyde is formed (Δ+70), we would account for the Δ+113 ± 6 adduct. The intermediate 10 (aldehyde at Ser70 with a carbamylated Lys) could be formed by this route. These pathways account for the intermediates seen in our LC-ESI/MS studies (highlighted in blue, Fig. 8). In interpreting the observed molecular masses, the acylation of the β-lactam ring results in a mass increase of 199 Da and decarboxylation reduces the adduct mass by 44 Da. No other facile fragmentation exists, except for hydrolysis of the imine forms (9 or 12a). This hydrolysis reduces the adduct mass to that of the aldehyde (Δ+70) or its hydrate (Δ+88). The observed Δ of 113 ± 6 cannot be explained by a known chemical fragmentation, but could result from the presence of a carbamylated Lys in combination with the aldehyde (10Saves I.

We are cautious about this suggestion because active site Lys may be mostly protonated at pH 7.4. However, if the pKa of this Lys is attenuated, it is possible that the unprotonated form of Lys in solution (-NH2) can accept a CO2 group. Experiments are underway to explore this possibility. Our understanding of the S130G atomic structure indicates that Ser at amino acid position 130 is not essential for enzyme inactivation (15Helfand M.S. Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Hujer K.M. Anderson V.E.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14111-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This unorthodox consideration is fundamental to understanding the interaction of S130G with clavulanate. We propose that the pathway followed by S130G mimics SHV-1. After the acylenzyme is formed, 4, and proceeds to the imine, 6, fragmentation results and the aldehyde is formed, 13. This fragmentation is the consequence of the recruited water molecule that serves to rehydrate the active site. In addition to the proposed mechanism of inactivation of S130G with tazobactam, the water in the active site may directly attack the acyclic imine form of clavulanate (18Pagan-Rodriguez D. Zhou X. Simmons R. Bethel C.R. Hujer A.M. Helfand M.S. Jin Z. Guo B. Anderson V.E. Ng L.M. Bonomo R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19494-19501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The reduction of the 280 nm peak in the UV difference spectra suggests that the trans-enamine intermediate is either delayed or diminished in the S130G pathway. It has also not escaped our attention that the chromophore at 280 nm that occurs at 15 min is also within the generation time of E. coli and may represent a critical intermediate found in vivo. The structural changes resulting from the S130G substitution drive the pathway of inactivation of the inhibitor-resistant variant and either change or limit the intermediates formed. It is now clear that the path the inhibitor takes and affinity for the active site are important. The atomic structural details of the inactivation of class A β-lactamases with clavulanate are limited to the study of Staphylococcus aureus penicillinase, PC1 β-lactamase (25Chen C.C. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cryocrystallographic studies of PC1 β-lactamase, inactivated with clavulanate revealed two species, a cis-enamine and a decarboxylated trans-enamine as trapped intermediates in the active site (25Chen C.C. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our investigations highlight the importance of these two intermediates. Furthermore, the carbonyl oxygen at the ester group of the former species is poorly positioned in the oxyanion hole, a finding of significant importance. Intermediates further along the reaction pathway were not seen by Chen and Herzberg (25Chen C.C. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). One wonders if each class A β-lactamase possesses singular features that dictate the pathway to inactivation. Our finding of intermediates (Δ+113 and Δ+174 ± 6 by LC-ESI/MS and 61.1 Da by MALDI-TOF/MS) not seen when TEM-2 is inactivated by clavulanate suggests this may be true. The future development of novel β-lactamase inhibitors must build on the understanding of how amino acid changes alter catalysis. Our experiments support the notion that the clavulanic acid-resistant S130G β-lactamase follows a different branch of the normal inactivation pathway compared with wild type enzyme. In the case of the S130G β-lactamase, we assert that once the imine form of clavulanate is generated and is progressively hydrolyzed to the aldehyde, there is a lack of enzyme recovery. In contrast to this, the inhibitor-susceptible SHV-1 β-lactamase “enjoys the benefit” of multiple (reversible) intermediate species and regenerates some free enzyme. This apparent “paradox of inhibitor resistance” in class A β-lactamases has significant implications (11Swaren P. Golemi D. Cabantous S. Bulychev A. Maveyraud L. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9570-9576Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recovery of free β-lactamase in a bacterium or bacterial population possessing large amounts of SHV could affect susceptibility to β-lactamase inhibitors that have a rapid turnover (e.g. sulbactam), especially when cells are in a stationary phase. It is becoming clear that desirable qualities for an effective inhibitor include: permeability through the cell membrane, affinity for the active site of the target β-lactamase, formation of intermediates that trap the enzyme either in a “waiting room” or in a poorly hydrolysable form, displacement or elimination of a key water molecule, and prolonged time to enzyme recovery (27Nukaga M. Abe T. Venkatesan A.M. Mansour T.S. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13152-13159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2136806985,"One of the most intriguing features of the 90 glycoside hydrolase families (GHs) is the range of specificities displayed by different members of the same family, whereas the catalytic apparatus and mechanism are often invariant. Family GH26 predominantly comprises beta-1,4 mannanases; however, a bifunctional Clostridium thermocellum GH26 member (hereafter CtLic26A) displays a markedly different specificity. We show that CtLic26A is a lichenase, specific for mixed (Glcbeta1,4Glcbeta1,4Glcbeta1,3)n oligo- and polysaccharides, and displays no activity on manno-configured substrates or beta-1,4-linked homopolymers of glucose or xylose. The three-dimensional structure of the native form of CtLic26A has been solved at 1.50-A resolution, revealing a characteristic (beta/alpha)8 barrel with Glu-109 and Glu-222 acting as the catalytic acid/base and nucleophile in a double-displacement mechanism. The complex with the competitive inhibitor, Glc-beta-1,3-isofagomine (Ki 1 microm), at 1.60 A sheds light on substrate recognition in the -2 and -1 subsites and illuminates why the enzyme is specific for lichenan-based substrates. Hydrolysis of beta-mannosides by GH26 members is thought to proceed through transition states in the B2,5 (boat) conformation in which structural distinction of glucosides versus mannosides reflects not the configuration at C2 but the recognition of the pseudoaxial O3 of the B2,5 conformation. We suggest a different conformational itinerary for the GH26 enzymes active on gluco-configured substrates."

In addition, DEK appears to participate in multiple cellular processes, including transcriptional repression, mRNA processing, and chromatin remodeling. Sub-nuclear distribution of this protein, with the attendant functional ramifications, has remained a controversial topic. Here we report that DEK undergoes acetylation in vivo at lysine residues within the first 70 N-terminal amino acids. Acetylation of DEK decreases its affinity for DNA elements within the promoter, which is consistent with the involvement of DEK in transcriptional repression. Furthermore, deacetylase inhibition results in accumulation of DEK within interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), sub-nuclear structures that contain RNA processing factors. Overexpression of P/CAF acetylase drives DEK into IGCs, and addition of a newly developed, synthetic, cell-permeable P/CAF inhibitor blocks this movement. To our knowledge, this is the first reported example of acetylation playing a direct role in relocation of a protein to IGCs, and this may explain how DEK can function in multiple pathways that take place in distinct sub-nuclear compartments. These findings also suggest that DEK-associated malignancies and autoimmune diseases might be amenable to treatment with agents that alter acetylation.

Indeed, a gene profile analysis of 41 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia using quantitative real-time PCR showed that DEK is overexpressed in 98% of the cases (10Casas S. Nagy B. Elonen E.

Most recently, quantitative multiplex PCR was used to precisely map the focal region of genomic gain on chromosome 6p22 in bladder cancer cells (7Evans A.J. Gallie B.L. Jewett M.A. Pond G.R.

Genomic mapping data identified the dek gene as being centrally located within this minimal region, suggesting DEK as an important candidate for involvement in pathogenesis of bladder cancer. DEK does not belong to any characterized protein family, and sequence similarity with other factors is limited to the SAF (scaffold attachment factor) box (11Gohring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P.

Interestingly, DEK has been implicated in all three of these nuclear events. We have previously shown that DEK binds to the TG-rich peri-ets (pets) site from the human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) 1The abbreviations used are: HIV-2, human immunodeficiency virus, type 2; CBP, CREB-binding protein; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; P/CAF, p300/CBP-associated factor; IGC, interchromatin granule cluster; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TSA, trichostatin A; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; POD, protein oncogenic domain; Dde, N-[1(4,4-dimethyl 2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)-ethyl]; HDAC, histone deacetylase. promoter and that this binding is responsive to cellular signals (14Fu G.K.

Hilfinger J.M. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25804-25812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Subsequently, DEK has also been isolated in a complex containing both hDaxx and HDAC2, essential proteins involved in transcriptional repression (16Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Mientjes E.J. Iyengar R. Grosveld G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lending further support to the role of DEK in this process. In addition, DEK has been shown to play an active role in DNA and chromatin remodeling and to bind preferentially to supercoiled and four-way junction DNA (17Alexiadis V. Waldmann T. Andersen J. Mann M. Knippers R. Gruss C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1308-1312PubMed Google Scholar, 18Waldmann T. Eckerich C. Baack M. Gruss C. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 7003-7010Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Moreover, DEK has been found in complexes with a number of mRNA splicing and export factors and spliced transcripts themselves (20McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6860-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Although the direct role of DEK in the exon-exon junction complex, as originally proposed, remains controversial (22Reichert V.L. Le Hir H. Jurica M.S. Moore M.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2778-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 23Kataoka N. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7009-7013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), there is considerable evidence supporting its association with one or more SR proteins that function in pre-mRNA splicing through protein-protein interactions (20McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that separate steps along the pathway of gene expression are integrated (24Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 25Proudfoot N.J. Furger A. Dye M.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). As DEK has defied categorization as a single function protein, it is likely poised at the interface of multiple components of the gene expression pathway; however, this poses the question of how DEK participates in processes known to occur in separate sub-nuclear compartments. The majority of endogenous DEK is associated with chromatin and DNA, whereas only 10% of DEK is released with RNase treatment (26Kappes F. Burger K. Baack M. Fackelmayer F.O. Gruss C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26317-26323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, DEK has been found in association with RNA and RNA-processing factors by separate groups using multiple experimental approaches. One mechanism by which a single polypeptide can exhibit different properties is through post-translational modifications. Acetylation can modify protein function in a number of ways. The most well known mechanism is that of histone acetylation, which by altering the charge and size of particular lysine residues results in a loosened association with DNA and a subsequent increase in local gene expression (27Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). It has recently become clear that many transcription factors are acetylated, which often results in an enhancement of function (27Sterner D.E. Berger S.L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 435-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar, 28Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar).

Cell. 2000; 5: 745-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Here we report that DEK is acetylated in the cell, and in vitro it is a substrate for the acetyltransferases CBP (CREB-binding protein), p300, and P/CAF (p300/CBP-associated factor). Differential reactivity of full-length versus N-terminally truncated DEK to an antibody that specifically recognizes acetylated lysine residues suggests that DEK is acetylated within the first 70 amino acids and that these modifications may have important functional consequences. Indeed, we show that increased acetylation of DEK results in a significantly decreased affinity for DNA. In addition, we find that acetylation markedly alters the localization of DEK: inhibition of deacetylase activity triggers redistribution of DEK from a diffusely nuclear to a punctate pattern within the nuclear space. We show that this pattern results from the accumulation of DEK in structures known as nuclear speckles or interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs), which are well characterized sub-nuclear domains containing RNA-processing and transcription factors. Importantly, DEK can be driven into the IGCs by overexpression of P/CAF, but not CBP/p300, and this movement can be prevented by specifically blocking the activity of P/CAF with a newly developed, synthetic, cell-permeable inhibitor. Another group of investigators has observed that, in a small percentage of cells, DEK is found at a higher concentration in IGCs than in the nucleus at large (20McGarvey T. Rosonina E. McCracken S. Li Q. Arnaout R. Mientjes E. Nickerson J.A. Awrey D. Greenblatt J. Grosveld G. Blencowe B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Our finding both strengthens and explains their observation by revealing the particular condition that favors localization of DEK to the IGC, namely its acetylation by P/CAF. Although there have been several examples of post-translational modifications controlling the movement of proteins within the cell, this is the first reported example of acetylation playing a direct role in the relocation of a protein to the IGC. It seems that the degree of acetylation, and its regulation, allow DEK to function in multiple pathways that take place in distinct sub-nuclear compartments. Cell Culture and Transfection—T98G cells were purchased from ATCC and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. GFP-DEK was constructed as a fusion protein between DEK and an enhanced variant of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein. Primers with EcoRV (5′) and EcoRI (3′) restriction sites were designed for PCR-based subcloning of the dek coding region into the pGNVL3 mammalian GFP vector (gift of T. Glaser, University of Michigan). Cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of GFP-DEK, P/CAF, or CBP plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After transfection, cells were treated overnight with 1 μm TSA or 5 mm sodium butyrate, or left untreated, and fixed for immunocytochemistry on the following day. Alternatively, untransfected cells were treated overnight with 330 nm TSA or left untreated and fixed the following day. Construction of DEK-encoding Adenovirus—FLAG-tagged DEK was excised from pCMV-Tag1 (Stratagene) using HindIII and BamHI and introduced via those sites into the adenoviral shuttle plasmid pACCMVpLpA(-)loxP-SSP. This vector was linearized with SfiI, and the transgene was recombined into E1A/E1B-deficient adenovirus by the University of Michigan Vector Core. Virus was harvested from E1A/E1B-positive producer cells, purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation, and assayed for plaque-forming unit concentration. T98G cells were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 100 by incubation for 48 h followed by cell harvesting for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-DEK from transduced T98G cells was performed using agarose-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) by following the manufacturer's instructions with regards to cell lysis, incubation, and washing, and elution by competition with 3xFLAG peptide. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred from the gel to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked in 5% powdered milk, and probed with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (Sigma), or monoclonal anti-acetyllysine antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 (Cell Signaling Technologies) or monoclonal anti-DEK antibody (Biosciences), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) for chemiluminescent detection. Production of Recombinant His-DEK in Baculovirus—DEK coding sequence was subcloned into the pBacPAK-His3 vector for recombination into the baculovirus genome. Recombination, virus production, cell transduction and harvesting, and protein purification were performed as indicated in the manufacturers' instructions for the BacPAK Baculovirus Expression System (Clontech) and HIS-trap nickel-chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Protein Acetylation Assay—Recombinant His-DEK was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into acetylation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% glycerol). DEK was then incubated at 30 °C for 1 h with 50 μm [14C]acetyl-CoA (Amersham Biosciences), 10 mm sodium butyrate, and 50 nm of either CBP, p300, or P/CAF, which had been purified as previously described (39Kashanchi F.

Reactions were resolved by SDS-PAGE; gels were stained with Coomassie Blue reagent and dried. The 14C signal was detected using a phosphorimaging screen and FX phosphorimaging device (Bio-Rad). Dissociation Constant Measurements Using Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Dissociation constant titrations were conducted by incubating immunoprecipitated FLAG-DEK (10-fold on either side of the dissociation constant) with a 32P-end-labeled DNA probe (5 nm) (sense, 5′-TAT ACT TGG TCA GGG CGA ATT CTA ACT AAC AGA-3′) containing the pets site (bold letters (15Faulkner N.E.

The dependence of binding affinity on buffer ionic strength was assessed by performing a series of binding titrations as a function of NaCl concentration (85 mm to 350 mm). Bound and free DNA were separated by electrophoresis in a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (4%) at 170 V at 4 °C for 1 h in 1× TBE buffer (100 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.4). The gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen overnight, and the bands were quantified using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). The data were fit via nonlinear least-squares regression to the single-site binding isotherm: % free DNA = Kd, app/(Kd, app + [protein]). From the above equation, the apparent Kd corresponds to the protein concentration at which half the DNA is bound (40Revzin A. Concepts Biochem. 1990; 67: 749-753Google Scholar). Errors in Kd are the standard error based on a minimum of three trials. Immunocytochemistry—Three phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) washes were performed in between each of the following steps; when indicated, PBS washes contained 0.1% saponin. Cells were washed and fixed for 10 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were washed, blocked for at least 1 h with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS, rewashed with PBS/saponin, and incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal anti-SC35 (23 μg/ml; Sigma) in PBS/saponin. If cells were not transfected with GFP-DEK, then the incubation included polyclonal anti-DEK serum at a 1:200 dilution (gift of G. Grosveld). Cells were then rewashed in PBS/saponin and reblocked with goat serum in PBS/saponin at a 1:50 dilution for 1 h, followed by PBS/saponin washing and a 1-h incubation with Alexa fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (20 μg/ml; Molecular Probes) in PBS/saponin. If cells were not transfected with GFP-DEK, then incubation included Alexa fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (20 μg/ml; Molecular Probes). Cells were washed with PBS/saponin, refixed for 10 min, rewashed, and incubated with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 10 min, rewashed with PBS, and distilled water then dried overnight. Coverslips were mounted with Antifade A reagent (Molecular Probes), and images were captured with a Zeiss Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM 510, version 2.8 SPI). For staining of PODs, the procedure was identical except for the use of polyclonal rabbit anti-CBP as the primary antibody (10 μg/ml, Upstate Biotechnology), and Alexa fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (20 μg/ml, Molecular Probes). Preparation of H3-CoA-20-Tat and H3-(Ac)-20-Tat—H3-CoA-20-Tat (Ac-ARTKQTARKSTGGK(CoA)APRKQLYGRKKRRQRRR-OH) is a derivatized version of the synthetic P/CAF inhibitor H3-CoA-20, in which the C-terminal sequence ends in the 12 amino acid residues of the cell permeabilizing Tat sequence. H3-(Ac)-20-Tat, a control compound, differs from H3-CoA-20-Tat in that the CoA moiety is replaced by a hydrogen atom. These compounds were synthesized by the solid phase method on a Rainin PS3 peptide synthesizer using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy, analogous to the previously described method for H3-CoA-20 (41Lau O.D.

The epsilon amino group of the lysine residue that corresponds to Lys-14 of histone H3 was protected with the N-[1(4,4-dimethyl 2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl] (Dde) group whereas other Lys residues were protected with the t-butoxycarbonyl group. Following amino acid couplings and N-terminal acetylation, the Dde group was removed by mixing the fully protected peptide resin with 2% hydrazine in dimethylformamide for 3 h at room temperature. The peptide resin was then reacted with 5 equivalents of bromoacetic acid and 5 equivalents of diisopropylcarbodiimide for 16 h at room temperature (or acetic anhydride for 1 h for the control peptide). Peptides were cleaved from the resin with Reagent K (trifluoroacetic acid:phenol:H2O: thioanisole:ethanedithiol:triisopropylsilane (81.5:5:5:5:2.5:1)) for 4 h at room temperature and subsequently precipitated with ice-cold diethyl ether. Precipitates were collected by centrifugation (3000 rpm, 5 min), the supernatants discarded, and the pellets washed two times with cold diethyl ether (30 ml). Precipitated peptides were dissolved in 5 ml of water, flash-frozen, lyophilized, and purified by preparative reversed phase (C18) high-performance liquid chromatography using a gradient of H2O:CH3CN:0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The bromoacetylated peptide was conjugated with 2 equivalents of CoASH in a minimal volume of aqueous 0.5 m trimethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 8) for ∼16 h at room temperature, lyophilized, and purified initially by passage over anion exchange chromatography (Dowex 1 × 8–100) to remove excess CoASH followed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography in a gradient of H2O:CH3CN:0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were confirmed to be >95% pure by high-performance liquid chromatography, and their structural identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. The inhibitory properties of both peptides against P/CAF and p300 are shown in Table I.Table IInhibitory properties of H3-CoA-20-Tat and H3-Ac-20-Tat (control) conjugates against p300 and P/CAF These assays were carried out with recombinant human P/CAF and p300 as described previously (41Lau O.D.

Glioblastoma is one of several tumors that exhibit increased expression of DEK, as compared with its tissue of origin (2Kroes R.A. Jastrow A. McLone M.G. Yamamoto H. Colley P. Kersey D.S. Yong V.W. Mkrdichian E. Cerullo L. Leestma J. Moskal J.R. Cancer Lett. 2000; 156: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FLAG-DEK was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and separated by SDS-PAGE. Staining for total protein revealed that one major band is recovered in the immunoprecipitate at 48 kDa and a minor protein band at 35 kDa (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing has previously demonstrated that the 35-kDa band corresponds to a truncated form of DEK (amino acids 70–375) (5Sierakowska H. Williams K.R. Szer I.S. Szer W. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1993; 94: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Importantly, immunoprecipitated DEK is reactive with a monoclonal antibody that is specific for acetylated lysine residues (Fig. 1A, lane 4), suggesting that DEK is acetylated in the cell. Although full-length DEK is reactive with both a DEK-specific monoclonal antibody and the acetyllysine-specific antibody, the 35-kDa band is only reactive with the DEK-specific antibody (Fig. 1B, lane 1 versus lane 2). These data indicate that, of the 67 potential lysine residues within DEK, the acetylated lysine residue is 1 (or more) of the 7 that are within the first 70 amino acids. In vitro acetylation assays were used to determine whether DEK could serve as a substrate for the well characterized acetyltransferase proteins CBP, p300, and P/CAF. Fig. 1C indicates that all three enzymes acetylate recombinant DEK purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells. In the absence of an acetyltransferase enzyme, DEK remained unlabeled. Similar in vitro acetylation reactions using FLAG-DEK immunoprecipitated from T98G cells gave identical results (data not shown). These data suggest that acetylation is not occurring solely on the tag, because one recombinant protein is FLAG-tagged while the other is polyhistidine-tagged, and the His tag contains no lysines. These results also indicate that in mammalian cells there are available CBP/p300 and P/CAF acetylation sites within native DEK, which validates the use of deacetylase inhibitor treatment to shift the equilibrium toward more highly acetylated forms of the protein. To confirm that treatment with a deacetylase inhibitor alters the acetylation state of DEK in vivo, T98G glioblastoma cells were treated or mock-treated overnight with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (T"

JLP is a novel leucine zipper protein belonging to a family of scaffolding proteins that assemble JNK signaling modules. JLP is a proline-rich protein that contains two leucine zipper domains and a highly conserved C-terminal domain. We have identified kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) as a binding partner for the second leucine zipper domain of JLP using yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction domain of KLC1 was mapped to its tetratripeptide repeat, which contains a novel leucine zipper-like domain that is crucial for the interaction with JLP. Mutations of Leu-280, Leu-287, Val-294, and Leu-301 within this domain of KLC1 disrupted its ability to associate with JLP. Immunofluorescence studies showed that JLP and KLC1 co-localized in the cytoplasm and that the localization of JLP was dependent on its second leucine zipper. Ectopic expression of a dominant negative form of KLC1 resulted in the mislocalization of endogenous JLP. Moreover, the association between JLP and KLC1 occurred in vivo and was important in the formation of ternary complex with JNK1.

To respond properly to extracellular signals, eukaryotic cells have developed cascades of highly conserved protein kinases (MAPK 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; JLP, JNK-associated leucine zipper protein; JSAP-1, JNK/stress-activated protein kinase-associated protein-1; JIP, JNK interacting protein; LZI, first leucine zipper; LZII, second leucine zipper; KHC, kinesin heavy chain; KLC, kinesin light chain; TPR, tetratripeptide repeat; HA, hemagglutinin; RA, retinoic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase. (s) and their activating kinases), which form the central elements of signal transduction pathways that activate transcription factors in the nucleus and other effectors throughout the cell in response to environmental signals. The MAP kinase cascades have recently been shown to be regulated by scaffolding proteins, which organize signaling modules by forming large protein complexes composed of MAPKs and their upstream kinases. One such family of scaffolding proteins, known as JIPs, assemble the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling module. This family contains three members, termed JIP-1, JIP-2, and JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd. These proteins have been shown to directly associate with kinesins (1Bowman A.B. Kamal A. Ritchings B.W. Philp A.V. McGrail M. Gindhart J.G. Goldstein L.S.

Nature. 1985; 317: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 6Vale R.D. Reese T.S. Sheetz M.P. Cell. 1985; 42: 39-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar). Conventional kinesin, also known as kinesin-I or kinesin, is a heterotetramer of two kinesin heavy chains (KHCs) and two kinesin light chains (KLC). KHC is believed to have movement potential, whereas the KLCs are the link between the specific cargo proteins (7Goldstein L.S. Yang Z. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). KHC is composed of a catalytic motor domain, a neck linker and neck domains, and a stalk domain that is responsible for dimerization of the KHCs and association with KLC (8Diefenbach R.J. Mackay J.P. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16663-16670Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 9Verhey K.J. Lizotte D.L. Abramson T. Barenboim L. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Finally, the tail domain plays a role in the regulation of motor activity (10Cross R. Scholey J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 119-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). KLC contains two notable domains, an N-terminal α-helical heptad repeat region (coiled-coil domain) that associates with the KHC stalk and a C-terminal domain that consists of a series of six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs (9Verhey K.J. Lizotte D.L. Abramson T. Barenboim L. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1053-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). TPR motifs are degenerate repeats, often arranged in tandem to form protein-protein interaction domains (11Blatch G.L. Lassle M. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar, 12Gindhart Jr., J.G. Goldstein L.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 52-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that the TPR motifs of KLC interact with cargo proteins. In addition, it has also been demonstrated that the coiled tail of KHC can also provide a binding site for cargo proteins (2Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 7Goldstein L.S. Yang Z. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1477-1485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). JIP-1 and JIP-2, which are unrelated to JIP-3 by sequence homology, interact with the TPR motifs of KLC through their extreme C termini. Deletions or a point mutation (P704A or Y709A) within the C-terminal residues of JIP1 (PTEDIYLE) was sufficient to disrupt this association (2Verhey K.J. Meyer D. Deehan R. Blenis J. Schnapp B.J. Rapoport T.A. Margolis B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the interaction between JIP-1 and KLC1 was important for the proper cellular localization of JIP-1. In the neuronal cell line N1E 115, deletion or mutation of the KLC binding domain of JIP-1 led to inappropriate localization of JIP-1. Although the full-length JIP-1 localizes normally at the tips of neurites, deletion of its KLC binding domain caused it to be diffusely localized throughout the cell. Conversely, the expression of dominant negative kinesin constructs in differentiated neuronal cells caused the localization of endogenous JIP-1 protein to shift from the normal localization at the tips of the neuronal processes to throughout the cell. Because the C terminus of JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd bears no sequence similarity to those of JIP-1 and JIP-2, it is not surprising that the TPR of KLC1 does not interact with the C termini of these proteins. Rather, it is the coiled-coil/leucine zipper domain in the N terminus of Syd that directly associates with KLC1. However, the precise domain that contributes to the association between JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd with KLC1 has yet to be identified. Dominant negative forms of KLC1 have also been shown to cause mislocalization of JIP-3 in neuronal cells. Therefore, it is clear that proper localization of JIPs is dependent on their ability to associate with KLC1. We have recently described a new member of this scaffolding family of proteins called JLP (JNK-associated leucine zipper protein), which contains two leucine zipper domains (LZI and LZII), and Domain C that shares a high degree of homology with the Caenorhabditis elegans protein UNC-16. JLP is 69% homologous to the JNK scaffolding proteins JIP-3, JSAP1, and the Drosophila homologue Syd. Furthermore, an alternatively spliced variant of JLP has recently been described (4Kelkar N. Standen C.L. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Like other JIPs, JLP can assemble a three-tiered JNK signaling complex through the association of the upstream kinases MKK4 and MEKK3. However, it is unique from the other JIPs in that it has been demonstrated to interact with both JNK and p38MAPK. In addition, JLP can tether signaling proteins to transcription factors such as Myc and Max (14Lee C.M. Onesime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To gain more insight into the biological function of JLP, we sought to determine potential binding partners for the second leucine zipper of JLP (LZII). Using only the LZII as a bait, we screened a mouse brain cDNA library in a yeast two-hybrid system. These studies showed that KLC1 strongly associated with the LZII of JLP. Mapping studies revealed that JLP bound to the TPR motifs of KLC1, which was in accordance with previous studies pertaining to JIP-1, JIP-2, and JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd (1Bowman A.B. Kamal A. Ritchings B.W.

However, our studies also identified a novel protein-protein interaction domain within TPR that consists of a heptad repeat resembling a leucine zipper-like domain. A KLC1 protein containing point mutations within this domain hindered the ability of KLC1 to associate with JLP. Our results provide the first evidence of a leucine zipper-like domain in KLC1 that plays a role in the association between KLC and JLP. Interestingly, exogenous expression of the mutant JLP containing mutations in LZII or dominant negative form of KLC1 also resulted in the mislocalization of JLP, suggesting a role of motor proteins in the spatial regulation of signaling modules. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and cDNA Cloning—The cDNA encoding the LZII of JLP was generated using the following primers and subcloned into an EcoRI/BamHI-digested pNLX3 yeast expression vector: sense 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCGTGGAGAATCTCATACTG and antisense 5′-GAGAGAGGATCCTAAGTTCACAGCCGCCAGCTC. The construct was confirmed by sequence analysis, and the construct subsequently used as a bait for screening the mouse brain Matchmaker Yeast Two-Hybrid library (Clontech) according to manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids—The pSG5 plasmid encoding S-tagged JLPWT has been described previously (14Lee C.M. Onesime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Leucines in the heptad repeats of LZI were mutated to alanines using site-directed mutagenesis (16Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). Similarly, hydrophobic amino acids in the heptad repeats of LZII were mutated to alanines in the series of JLPLZII mutants: JLPLZII:1–2, JLPLZII:3–4, JLPLZII:5–6, JLPLZII:7–8, and JLPLZII:8–9 contained mutations in amino acids (399, 406), (413, 420), (427, 434), (441, 448) and (448, 455), respectively. All constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. LZIIWT and LZII mutants for yeast mating assays were generated by the following primers: sense 5′-GAGAGAGAATTCGTGGAGAATCTCATACTG and antisense 5′-AGAGAGGGATCCTCTGTTCTTGTCCTCCA. The DNA templates used were JLPWT, JLPLZII:1–2, JLPLZII:3–4, JLPLZII:5–6, JLPLZII:7–8, or JLPLZII:8–9. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI-digested pNLX3 vector. Full-length KLC1 was obtained using the following primers: sense 5′-AGAGAATTCGAATGTATGACAACATGTCC and antisense 5′-AGACTCGAGCTAGGCTTCCTCCCCTCCGTC. The PCR product was subsequently cloned into pACT-2 (Clontech) via its EcoR1 and Xho sites. The HA-KLC1 fusion cDNA from pACT-2 was released by BglII and cloned into pSG5 for mammalian expression. This strategy was used for cloning the deletion constructs of KLC1: for the coiled-coil domain, sense 5′-AGAGAATCCGAATGTATGACAACATGTCC and antisense 5′-GAGCTCGAGTGTCCTGGTTCGTCCTCGTCA; for the TPR domain, sense 5′-AGACGAATCCCAAATGACGAGGACGAACCAGGA and antisense 5′-AGACTCGAGCTAGGCTTCCTCCCCTCCGTC; for the TPR2 domain, sense 5′-AGACGAATCCATCCTGATGTTGCCAAACAGTTA and antisense 5′-AGACTCGAGCTAGGCTTCCTCCCCTCCGTC. GST-KLC1 was cloned using the following primers: sense 5′-ATCGGATCCATGTATGACAACATGTCC and antisense 5′-ATCGGATCCCTAGGCTTCCTCCCCTCC. The PCR product was cloned via engineered BamHI restriction sites of the primers into pEBG. Cell Culture and Transfection—African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and calf serum, respectively, in an incubator at 37 °C under humidified conditions and 5% CO2. COS-7 cells were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (17Warren T.G. Shields D. Cell. 1984; 39: 547-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation as described previously (18Ausubel E.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Association of Endogenous KLC1 and JLP and Ternary Complex Formation—NIH3T3 cells were lysed in the lysis buffer (PBS containing 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mg/ml protease inhibitors (apostatin, leupeptine, pepstatin)) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were mixed with control goat IgG or goat anti-KLC1 antibodies (Santa Cruz) at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein G was then added to the samples, and the incubation was continued at 4 °C for 1 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis using a rabbit anti-JLP antibody described previously (14Lee C.M.

For detection of ternary complex formation, the same procedures were followed with cell lysates prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged KLC1, S-tagged JLP, and JNK1. The JNK-S levels in the lysates and immunoprecipitates were quantified using the software MacBas. P19 Cell Neuronal Differentiation—The P19 clone was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) in 6% CO2 humidified chamber. To promote cellular differentiation, cells were cultured as aggregates in bacterial Petri dishes using media supplemented with 1 μm retinoic acid (RA) for 4 days. After 4 days, the cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and then transferred to tissue culture dishes in medium lacking RA. Arabinosidase C was added to inhibit cell proliferation and to enrich the differentiated population. Analysis of Protein-Protein Interactions in Vivo—Transfected COS-7 cells were harvested 48–72 h posttransfection and lysed in the association assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 5 μg/ml protease inhibitors (apostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin)). Clarified lysates were rotated for 1 h at 4 °C with S-protein-agarose (Novogen) or glutathione-agarose (Sigma), centrifuged, and washed three times with association buffer. The precipitates were the resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed with anti-HA, anti-GST, and anti-S antibodies (Santa Cruz) as described in the figure legends and visualized by the PerkinElmer Life Sciences enhanced chemiluminescence detection system. Immunofluorescence Studies—Cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with appropriate expression plasmids using the calcium phosphate method (18Ausubel E.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 9.1.4-9.1.11Google Scholar). Posttransfection, the cells were fixed by incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After an incubation with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 15 min, the coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies in PBS with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The primary antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal antibody to JLP and a mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope as described in the figure legends. Immunocomplexes were detected using Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse or fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Coverslips were mounted using the ProLong Antifade Kit (Molecular Probes) and examined by confocal microscopy. Retroviral Infection—The cDNAs encoding the HA-tagged wild-type, TPR1, and TPR2 mutants of KLC were subcloned into the pFBneo vector (Stratagene). The retroviral vectors were transfected into an amphotrophic packaging cell line derivative of BOSC 23 (19Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar) to prepare retroviral supernatants. The retroviral supernatants were harvested, centrifuged, and used to infect HFL-1 cells for three consecutive days in the presence of Polybrene (8 μg/ml). Identification of KLC1 as a JLP Interacting Protein—To gain an insight into the biological functions of JLP, we sought to identify potential binding partners of the LZII of JLP using a yeast two-hybrid screening (Fig. 1A). This approach resulted in the identification of a partial cDNA clone of KLC1 (missing 164 bp of the 5′-sequence) as a binding partner of JLP. To confirm the specificity of the interaction, the L40 yeast strain expressing this KLC1 clone was mated with the AMR70 yeast stain expressing LZII (bait), the LZII:3–4, LZI and LZI mutants, or Lamin C, which was used as a negative control. Yeast co-expressing KLC1 and each of the LZ constructs showed growth on -Leu/-Trp plates, whereas only yeast expressing KLC1 and LZII were able to grow on -Leu/-Trp/-His plates (Fig. 1B). This suggests that KLC1 associates specifically with LZII but not with LZI. Mutation of the LZII domain by replacing the third and fourth leucine residues with alanines disrupts the KLC1/LZII interaction. On average, six heptad repeats of leucines comprise a leucine zipper domain. However, a minimum of only four heptad repeats of leucines are required to make up a functional leucine zipper (20Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). LZII of JLP is unique in that it is relatively large; it contains nine heptad repeats of leucines with the exception of valine at the seventh position. This implies that more than one protein can potentially bind LZII of JLP at the same time. To gain an understanding of the nature of interaction between JLP and KLC1, we investigated the specificity within LZII that contributed to the association with KLC1. We systematically mutated the appropriate leucine and valine residues to alanines within LZII to disrupt the appropriate heptad repeats (Fig. 1A). We then tested whether these mutants were capable of interacting with KLC1 by performing yeast-mating experiments using one strain of yeast expressing KLC1 and another expressing LZII, LZII:1–2, LZII:3–4, LZII:5–6, LZII:7–8, or LZII:8–9. After mating, yeast strains expressing the wild-type JLPLZII and mutants JLPLZII:7–8 and LZII:8–9, but not the mutants JLPLZII:1–2, JLPLZII:3–4, and JLPLZII:5–6, were found grow on -Leu/-Trp/-His plates (Fig. 1C) indicating that mutations of any of the first six leucine residues abrogate the association between LZII of JLP and KLC1. These results demonstrate that the association between JLP and KLC1 is dependent on the first six heptad repeats within LZII of JLP. In Vivo Interaction of JLP and KLC1—To validate the results performed in yeast, we sought to determine the ability of full-length JLP and KLC1 to interact when co-expressed in eukaryotic cells. GST pull-down assays using lysates derived from COS-7 cells expressing JLP and KLC1 demonstrated that GST-KLC1 could precipitate JLPWT-HA, whereas the JLPLZII-HA mutant was unable to do so (Fig. 2A). In a reciprocal experiment, wild-type S-tagged JLP, but not the mutant JLPLZII:3–4, could precipitate KLC1 in pull-down experiments using S-protein-agarose (Fig. 2B). These results demonstrated that the association between JLP and KLC1 was dependent on LZII of JLP. Additional experiments were performed using the series of S-tagged JLPLZII mutants in conjunction with HA-KLC1 in COS-7 cells. The results of these experiments showed that although wild-type JLP, mutants JLPLZII:7–8, and JLPLZII:8–9 could precipitate KLC1, mutants JLPLZII:1–2, JLPLZII:3–4 and JLPLZII:5–6 failed to do so (Fig. 2C). These in vivo association studies in COS-7 cells corroborate the results obtained from the yeast mating assays and confirm that formation of the JLP-KLC1 complex is dependent on the first six heptad repeats within LZII of JLP (Fig. 2C). To determine the role of LZII (which associates with KLC1) in the subcellular localization of JLP, we expressed HA-tagged wild-type, LZI, and LZII mutants of JLP in NIH3T3 cells. The transfected cells were fixed, and the subcellular localization of the exogenous JLP proteins was analyzed by immunofluorescence using a specific antibody against the HA-tag. As described previously, wild-type JLP was mainly localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). No significant change in subcellular localization was observed when LZI was mutated, suggesting that LZI is not involved in the subcellular localization of JLP. However, when LZII was mutated, the JLP mutant was localized to distinct patched areas within the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D), in contrast to that observed with wild-type JLP. This indicates that LZII is important for the proper subcellular localization of JLP. Because LZII associates with KLC1, it is possible that KLC1 may be responsible for proper localization of JLP in the cytoplasm. Identification of a Novel Leucine Zipper-like Domain in KLC1—KLC1 contains an N-terminal α-helical domain (also known as the heptad repeat domain or coiled-coil domain) that associates with the KHC stalk and a C-terminal domain that consists of six TPR motifs (Fig. 3A). The TPR motifs are involved in protein-protein interactions and represent a link between cargo and microtubule. These TPR motifs of KLC1 have been shown to associate with JIP-1, JIP-2, JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd, and JIP-4, but the precise domain within KLC1 that contributes to the association has not yet been identified. To determine the precise domain of KLC1 that interacts with JLP, we generated several deletion mutants of KLC1 that encoded only the heptad repeat/coiled-coil domain, the TPR domain (TPR1) or the partial TPR domain (TPR2) (Fig. 3A). S-protein precipitation studies in COS-7 cells demonstrated that S-tagged JLPWT was only able to associate with full-length KLC1 and the TPR1 mutant (Fig. 3B). However, S-tagged JLPWT was not able to co-precipitate the coiled-coil domain or TPR2 mutants. This suggests that JLPWT binds to a region in KLC1 spanning from amino acids 181 to 331. Because the LZII of JLP was found to mediate the association between JLP and KLC1, we next searched for the presence of a leucine zipper-like motif within amino acid residues 181–331 of KLC1. This search revealed the presence of a peptide sequence at position 279–300 that contained four heptad repeats (Fig. 4A). Mutation of Leu-280, Leu-287, Val-294, and Leu-301 of KLC1 to alanine (HA-KLC1LZ) abolished its association with JLP (Fig. 4B). The results of this study revealed the presence of a novel “leucine zipper-like” domain in KLC1 that was essential for binding to LZII of JLP. These results also suggest that JLP and KLC1 may from heteromers via LZII of JLP and the leucine zipper-like domain of KLC1.Fig. 4Identification of a novel leucine zipper-like domain in KLC1. A, schematic representation of KLC depicting mutations to alanine at positions 280, 287, 294, and 301. B, wild-type HA-KLC1 or HA-KLC1LZ was expressed in COS-7 cells together with wild-type or mutants of S-tagged JLP as indicated. The cells were lysed and subjected to precipitation using S-protein-agarose. The precipitates were immunoblotted for associated proteins using anti-HA antibodies. Protein expression was detected with either anti-S or anti-HA antiserum.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Association of Endogenous KLC1 and JLP—To determine whether endogenous KLC1 and JLP could associate in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitations using cell lysates derived from NIH3T3 cells treated in the presence or absence of arsenite using control or anti-KLC1 antibodies, and subjected them to immunoblot analysis using a JLP-specific antiserum. Treatment with arsenite has been shown to stimulate the activities of JNK and p38MAPK (21Namgung U. Xia Z. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2001; 174: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, our studies showed that treatment of cells with arsenite results in the phosphorylation of JLP and its perinuclear localization (data not shown). The results presented in Fig. 5 showed that the anti-KLC1 antibody could specifically precipitate JLP, demonstrating that endogenous KLC1 and JLP associate in vivo. However, treatment with arsenite did not change the levels of JLP that are associated with KLC1 (Fig. 5). Role of LZII Domain of JLP in Subcellular Localization— The spatial organization of several cytoplasmic proteins has been shown to be dependent on their direct or indirect association with components of the cytoskeleton. KLC1 is one component that links cargo to motor proteins, which in turn are anchored on microtubules. Because our observations show that JLP associates with KLC1, we hypothesized that KLC1 was responsible for proper subcellular localization of JLP and that a dominant negative mutant of KLC1 (TPR1) could alter its subcellular localization. To address this question, we determined the subcellular distribution of JLP in human lung fibroblasts, HFL-1 (Fig. 6). The cells were infected with viral supernatants derived from packaging cells transfected with retroviral vectors expressing HA-tagged wild-type KLC1 and the TPR1 and TPR2 mutants shown in Fig. 3. The infected cells were then analyzed by immunofluorescence using a specific JLP antibody and an HA antibody to detect the endogenous JLP and KLC1 proteins, respectively. The results of this study showed that JLP was mainly distributed homogenously throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 6), which is consistent with our previously published results obtained in Swiss3T3 cells (14Lee C.M. Onesime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, wild-type KLC1 was also similarly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, suggesting that both proteins are localized in the same region of the cell (Fig. 6). In contrast, when the TPR1 mutant of KLC1 was expressed, it was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 6). This inappropriate localization of TPR1 resulted in the translocation of JLP to the nucleus. It is possible that TPR1 transported JLP into the nucleus because of its ability to bind JLP (Fig. 3). Similarly, when the TPR2 mutant was expressed, it was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 6). However, in this case, the mislocalization of TPR2 did not result in JLP being localized to the nucleus. This is likely because of the fact that TPR2 does not bind to JLP (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the proper subcellular localization of JLP depends on its interaction with KLC1. Ternary Complex Formation by JLP, JNK, and KLC1—We have previously demonstrated that JLP can regulate JNK signaling and that this phenomenon can be attributed to the ability of JLP to associate with JNK and to function as a scaffolding protein for the JNK signaling module (14Lee C.M. Onesime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that JLP, KLC1, and JNK form a complex, we expressed various combinations of HA-tagged KLC1, S-tagged JLP, and JNK1 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 7). Cell lysates derived from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a KLC1-specific antibody. Our results show that when JLP or JNK1 was expressed either individually or together in the absence of KLC1, neither protein was able to be immunoprecipitated. However, when JLP was co-expressed with KLC1, JLP could be co-immunoprecipitated using the KLC1 antibody; this result is in agreement with those shown in Fig. 2. Furthermore, when KLC1 and JNK1 were co-expressed, a small amount of JNK1 could also be co-immunoprecipitated with KLC1, which is clearly visible in the long exposure. This association was likely because of the tethering property of JLP toward KLC1 and JNK1 and is supported by the fact that greater levels of JNK1 are precipitated when exogenous JLP is co-expressed with KLC1 and JNK1 (Fig. 7). These results support the notion that JLP acts as a bridging molecule that mediates the formation of a ternary complex with KLC1 and JNK1 and rejects the notion that two independent binding events occur between JLP and KLC1, and JLP and JNK1. Induction of JLP and KLC1 Transcripts during Neuronal Differentiation—The observation that JLP and KLC1 are highly expressed in adult brain compared with other tissues (4Kelkar N. Standen C.L. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Rahman A. Friedman D.S. Goldstein L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15395-15403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggested that their expression might be induced during neuronal differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of JLP and KLC1 in the P19 cell model of neuronal differentiation in response to RA (Fig. 8A). A Northern blot analysis showed that both JLP and KLC1 were detected at low levels in proliferating P19 cells. However, when these cells were induced to differentiate, RNA levels of both JLP and KLC1 were increased as a function of time (Fig. 8B). Time course analysis indicated that JLP and KLC1 expression was not an early event following RA treatment. However, JLP and KLC1 expression was robust at day four following initiation of differentiation (Fig. 8B). The expression profiles of JLP and KLC1 are also similar at the protein level (Fig. 8C), and it is therefore likely that these proteins associate in neuronal cells as well. There are essentially two classes of scaffolding proteins that assemble the JNK signaling module. The first class is comprised of the SH3-motif containing proteins known as JIP-1 and JIP-2 and the second class includes JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd, JLP, and JIP-4, which contain leucine zipper motifs (4Kelkar N. Standen C.L. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J.

Besides their role as scaffolding proteins for the JNK signaling pathway, both classes of proteins also associate with kinesin motor proteins through KLC1. However, because of the variance in amino acid sequence between the two classes of proteins, it is not surprising that they associate with KLC1 TPRs through different domains. JIP-1 and JIP-2 bind to KLC1 TPRs through their extreme C termini. This is consistent with previous studies on TPR domain-containing proteins demonstrating that TPR domains recognize short sequences at the C terminus of their partner protein (28Gatto Jr., G.J. Geisbrecht B.V. Gould S.J. Berg J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, the TPRs of KLC1 associate with the internal sequences of the JNK scaffolding proteins, JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd and JIP-4 (1Bowman A.B. Kamal A. Ritchings B.W. Philp A.V. McGrail M. Gindhart J.G. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 4Kelkar N. Standen C.L. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). JLP is a leucine zipper-containing scaffolding protein that also associates with JNK and KLC1. Sequence comparison shows that it exhibits 69% homology to JIP-3/JSAP-1/Syd, with an exceptionally high homology in the two coiled-coil domains (leucine zipper domains) and Domain C. Therefore, it was not surprising that LZII of JLP was shown to associate with KLC1 when it was used as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening. This result is consistent with the finding that the GST-KLC1 was only able to pull down the recombinant N terminus of Syd and not the C terminus (1Bowman A.B. Kamal A. Ritchings B.W. Philp A.V. McGrail M. Gindhart J.G. Goldstein L.S. Cell. 2000; 103: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the alternative splicing variant of JLP, JIP-4, interacts with the TPR of KLC1 via a region containing the leucine zipper (4Kelkar N. Standen C.L. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2733-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our results are therefore consistent with the idea that the domains of JIP proteins that interact with KLC1 are distinct and that the binding of each JIP protein to kinesin is mediated by the TPR region of kinesin light chain. A leucine zipper consists of a stretch of amino acids with a leucine residue in every seventh position in a coiled-coil α-helical structure (20Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). These leucine residues are important for the leucine zipper to form a dimer with the leucine zipper of another polypeptide. Our results provide definitive evidence that the heptad repeats of leucine residues within LZII of JLP are required for the association with KLC1 both in yeast and in mammalian cells (Figs. 1 and 2). However, to date, there have been no prior reports that identified leucine zipper-like domains in the TPRs of KLC1. We have scanned the peptide sequence of the KLC1 TPRs and identified such a domain. One stretch of amino acids contained four heptad repeats of leucine residues, with the exception of a valine in the third heptad. A KLC1 construct containing the mutations L280A, L287A, V294A, and L301A was unable to associate with JLP in mammalian cells (Fig. 4). These experiments not only show an association between JLP and KLC1 but also provide evidence for a novel leucine zipper-like domain in KLC1 that is important for the association with JLP. The connection between motor proteins and signaling pathways has many implications. It has been reported that KLC1 is the link between kinesin motor proteins and JIPs and that the significance of this complex is to mediate proper cellular localization (26Ito M. Yoshioka K. Akechi M. Yamashita S. Takamatsu N. Sugiyama K. Hibi M. Nakabeppu Y. Shiba T. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7539-7548Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the formation of a ternary complex consisting of JLP, KLC1, and JNK1 (Fig. 7) suggests that JLP serves as a link between the kinesin motor proteins and their cargo JNK signaling complex proteins (Fig. 9). Interestingly, accumulation of JLP in the perinuclear region results when cells are exposed to stress-inducing agents such as arsenite or UV radiation (14Lee C.M. Onesime D. Reddy C.D. Dhanasekaran N. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14189-14194Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This may represent a mechanism by which JLP can transduce signals from the periphery of the cell to the nucleus. Alternatively, scaffolding proteins could allow signaling pathways to regulate motor activity. For example, the association of kinesin with the JIPs could enable the JNK pathway to induce phosphorylation of kinesin itself or an associated protein, thereby activating the motor at the point of departure and/or inactivating it at the point of destination (Fig. 9). We and others have demonstrated that a dominant negative mutant of kinesin (DN kinesin) can alter the proper localization of JIPs and JLP. However, it is still unresolved as to whether DN kinesin can alter the localization of JNK. In addition, it would be interesting to determine whether DN kinesin can alter the activation of JNK. It has been speculated that there is a connection between kinesin, JNK signaling, and neurogenesis. For example mice lacking the ubiquitously expressed conventional kinesin gene kif5b and mice lacking the jnk1 and jnk2 genes exhibit embryonic lethality with severe defects in early brain development (29Kuan C.Y. Yang D.D. Samanta Roy D.R. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Although biochemical studies and transfection assays have demonstrated that putative JNK scaffold proteins can regulate JNK activation in cultured cells, the function of these scaffold proteins in vivo has not been extensively established. One such in vivo study involves genetic alterations in the syd gene, the Drosophila homologue of JIP-3, and JSAP. Mutations in syd interfered with axonal transport processes and resulted in massive accumulation of anterograde and retrograde membranous axonal cargo within the axons of the larval segmental nerves. Thus, proper Syd function is required for efficient axonal transport in Drosophila, and the Syd mutant phenotypes are nearly indistinguishable from mutants lacking the anterograde axonal transport motor kinesin-1 (1Bowman A.B.

https://openalex.org/W2143318242,"Protein interactions critical to DNA repair and cell cycle control systems are often coordinated by modules that belong to a superfamily of structurally conserved BRCT domains. Because the mechanisms of BRCT interactions and their significance are not well understood, we sought to define the affinity and specificity of those BRCT modules that orchestrate base excision repair and single-strand break repair. Common to these pathways is the essential XRCC1 DNA repair protein, which interacts with at least nine other proteins and DNA.

The BRCT family comprises over 100 members that share predicted (1Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 2Callebaut I.

Proteins can contain from one to eight divergent BRCT domains, which are present in DNA repair proteins such as DNA ligase III, poly(ADP-ribosyl) transferase 1 (ADPRT1 or PARP1), and the x-ray cross complementation group 1 protein (XRCC1). Human XRCC1 protein is involved in two interconnected DNA repair pathways, base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR). The former consists of two sub-pathways: a short-patch pathway that replaces 1 nucleotide and a long-patch pathway that replaces 2-15 nucleotides (7Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Bogenhagen D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6187-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 8Frosina G. Fortini P. Rossi O. Carrozzino F. Raspaglio G. Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Abbondandolo A. Dogliotti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9573-9578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In the BER and SSBR pathways, XRCC1 interacts directly with at least seven other proteins. In short-patch BER, XRCC1 interacts with 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) (9Marsin S. Vidal A.E. Sossou M. Menissier-de Murcia J. Le Page F. Boiteux S. de Murcia G. Radicella J.P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In long-patch BER, XRCC1 interacts with some of the same proteins, as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (14Fan J. Otterlei M. Wong H.K. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson 3rd, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2193-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In SSBR, XRCC1 interacts with PARP1 (11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P.

Weinfeld M. Caldecott K.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 107-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The regions of XRCC1 that are involved in these various interactions are depicted in Fig. 1A. Some of the interaction partners of XRCC1 also interact with each other, mediating triangular interactions, for example among Ape1, Polβ, and XRCC1. In addition, many indirect physical interactions exist, for example those of XRCC1 with binding partners of Ape1 (17Hill J.W. Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Mitra S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 18Parker A. Gu Y. Mahoney W. Lee S.H. Singh K.K. Lu A.L. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 743-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Recently, XRCC1 has been shown to interact with and be stabilized by aprataxin, a protein associated with ataxia-oculomotor apraxia, which also may be involved in SSBR (21Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M.C. Taylor A.M. Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 22Luo H. Chan D.W. Yang T.

XRCC1 was found to interact with tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase, a protein associated with the neurodegenerative disease spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy 1 (SCAN1) (23Plo I. Liao Z.Y. Barcelo J.M. Kohlhagen G. Caldecott K.W. Weinfeld M. Pommier Y. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1087-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the significance of this interaction is not understood, a functional connection to DNA metabolism is preserved. To add to the complexity of the multiple interactions of XRCC1, it is known to bind single strand, nick, and gap DNA (24Marintchev A. Robertson A. Dimitriadis E.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2049-2059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and double strand DNA ends (25Yamane K. Katayama E. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 678-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Through the physical interactions of XRCC1, the activity of some of its enzymatic partners is stimulated. For example, in short-patch BER, XRCC1 activates OGG1 (9Marsin S. Vidal A.E. Sossou M. Menissier-de Murcia J. Le Page F. Boiteux S. de Murcia G. Radicella J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44068-44074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and Ape1 (26Vidal A.E. Hickson I.D. Boiteux S. Radicella J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the SSBR pathway, XRCC1 stimulates polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (16Whitehouse C.J. Taylor R.M. Thistlethwaite A. Zhang H. Karimi-Busheri F. Lasko D.D. Weinfeld M. Caldecott K.W. Cell. 2001; 104: 107-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In both pathways, XRCC1 enhances LigIIIα activity through stabilization of its protein levels (13Caldecott K.W. McKeown C.K. Tucker J.D. Ljungquist S. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 68-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the different types of protein interactions orchestrated by XRCC1, there is the potential for one or more large multicomponent complexes to operate in these overlapping DNA repair pathways. To gain a better understanding of the specific complexes involved in these pathways, more extensive, quantitative studies of the relevant complexes are needed. The interactions of XRCC1 with PARP1 and LigIIIα are mediated through BRCT domains from each protein (Fig. 1B). The first BRCT domain of XRCC1 (designated X1BRCTa) associates with the BRCT domain from PARP1 (15Masson M. Niedergang C. Schreiber V. Muller S. Menissier-de Murcia J. de Murcia G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3563-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The second, C-terminal BRCT domain of XRCC1 (X1BRCTb) associates with the BRCT domain from LigIIIα (L3BRCT) (27Nash R.A. Caldecott K.W. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5207-5211Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Taylor R.M. Wickstead B. Cronin S. Caldecott K.W. Curr.

Purif. 1999; 16: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that XRCC1 functions as a scaffold by using its N-terminal domain (X1NTD), and its two BRCT domains to tether catalytically active DNA repair proteins into multiprotein complexes (11Caldecott K.W. Aoufouchi S. Johnson P. Shall S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4387-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Alternatively, XRCC1 could serve as an auxiliary protein at one or more steps in a series of handoff reactions, as has been proposed for the earlier steps of BER (30Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Slupphaug G. Bharati S. Krokan H.E. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5214-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 31Hazra T.K. Hill J.W. Izumi T. Mitra S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The interactions of X1NTD have been characterized quantitatively using biophysical methods (24Marintchev A. Robertson A. Dimitriadis E.K. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2049-2059Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other XRCC1 interactions, including its BRCT domain-mediated interactions with LigIIIα and PARP1, have been assessed using biochemical approaches (32Dulic A. Bates P.A. Zhang X. Martin S.R. Freemont P.S. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5906-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 33Thornton K.H. Krishnan V.V. West M.G. Popham J. Ramirez M. Thelen M.P. Cosman M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Recent attention has focused on the role of BRCT domains as phosphopeptide-binding modules. The BRCT domain-containing proteins BRCA1, Fcp1, and TopBP1 proteins bound only the phosphorylated forms of their protein targets (34Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Thirteen additional BRCT domains exhibited higher affinity for phosphopeptides than non-phosphorylated peptide controls (34Yu X. Chini C.C. He M. Mer G. Chen J. Science. 2003; 302: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Moreover, BRCA1 and Pax transactivation domain-interacting protein bound phosphorylated peptides from a library comprising ATM/ATR phosphorylation consensus sequences (35Manke I.A. Lowery D.M. Nguyen A. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 302: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Although phosphopeptide binding may be common among BRCT domains, there is considerable sequence divergence among these proteins. Therefore, phosphorylation-dependent interactions may not be common to all BRCT domains (reviewed in Ref. 6Glover J.N.M. Williams R.S. Lee M.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Indeed, the structures of the 53BP1·p53 complex and the DNA ligase IV·XRCC4 complex exhibit no phosphoprotein-dependent interactions. There is no evidence to indicate that phosphorylation is required for BRCT domain interactions in either BER or SSBR. Because BRCT domains are widespread in nature yet appear to have specific cellular binding partners, we are interested in defining the molecular details of the affinity and specificity of BRCT interactions involving XRCC1. Specifically, if structurally similar BRCT domains interact through common structural motifs and both self- and heteromeric interactions are observed, what dictates the specificity of their interactions? We sought to address this question using differential affinity tagging of the four BRCT domains from XRCC1, LigIIIα, and PARP1, which enabled biochemical interaction studies among these protein domains. Cloning—Human BRCT domain-encoding open reading frames were subcloned into expression plasmids using a strategy employing PCR amplification, followed by restriction digestion and ligation. All of the expression plasmid constructs used are summarized in Table I. Sub-cloning of the XRCC1 BRCTb domain (X1BRCTb) comprising residues 533-633 (29Thornton K. Forstner M. Shen M.R. West M.G. Rupp B. Thelen M.P. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and the LigIIIα BRCT domain (L3BRCT) comprising residues 838-932 (33Thornton K.H. Krishnan V.V. West M.G. Popham J. Ramirez M. Thelen M.P. Cosman M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) was reported previously. The PARP1 BRCT domain (PBRCT) was subcloned into pET28a to yield an N-terminally His6-T7 epitope-tagged protein. The XRCC1 BRCTa domain (X1BRCTa) was subcloned into pET41a to generate an N-terminal GST-His6 fusion protein. BRCT constructs are named based on previous conventions (33Thornton K.H. Krishnan V.V. West M.G. Popham J. Ramirez M. Thelen M.P. Cosman M. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) according to their N-terminal fusion, if present, and an abbreviation for the domain (Table I).

Terrific Broth (Sigma) containing the appropriate antibiotic was inoculated with 0.02 volume of an overnight starter culture. Large-scale (1.0-1.5 liter) cultures were grown to an optical density (A600) of 0.5 and were induced for 16 h at 22 °C with 0.001 m β-d-isopropylthiogalactoside. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 5,000 × g and were resuspended in 30 ml of the appropriate column buffer (see below). Cells were lysed at >15,000 p.s.i. in an EmulsiFlex C5 cell disruptor (Avestin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation twice at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C followed by filtration (0.45-μm pore size) to remove particulate matter. The non-tagged X1BRCTb domain was purified by anion exchange chromatography using Q-Sepharose (Q Trap, Amersham Biosciences) and size exclusion chromatography using Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) according to published procedures (29Thornton K. Forstner M. Shen M.R. West M.G. Rupp B. Thelen M.P. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 16: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GST-L3BRCT and GST-His6-X1BRCTa were purified using 5 ml glutathione-Sepharose (GSTrap FF) columns (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 25 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (0.043 m Na2HP04, 0.021 m NaH2PO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and 25 ml of clarified crude lysate were bound. The column was washed with 100 ml of PBS, and the bound protein was eluted with GST elution buffer (0.05 m Tris·HCl, 0.01 m glutathione, reduced form (GSH), pH 8.0). The His6-T7-PARP1 BRCT domain was purified using a 5-ml HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Biosciences) charged with Ni2+. The column was equilibrated with 25 ml of Ni2+ lysis buffer (0.05 m NaH2P04, 5% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.001 m NaN3, pH 8.0) containing 0.01 m imidazole, 25 ml of clarified crude lysate were bound, the column was washed with 100 ml of Ni2+ lysis buffer containing 0.02 m imidazole, and the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0.02-0.5 m imidazole over a volume of 100 ml. Monoclonal Antibody Production—Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 94 used in this study was raised against the recombinant human DNA Ligase IIIα BRCT domain (L3BRCT). This domain was expressed as a GST fusion protein in E. coli and purified by GSTrap chromatography. The purified fusion protein was used as the immunogen for mAb production using procedures described previously (36Kumaresan K.R. Hwang M. Thelen M.P. Lambert M.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 890-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to screen the growing hybridoma for GST-L3BRCT- and GST-specific antibodies, and clones positive for GST-L3BRCT (but negative for GST) were picked for secondary screening by immunoblotting. L3BRCT Immunoprecipitation and Co-immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation experiments, 2-10 μg of purified protein were incubated with 20 μg of anti-L3BRCT mAb 94 at 4 °C for 1 h. 50 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose 6MB (Sigma) was equilibrated in TNEN buffer (0.05 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.005 m EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and added to the protein mixture, which was incubated for an additional 2 h. The suspension was centrifuged (500 × g for 5 min at 22 °C), washed three times with 0.5 ml of TNEN, and resuspended in 25 μl of SDS sample loading buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, were briefly centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant was loaded onto a 4-20% acrylamide gradient gel and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. To probe X1BRCTb·L3BRCT complex formation, purified GST-L3BRCT (10 μg) was mixed with X1BRCTb (2 μg) in a total volume of 300 μl using TNEN as a diluent. Incubations with antibody and protein A-Sepharose and electrophoresis were performed as described above. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the blot was cut in half horizontally just above the 21-kDa marker position. The top half was probed with anti-GST Ab (Amersham Biosciences, 1:5,000) and the bottom half was probed with anti-XRCC1 polyclonal Ab (37Shen M.R. Zdzienicka M.Z. Mohrenweiser H. Thompson L.H. Thelen M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The blot was washed and further incubated with secondary anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:7,500) and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Sigma, 1:2,000). The immunoblot was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to autoradiographic film. In experiments to test the effect of order of addition (protein, protein, then mAb versus protein, mAb, then protein), the first two components were mixed first, incubated for 30 min on ice, and the third component was added last. Size Exclusion Chromatography—SEC was carried out using an Akta fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with Superdex 200 or 75 HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The columns were equilibrated and run at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using GF buffer (0.01 m NaH2P04, 0.05 m NaCl, 5% glycerol). X1BRCTb protein was also run in GF buffer containing 1 m NaCl. Estimation of molecular mass was based on a least-squares fit of log10 Mr versus Kav for seven proteins, comprising Gel Filtration Standards (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin (Sigma) monomer and dimer. These seven proteins fit the linear equation, Kav = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo), where Ve = elution volume, Vo = void volume, and Vt = total volume of the Superdex column, with an R2 value of 0.98. SEC with on-line multiangle light scattering (MALS) was performed on an Amersham Biosciences fast protein liquid chromatography system using a KW-804 (Shodex) or a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences) column. MALS measurements were performed using a MiniDAWN in-line detector (Wyatt Technology). Protein concentration was monitored using a UV monitor at 280 nm and a refractive index detector at 690 nm (Optilab DSP, Wyatt Technology). The detectors were plumbed in the order: UV, RI, then MALS. SEC-MALS experiments employed MALS buffer (0.02 m NaPO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.001 m EDTA, pH 7.0) and a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Data were analyzed using Astra software (Wyatt Technology) using the refractive index detector and a refractive index increment (dn/dc) value of 0.185 ml/g. Fusion-protein Capture Experiments—Interacting proteins (or controls) were combined using 0.5 mg of the GST fusion proteins and equimolar partner proteins at a total concentration of 0.13 mg/ml in binding buffer (0.05 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.05 m NaCl). Complexes were formed by mixing two proteins and incubating on ice for 30 min. Putative complexes were bound to 1 ml GSTrap, HiTrap-Ni2+, or T7 tag antibody (Novagen) columns. For all resin types, the columns were washed with 5 ml of interaction buffer (0.05 m Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 0.02 m imidazole) plus 0.05 m NaCl. The bound complexes were challenged with solutions of increasing ionic strength (interaction buffer containing 0.05 m, 0.15 m, 0.5 m, or 1.5 m NaCl) in 4.5-ml aliquots and 1.5-ml fractions were collected. Bound proteins were eluted with 4.5 ml of interaction buffer plus 0.05 m NaCl containing 0.01 m GSH, 0.5 m imidazole, or the supplied elution buffer for the T7 tag antibody column. Relevant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on NuPAGE 4-12% acrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen) that were run in NuPAGE MES buffer (Invitrogen). Surface Plasmon Resonance—The affinity of X1BRCTb for its cognate partner L3BRCT was measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with a BIAcore X instrument. The GST-L3BRCT ligand was immobilized onto an anti-GST antibody (Ab) chip. An anti-GST Ab (BIAcore) was first amine-coupled to a CM-5 chip (BIAcore) to a density of 10,000 response units. The GST-L3BRCT ligand was diluted to 1 ng/μl in HBS-P buffer (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and injected over one flow cell of the anti-GST Ab-coated sensor chip at 5 μl/min until 300 response units of GST-L3BRCT was immobilized. A second flow cell served as a reference to account for bulk-shift responses and minor, nonspecific interactions with the anti-GST Ab, which was subtracted from the binding response. X1BRCTb was buffer exchanged into HBS-P using a Micro Bio-spin P6 (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Binding was measured for six concentrations of X1BRCTb analyte (0.05, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 μm), which were injected for 3 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. After measuring the off-rates for 2 min for each analyte injection, complete regeneration of the surface was achieved with one 60-s injection of 2 m NaCl and two 30-s injections of 0.05% SDS. The interaction affinity, as described by the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), was determined globally by fitting to the kinetic simultaneous ka/kd model, first testing a model of equimolar stoichiometry. The steady-state affinity was determined from curve fitting to a plot of the equilibrium response unit (Req) values, derived from sensorgrams fitted locally, against the concentrations of analyte. Construction of the Heterotetrameric BRCT Model—The heterotetrameric BRCT model was generated based on the known X1BRCTb (38Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Hainbucher K. Nash R.A. Sternberg M.J. Lindahl T. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6404-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and L3BRCT structures (4Krishnan V.V. Thornton K.H. Thelen M.P. Cosman M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13158-13166Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as follows. The relevant X1BRCTb dimerization interface was inferred from structural (38Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I. Hainbucher K. Nash R.A. Sternberg M.J. Lindahl T. Freemont P.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6404-6411Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and mutagenesis data (32Dulic A.

The non-crystallographic symmetry operator was used to generate the second copy of X1BRCTb, which interacts with the first through α helix 1. The interface of X1BRCTb that interacts with LigIIIα was inferred from additional mutagenesis studies (28Taylor R.M. Wickstead B. Cronin S. Caldecott K.W. Curr.

Crystallographic symmetry operators were used to generate the third and fourth copies of X1BRCTb, which associate through connecting loop 2 of the first two copies. The L3BRCT structure was then superimposed (root mean square deviation, 2.2 Å) on the third and fourth copies of X1BRCTb using SuperPose (39Maiti R. Van Domselaar G.H. Zhang H. Wishart D.S.

https://openalex.org/W2113270638,"Actinomadura sp. R39 produces an exocellular DD-peptidase/penicillin-binding protein (PBP) whose primary structure is similar to that of Escherichia coli PBP4. It is characterized by a high β-lactam-binding activity (second order rate constant for the acylation of the active site serine by benzylpenicillin: k/K = 300 mm-1s-1). The crystal structure of the DD-peptidase from Actinomadura R39 was solved at a resolution of 1.8 Å by single anomalous dispersion at the cobalt resonance wavelength. The structure is composed of three domains: a penicillin-binding domain similar to the penicillin-binding domain of E. coli PBP5 and two domains of unknown function. In most multimodular PBPs, additional domains are generally located at the C or N termini of the penicillin-binding domain. In R39, the other two domains are inserted in the penicillin-binding domain, between the SXXK and SXN motifs, in a manner similar to “Matryoshka dolls.” One of these domains is composed of a five-stranded β-sheet with two helices on one side, and the other domain is a double three-stranded β-sheet inserted in the previous domain. Additionally, the 2.4-Å structure of the acyl-enzyme complex of R39 with nitrocefin reveals the absence of active site conformational change upon binding the β-lactams. Actinomadura sp.

Additionally, the 2.4-Å structure of the acyl-enzyme complex of R39 with nitrocefin reveals the absence of active site conformational change upon binding the β-lactams. Cell wall assembly is catalyzed by a series of active-site serine DD-peptidases, known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; K15, Streptomyces K15 DD-peptidase; R61, Streptomyces R61 DD-transpeptidase-carboxypeptidase; R39, Actinomadura sp. strain R39 DD-peptidase; PBP5fm, E. faecium PBP5; SaG, Streptomyces albus G class A β-lactamase; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; SAD, single anomalous diffraction. These enzymes catalyze the final steps in the synthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan, a highly cross-linked mesh that surrounds the bacteria and protects them from osmotic shock and lysis. They constitute the lethal targets of penicillins and more generally of β-lactam antibiotics, which exhibit a rough structural analogy with the PBP peptide substrates, i.e. the d-alanyl-d-alanine C termini of peptidoglycan stem peptides. β-Lactams acylate the active site serine of the penicillin-binding domain of PBPs and form a rather stable acyl-enzyme devoid of transpeptidase activity (1Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Multiple PBPs, from three in Neisseria meningiditis to twelve in Escherichia coli, are bound to the cytoplasmic membrane of all bacteria. These PBPs can be divided into two groups: the high molecular mass PBPs, which are multimodular enzymes containing a DD-transpeptidase domain associated either with a transglycosylase domain or with a domain of unknown function and the low molecular mass PBPs, which act mainly as DD-transpeptidases or DD-carboxypeptidases (2Foster S.J.

The overall fold of PBP5 is that of class A β-lactamases with a C-terminal extension domain, whereas R61 is similar to class C β-lactamases. Despite the absence of crystal structure of class C low molecular mass PBPs, similarities with class A β-lactamases have been highlighted. Compared with the class A β-lactamase structures, these proteins exhibit an additional domain of about 200 residues inserted between the SXXK and the SXN conserved motifs characteristic of the penicillin-binding domain (8Granier B.

The members of this class of PBPs exhibit medium to high sensitivity to β-lactams, DD-carboxypeptidase, and transpeptidase activity. They also exhibit a so-called endopeptidase activity, i.e. they can release a C-terminal residue bearing a large and complex side chain, which is in fact a facet of their carboxypeptidase activity. Moreover, in contrast to most other PBPs, which are strongly anchored in the membrane, class C low molecular mass PBPs are soluble or loosely bound to the membrane via an amphiphilic C-terminal helix (10Pedersen L.B.

Under laboratory growth conditions E. coli PBP4 appears to be dispensable, and similar results were found for B. subtilis PBP4a and N. gonorrhoeae PBP3. In addition to the low molecular mass PBPs, a few high molecular mass PBPs have been crystallized: Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP2x (14Pares S. Mouz N. Petillot Y. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 284-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), Staphylococcus aureus PBP2a (15Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct.

The crystal structure of R39 is the first structure of a class C low molecular mass PBP and reveals special structural features that characterize this class of PBPs. Purification and Crystallization—R39 has been expressed and purified as described previously (8Granier B. Duez C. Lepage S. Englebert S. Dusart J. Dideberg O. Van Beeumen J. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown at 20 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Native crystals were obtained by mixing 2.5 μl of 25 mg ml-1 protein solution (containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 m Tris) and 2.5 μl of well solution per drop (containing 1.5 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8). The crystallization conditions were optimized by a search around these conditions and by testing several additives, including different chloride salts. Crystals of the Co2+ derivative were prepared by mixing 2.5 μl of 25 mg ml-1 protein solution (containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 0.02 m Tris), 2 μl of well solution (containing 2.0 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m MES, pH 6), and 0.5 μl of 0.1 m CoCl2 solution. Nitrocefin-soaked crystal were prepared using the same conditions and then transferred to 2 μl of well solution containing nitrocefin (1 mm) for 14 h. Before data collection, crystals were cryoprotected with 100% glycerol. Data Collection, Phase Determination, and Structure Refinement—Native data were collected at 100 K on an ADSC Quantum 4R charge-coupled device detector at beamline ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). SAD data and nitrocefin-soaked crystal data were collected at 100 K on a MAR charge-coupled device detector at beamline BM30a at ESRF. All data were processed and scaled using Mosflm (17Leslie A.G.W. Crystallographic Computing. 1991; 5: 50-61Google Scholar) and CCP4 (18CCP4. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by a SAD experiment at the peak wavelength of Co2+ K-edge (1.605 Å). The eighteen Co2+ sites were found with Solve (19Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Phasing with Resolve (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar) produced a clearly interpretable electron density map, from which a complete model could be built using Turbo-Frodo (21Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989Google Scholar). This monomer was used as a search model for molecular replacement, with native data. The four monomers in the asymmetric unit were found using AMoRe (22Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1367-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Subsequent refinement was carried out using CNS (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), and manual model fitting was done with Turbo-Frodo. The four monomers were refined individually. The figures were prepared with Molscript (24Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), Bobscript (25Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1997; 15 (132-134): 112-113Crossref Scopus (1795) Google Scholar), and Raster3D (26Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2859) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—R39 is a soluble 538-amino acid protein, as deduced from DNA sequence analysis, including a 49-amino acid signal peptide. The tracing of the resulting 489-amino acid R39 molecule in the electron density maps showed that the 23-amino acid C-terminal peptide (467-489) is missing. Subsequent mass spectrometry analyses indicated that the purified enzyme contained 466 residues prior to crystallization. Because a production system of R39 in E. coli was not available and selenomethionine-substituted protein could not be obtained, a search for the presence of anomalous scattering ions, firstly added to enhance crystal growth, was monitored by using a fluorescence detector available at the BM30a beamline at ESRF. A strong fluorescence peak was observed with a crystal grown in presence of Co2+. Thus the use of Co2+ ions in the crystallization conditions facilitated the structure determination by single anomalous diffraction at the cobalt resonance wavelength (Table I). R39 crystallizes in space group P21 (a = 104.56 Å; b = 94.37 Å; c = 106.96 Å; β = 94.05°) with four molecules and eighteen Co2+ ions in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 1A). The crystallographic environment is similar for molecules A and D and molecules B and C but is different for both pairs. Five Co2+ ions are found in molecules A and D, whereas only four are found in molecules B and C. Each Co2+ ion is ligated by at least one histidine and one aspartic or glutamic acid residues. In molecule A, a Co2+ ion is located between His282 and Glu466 of a crystallographic symmetry-related molecule of molecule A. The same situation arises for molecule D. Because the crystallographic environment is different for molecules B and C, the absence of cobalt near residue 466 results in a disordered 464-466 segment with elevated temperature factors for residues 464 and 465 and loss of interpretable density for residue 466. The root mean square deviation between any two molecules of the asymmetric unit is between 0.35 and 0.40 Å. The final structure has been refined at 1.8 Å against data collected from a crystal grown in slightly different conditions in the absence of Co2+. In this refined structure, four Mg2+ ions are present in the asymmetric unit in sites of four of the 18 Co2+ ions. Two of these Mg2+ ions are found in molecule A and two in molecule D.Table IData collection, phasing and refinement statisticsData setCo2+NativeNitrocefin-soakedPDB code1W8Q1W791W8YWavelength (Å)1.6050.97630.970Resolution range (Å)aStatistics for the highest resolution shell are given in parentheses.50-2.85 (3.0-2.85)50-1.8 (1.91-1.8)50-2.4 (2.55-2.4)Unique reflections47,856187,52769,694RedundancyaStatistics for the highest resolution shell are given in parentheses.13.3 (5.5)3.6 (3.6)2.9 (2.53)Completeness (%)aStatistics for the highest resolution shell are given in parentheses.98.0 (86.7)98.5 (95.6)86.6 (80.5)I/σ (I)aStatistics for the highest resolution shell are given in parentheses.20.7 (2.7)11.7 (3.9)9.5 (2.2)Rsym (%)aStatistics for the highest resolution shell are given in parentheses.15.3 (71)9.7 (46)10.1 (54)RefinementResolution range (Å)20-2.8520-1.820-2.4σ Cutoff222Rcryst/Rfree (%)19.7/24.421.4/24.022.7/28.6Number of protein atoms1339413,39413,394Number of ions18 Co2+4 Mg2+4 Mg2+Number of water molecules801781829Average B-factors (Å2)Protein41.922.043.5Nitrocefin40.0Water52.534.345.3Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0060.0050.007Bond angles (°)1.21.31.3a Statistics for the highest resolution shell are given in parentheses. Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—Topologically, R39 is composed of three distinct domains. The penicillin-binding domain consists of residues 1-65 and 285-466 (Fig. 1, B and C). The second domain (domain II) comprises residues 66-165 and 237-284 and corresponds to an insertion at the beginning of helix α4 between the motifs SXXK and SXN, two usual motifs of the PBPs active site. The third domain (domain III) is a subdomain inserted in domain II and consists of residues 166-236. Each domain possesses a β-sheet that is oriented approximately at right angle from the β-sheets of the other two domains. Penicillin-binding Domain—The penicillin-binding domain shares its overall fold with other penicillin-binding proteins and the serine β-lactamases: the R39 active site is located in an extended groove between a five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and a cluster of α-helices. The root mean square deviations with the corresponding domains of other PBPs range between 2.2 and 2.8 Å (Table II). Structure-based alignments of these domains reveal significant structural differences. The structures providing the greatest degree of folding similarity are those of E. coli PBP5 and class A β-lactamases, with some major differences. The first difference is the replacement of the β-lactamase variable loop inserted before helix α4 by the 220-amino acid peptide corresponding to domains II and III. A loop of R39 domain II extends near the active site, reminiscent of the variable loop in β-lactamases, but the two loops are structurally different. The second difference is the absence of the β-lactamase Ω-like loop defining the bottom of the active site. In this region, the 343-353 segment is folded like its counterpart in PBP5. The third difference is the conformation of the residues surrounding helix α10 in a region situated above the active site (residues 381-408).Table IIRoot mean square deviations between the R39 penicillin-binding domain and the corresponding domains of other PBPsEnzymeK15PBP5R61Root mean square deviation (Å)2.232.322.84Number of aligned Cα atoms187185192 Open table in a new tab The residues involved in the enzymatic activity and defining the active site correspond to the three conserved motifs found in PBPs and class A β-lactamases: Ser49-Xaa-Xaa-Lys52 (motif 1), Ser298-Xaa-Asn300 (motif 2), and Lys410-Thr411-Gly412-Thr413 (motif 3). As in other PBPs, a dense hydrogen bond network prevails in the R39 active site, with a water molecule in the oxyanion hole formed by the backbone nitrogens of Ser49 and Thr413. In the upper region of the active site, although the superposition of most PBP backbones does not fit in the surroundings of helix α10, a threonine is frequently observed at the exact position of Thr393 (Thr199 in K15, Thr526 in PBP2x, Thr526 in PBP2a, Thr603 in PBP5fm, and Thr216 in the Streptomyces albus G class A β-lactamase (SaG) (27Dideberg O. Charlier P. Wery J.P. Dehottay P. Dusart J. Erpicum T. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 911-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar)). Thr393 Oδ is hydrogen-bonded to Thr411 Oδ and contributes to the hydrogen bond network that strengthens the active site. A distinctive feature of R39 is a specific pocket observed in the bottom of the active site and mainly defined by residues Trp139, Asp142, Tyr147, three residues belonging to domain II, and Arg351 and Met414, two residues of the penicillin-binding domain. This characteristic could prove useful in the development of specific β-lactam antibiotics with a high affinity for R39, as developed for the R61 DD-peptidase (28Silvaggi N.R. Josephine H.R. Kuzin A.P. Nagarajan R. Pratt R.F. Kelly J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Acylation with β-Lactams—R39 is highly sensitive to β-lactams (k2/K = 2600 mm-1s-1 for nitrocefin), and deacylation occurs at a very low rate (k3 = 1.5 × 10-6 s-1) (3Frere J.M. Joris B. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 11: 299-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), a favorable situation for the accumulation of an acyl-enzyme. After soaking in nitrocefin, the four molecules present in the asymmetric unit are acylated. The electron density of the R39 active site unambiguously reveals a covalent acyl-enzyme with nitrocefin (Fig. 2). The dihydrothiazolidine ring and the carboxylate are well defined, and the electron density is continuous between the active site serine hydroxyl group and the β-lactam carbonyl group. There is no density for the R2 substituent of nitrocefin. Departure of the C3′ substituent after electronic rearrangement upon opening of the β-lactam ring has been observed in acyl-enzyme complexes of R61 and PBP2x with cephalosporins (29Kuzin A.P. Liu H. Kelly J.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9532-9540Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Gordon E. Mouz N. Duee E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), but not in the acyl-nitrocefin-PBP2a structure (15Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 870-876PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the R2 substituent, the position of nitrocefin in the active site is similar to that observed with PPB2a. The amide group in the nitrocefin side-chain hydrogen bonds to Asn300 Oδ1 and to the backbone carbonyl of Thr413, the β-lactam carbonyl oxygen being located in the oxyanion hole. The nitrocefin carboxylate is hydrogen bonded to Thr411 and Thr413, as observed in many acyl-PBPs complexes. It is noteworthy that, among 25 class C low molecular mass PBPs sequences aligned with R39 in a Blast search (31Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar), Arg397 is one of the few strictly conserved residues. Its position in helix α10 is equivalent to the position of Arg220 in SaG. Owing to the α10 position, which is slightly different in class A β-lactamases and R39, the distance between the guanidinium group and the β-lactam carboxylate is 6.2 Å, whereas a direct interaction between these two groups is generally observed in acyl-enzyme intermediates of class A β-lactamases. The R39 active site does not undergo a great structural deformation upon β-lactam binding. The main effect of acylation on the R39 structure is a slight tilt of the β3 strand and a displacement of Thr413 (Fig. 2C). The side chain of Thr413 moves 2.35 Å in direction of nitrocefin, allowing for hydrogen bond formation between the substrate carboxylate and the hydroxyl groups of Thr411 and Thr413. The situation is identical in all molecules except a slight difference in the position of the nitrocefin C6 substituent and a consequent adaptation of the side chain of residues Tyr147 and Met414. Non Penicillin-binding Domains—Domain II (residues 66-165 and 237-284) is a five-stranded β-sheet with two helices packed on one side (Fig. 3A). The sheet is composed of one antiparallel and four parallel strands in the order β5II-β1II-β2II-β3II-β4II with β1II anti-parallel. Strand β2II is followed by helix α1II, and strand β3II is followed by helix α2II. The topology as well as the three-dimensional arrangement of the subdomain formed by β2II-α1II-β3II-α2II-β4II corresponds to one-half of a Rossmann fold. Using a three-dimensional DALI search (32Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) with residues 66-165 and 237-284, domain II was found to topologically resemble domains of E. coli d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase (33Ferri-Fioni M.L.

Indeed, the five strands and the two helices can be superimposed with a root mean square value of 3.1 Å for 82 aligned Cα atoms for the d-Tyr-tRNATyr deacylase and 3.5 Å for 74 aligned Cα atoms for the 1,3-1,4-β-glucanase. Domain II is also topologically similar to the N-terminal domain of MinC (35Cordell S.C. Anderson R.E. Lowe J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2454-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and the 1A region of FtsA (36Rico A.I. Garcia-Ovalle M. Mingorance J. Vicente M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1359-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), two proteins interacting with FtsZ and involved in the regulation of the septum formation in cell division. However the resemblance between R39 and both MinC and FtsA remains limited. Moreover, R39 lacks sequence homology with all these topologically similar proteins and the loops connecting the secondary structures are completely different. A β hairpin connects strands β1II and β2II. Two arginines (Arg81 and Arg82) constitute the head of the hairpin with their side chain protruding out of the core of domain II. Similarly, the side chains of Arg116 and Arg119, located in the loop connecting α1II and β3II, extend on the same side of domain II. These four arginines, together with Lys261, form a positively charged surface on the side opposite to the interface with the penicillin-binding domain. The side chains of these residues seem to float into the solvent. Accordingly, the temperature factors of the side chains are high, and the electron density around them is quite poor. A crown of negatively charged residues (Glu76, Asp87, Asp121, Glu250, Glu251, Glu254, Asp263, Asp272, Asp275, and Glu277) surrounds this positively charged head (Fig. 3B). This dipolar surface might be involved in protein-protein interaction. On the opposite side, following β3II strand, a long unstructured loop (126-153) extends out of domain II. It packs onto the penicillin-binding domain, with residues Trp139, Asp142, and Tyr147 being part of a specific pocket in the bottom of the active site. A small β hairpin connects this loop to domain III. Domain III consists of two three-stranded β-sheets facing each other in a kind of incomplete β-barrel (Fig. 4). The first β-sheet is an antiparallel β-sheet made of strands β2III-β1III-β6III. The second β-sheet consists of strands β3III-β5III-β4III, β5III being parallel to β3III and antiparallel to β4III. A DALI search with residues 166-236 did not yield any structurally similar protein (Z smaller than 2.5 and no equivalence with visual inspection). The Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase is encoded by a 1614-nucleotide gene. The 538-amino acid protein precursor presents a 49-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide and, presumably, a 23-amino acid C-terminal extension that are both cleaved to yield a mature soluble protein of 466 residues. When the protein is produced in Streptomyces lividans TK24 grown in YEME (Difco yeast extract, 3 g; Difco bactopeptone, 5 g; Oxoid malt extract, 3 g; glucose, 10 g; sucrose, 340 g) medium, its molecular mass is about 3 kDa higher than the molecular mass exhibited by the protein purified from the culture supernatant of Actinomadura R39. Moreover, the protein produced in S. lividans lacks both DD-peptidase activity and penicillin-binding ability. The mass difference associated with loss of enzymatic activity was first thought to be an incorrect processing of the signal peptide (8Granier B. Duez C. Lepage S. Englebert S. Dusart J. Dideberg O. Van Beeumen J. Frere J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but it might also result from an incorrect processing of the C-terminal extension. A similar situation has been observed with the R61 DD-peptidase, for which the precursor containing the C-terminal extension was shown to be inactive (37Fanuel L. Granier B. Wilkin J.M. Bellefroid-Bourguignon C. Joris B. Knowles J. Komives E. Van Beeumen J. Ghuysen J.M. Frere J.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 49-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of a C-terminal fragment has been observed in few other cases, although not necessarily associated with enzymatic activity (38Nicolet Y. Piras C. Legrand P. Hatchikian C.E.

Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5890-5893Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inspection of the R39 three-dimensional structure reveals that the C-terminal extension might reduce the active site accessibility to peptide substrates or β-lactam antibiotics, which would result in a loss of enzymatic activity and β-lactam binding ability. The mechanism of interaction between PBPs and β-lactam antibiotics is known to follow a three-step pathway involving the rapid reversible formation of a non-convalent Henri-Michaelis complex followed by formation of a long-lived acyl-enzyme intermediate. Evidence supporting this mechanism is given by the crystallographic structure of a non-covalent PBP-β-lactam complex described recently (28Silvaggi N.R. Josephine H.R. Kuzin A.P. Nagarajan R.

https://openalex.org/W2002835897,"A major determinant of neuronal homeostasis is the proper integration of cell signaling pathways recruited by a variety of neuronal and non-neuronal factors. By taking advantage of a neuroectodermal cell line (1C11) endowed with the capacity to differentiate into serotonergic (1C115-HT) or noradrenergic (1C11NE) neurons, we identified serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)- and norepinephrine (NE)-dependent signaling cascades possibly involved in neuronal functions. First, we establish that 5-HT2B receptors and 1D adrenoceptors are functionally coupled to reactive oxygen species (ROS) synthesis through NADPH oxidase activation in 1C115-HT and 1C11NE cells. This observation constitutes the prime evidence that bioaminergic autoreceptors take part in the control of the cellular redox equilibrium in a neuronal context. Second, our data identify TACE (TNF- Converting Enzyme), a member of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family, as a downstream target of the 5-HT2B and 1D receptor-NADPH oxidase signaling pathways. Upon 5-HT2B or 1D receptor stimulation, ROS fully govern TNF- shedding in the surrounding milieu of 1C115-HT or 1C11NE cells. Third, 5-HT2B and 1Dreceptor couplings to the NADPH oxidase-TACE cascade are strictly restricted to 1C11-derived progenies that have implemented a complete serotonergic or noradrenergic phenotype. Overall, these observations suggest that 5-HT2B and 1D autoreceptors may play a role in the maintenance of neuron- and neurotransmitter-associated functions. Eventually, our study may have implications regarding the origin of oxidative stress as well as up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines in neurodegenerative disorders, which may relate to the deviation of normal signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1986686062,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by accumulation of the neurotoxic amyloid β peptide (Aβ) and by the loss of cholinergic neurons and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) throughout the brain. Direct inhibition of nAChRs by Aβ has also been suggested to contribute to cholinergic dysfunction in AD. In an effort to find ligands capable of blocking Aβ-induced inhibition of nAChRs, we have screened a phage display library to identify peptides that bind to Aβ. Using this approach, we identified a heptapeptide denoted IQ, which binds with nanomolar affinity to Aβ and is homologous to the acetylcholine-binding protein and to most subtypes of nAChRs. Rapid kinetic whole-cell current-recording measurements showed that Aβ inhibits nAChR function in a dose-dependent manner in neuronal differentiated PC12 cells and that nanomolar concentrations of IQ completely block the inhibition by Aβ. These results indicate that the Aβ binding site in nAChRs is homologous to the IQ peptide and that this is a relevant target for Aβ neurotoxicity in AD and, more generally, for the regulation of nAChR function by soluble Aβ in a physiological context.

This irreversible disease is caused by extensive synaptic dysfunction, resulting in the impairment of cognitive and other cerebral functions. Clinical investigations as well as studies on animal models suggest that the primary agent of neurodegeneration is a peptide of 39-43 amino acid residues known as amyloid β peptide (Aβ) (1Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 2De Felice F.G. Ferreira S.T. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 2002; 22: 545-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although the majority of secreted Aβ is 40 amino acids long (Aβ40), the smaller fraction of longer, 42-amino acid species (Aβ42) has received greater attention because of its high propensity to nucleate and drive the formation of amyloid aggregates and fibrils (3Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 695: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Amyloid fibrils found in the senile plaques present in the brains of AD patients were originally considered to be primarily responsible for the clinical progression of AD. However, more recent evidence indicates that the cognitive decline correlates better with the amount of soluble Aβ and with the loss of synaptic proteins than with the formation and deposition of amyloid plaques (e.g. Refs. 4Terry R.D.

Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 219-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Multiple neural systems are affected in AD, and a key feature of the neurodegenerative process is the loss of cholinergic neurons and nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) throughout the brain (6Nordberg A. Biol. Psychiatry. 2001; 49: 200-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). High affinity association of Aβ42 with α7 and α4β2 nAChRs has recently been observed in amyloid plaques and neurons of AD patients (7Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P.

Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Partial functional inhibition of α4β2 and α7 nAChRs by Aβ has also been demonstrated (9Liu Q.-S. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4734-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Tozaki H. Matsumoto A. Kanno T. Nagai K. Yamamoto S. Nishizaki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2004; 279: 37842-37851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This, however, is still a somewhat controversial issue, as a recent report has described that picomolar concentrations of Aβ activate, rather than inhibit, whole-cell current responses of α7-nAChRs (13Dineley K.T. Bell K. Bui D. Sweatt J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25056-25061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used a phage display approach to identify peptides that bind to Aβ40 with high affinity. The display of random peptides on filamentous bacteriophage has allowed the identification of peptides that bind specifically to a variety of targets, including fibrillar Aβ (14Kang C.K. Jayasinha V. Martin P.T. Neurobiol. Dis. 2003; 14: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Wiesehan K. Buder K. Linke R.P. Patt S. Stoldt M. Unger E. Schmitt B. Bucci E. Willbold D. Chembiochem. 2003; 4: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Peptides thus identified have been shown to act as agonists and antagonists of various receptors and to mimic the binding sites of physiological receptors (16Azzazy H.M. Highsmith Jr., W.E. Clin. Biochem. 2002; 35: 425-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have now isolated a cysteine-linked heptapeptide (denoted IQ) that binds to Aβ40 and is homologous to AChBP and to several subtypes of nAChRs. Remarkably, nanomolar concentrations of IQ completely block the inhibition of nAChRs by Aβ in differentiated PC12 cells. These results indicate that the Aβ binding site in nAChRs is homologous to the IQ peptide and suggest that IQ may be a lead for the development of novel drugs to alleviate the inhibition of cholinergic function by Aβ in AD. Phage Display—Aβ40 (Bachem) was diluted to 0.1 μg/μl in either PBS or in a 50% trifluoroethanol solution in PBS, and 50 μl of each solution were dried in the wells of a 96-well plate at 37 °C under constant shaking for 16 h. To check the state of aggregation of the samples, the material from one well of each solution was extracted with 1% SDS and submitted to SDS-PAGE. Although all of the material from the PBS solution sample was found to be aggregated, silver staining of the gel indicated that Aβ40 dried from the trifluoroethanol solution did not aggregate. The wells were washed with PBS and blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. After washing, 10 μl of a phage display library (PhD-C7C, New England Biolabs) was added to each well and incubated according to the manufacturer's instructions. After five rounds of panning, 30 Aβ-binding clones were individually picked, amplified, and had their DNA sequenced. Most of the 30 clones thus obtained had different DNA sequences. To identify the clones with higher affinities for monomeric Aβ40, all of the clones were amplified and titrated as recommended by the manufacturer. Increasing concentrations of each phage were incubated for 2 h in 96-well plates coated with 5 μg of either monomeric or fibrillar Aβ40 per well, as described above. The peptide sequences exhibiting higher affinities for monomeric Aβ40, determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a recombinant phage antibody kit (Amersham Biosciences), were compared with protein sequences deposited in several data banks (NCBI) using BLAST (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59926) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—The peptides IQ (IQTTWSR), QI (RSWTTQI), and SQI (TIWQSTR) were synthesized as described previously (18Magdesian M.H. Giordano R. Ulrich H. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Schumacher R.I. Colli W. Alves M.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19382-19389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cultilab), 5% horse serum (Invitrogen), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml) (both from United States Biochemical), and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen). Exposure of PC12 cells to N5,2′-O-dibutyryl cAMP and fibroblast growth factor leads to differentiation into mature sympathetic neurons containing an increased number of neuronal nAChRs (19Ho P.L. Raw I. J. Cell Physiol. 1992; 150: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For differentiation, 2.5 × 105 cells/ml were cultured for up to 6 days in medium containing 30 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-2 (Sigma) and 250 μm N5,2′-O-dibutyryl cAMP. The medium was changed every 2 days. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that PC12 cells thus differentiated express subtypes α3, α5, α7, β2, and β4 of nAChRs (data not shown). For evaluation of cell viability, PC12 cells (differentiated for 3 days as described above) were incubated in duplicate wells in the presence of different peptides (see “Results”) for 48 h, washed with PBS, and stained with trypan blue. Five fields were photographed per well, and live and dead cells were counted. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test. Whole-cell Current Recording and Rapid Application of Ligand Solutions—For whole-cell recording experiments, PC12 cells (3-6 days of differentiation) were plated at a density of 20-100 cells/mm2 on 35-mm cell culture dishes. Whole-cell currents were recorded at room temperature at a transmembrane voltage of -70 mV and pH 7.4. The solution in the recording pipette was 145 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Glass pipettes were pulled on a Sutter P-30 pipette puller and were fire-polished. The resistance of the pipette filled with the solution described above was typically 2-3 megohms, and the serial resistance was 5-20 megohms. Whole-cell currents were amplified using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) and filtered at 2 kHz using a 40-pole low-pass Bessel filter in the amplifier. The filtered signals were digitized using a Digidata 1322A interface and recorded using the pCLAMP software package (Axon Instruments). Carbamoylcholine (CCh)-induced currents were recorded by whole-cell recording in combination with a rapid kinetic ligand delivery system, designated the cell-flow technique, which provides a time resolution of 10 ms (20Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, a U-shaped stainless steel capillary tube (250-μm inner diameter) with a circular porthole 150 μm in diameter at the base of the U was connected to pumps on both ends so that the solution containing ligand could be driven into the tube at one end and removed through the other end at twice the entry flow rate (20Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The porthole was placed 100 μm away from a cell attached to the recording pipette. Upon closing a solenoid valve between the U-tube and the suction pump by an electric trigger, CCh, Aβ, and/or different peptides were applied to the cell in a laminar flow. Aβ, IQ, QI, and SQI peptide solutions were mixed prior to co-application with CCh. Correction for Receptor Desensitization in Cell-flow Measurements—The maximum amplitude of current is a measure of the concentration of open channels. As receptor desensitization may occur while the ligand solution is flushed over the cell surface, the observed current amplitudes were corrected for receptor desensitization, using the equation (20Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), I(t)=I1e-t/ϑ1+I2e-t/ϑ2+Ie(Eq. 1) where I(t) is the maximum current amplitude at time t; I1, I2, and Ie are the maximum current amplitudes for the first, second, and equilibrium components; and ϑ1 and ϑ2 are the time constants for the first and second components. Origin software (MicroCal) was used to estimate the rate of current decay in the presence of agonist. Equation 1 was fitted to the decreasing part of the recording, and the observed maximum current amplitude was corrected for receptor desensitization accordingly (20Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data in Fig. 2A (activation of whole-cell current in PC12 cells as a function of CCh concentration) were analyzed by non-linear fitting according to ICCh=Imax×[CCh]/(Kd+[CCh])(Eq. 2) where Kd is the dissociation constant for binding of CCh to the receptor and Imax is the maximal current obtained in the presence of saturating CCh concentrations. Non-linear least-squares analysis of data showing alleviation of receptor inhibition (Fig. 4, B and D, insets) was performed using Origin according to the following equation (21Hess G.P. Gameiro A.M. Schoenfeld R.C. Chen Y. Ulrich H. Nye J.A. Sit B. Carroll F.I. Ganem B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6106-6114Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), I/IAβ=1+([Aβ]/KAβ)×{Ka/([IQ]+Ka)}(Eq. 3) where I and IAβ are the corrected currents measured in the absence and in the presence of the inhibitor (Aβ), respectively, and KAβ is the dissociation constant for Aβ binding to the receptor. The same mathematical model was used to calculate the apparent dissociation constant of Aβ in the presence of the alleviating peptides IQ or QI (Ka). Selection of Aβ Binding Peptides by Biopanning against Monomeric Aβ—To identify Aβ40-specific ligands, we screened a phage display library and selected clones that bound specifically and with high affinities to monomeric but not to fibrillar Aβ40 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The sequence of each clone was submitted to BLAST analysis against protein sequence data banks in both forward and reverse senses to account for the possibility that small peptides may bind to their ligands in both forward and reverse directions. The IQ Peptide is Homologous to AChBP and nAChRs—One of the selected peptides (amino acid sequence IQTTWSR, denoted IQ) presented significant sequence homology to AChBP (Fig. 1A). Brejc et al. (22Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) showed that AChBP aligns with nAChRs and that nearly all residues that are conserved within the nAChR family are present in AChBP, including those that are involved in ligand binding. In functional terms, AChBP shares virtually all of the ligand binding characteristics with the nicotinic receptor family and can be used as a soluble model of the N-terminal domain of nAChRs (22Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Sequence homology alignment according to Brejc et al. (22Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar) reveals that IQ is also homologous to several subtypes of nAChRs (α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, α7, α9, α10, β2, β3, β4) (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, ACh and nicotine bind at the interface between adjacent subunits in the pentameric nicotinic receptor, and the residues that are homologous to IQ are located inside the ACh and nicotine binding pocket (Fig. 1C). In particular, Trp-58 (numbering according to AChBP), which is strictly conserved in all nAChR subtypes, is comprised within the IQ homologous sequence (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, mutations in Trp-53 (next to the IQ homologous region) and Gln-55 (within the IQ homologous region) of α7 nAChR affect the apparent affinities for ACh and nicotine (23Corringer P.J. Galzi J.L. Eisele J.L. Bertrand S. Changeux J.P. Bertrand D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11749-11752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequence of the QI peptide (corresponding to the reverse of IQ) also revealed homology to various nAChR subtypes (α2, α5, α6, α7, β2, and β4) (Fig. 1, B and C). In particular, a widely conserved motif comprising residues Ser-142, Trp-143, and Thr-144 of those subtypes of nAChRs is contained within the QI peptide. Aβ Inhibits Neuronal nAChRs in Differentiated PC12 Cells—Electrophysiological determinations of nAChR function were carried out in differentiated PC12 cells. nAChRs exhibit desensitization in the 100-ms to 1-s time range (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we have used a combination of whole-cell current-recording (24Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) and cell-flow techniques (20Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with a time resolution of 10 ms to equilibrate PC12 cells with different concentrations of ligands and measure the evoked currents before receptor desensitization. Fig. 2A shows results from a set of experiments in which different concentrations of CCh, a stable analog of ACh, flowed from the porthole of a U-tube device over a differentiated PC12 cell suspended in the solution stream, and the resulting whole-cell current (ICCh) was measured. The data were fit to a single binding site model, yielding a Kd of 259 ± 58 μm for CCh. Because the concentration of receptors (total number of binding sites), as measured by the whole-cell current methodology, differs somewhat from cell to cell, all ICCh values were normalized to the current value (3.6 nA) obtained in the presence of 1.5 mm CCh (Fig. 2A). At this CCh concentration, most of the receptors are in the open channel form (Fig. 2A). The effect of Aβ on the activity of nAChRs was investigated next using Aβ40 at concentrations ranging from 10 to 300 nm. Consistent with previous reports (9Liu Q.-S. Kawai H. Berg D.K. Proc. Natl.

In the presence of 1.5 mm CCh, maximal inhibition of nAChR function (∼ 50-60% inhibition) was obtained in the presence of 200 nm Aβ40, with an apparent K0.5 of ∼30 nm for Aβ40. The inhibition of nAChRs by Aβ40 was also investigated at lower, subsaturating concentrations of CCh. Similar results were obtained in the presence of 0.2 mm CCh (Fig. 2B), indicating that the apparent affinity for Aβ for inhibition of nAChRs is independent of the concentration of agonist and thus, of the receptor state (open or closed). Aβ by Itself Does Not Elicit Currents in Neuronal Differentiated PC12 Cells—Previous studies have shown that Aβ may insert into cell membranes to form large conductance, nonspecific ion channels (e.g. Ref. 25Mirzabekov T. Lin M.C. Yuan W.L. Marshall P.J. Carman M. Tomaselli K. Lieberburg I. Kagan B.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1142-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether Aβ by itself elicited any current responses in cells under our experimental conditions. To this end, a single cell was equilibrated with Aβ for 2 s, the elicited current was measured, and Aβ was washed for 5 min before the next measurement. It is important to note that cells that were repeatedly exposed to successive applications of CCh (in the absence of Aβ) consistently yielded the same current response (Fig. 3A), indicating the high reproducibility of our measurements. At concentrations of 200 and 300 nm, Aβ40 alone induced no current responses (Fig. 3B, bars 2 and 4). All of the cells were responsive to CCh (1.5 mm), which was applied before and after the trials with Aβ. These results are in agreement with other reports showing that, at concentrations ranging from 10 pm to 1 μm, Aβ does not elicit current responses in other cell types (11Grassi F. Palma E. Tonini R. Amici M. Ballivet V. Eusebi F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 147-157Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). On the other hand, after each successive incubation with Aβ, the response to CCh clearly decreased (Fig. 3B). These findings are consistent with previous observations of the incomplete reversibility of nAChR function after Aβ washout (11Grassi F. Palma E. Tonini R. Amici M. Ballivet V. Eusebi F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 147-157Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar). IQ Blocks the Inhibition of Neuronal nAChRs by Aβ—To investigate the possible effects of IQ and QI on Aβ/nAChR interactions, both peptides, as well as a scrambled control peptide denoted SQI, were chemically synthesized. Remarkably, we found that 500 nm IQ completely abrogated the inhibition of nAChRs by Aβ40 (Fig. 4A). To better characterize the alleviation of Aβ40-induced inhibition of nAChRs, PC12 cells were co-incubated with 1.5 mm CCh, 200 nm Aβ40, and increasing concentrations of IQ (Fig. 4B). This showed that 200 nm IQ rescued ∼70% of nAChR activity, and 500 nm IQ completely prevented the inhibition by Aβ. Analysis of the data shown in Fig. 4B with a model that takes into account the interaction between Aβ and IQ (see “Experimental Procedures”) yielded a binding affinity of 63 ± 27 nm for the interaction between IQ and Aβ in the presence of 1.5 mm CCh. Similar results were obtained when the cells were incubated with 0.2 mm CCh and 75 nm Aβ (Fig. 4B). In that case, the affinity constant calculated for Aβ binding to IQ was 101 ± 21 nm. It is important to note that addition of IQ alone (up to 500 nm) did not elicit any current in differentiated PC12 cells. Furthermore, IQ up to 750 nm does not interfere with the current evoked by CCh, but at higher concentrations IQ inhibits ICCh (data not shown). For these reasons, IQ concentrations higher than 750 nm were not investigated further here. We also investigated the effects of IQ on the neurotoxicity of Aβ40 to neuronal differentiated PC12 cells. Cells were incubated for 48 h with Aβ40 and IQ at the same concentrations as those used for the whole-cell current measurements. Interestingly, 200 nm IQ prevented the cell death promoted by 200 nm Aβ (Fig. 4C). However, high concentrations of IQ (>1 μm) induced cell death (data not shown). QI Also Blocks the Inhibition of Neuronal nAChRs by Aβ—Because the reverse peptide, QI, is also homologous to nAChRs (Fig. 1B), we decided to investigate its effects on the interaction of Aβ40 and nAChRs. Cells were equilibrated for 2 s with 1.5 mm CCh, 200 nm Aβ, and increasing concentrations of QI. Those studies revealed that QI also blocks the inhibition of nAChRs by Aβ, albeit with significantly lower efficiency than IQ (Fig. 4D). Compared with IQ, ∼10-fold higher concentrations of QI (2 μm) were needed to recover the nAChR response to CCh by 82%. The lower affinity of QI for Aβ suggests that the nAChR domain that is homologous to QI is of secondary importance to the interaction with Aβ40. In contrast to IQ, QI up to 2 μm did not interfere with the current response of nAChRs to CCh and did not promote cell death (data not shown). As an additional control for the experiments described above, PC12 cells were also exposed to CCh, Aβ40, and the scrambled peptide SQI. Those experiments showed that SQI (up to 10 μm) had no effects on the inhibition of nAChRs by Aβ or on cell viability (data not shown). The significance of the interaction between Aβ and nAChRs for the pathogenesis of AD is still unclear. In more general terms, the possible regulation of nAChR function by soluble Aβ40 under physiological conditions also remains to be clearly established. Recent work shows a preferential accumulation of Aβ in neurons expressing α7 nAChRs (7Wang H.Y. Lee D.H. D'Andrea M.R. Peterson P.A. Shank R.P. Reitz A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 25: 5626-5632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Evidence has been provided that intracellular accumulation of Aβ may be facilitated by α7 nAChRs (8Nagele R.G. D'Andrea M.R. Anderson W.J. Wang H.Y. Neuroscience. 2002; 110: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), thus implicating a relevant physiopathological role for the interaction. Here we identified a novel Aβ40 ligand, a peptide denoted IQ, that is homologous to the ligand binding domain of AChBP. AChBP aligns with the N-terminal domains of the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) and lacks the transmembrane and intracellular domains present in the superfamily. Moreover, AChBP shares 24% sequence identity with the ligand binding domain of human α7nAChR, 20-24% with other nicotinic receptors, and 15-18% with other LGICs. This protein has been used as a model for the study of ligand binding to nAChRs (22Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K.

Commun. 2004; 320: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). IQ appears to mimic the nAChR domain that binds to Aβ, and this domain is also part of the binding pocket for ACh and nicotine. Therefore, we propose that the inhibition of nAChR function by Aβ results from its direct binding to the nicotine and ACh binding pocket in the receptor. To test this hypothesis, we used a whole-cell current-recording approach in combination with the cell-flow technique (20Udgaonkar J.B. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8758-8762Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Addition of Aβ in various aggregation states to neuronal preparations has been shown to elicit electrophysiological phenotypes, in most cases consisting of the inhibition of nAChR response to nicotine and ACh (28Hartley D.M.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5703-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, those studies have suffered from ambiguities caused by working with peptides in which the biological properties depend on their aggregation states (30Ye C. Walsh D.M. Selkoe D.J. Hartley D.M. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 19: 320-325Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our experimental approach was designed to circumvent those difficulties, as cells were exposed for only 2 s to Aβ40 and other ligands. This procedure avoids long periods of incubation with Aβ, which might otherwise favor aggregation. The crystal structure of AChBP and its alignment with nAChRs and with other LGICs reveals that the location of the ligand binding site is conserved among pentameric LGIC receptors, but the actual ligand binding residues may vary, creating specificities for different ligands (22Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

However, we have recently demonstrated that repeat 4 is necessary and sufficient for binding of GTF3 to the bicoid-like motif of the Troponin I slow enhancer. Given the sequence similarity between different GTF2I-like repeats we hypothesized that DNA binding might be a common property of this domain type. We subjected five repeats of GTF3 to random oligonucleotide selection (SELEX) to assess their DNA binding potentials. We delineated the consensus sequence GTCGAGATTAGBGA for repeat 4 and showed that binding sites for GTF3 in enhancers for Troponin I and homeobox c8 (HOXc8) are in very good agreement with this motif. SELEX selections for repeats 5 and 2 enriched for oligonucleotides that were also bound by R4, suggesting that they share common sequence preferences, whereas repeat 3 exhibited relaxed sequence requirements for DNA binding. No binding was observed for repeat 1. We also show that GTF2I-like repeats 4 and 6 of transcription factor II-I (TFII-I) exhibit modest DNA binding properties. Lastly, we identified several amino acids of GTF3 repeat 4 required for high affinity protein-DNA interaction. Based on the ability of many repeats to bind DNA in vitro, we suggest that GTF2I-like domains evolved by duplication and diversification of a prototypic DNA-binding ancestor.

Transcription of eukaryotic genes generally requires the assembly of multiple nuclear factors bound directly or indirectly to enhancer elements to regulate the recruitment of the basal transcription machinery to the core promoter. General transcription factor 3 (GTF3 1The abbreviations used are: GTF3, general transcription factor 3; BEN, binding factor for early enhancer; BLM, bicoid-like motif; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HLH, helix-loop-helix; HOXc8, homeobox c8; MusTRD1, muscle TFII-I repeat domain-containing protein 1; SELEX, selection by exponential enrichment; SURE, slow upstream regulatory element; TFII-I, general transcription factor II-I; TK, thymdidine kinase; TnI, troponin I; USE, upstream slow enhancer.; also known as GTF2ird1, MusTRD1, BEN) belongs to a family of nuclear proteins including TFII-I as its prototype which has been implicated in organizing transcription factor complexes by virtue of its multiple GTF2I-like repeats that structurally resemble helix-loop-helix (HLH) domains (1Roy A.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These motifs exhibit extensive sequence similarities to each other and to the corresponding domains in TFII-I (see Fig. 1). As potential HLH domains they are structurally unusual in that their loop regions are long (∼40 residues) compared with conventional HLH domains (<30 residues) (2Hinsley T.A. Cunliffe P. Tipney H.J. Brass A. Tassabehji M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 3Ferre-D'Amare A.R. Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 363: 38-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). GTF3 has been implicated to interact directly with several proteins, such as retinoblastoma protein (Rb), HDAC3, PI-ASxβ, and MEF-2 (4Yan X. Zhao X. Qian M. Guo N. Gong X. Zhu X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 5Tussie-Luna M.I. Bayarsaihan D. Seto E. Ruddle F.H. Roy A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36603-36610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it is not known which, if any, of the GTF2I-like repeats are involved in these interactions. The second repeat of TFII-I is preceded by a stretch of basic residues and therefore constitutes a classical basic HLH domain that binds to the upstream-derived E-box of the AdML (adenovirus major late) promoter (7Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). No such consensus basic HLH motif has been functionally identified for GTF3. We and others isolated GTF3/MusTRD1 as a nuclear factor that binds the upstream enhancer of the rodent (SURE) and human (USE) troponin I (TnI) slow gene, a regulatory element that controls slow fiber-specific transcription in transgenic mice (8O'Mahoney J.V.

Biol. 2001; 21: 8490-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The SURE consists of two functional units that cooperate to establish slow fiber-restricted transcription. The downstream half, including binding sites for MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as MyoD, is required for muscle-specific activity but lacks slow fiber specificity. The upstream half is necessary to restrict the pan-muscle activity of the downstream half to slow twitch muscle fibers (10Calvo S. Vullhorst D. Venepally P. Cheng J. Karavanova I. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8490-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GTF3 was isolated in yeast one-hybrid screens as a nuclear factor that binds to a bicoid-like sequence motif (BLM; B1b in the human USE) within the upstream halves of the SURE and the USE. In in vivo transfected rat muscles, GTF3 represses transcriptional activity of the SURE (10Calvo S. Vullhorst D. Venepally P. Cheng J. Karavanova I. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8490-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GTF3 is expressed in muscle primarily during early development and is subjected to extensive alternative splicing, generating proteins with 6 (α- and β-isoforms) or 5 (γ-isoforms) GTF2I-like repeats (10Calvo S. Vullhorst D. Venepally P. Cheng J. Karavanova I. Buonanno A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8490-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Tay E.S. Guven K.L. Subramaniam N. Polly P. Issa L.L. Gunning P.W. Hardeman E.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 359-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that GTF3 is involved in the down-regulation of the TnI slow gene in developing fast muscles. Like GTF3, BEN was isolated in a yeast one-hybrid screen as a factor that binds to the EFG site of the Hoxc8 enhancer (12Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7342-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mapping of the DNA binding domain using in vitro-translated proteins revealed that GTF2I-R4 is necessary and sufficient for interaction of GTF3 with the BLM (13Vullhorst D. Buonanno A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8370-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The absence of a nearby basic region in R4 suggested an intrinsic ability of the GTF2I-like repeat motif to interact with DNA in a sequence-specific manner that is distinct from the basic HLH/E-box interaction observed for TFII-I. Based on the sequence similarities between GTF2I-like repeats and the observed DNA binding capability of R4, we speculated that DNA-protein interactions might be a common property of this domain. In agreement with this notion it was recently reported that GTF3/MusTRD1 interacts via R4 and, albeit weakly, via R2 with the B1b element of the USE of the human TnIs gene (6Polly P. Haddadi L.M.

In this study we investigated whether individual repeats can interact with DNA in a sequence-specific fashion. We purified GTF2I-like repeats as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins and used oligonucleotide selection by exponential enrichment (SELEX) to isolate binding-competent sequences from a random oligonucleotide library. We delineated a consensus binding site for R4 and showed that all repeats except for R1 display some degree of DNA binding activity in vitro. The binding is sequence-specific for R4, R5, and R2 but appears to be largely sequence-independent for R3. These findings are important for in silico-based prediction of GTF3 binding sites in other genes and thus may contribute to our understanding of GTF3 functions in different tissues and possibly of the pathogenesis underlying Williams syndrome in which both GTF3 and TFII-I are hemizygously deleted (14Tassabehji M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: R229-R237Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also demonstrated that some repeats of TFII-I exhibit DNA binding properties. Based on the ability of most repeats to interact with DNA, we speculate that this property was inherent to the prototypic GTF2I-like motif.

Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar)). PCR products were then subcloned into pGemT vector (Promega, Madison, WI), and recombinant clones were confirmed by sequencing (dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit; Applied Bio-systems, Foster City, CA). Inserts were excised with BglII and EcoRI restriction enzymes using flanking sites introduced by PCR and placed between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) for in-frame expression of GTF2I-like repeats domain as GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Point mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions of GTF3 repeat 4 were introduced into the corresponding pGEX-2T (GTF3-R4 expression plasmid using the Gene-Editor mutagenesis kit (Promega)). For reporter analysis in eukaryotic cells, mouse GTF3-R4 was expressed as an amino-terminal VP16 fusion protein in vector pCMV-Sport2 (Invitrogen). The sequence encoding the repeat exactly matched the sequence in the corresponding GST fusion protein (see above). It was amplified using SalI (5′)- and ApaI (3′)-linked oligonucleotides and inserted between the corresponding sites of pCMV-Sport2. Next, the VP16 transactivation domain from herpes simplex virus (amino acids 412–490) was PCR amplified and inserted as an ApaI-HindIII fragment in-frame with the upstream sequence (GTF3-R4-VP16). Because preliminary experiments revealed that this protein exhibited poor nuclear residence, a fragment of GTF3 encompassing the carboxyl-terminal 65 amino acids including the nuclear localization signal was inserted as a PCR product into the ApaI site of GTF3-R4-VP16. GST Fusion Protein Expression and Purification—For GST pull-down and gel retardation assays, GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3pLysS) host strain (Novagen, Madison, WI). Protein expression was induced in 150-ml late logarithmic cultures by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mm for 2 h at 30 °C. Cells in 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline were broken in a French press in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). GST fusion proteins were extracted from cleared lysates on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After four washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA, recombinant proteins were eluted in 50 mm glutathione in 50 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Purities of protein preparations were >90% as judged by SDS-PAGE and subsequent staining with colloidal Coomassie. Random Oligonucleotide Library—The oligonucleotide library was generated by PCR from a pool of single-stranded SELEX oligonucleotides (SELEX-1) containing a core of 14 random bases and flanking nonrandom sequences used for amplification (16Feledy J.A. Morasso M.I. Jang S.I. Sargent T.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 10 ng of SELEX-1 was made double-stranded by 14 cycles of PCR using 600 ng each of primers SELEX-2 and SELEX-3, 400 μm deoxyribonucleotides, and 5 units of Taq Expand polymerase (Roche Applied Science) in a final volume of 100 μl. Reaction times and temperatures for each cycle were as follows: 40 s at 92 °C, 40 s at 46 °C, 20 s at 72 °C. To ensure that the library contained a large proportion of perfectly complementary oligonucleotides, 2.5 units of Taq Expand and 600 ng of each SELEX-2 and SELEX-3 primers were added, and the reaction was subjected to one additional denaturation/annealing/extension cycle. The product was electrophoresed through a 10% acrylamide gel in 0.5 × Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE; 1 × = 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). The 43 bp band was excised, crushed, and eluted overnight in 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS. Acrylamide pieces were removed by filtration using GenElute spin columns (Sigma). After ethanol precipitation, the final DNA pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA. SELEX—The oligonucleotide selection procedure SELEX was performed using a GST pull-down format, as described previously (17Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1073-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C unless indicated otherwise. Typically, 300 μl of glutathione beads in NET-N (20 mm Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40; supplemented with 0.5% nonfat dry milk) were loaded with 1 mg of GST fusion protein. After four washes each in 1 ml of NET-N, the beads were stored in small aliquots until use. Because of a tendency of GST-R2 protein to aggregate upon elution from the beads, SELEX for R2 was done with beads that were loaded with GST-R2 protein from crude cell lysates instead of purified protein. For each round of binding site selection, 10 μl of protein-loaded beads was first incubated with 4 μg of poly(dI-dC) in 240 μl of NET-N for 30 min to minimize nonspecific binding. Next, 2 pmol of doublestranded SELEX oligonucleotide was added to the beads and allowed to bind for 30 min with gentle rocking. After four washes each with 1 ml of NET-N, DNA that remained bound to the beads was eluted by incubation with 250 μl of proteinase K digestion buffer (500 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.8, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 200 μg/ml proteinase K) for 3 h at 50 °C. Oligonucleotides were then phenol extracted and precipitated with ethanol, and the resulting pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of H2O. 5 μl of this preparation was subjected to PCR using primers SELEX-2 and SELEX-3. Conditions for PCR and subsequent PAGE purification were as described above. Between 4 and 5 cycles of SELEX were used for the different repeats. Cloning and Sequence Analysis of SELEX Oligonucleotide Pools— Upon completion of the final cycle of SELEX selection, oligonucleotides were shotgun cloned into the PCR vector pGemT. Plasmid DNA from 30–35 recombinant clones was isolated and subjected to sequencing. Sequences corresponding to the random core of the SELEX oligonucleotide were inspected visually for conserved motifs and tabulated accordingly. Gel Retardation Assays—Double-stranded oligonucleotides used in gel retardation and GST pull-down assays were PAGE purified prior to radioactive labeling. 5 pmol of oligonucleotides was 5′-phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using 2.5 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in a total volume of 20 μl. Probes were PAGE purified, extracted, and precipitated with ethanol. Pellets were dissolved in 5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA. GST fusion proteins were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Unless indicated otherwise, 100 ng of protein was incubated with the labeled probe (25,000 cpm) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 4% Ficoll, 5% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 500 ng of poly(dG-dC)) for 20 min at room temperature. 5-μl aliquots were loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 4 °C in 0.5 × TBE. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. For some experiments, signal intensities were quantitated using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Firefly luciferase reporter plasmids harboring SURE sequences were based on pGL3Basic (Promega) and the herpes simplex virus -81/+52 thymidine kinase core promoter (pTK81, (18Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar)). A trimerized cluster of SURE sequences between nucleotide 844 and 823 was inserted as a double-stranded oligonucleotide into the BglII site of pTK81 to yield 3×(844/823). As a negative control, the same oligonucleotide with G → T point mutations in nucleotide positions -837 was used (3×(Mut837)). COS-7 cells were transfected at 50–70% confluence with a mixture of expression and reporter plasmids and the transfection control vector pRL-TK (Promega) at a mass ratio of 5:5:1 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed 24 h later and assayed for both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega). Delineation of the Consensus Binding Sequence for GTF3-R4 —GTF2I-like-repeats 1–5 of mouse GTF3 β were expressed in E. coli and purified as GST fusion proteins. Most GTF3 isoforms contain an additional sixth repeat whose core repeat is identical in amino acid sequence to R5 and whose flanking sequences are highly similar (13Vullhorst D. Buonanno A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8370-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar; see also Fig. 1A). We included only R5 in our experiments because the properties of repeats 5 and 6 were expected to be very similar. To confirm their ability to interact with double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides, fusion proteins were incubated with a probe corresponding to the SURE enhancer encompassing the sequences between nucleotide positions -844 and -808 and then subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 1, B and C). In agreement with our previous data using in vitro-translated proteins (13Vullhorst D. Buonanno A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8370-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), this probe gave rise to a robust shift with R4. Additional bands of similar mobility were obtained with R5, and to a lesser extent with R3, suggesting that these domains also exhibit some DNA binding activity. In contrast, R1 did not interact with the 844/808 probe. As expected, no complexes were obtained with unfused GST protein. R2 was not included in this assay because of low solubility of the corresponding GST fusion protein (see “Materials and Methods”). The interaction between R4 and the 844/808 probe was confirmed in GST pull-down assays, demonstrating that these DNA-protein interactions were stable in free solution (data not shown). The apparent ability of several GTF3 repeats to interact with the 844/808 probe supports our hypothesis that DNA binding might be a common property of GTF2I-like domains. We then used the random oligonucleotide selection technique SELEX to determine the consensus DNA binding sequence for GTF3-R4. Starting from a library of random 14-bp oligonucleotide sequences flanked by invariant primer binding sites, we enriched for oligonucleotide pools capable of interacting with this repeat using a GST pull-down approach (17Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1073-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Five cycles of selection and subsequent amplification were performed. Fig. 2A shows an oligonucleotide mobility shift assay with R4 protein and radioactively labeled probes derived from the unselected SELEX library and from oligonucleotide pools obtained after each round of selection and amplification. The enrichment of oligonucleotides competent in binding to this repeat is evident from the increase in signal intensity of the corresponding DNA-protein complexes. The signal intensities of the shifts in lanes 5 and 6 were similar and only slightly weaker than those of a complex formed between R4 and the SURE 844/808 probe (lane 7), suggesting that the selection was mostly completed after four rounds of SELEX. Moreover, competition experiments demonstrated that the selected sequences could be competed with SURE-derived unlabeled oligonucleotides that included the BLM (844/808, lane 9; 842/815, lane 10), but not with an oligonucleotide that lacked the BLM (827/808, lane 11). We then cloned the oligonucleotide pool from SELEX cycle 4 and analyzed 30 random clones for the presence of shared sequences (Fig. 2B). The alignment revealed a 9-bp motif, including the conserved core sequence GAGATTAG at a stringency of >90% in all six positions (Fig. 2C). The second guanosine is the only completely invariant position in all clones analyzed. The 6-bp core is flanked on the upstream side by a single and on the downstream side by two more relaxed positions preferentially occupied by guanosines. The core consensus sequence is in perfect agreement with the sequence of the BLM (CGGATTAAC), which serves as the binding site for GTF3 in the TnI enhancer SURE. The absence of guanosines from the flanking sequences apparently does not significantly affect DNA-protein interaction, given the ability of the BLM to bind to R4 (see Fig. 1C). To corroborate the results from the SELEX analysis of R4, we tested the interactions between wild-type and mutated versions of oligonucleotides derived from the TnI SURE (844/823) and from the EGF site of the HOXc8 enhancer that was demonstrated previously to bind GTF3/BEN (12Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7342-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, the sequence of the HOXc8 enhancer used to isolate GTF3/BEN by functional cloning includes a motif that conforms to the consensus motif for GTF3 R4. The complexes formed between individual repeats and a HOXc8 oligonucleotide probe that contains this sequence were very similar to those seen with the BLM of the TnI SURE (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). Moreover, this oligonucleotide competed for binding of R4 to the TnI SURE probe 844/823 that harbors the R4 binding motif (lane 8). In contrast, both HOXc8M and Mut837, in which the invariant G of the core consensus motif was mutated to T, failed to bind R4 (lanes 10 and 12). However, unlike Mut837, HOXc8M modestly competed for binding to the 844/823 wild-type probe (lanes 7 and 9), possibly because of the presence of a GGAATG sequence right downstream from the mutated consensus that closely resembles the GAGATTAG motif. We then sought to confirm these results in an in vivo binding assay. COS-7 cells that express very low amounts of endogenous GTF3 (6Polly P. Haddadi L.M. Issa L.L. Subramaniam N. Palmer S.J. Tay E.S. Hardeman E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36603-36610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were cotransfected with an expression plasmid for a GTF3-R4-VP16 fusion protein and luciferase reporter plasmids harboring trimerized versions of wild-type and single-point mutated SURE 844/823 sequences linked to the basal promoter of the thymidine kinase gene (TK81; Fig. 3B). In agreement with the in vitro experiments, robust transactivation of the wild-type sequence was observed in vivo in the presence of R4-VP16; this activity was abolished by the G → T mutation of the BLM. Taken together, two bona fide GTF3 binding sites in the enhancers of TnI and HOXc8 genes conform to the consensus sequence for GTF3 R4 as revealed by SELEX. SELEX for Other GTF2I-like Repeats of GTF3—After delineating the consensus binding motif for R4, we subjected repeat domains 1–3 and 5 to the same SELEX procedure to test the hypothesis that different repeats might exhibit distinct sequence preferences. All repeats were subjected to four selection cycles. To assess the enrichment of binding-competent oligonucleotides, aliquots of all cycles were radiolabeled and tested in GST pull-down assays for their ability to interact with their cognate GTF2I-like repeats. In addition, R4 was included to determine whether the enriched sequences were selectively recognized by the respective repeat or whether they also interacted with R4. As shown in Fig. 4, no specific enrichment of binding-competent oligonucleotides was observed for R1. This result suggests that repeat domain 1 does not exhibit detectable DNA binding properties despite its sequence similarities to R4. Likewise, R2 apparently did not interact robustly with the R2-selected SELEX oligonucleotide pools. However, incubation of these pools with R4 revealed a clear increase in the fraction of binding-competent sequences. A likely explanation for these seemingly contradictory observations is that R2 exhibits very weak but specific DNA binding properties. The affinity was apparently strong enough to allow for enrichment of specific sequences by SELEX (note that even very small amounts of selected oligonucleotides will subsequently be greatly amplified by PCR). However, the binding was probably too weak to be directly detectable in pull-down assays. Based on the observed interaction with R4, we speculate that the selected sequences conform, or are very similar to, the consensus motif delineated for R4. In contrast to R2, repeat 3 exhibited significant DNA binding activity even with the unselected SELEX oligonucleotide library. It was only modestly augmented in subsequent selection cycles, suggesting that the specific sequence recognized by R3 was not complex. The interaction between R3-selected sequences and R4 protein was weak and remained almost unchanged across the four cycles examined. The fact that some selection occurred with R3 (starting from ∼50% and increasing to 70% relative binding efficiency) and that R3 does not bind efficiently to sequen"

Recruitment of cells involved in the cellular defense against pathogens is mediated by an armada of cell surface proteins, chemokines, complement factors, and leucotriens. The receptors that mediate the action of these factors all belong to the large family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; IP, inositol phosphate; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1. and constitute within this family structural classes sharing sequence similarities and common transduction pathways (1Thelen M. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition to the well known repertoire of CC and CXC chemokine receptors, there are several orphan GPCRs that share structural similarities with chemokine and other chemoattractant receptors and that are currently under intensive investigation. Less attention, however, has been directed to pseudogenes of chemoattractant receptors, among them GPR33, which was identified as a pseudogene in human but as an intact gene in mouse (2Marchese A. Nguyen T. Malik P. Xu S. Cheng R. Xie Z. Heng H.H. George S.R. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The human GPR33 gene contains a premature stop codon within the coding sequence of the second intracellular loop but no other obvious structural defects, suggesting a recent inactivation of the receptor. Its close structural relation to ChemR23, a chemokine receptor for chemerin and SIV co-receptor (3Samson M. Edinger A.L. Stordeur P. Rucker J. Verhasselt V. Sharron M. Govaerts C. Mollereau C.

By screening all vertebrate classes it turned out that GPR33 arose together with the first mammals. The analysis of GPR33 orthologs revealed an almost simultaneous inactivation in humans, several apes, as well as in several rodent species about 0.5-1 million years ago. Our data provide evidence for a selective pressure to inactivate this chemoattractant GPCR. However, a small fraction of the human population still harbors an intact GPR33 allele. Our finding may be of great medical relevance because mutational inactivation of other chemokine GPCRs, such as CCR5 and Duffy, are associated with resistance to infections by HIV-1 and by Plasmodium vivax, respectively (5Samson M.

Cloning of gpr33 Orthologs—To identify the gpr33 sequence in other vertebrates, genomic DNA samples were prepared from tissue or peripheral mononuclear blood cells of various species or were kindly provided by several other laboratories (supplemental materials Table S1). Tissue samples were digested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 55 °C for 18 h. DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Based on the human and mouse GPR33 sequences (2Marchese A. Nguyen T. Malik P. Xu S. Cheng R. Xie Z. Heng H.H. George S.R. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), sets of degenerated primer pairs (supplemental materials Table S2) were applied to amplify gpr33-specific sequences. PCR were performed with Taq polymerase under variable annealing and elongation conditions. Specific PCR products were directly sequenced and/or subcloned for sequencing into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). In case of heterozygosity, allelic separation was performed by subcloning and subsequent sequencing. Sequencing reactions were performed on PCR products with a dye-terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3700 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Based on considerable sequence similarities of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of gpr33 genes, primers were designed (supplemental materials Table S2) that allowed for the identification of sequences encoding the N and C termini of mammalian GPR33 orthologs. gpr33 Sequence Analyses in Human, Chimpanzee, Bonobo, and Rat Samples—To screen large sample sets for the presence of the TGA allelic variant we established a restriction analysis. Because the TGA codon 140 and the flanking sequence does not contain a suitable site for restriction analysis, we designed a one-base mismatch antisense primer (DdeI-AS 5′-AATGCTGGAAGCCCAGCGCGGGGcTC-3′) that introduces a new DdeI restriction site in the PCR product if TGA codon 140 is present. Together with a sense primer (DdeI-S 5′-CTGGAACTTTGGAACTGCCTTGTGC-3′) PCR resulted in a 166-bp fragment. The reactions were initiated with denaturation at 92 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 92 °C for 20 s, annealing at 55 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 20 s. A final extension step was performed at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were treated with DdeI (37 °C overnight) and separated in a 3% agarose gel. In the case of the TGA allele, the 166-bp PCR product was cleaved into two fragments (139 and 27 bp). Uncut fragments were always sequenced. This DdeI restriction analysis was performed for 1217 human individuals (for details, see supplemental materials Table S3). The DNA sample collection containing mostly samples of the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphism Human panel, a panel representing all major linguistic groups (DNA panel from Ref. 8Kaessmann H. Heissig F. von Haeseler A. Pääbo S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), 45 individuals from Papua New Guinea (kindly provided by Mark Stoneking), and 21 Yoruba individuals (International HapMap Project), was used. To search for individual variations we sequenced the GPR33 coding region in 85 humans (DNA panel from Ref. 8Kaessmann H. Heissig F. von Haeseler A. Pääbo S. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), PCR fragments were amplified with genomic DNA samples and primers (hu-32, 5′-ACTGTTTCTCACTCCACAGGTC-3′ and hu-33, 5′-CTATTGGTATAATTGACCAAGTGC-3′). Genomic DNA (100 ng) was used in the PCR (50 μl) with primers (10 pmol each), standard buffer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dNTP (200 μm), and Taq polymerase (1 unit; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reactions were initiated with denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min. A final extension step was performed at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated in a 1% agarose gel, purified by using a PCR Product Purification Kit (Qiagen), and sequenced. For dating purposes several kilobase 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of human, chimpanzee, bonobo, Rattus rattus, and Rattus norvegicus were amplified by PCR and directly sequenced (supplemental materials Tables S4 and S5). Similarly, the coding region of the human GPR33 and approximately 4 kb of the 3′-flanking region were sequenced from 21 Yoruba individuals (International HapMap Project) and analyzed for signatures of positive selection using the D-tests of Tajima (9Tajima F. Genetics. 1989; 123: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Fu and Li (10Fu Y.X. Li W.H. Genetics. 1993; 133: 693-709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the allelic variance in rat gpr33, genomic DNA was prepared from 114 wild-caught R. norvegicus from different parts of Germany (Nordrhein-Westfalen, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Berlin-Brandenburg), 5 wild-caught R. norvegicus from Russia (Siberia), 6 wild-caught R. norvegicus from the United States (Alaska), 2 wild-caught R. norvegicus from Japan, 2 wild-caught R. rattus from Germany (Berlin-Brandenburg), and 4 wild-caught R. rattus from Paraguay. gpr33 coding regions were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Sequence Analyses and Age Estimates—Nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments were made with the Clustal X program (11Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35609) Google Scholar). Maximum likelihood trees reconstructed with the PHYLIP software package (12Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), version 3.6a2.1. University of Washington, Seattle, WA2001Google Scholar) and the neighbor-joining method (13Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) gave essentially similar results. Bootstrap replications were conducted to assess the reliability of the trees. The expected age of a selected allele at a given population frequency is a well studied problem. However, in this case, we only know the sample frequency of the derived allele, not the population frequency. Griffiths (14Griffiths R.C. Theor. Popul. Biol. 2003; 64: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) investigated various properties of a derived allele given the sample frequency under a range of models. The approach makes use of a diffusion process, which is the large population limit of a wide range of random mating, constant population size models. The derived allele appears in the population at an arbitrarily small frequency, after a single mutational event. We have implemented the approach of Griffiths (14Griffiths R.C. Theor. Popul. Biol. 2003; 64: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to evaluate the expected age of an allele given its sample frequency under a model of genic selection and under a neutral model. Specifically, Griffiths (14Griffiths R.C. Theor. Popul. Biol. 2003; 64: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) derives the joint probability density function of the population frequency of the allele and its age given the sample frequency. From this, we computed the expected age of an allele for a given sample frequency by numerically integrating the conditional expectation of the age of the allele given a population frequency over the marginal distribution of the population frequency conditional on the sample frequency. This approach yields the expected age in time scaled in units of 2Ne, generations where Ne is the effective population size of the species. Thus, an estimate of Ne and of the generation time is required to translate the age into years. We used a generation time of 25 for humans and 20 for chimpanzee and orangutan, and estimates of Ne reported in Table II. Because nothing is known about the effective population size of siamang, we omit the species from this analysis.Table IIAge estimates for the pseudogene allelesSpeciesNo. of chromosomes surveyedNo. of copies of pseudogene alleleEstimate of NeaThe expected age of a selected allele at a given population frequency was evaluated under a model of genic selection and under a neutral model (see “Experimental Procedures”) based on Ne values for humans (42) and for chimpanzee and orangutan (20).

Except of the wild-type and the Stop140 alleles no further sequence variations or evidences of recombination were observed within the coding region of GPR33. Age estimates were performed on the basis of these sequencing resultse There is also a distinct gene disruption mutation present twice in the sample. We estimated the expected age of a selected allele (Stop39/Arg140) ignoring interference between themf The two estimates are for the two positions at which the mutation could occur in the genealogy. Please note that the GENETREE approach assumes no recombination. Whereas there is no evidence for recombination in the coding region of GPR33, this does not preclude that recombination occurred in the history of the sample. Thus, the results of this analysis should be interpreted with careg ND, not determined Open table in a new tab To obtain a second estimate of the age of the allele, assuming neutrality, we first used the program PHASE version 2.1 to infer haplotypes from genotypes, using default parameters and multiple runs to check the accuracy of the results (15Stephens M. Smith N.J. Donnelly P. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 978-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6470) Google Scholar). We then used the GENETREE program to estimate the age of the mutation (16Griffiths R.C. Tavaré S. Donnelly P. Tavaré S. Progress in Population Genetics and Human Evolution. Springer-Verlag, New York1997: 165-182Google Scholar). The program finds the maximum likelihood estimate of the age of the allele for a given population mutation rate, θ, through neutral coalescent simulations conditional on the full polymorphism data set. The age was evaluated for the estimate of Watterson (17Watterson G.A. Theor. Popul. Biol. 1975; 7: 256-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (3001) Google Scholar), θ, based on the number of segregating sites in the sample. Construction of Wild-type and Mutant GPR33, Cell Culture, Transfection, and Functional Assays—Full-length GPR33 sequences were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDps. The human and mouse GPR33 were tagged with an N-terminal hemagglutinin and a C-terminal FLAG epitope. The GPR33 mutation (A125D) was introduced into the hemagglutinin-tagged version of the murine Gpr33 using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and restriction fragment replacement strategy. The identity of the various constructs and the correctness of all PCR-derived sequences were confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator. Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for transient transfection of COS-7 cells. Thus, cells were split into 12-well plates (1.5 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with a total amount of 1 μg of plasmid DNA/well. To measure inositol phosphate (IP) formation, transfected COS-7 cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml of myo-[3H]inositol (18.6 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 18 h. Thereafter, cells were washed once with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Intracellular IP levels were determined by anion-exchange chromatography as described (18Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Immunofluorescence Studies—To estimate cell surface expression of receptors carrying an N-terminal hemagglutinin tag, we used an indirect cellular enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (19Schöneberg T. Sandig V. Wess J. Gudermann T. Schultz G. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 1547-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies were carried out to examine the subcellular distribution of the human GPR33. COS-7 cells were transferred into 6-well plates containing sterilized glass coverslips and transfected. Approximately 48 h later, cells were fixed, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, and probed with a monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody (10 μg of 12CA5/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) and an affinity purified rabbit anti-FLAG antibody (10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline). The primary antibodies were detected using species-specific TRITC- and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibodies (Sigma). Fluorescence images were obtained with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Jena, Jena, Germany). GPR33 Pseudogenes Are Polymorphic in Human and Several Ape Species—Here, we followed the evolutionary trail of an orphan chemoattractant GPCR, GPR33, which was originally identified as a pseudogene in humans (2Marchese A. Nguyen T. Malik P. Xu S. Cheng R. Xie Z. Heng H.H. George S.R. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1998; 50: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The human GPR33 gene contains a stop codon within the coding sequence of the second intracellular loop that leads to a premature termination of translation (see supplemental materials Fig. S1). To investigate if the inactivation of GPR33 is recent in primate evolution, we amplified and sequenced the gpr33 orthologs in the great apes and gibbons. Surprisingly, different inactivating nonsense mutations were found together with intact variants in our samples of chimpanzees, orangutans, and siamangs (Fig. 1, Table I). The positions of most stop codons within the gpr33 genes were different from the one (Stop140) truncating the human GPR33. However, the same Stop140 mutation as in humans was also identified in two chimpanzee individuals (Table I). Because a polymorphism in the ancestor of humans and chimpanzees is highly unlikely to persist for over 5 million years (20Kaessmann H. Pääbo S. J. Intern. Med. 2002; 251: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), this is likely to be the result of two mutations at the same site. Two observations strengthen this interpretation: first, the site is at a CpG, a dinucleotide known to experience an elevated mutation rate (21Cooper D.N. Krawczak M. Hum. Genet. 1989; 83: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Second, an allelic variant at another site (silent C to T transition codon 305) is in complete linkage disequilibrium with the Stop140 mutation in the chimpanzee sample, but is absent from the human sample. Thus, it appears that the Stop140 mutation was introduced independently in the human and chimpanzee lineages in the last 5 million years after the human-chimpanzee split (20Kaessmann H. Pääbo S. J. Intern. Med. 2002; 251: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An extensive sequence analysis of 17 additional primates did not reveal any other GPR33 orthologs with an obvious gene inactivation (Fig. 1), suggesting that gpr33 pseudogenization is restricted to hominoids among primates.Table IGPR33 allele frequency in Hominoidea Polymorphic GPR33 inactivation (bold) was found in humans (see Fig. 2 and supplemental materials Table S3 for sample origins), chimpanzees, orangutans, and siamangs. The allele combinations found and the numbers of individuals carrying them were determined by direct sequencing the GPR33 coding region from species and populations indicated.Species (number of individuals investigated)Allele 1-allele 2Number of individualsHuman (1217)Arg140-Arg1401Arg140-Stop14050Stop140-Stop1401166Chimpanzee (9)Ser39/Arg140-Ser39/Arg1405Ser39/Arg140-Stop39/Arg1402Ser39/Stop140-Stop39/Arg1402Orangutan (4)His171-His1712His171-Stop1711Stop171-Stop1711Siamang (3)Trp94-Stop943 Open table in a new tab Because the Stop140 was introduced in the human GPR33 after speciation, we determined the Stop140 allele frequency in 1217 individuals representing all major linguistic groups by DdeI restriction analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). The inactive allele (TGA, Stop140) was present in all parts of the world at high frequency (Fig. 2, Table I). Thus, it is likely that GPR33 inactivation occurred before the last migration of Africa about 50,000-100,000 years ago (20Kaessmann H. Pääbo S. J. Intern. Med. 2002; 251: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we identified individuals that were heterozygous (n = 50) or homozygous (n = 1) for an allele resistant to DdeI cleavage. In all latter individuals the entire GPR33 coding region was sequenced. Sequencing revealed the Stop140 allele and the ancestral sequence of codon 140 (CGA, Arg140, intact receptor protein) in heterozygous individuals. One individual was homozygous for the ancestral allele. Fig. 2 shows the geographic distribution of the GPR33 pseudogene and the intact allele that was found with a 2.1% frequency in 2434 alleles screened (Table I). GPR33 Pseudogenes Predominantly Occur in Rodents and Primates but Not in Other Mammals—To find out if GPR33 inactivation is unique to hominoids, we set out to identify GPR33 orthologs from all vertebrate classes (mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes) by an extensive PCR-based ortholog cloning strategy (22Schulz A. Schöneberg T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35531-35541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GPR33 orthologs were found in eutherians and marsupials (supplemental materials Table S1) but not in other vertebrate clades tested. Data base search of the available fish genomes (zebrafish, fugu, and tetraodon) and the chicken genome revealed no putative GPR33 homologues. The absence of GPR33 in amphibians, birds, and reptiles implies that the receptor is less than ∼310 million years old (23Kumar S. Hedges S.B. Nature. 1998; 392: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar). All attempts to amplify the gpr33 sequence from two monotremes, platypus and echidna, failed. This in turn implies that GPR33 arose 125-190 million years ago (24Ji Q. Luo Z.X. Yuan C.X. Wible J.R. Zhang J.P. Georgi J.A. Nature. 2002; 416: 816-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 25Woodburne M.O. Rich T.H. Springer M.S. Mol. Phylogenet. Evol. 2003; 28: 360-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or alternatively, was lost in the monotreme lineage. Next, we analyzed GPR33 orthologs from 121 species representing 16 of a total of 18 existing eutherian orders (26Wilson D.E. Reeder D.M. Mammal Species of the World. Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D. C.1993Google Scholar). Gpr33 pseudogenes generated by frame shifting deletions or insertions were found in two gerbil species, the laboratory rat, the Syrian hamster, the European mole and, as a polymorphic stop mutation, in the yellow-toothed cavy. In other ordinal clades no obvious GPR33 inactivation was found. It has been estimated that about 65% of all inactivating mutations naturally found in GPCRs are missense mutations that can only be identified by functional testing (27Schöneberg T. Schulz A. Biebermann H. Hermsdorf T. Römpler H. Sangkuhl K. Pharmacol. Ther. 2004; 104: 173-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The other third is obvious because of stop codons, deletions, or insertions. Taking in account that 5 of 25 rodent species and 4 of 27 primate species present an apparent inactivation of GPR33, we would have expected to see at least one obvious inactivation in Carnivora (19 species) and Cetartiodactyla (20 species) if gpr33 pseudogenes are as frequent in these orders as in rodents and primates (p < 0.01, Fisher's Exact Test, comparing Carnivora and Cetartiodactyla to primates and rodents). Age Estimation of GPR33 Pseudogenization in Hominoids and Rats—GPR33 pseudogenization events in hominoids and rats took place after divergence from their closest living relative. To further delimit the time point of GPR33 inactivation in great apes and humans, we sequenced the 5′ and 3′ non-coding genomic regions flanking intact and pseudogene GPR33 alleles of human, chimpanzee, and bonobo. Comparison of ∼5.4-kb homologous genomic sequence revealed an average of 9.6 mutations/1,000 bp between chimpanzee and human alleles (supplemental materials Table S6). Assuming that half of the mutations occurred in humans and chimpanze"
https://openalex.org/W2021420691,"Calcineurin B homologous protein 1 (CHP1), also known as p22, is a calcium-binding EF-hand protein that plays a role in membrane trafficking. It binds to multiple effector proteins, including Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers, a serine/threonine kinase, and calcineurin, potentially modulating their function. The crystal structure of calcium-bound CHP1 from rat has been determined at 2.2 Å of resolution. The molecule has a compact α-helical structure containing four EF-hands. The overall folding topology of the protein is similar to that of the regulatory B subunit of calcineurin and to that of calcium- and integrin-binding protein. The calcium ion is coordinated in typical fashion in the third and fourth EF-hands, but the first and second EF-hands contain no calcium ion. The first EF-hand is maintained by internal interactions, and the second EF-hand is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. CHP1 contains a hydrophobic pocket on the opposite side of the protein to the EF-hands that has been implicated in ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2044508449,"The aim of this study was to investigate (a) whether Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) participates in the regulation of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase and (b) its possible cross-talk with other kinase-mediated modulatory pathways of the pump. Using isolated innervated membranes of the electrocytes from Electrophorus electricus L., we found that stimulation of endogenous protein kinase A (PKA) strongly phosphorylated membrane-bound CaM kinase II with simultaneous substantial activation of the Ca2+ pump (≈2-fold). The addition of cAMP (5-50 pm), forskolin (10 nm), or cholera toxin (10 or 100 nm) stimulated both CaM kinase II phosphorylation and Ca2+-ATPase activity, whereas these activation processes were cancelled by an inhibitor of the PKA α-catalytic subunit. When CaM kinase II was blocked by its specific inhibitor KN-93, the Ca2+-ATPase activity decreased to the levels measured in the absence of calmodulin; the unusually high Ca2+ affinity dropped 2-fold; and the PKA-mediated stimulation of Ca2+-ATPase was no longer seen. Hydroxylamine-resistant phosphorylation of the Ca2+-ATPase strongly increased when the PKA pathway was activated, and this phosphorylation was suppressed by inhibition of CaM kinase II. We conclude that CaM kinase II is an intermediate in a complex regulatory network of the electrocyte Ca2+ pump, which also involves calmodulin and PKA.

The electrocytes of the electric organs from Electrophorus electricus L. are specialized structures that generate electric potentials and produce electric discharges similar to those of nerve and muscle (1Schoffeniels E. Chagas C. Paes de Carvalho A. Bioelectrogenesis: A Comparative Survey of Its Mechanisms with Particular Emphasis on Electric Fishes. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1961: 147-165Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that passive Ca2+ translocation across the membranes of the electrocytes plays a crucial role in the transmission of impulses within the electric organ (2Esquibel M.A. Effect of Calcium and Magnesium on the Neuroelectric Synapses. Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil1970Google Scholar) and that Ca2+ fluxes from the extracellular milieu toward the cytosolic compartment require a huge inwardly directed Ca2+ electrochemical gradient to be maintained (3Carafoli E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Among different mechanisms, the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase is responsible for fine-tuning of that Ca2+ disequilibrium (3Carafoli E. Physiol.

The smaller functional units of the electric organ present in E. electricus L. are the asymmetrically shaped cells called electrocytes, stacked one after another along the axis of the fish (13Gotter A.L. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1998; 119: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). One face of the electrocyte is innervated, whereas the other is not (14Almeida D.F. Castro G.O. Miranda M. Chagas C. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 29: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and electrocytes are organized in a capacitor-like structure that allows current flow during discharges (13Gotter A.L. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1998; 119: 225-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exclusively localized in the innervated face, acetylcholine receptors generate endplate potentials, triggering action potentials (15Keynes R.D. Martins-Ferreira H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1953; 119: 315-351Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar); the Na+ concentration is restored by the abundant (Na+ + K+)-ATPase resident in both faces (16Lowe J. Araujo G.M. Pedrenho A.R.

With respect to Ca2+ fluxes, an ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake was described in membranes derived from the electroplax (17Oliveira M.M. Machado R.D. Chagas C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Connor C.G. Turner R. Dedman J.R. Mol. Cell.

The aim of this work was to investigate whether CaM and CaM kinase II interact in a regulatory fashion in the electrocyte Ca2+-ATPase and also their possible interaction with protein kinase A (PKA).

(Paris). 1972; 274: 1526-1529Google Scholar), where phosphorylation events involving PKA appear to be implicated in the modulation of channel-mediated ion fluxes in the electric membranes (35Emerick M.C. Agnew W.S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8367-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Evidence for a coupling between CaM and CaM kinase II in regulating Ca2+-ATPase is described, as well as their interplay with a cAMP stimulatory pathway. This complex regulation of the Ca2+-ATPase (which was found asymmetrically concentrated in the excitable face of the cell) might be indicative of its important role in modulating the electric and chemical activities of the electroplax from E. electricus L. Materials—ATP, cAMP, ouabain, dl-dithiothreitol, β-mercaptoethanol, trifluoperazine dihydrochloride (TFP), cholera toxin (CTx), molecular mass markers, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. The CaM kinase II inhibitor KN-93 (N-(2-(N-(chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylaminomethyl)phenyl)-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methoxybenzene-sulfonamide) was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. The PKA α-catalytic subunit inhibitors (PKIα), peptide 5-24 and the heat-stable inhibitor (equally efficient at nanomolar concentrations), were from Sigma and Calbiochem-Novabiochem, respectively. Forskolin was from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). Deionized water was obtained from a Nanopure II system (Sybron-Barnstead, Newton, MA). All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Preparation of CaM-containing Electrocyte Membranes—E. electricus L. specimens were supplied by the Museu Paraense Emílio Goeldi (Belém, Para, Brazil) and were transported and kept in an aquarium. They were anesthetized with ice-cold water containing 2% urethane and killed by decapitation. Plasma membrane fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation of homogenates of the main electric organ using a sucrose gradient (16Lowe J. Araujo G.M. Pedrenho A.R. Nunes-Tavares N. Ribeiro M.G. Hassón-Voloch A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1661: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The main electric organs of electric fishes (200-500 g of tissue) were dissected and minced in 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaI, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The fragments were then homogenized in a Virtis apparatus for 1 min at its maximal speed and left overnight in a cold room under gentle stirring. The next day, the homogenate was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4); rehomogenized in a blender (three periods of 20 s); and left again overnight. The suspension was filtered with gauze and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 30 min, and the recovered supernatant was centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The sediment containing a fraction enriched with membranes of the anterior non-innervated face (NF) of the electrocyte (14Almeida D.F. Castro G.O. Miranda M. Chagas C. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 29: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose. The corresponding supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 h, and the final sediment containing the membranes of the posterior innervated face (IF) of the electrocyte (14Almeida D.F. Castro G.O. Miranda M. Chagas C. Exp. Cell Res. 1963; 29: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) was also resuspended in 250 mm sucrose. These membrane fractions were stored in small flasks under liquid N2. In the IF fraction used in most of the experiments of this work, cytochemical and freeze-fracture studies have shown vesicles together with membrane sheets (36de Souza W. Benchimol M. Somló C. Machado R.D. Hassón-Voloch A. Cell Tissue Res. 1979; 202: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Even though there is a larger number of right-side-out vesicles, as in other plasma membrane preparations (37Boumendil-Podevin E.F. Podevin R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), there is also a population of sealed inside-out vesicles that allows measurement of ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ accumulation in their lumen. Protein determination was carried out using the Folin-phenol method (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Preparation of CaM-depleted Membranes—CaM-depleted innervated membranes were obtained after incubation in mild alkaline (pH 7.8) hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 2 mm EDTA) according to Niggli et al. (23Niggli V. Adunyah E.S. Penniston J.T. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 395-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the membranes (0.2 mg/ml) were preincubated for 10 min in Eppendorf tubes in ice-cold hypotonic buffer. The samples were then centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min, and the sediment was recovered for protein determination and Ca2+-ATPase activity as described (12Tortelote G.G. Valverde R.H.F. Lemos T. Guilherme A. Einicker-Lamas M. Vieyra A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 576: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase Activity Determination—Except when indicated otherwise, the reaction medium for the Ca2+-ATPase activity assay contained 50 mm BisTris propane buffer (pH 7.4), 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaN3, 200 μm EGTA, and the CaCl2 concentrations needed for the desired free Ca2+ concentrations. Except when the Ca2+ concentration dependence was studied, free Ca2+ was kept at 0.5 μm. Free Ca2+ was calculated using a computer program that took into account the different species involved in the equilibrium between EGTA, Ca2+, ATP, Mg2+, H+, and K+ (39Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Coan C. Lewis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3025-3031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Sorenson M.M. Coelho H.S. Reuben J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The temperature of the assay was 37 °C. The membranes (0.2 mg/ml) were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 3 mm ouabain and the compounds indicated in the corresponding figures and figure legends. The reaction was started by the addition of reaction medium to the preincubated membranes and was arrested after 10 min with 1 volume of activated charcoal in 0.1 n HCl. After centrifugation, aliquots of the supernatants were removed to measure the amount of released Pi following the method of Taussky and Shorr (41Taussky H.H. Shorr E. J. Biol. Chem. 1953; 202: 675-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase activity was calculated after subtraction of the activity measured in the presence of 2 mm EGTA. Calculation of Kinetic Parameters for Ca2+-ATPase Activity—Data for Ca2+-ATPase activity at a Ca2+ concentration range from 5 nm to 200 μm were simulated with Kinsim (42Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar), assuming a simplified four-step catalytic cycle with 1:1 stoichiometry of Ca2+ to ATP (3Carafoli E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1), where k1Cacyt, k2ATP, k3, and k4 are the rate constants of steps 1-4 in the forward direction of the cycle (ATP consumption), respectively, and k-1, k-2ADP, k-3Caext, and k-4Pi are the corresponding rate constants in the backward direction (ATP synthesis). The equilibrium constants K1 = k-1/k1 and K3 = k3/k-3 define the Ca2+ dissociation constants at steps 1 (high affinity stimulatory site) and 3 (low affinity inhibitory site), respectively. Simulations were performed by defining a set of values for the rate constants and setting [ATP] and [Ca2+] to the experimental values. The Ca2+-ATPase activity, calculated at steady state for each [Ca2+], displayed a bell shape dependence on [Ca2+] as the experimental curve. Because various sets of rate constants (Scheme 1) could simulate the same experimental curve, we defined overall parameters that could be directly evaluated from the activity measurements. These parameters are K, the apparent dissociation constant for Ca2+ at the high affinity site; K′, the apparent dissociation constant for Ca2+ at the low affinity site; and Vmax, the maximal activity. It was assumed for simplification that (a) [ATP] and [Ca2+] are constant during the assays (hydrolysis of the nucleotide was <2%; free Ca2+ ≪ total Ca2+, and therefore, it can be considered constant even though there was a small parcel of sealed inside-out vesicles) (see Fig. 2); and (b) the reverse phosphoryl transfer reactions are slow, so that k-2[ADP] (ADP binding and ATP synthesis) and k-4[Pi] (phosphorylation by Pi) are set to zero and k2[ATP] is replaced by k2′. According to the cycle described above (Scheme 1), Ca2+-ATPase can be viewed as a transporter of cytosolic Ca2+, which is inhibited by extracellular Ca2+, and its ATPase activity is as follows ((Eq. 1), (Eq. 2), (Eq. 3), (Eq. 4), (Eq. 5)). V/Eo=Vmax×[Ca2+]cyt/([Ca2+]ext[Ca2+]cyt/K'+[Ca2+]cyt+K)(Eq. 1) Eo=E+CaE+CaE∼P+E-P(Eq. 2) K=K1(k4/k2'+k4/k-1)/(1+k4/k3+k4/k2')(Eq. 3) K'=K3(1+k4/k3+k4/k2')(Eq. 4) Vmax=k4/(1+k4/k3+k4/k2')(Eq. 5) Considering again that, in our experiments, there was only a small parcel of sealed inside-out vesicles (36de Souza W. Benchimol M. Somló C. Machado R.D. Hassón-Voloch A. Cell Tissue Res. 1979; 202: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), it can be also assumed for simplification that there is no Ca2+ gradient across most of the Ca2+-ATPase molecules (extracellular [Ca2+] = cytosolic [Ca2+]), and thus, Equation 1 becomes Equation 6. V/Eo=Vmax×[Ca2+]/([Ca2+]2/K'+[Ca2+]+K)(Eq. 6) ATP-dependent 45Ca2+ Accumulation—Active Ca2+ transport was measured by filtration using 0.45-μm pore size filters and by liquid scintillation counting. The experiments were started by the addition of the membranes (0.2 mg/ml) to a reaction medium containing 50 mm BisTris propane buffer (pH 7.4), 125 mm K+ (Cl- plus phosphate salts), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm phosphate, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate plus 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase (to avoid ADP accumulation), 21.1 μm EGTA, and 15 μm 45CaCl2 (5 × 104 cpm/nmol; 0.5 μm free Ca2+). This combination of EGTA/calcium buffer was chosen to keep total 45CaCl2 as low as possible, thus avoiding high blank values. After 45Ca accumulation attained a plateau, concentrated A23187 (in Me2SO; final concentration of 10 μg/ml) was added to visualize the rapid 45Ca2+ release from the vesicular lumen. Active 45Ca2+ uptake was calculated after subtraction of the radioactivity found in the filters in the absence of ATP. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—After SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) of the innervated membranes, the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran™, Schleicher & Schüll) and incubated with the desired antibodies. The antibodies against plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase (clone 5f10) and N-terminal CaM kinase II (amino acids 7-20) were from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO) and Calbiochem-Novabiochem, respectively. The rabbit phospho-Ser/Thr PKA substrate polyclonal antibody was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The bound antibodies were detected using the ECL™ system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) and X-Omat™ diagnostic film (Eastman Kodak Co., Resende, Brazil). Gels of the SDS-treated membranes and molecular mass standards were run in parallel and were then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Determination of CaM content in the IF was carried out by densitometric analysis of gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue using purified bovine brain CaM as a standard. Hydroxylamine-resistant Phosphorylation of Ca2+-ATPase—Direct regulatory phosphorylation of the Ca2+ pump was assayed as described previously for the Na+ pump (43Caruso-Neves C. Rangel L.B. Vives D. Vieyra A. Coka-Guevara S. Lopes A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1468: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the membranes were preincubated for 15 min with the reaction medium employed to measure ATPase activity (0.5 μm Ca2+; no ATP) in the presence of CTx, KN-93, and PKIα in the combinations described in the legend to Fig. 9. The reaction was started by adding 2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (5 × 107 cpm/μmol), and 5 min later, the assays were mixed with a concentrated solution of hydroxylamine in 0.5 m citrate buffer (pH 5.5) to give a final concentration of 1 m. After vortexing for 5 min, the reaction was stopped with ice-cold 30% trichloroacetic acid. The samples were centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 25 min in a clinical centrifuge, and the precipitates were washed three times with citrate buffer and immediately used for protein determination and SDS-PAGE (7.5% acrylamide). The gels were exposed for 6 h to a phosphor screen and analyzed using a PhosphorImager to measure the intensity of the 140-kDa 32P-phosphorylated bands recognized by antibody 5f10. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was measured in membranes derived from both the IFs and NFs of polarized electrocytes. As shown in Fig. 1A, the activity was 10-fold higher in the IF compared with that in the NF. Because the acetylcholinesterase activity (the marker of the IF) is 10-fold lower in the NF (16Lowe J. Araujo G.M. Pedrenho A.R. Nunes-Tavares N. Ribeiro M.G. Hassón-Voloch A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1661: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the Ca2+-ATPase activity of this fraction probably reflects contamination with contralateral membranes. Thus, in this work, we examined the regulation of the Ca2+-ATPase resident in the IF. Fig. 1A (inset) shows the immunodetection of a band of 140 kDa recognized by monoclonal antibody 5f10, raised against a common epitope between amino acids 724 and 783 of the human erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase, which are conserved in all isoforms of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (22Guerini D. Cell Tissue Res. 1998; 292: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 44Borke J.L. Caride A. Verma A.K. Penniston J.T. Kumar R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: R842-R849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the enzyme of electrocyte origin shares structural properties with other Ca2+-ATPases of the P2-type ATPase family (20Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To investigate Ca2+ affinities of the pump in this especially CaM- and CaM kinase II-rich system (30Gotter A.L. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1997; 118: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), the dependence of ATPase activity on the free Ca2+ concentration was studied. The biphasic variation of the activity in the presence of increasing free calcium concentrations ranging from 5 nm to 200 μm is shown in Fig. 1B. Fitting Equation 6 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to the experimental data allows to determine the values for the three global parameters defined above (Equations 3-5) as K = 21 nm, K′= 12 μm, and Vmax = 16 nmol of Pi/mg/min, therefore revealing an enzyme with an extremely high affinity for Ca2+. Fig. 1C shows that there was no difference in Ca2+-ATPase activity in either the absence or presence of thapsigargin, indicating that contamination of the preparation with reticular membranes is negligible (45Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the sealed inside-out vesicles present in the preparation (36de Souza W. Benchimol M. Somló C. Machado R.D. Hassón-Voloch A. Cell Tissue Res. 1979; 202: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), as in others (37Boumendil-Podevin E.F. Podevin R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 735: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), were able to accumulate 45Ca2+ in their lumen in the presence of 0.5 μm free Ca2+ (Fig. 2). This capacity to transport Ca2+ at a concentration that also stimulated hydrolytic activity (Fig. 1B) and at comparable initial rates (Fig. 2, inset) gives strong support to the view that the Ca2+-ATPase activity is due to the electrocyte Ca2+ pump. Fig. 3A shows the response of electrocyte Ca2+-ATPase to CaM depletion and CaM inactivation. When the membranes were depleted of their endogenous CaM, Ca2+-ATPase activity decreased to 50% of the control value measured in the untreated preparation (calmodulin-containing membranes (CCM)), a maximal activity that could be restored after the addition of 50 nm CaM. The same 50% inhibition was seen in the presence of the well known CaM antagonist TFP (46Yamaotsu N. Suga M. Hirono S. Biopolymers. 2000; 58: 410-421Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which had no effect on calmodulin-depleted membranes (CDM). In addition, the Ca2+ curve of ATPase activity in the presence of 50 μm TFP showed an apparent >10-fold lower Ca2+ affinity (data not shown), reaching a value similar to that found for the non-poisoned plasma membrane Ca2+ pump from other different sources in the presence of CaM (3Carafoli E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Densitometric comparison of the CaM content of the IF (40 μg of the total protein) with a purified standard (2.5 μg) allowed us to estimate that CaM corresponds to ≈5% of the total IF proteins (Fig. 3B, inset), in agr"
