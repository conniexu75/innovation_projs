https://openalex.org/W2006503491,"A series of organic salts, in which the cation has been designed to have a large molecular hyperpolarizability, has been prepared. Variation of the counterion (anion) in many cases leads to materials with large powder second harmonic generation efficiencies, the highest of which is roughly 1000 times that of a urea reference."

Barley, corn, wheat, and wild oat leaves show a similar response. Increased arginine decarboxylase activity parallels the rise in putrescine, whereas ornithine decarboxylase remains unchanged. DL-alpha-Difluoromethylarginine, a specific irreversible inhibitor of arginine decarboxylase, prevents the stress-induced rise in increase in arginine decarboxylase activity and putrescine synthesis, indicating the preferential activation of this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2062746302,"An important parasitic threat to honey bees, the mite Varroa jacobsoni, is attracted to its major prey, drone larvae, by methyl and ethyl esters of straight-chain fatty acids, in particular methyl palmitate. These esters were extracted from drone larvae with n-hexane and were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Their behavioral effect was evaluated with the use of a four-arm airflow olfactometer."
https://openalex.org/W2004264742,"Molecular velocities have been measured inside a hypersonic, normal shock wave, where the gas experiences rapid changes in its macroscopic properties. As first hypothesized by Mott-Smith, but never directly observed, the molecular velocity distribution exhibits a qualitatively bimodal character that is derived from the distribution functions on either side of the shock. Quantitatively correct forms of the molecular velocity distribution function in highly nonequilibrium flows can be calculated, by means of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo technique."
https://openalex.org/W2068696985,"The effect of variations in cloud cover, optical properties, and fractional distribution with altitude on the mean surface temperature of a model of the early earth has been investigated. In all cases examined, cloud-climate feedbacks result in temperatures greater than those in models with no cloud feedbacks. If the model of hydrospheric feedback effects is correct, then cloud feedbacks are as important to the climate as changes in solar luminosity and atmospheric composition during the earth's atmospheric evolution. In particular, the early earth need not become completely ice-covered if strong negative cloud feedbacks occur. However, until a proper understanding of cloud feedbacks is available, conclusions regarding conditions in the early atmosphere must remain in doubt."
https://openalex.org/W2007020723,The detoxification capabilities of the predatory mite Amblyseius fallacis and its herbivorous prey Tetranychus urticae are fundamentally different. The activities of mixed-function oxidase and trans-epoxide hydrolase are higher in the prey than in the predator; those of cis-epoxide hydrolase and glutathione transferase are lower; and esterase activity is similar. Dissimilarities may be related both to differing adaptations to plant allelochemicals and to the higher respiration rate of the predator. Hydrolytic and conjugating reactions appear more important than oxidative pathways in imparting organophosphate resistance to these acarines. These resistances provide insecticide selectivity favorable to the predator and improved integrated pest control.

https://openalex.org/W2057810446,"Several measures are used to delineate the remarkable growth in the Japanese technological position over the last decade. The share of U.S. patents issued to Japanese inventors has been rising at 1 percent per year. These patents are the most frequently cited patents in the U.S. system. By 1984, Japanese inventors obtained more U.S. patents than inventors in the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany combined, and the gap has been widening ever since. As measured by publications, the Japanese scientific position is more modest, with a 0.5 percent rise per year in papers and with barely average citation performance. These indicators characterize Japan as a technological powerhouse, with highly innovative technology, and an expanding but far less powerful scientific position."
https://openalex.org/W1973535000,"Much information on ionic solvation in electrolyte solutions has been inferred from macroscopic thermodynamic and transport properties and from spectroscopy. These ion-water interactions can now be probed directly and unambiguously by neutron diffraction. Such measurements have been done with neodymium trichloride solutions in heavy water that are identical in every respect except the isotopic state of the neodymium ions; these experiments yield in a straightforward manner the distribution of oxygen and deuterium atoms from the water molecules in the first hydration sphere of the neodymium ion. Each ion is surrounded by 8.6 oxygen atoms at a distance of 2.48 angstroms and 16.7 deuterium atoms at 3.13 angstroms indicating a well-defined first hydration sphere of water molecules, the deuterium atoms pointing away from the cation."

https://openalex.org/W2013536552,"A computer model of coupled ice sheet-ice shelf behavior was used to evaluate whether observed changes in atmospheric CO(2) concentration could have caused the advance and retreat of Pleistocene ice sheets in the Eurasian Arctic. For CO(2) concentrations below a threshold of approximately 250 parts per million, an extensive marine-based ice sheet covering Scandinavia, the Barents, Kara, and East Siberian seas, and parts of the Arctic Ocean developed in the model simulations. In the simulations, climatic warming associated with the Holocene rise of atmospheric CO(2) was sufficient to collapse this widespread glaciation and restore present-day ice conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2034902428,"Photochemical processes in planetary atmospheres are strongly influenced by catalytic effects of minor constituents. Catalytic cycles in the atmospheres of Earth and Venus are closely related. For example, chlorine oxides (CIOx) act as catalysts in the two atmospheres. On Earth, they serve to convert odd oxygen (atomic oxygen and ozone) to molecular oxygen. On Venus they have a similar effect, but in addition they accelerate the reactions of atomic and molecular oxygen with carbon monoxide. The latter process occurs by a unique combination of CIOx catalysis and sulfur dioxide photosensitization. The mechanism provides an explanation for the very low extent of carbon dioxide decomposition by sunlight in the Venus atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2023344114,"Skeletal structures that resist only tensile forces can scale differently than compression resisting structures that fail in bending or buckling. The tensile structures examined scalelike simple ropes: length and diameter of the structure are not correlated, and in three of four cases, length is independent of scale or load, but diameter is dependent on scale. These relations suggest that similarity in stress rather than strain, or deformational behavior, is the basis for mechanical adaptation in the gross dimensions of these tensile structures."
https://openalex.org/W1999146209,"When Earth-orbiting spacecraft are exposed to large fluxes of energetic charged particles, electric discharges occur on circuit boards, solar panels, and other dielectric surfaces. Large fluxes of energetic partides can produce such discharges on natural materials in the solar system. Surface discharges will occur under a variety of conditions, but particularly favorable environments are expected to occur within the magnetospheres of the giant planets; an example is the surface of Io."

https://openalex.org/W2019791737,"Budget cuts in fusion programs could limit research on the tokomak and linear tandem-mirror designs and preclude new alternative designs. With no guarantee that either design will reach the energy-breakeven point, unfunded alternatives will not be able to save the program. The Magnetic Fusion Advisory Committee (MFAC), formed in May 1982 to help DOE negotiate, heard arguments for throwing all efforts into proving the two mainline approaches and counterarguments for developing cheaper and safer alternatives. The history of the ELMO Bumpy Torus (EBT) proof-of-principle program illustrates the dilemma. New features in the tandem-mirror program do the same. Among the alternatives seeking research funds are the stellarator, the reversed-field pinch, and the compact-toroids concepts. (DCK)"
