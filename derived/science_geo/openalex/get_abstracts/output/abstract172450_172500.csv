https://openalex.org/W2007062612,"Successful social interaction partly depends on appraisal of others from their facial appearance. A critical aspect of this appraisal relates to whether we consider others to be trustworthy. We determined the neural basis for such trustworthiness judgments using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects viewed faces and assessed either trustworthiness or age. In a parametric factorial design, trustworthiness ratings were correlated with BOLD signal change to reveal task-independent increased activity in bilateral amygdala and right insula in response to faces judged untrustworthy. Right superior temporal sulcus (STS) showed enhanced signal change during explicit trustworthiness judgments alone. The findings extend a proposed model of social cognition by highlighting a functional dissociation between automatic engagement of amygdala versus intentional engagement of STS in social judgment."

https://openalex.org/W1974935915,"Positional cloning of hereditary deafness genes is a direct approach to identify molecules and mechanisms underlying auditory function. Here we report a locus for dominant deafness, DFNA36, which maps to human chromosome 9q13–21 in a region overlapping the DFNB7/B11 locus for recessive deafness. We identified eight mutations in a new gene, transmembrane cochlear-expressed gene 1 (TMC1), in a DFNA36 family and eleven DFNB7/B11 families. We detected a 1.6-kb genomic deletion encompassing exon 14 of Tmc1 in the recessive deafness (dn) mouse mutant, which lacks auditory responses and has hair-cell degeneration1,2. TMC1 and TMC2 on chromosome 20p13 are members of a gene family predicted to encode transmembrane proteins. Tmc1 mRNA is expressed in hair cells of the postnatal mouse cochlea and vestibular end organs and is required for normal function of cochlear hair cells."

https://openalex.org/W2042386826,"The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene is characteristically translocated in Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas (ALCL) and the juxtaposition of the ALK gene to multiple partners results in its constitutive protein tyrosine kinase activity. We show here that expression of activated ALK induces the constitutive phosphorylation of Stat3 in transfected cells as well as in primary human ALCLs. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that among distinct human B and T cell lymphomas, activation of Stat3 nuclear translocation is uniquely associated with ALK expression. NPM-ALK also binds and activates Jak3; however, Jak3 is not required for Stat3 activation or for cell transformation in vitro. Moreover, src family kinases are not necessary for NPM-ALK-mediated Stat3 activation or transformation, suggesting that Stat3 may be phosphorylated directly by ALK. To evaluate relevant targets of ALK-activated Stat3, we investigated the regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-x(L) and its role in cell survival in NPM-ALK positive cells. NPM-ALK expression caused enhanced Bcl-x(L) transcription, largely mediated by Stat3. Increased expression of Bcl-x(L) provided sufficient anti-apoptotic signals to protect cells from treatment with specific inhibitors of the Jaks/Stat pathway or the Brc-Abl kinase. These studies support a pathogenic mechanism whereby stimulation of anti-apoptotic signals through activation of Stat3 contributes to the successful outgrowth of ALK positive tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2001215449,"Ansamycin antibiotics, such as 17-allylaminogeldanamycin (17-AAG), bind to Hsp90 and regulate its function, resulting in the proteasomal degradation of a subset of signaling proteins that require Hsp90 for conformational maturation. HER2 is a very sensitive target of these drugs. Ansamycins cause RB-dependent G1 arrest that is associated with loss of D-cyclins via a PI3 kinase, Akt dependent pathway. Downregulation of D-cyclin was due, in part, to loss of Akt expression in response to drug. Moreover, in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cells, 17-AAG caused rapid inhibition of Akt activity prior to any change in Akt protein. Ansamycins caused rapid degradation of HER2 and a concomitant loss in HER3 associated PI3 kinase activity. This led to a loss of Akt activity, dephosphorylation of Akt substrates, and loss of D-cyclin expression. Introduction into cells of a constitutively membrane bound form of PI3 kinase prevented the effects of the drug on Akt activity and D-cyclins. Thus, in breast cancer cells with high HER2, Akt activation by HER2/HER3 heterodimers is required for D-cyclin expression. In murine xenograft models, non-toxic doses of 17-AAG markedly reduced the expression of HER2 and phosphorylation of Akt and inhibited tumor growth. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of Akt activation is achievable with ansamycins and may be useful for the treatment of HER2 driven tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2323327334,"Human melanoma cells growth arrest irreversibly, lose tumorigenic potential and terminally differentiate after treatment with a combination of fibroblast interferon (IFN-beta) and the protein kinase C activator mezerein (MEZ). Applying subtraction hybridization to this model differentiation system permitted cloning of melanoma differentiation associated gene-7, mda-7. Expression of mda-7 inversely correlates with melanoma development and progression, with elevated expression in normal melanocytes and nevi and increasingly reduced expression in radial growth phase, vertical growth phase and metastatic melanoma. When expressed by means of a replication incompetent adenovirus (Ad.mda-7) growth of melanoma, but not normal early passage or immortal human melanocytes, is dramatically suppressed and cells undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). Infection of metastatic melanoma cells with Ad.mda-7 results in an increase in cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle and changes in the ratio of pro-apoptotic (BAX, BAK) to anti-apoptotic (BCL-2, BCL-XL) proteins. Ad.mda-7 infection results in a temporal increase in mda-7 mRNA and intracellular MDA-7 protein in most of the melanocyte/melanoma cell lines and secretion of MDA-7 protein is readily detected following Ad.mda-7 infection of both melanocytes and melanoma cells. The present studies document a differential response of melanocytes versus melanoma cells to ectopic expression of mda-7 and support future applications of mda-7 for the gene-based therapy of metastatic melanoma."

https://openalex.org/W2329587797,"Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, including p38 kinase and SAPK/JNK, play a central role in mediating cellular response to environmental stress, growth factors and cytokines. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) is a multifunctional cytokine capable of eliciting mitogenic, motogenic and morphogenetic activities in responsive cells, and has been implicated in tumor development and metastasis. Binding of HGF/SF to its tyrosine kinase receptor c-Met stimulates multiple signal transduction pathways, leading to the activation of numerous transcription factors. We here report that HGF/SF can induce cyclin D1 expression in mouse melanoma cells, and that this up-regulation is mediated in part by the activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2). HGF/SF-mediated phosphorylation of ATF-2 was reduced in the presence of either the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor SB203580, a dominant negative p38 mutant, the SAPK/JNK inhibitor JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1), or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-specific inhibitor LY294002. Activation of p38 kinase by HGF/SF was partially blocked by the PI3K-specific inhibitor as well. The upstream kinases for p38, MKK3/6, did not become activated following HGF/SF exposure, and ATF-2 activation was undiminished by transient transfection of a dominant negative MKK6 mutant. However, transcriptional up-regulation of cyclin D1 by HGF/SF was partially inhibited by the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor, and cyclin D1 protein induction was partially blocked by a dominant negative ATF-2 mutant. Notably, the p38 kinase-specific inhibitor was able to block melanoma cell proliferation but not motility. We conclude that the ATF-2 transcription factor becomes activated by HGF/SF through p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK. Moreover, the p38-ATF-2 pathway can help mediate proliferation signals in tumor cells through transcriptional activation of key cell cycle regulators."

https://openalex.org/W1976118513,"Both the human and the mouse bax promoters contain p53 binding sites which are sufficient to confer p53-dependent transcriptional activation in a heterologous setting. Nevertheless in the context of the bax promoter, these sites do not mediate a p53-dependent response, suggesting that bax may not be a direct transcriptional target of p53. Here, data are presented identifying a conserved p53 response element in the first intron of both the human and the murine bax genes. This element both in isolation and in the context of the first intron conferred p53-dependent transcriptional activation upon a minimal promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that this sequence also is capable of mediating sequence specific binding to p53. p53 effectively activated transcription through both human and murine bax gene reporter constructs, whereas deletion of the intronic response element abrogated the p53-responsiveness of both reporters. Interestingly, tumor-derived mutants of p53 which are defective in inducing an apoptotic response retain the ability to activate transcription via the bax intronic p53 site. Since these mutants are transcriptionally inactive on the p53 site in the bax promoter, the ability of these mutants to up-regulating endogenous bax mRNA levels supports a role for the intronic element in p53-dependent up-regulation of bax expression. Taken together, these results show the requirement for a novel intronic element in the p53-dependent transcriptional activation of bax, and demonstrate that bax is indeed a direct and evolutionarily conserved transcriptional target of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2077951123,"Human telomerase is a unique reverse transcriptase that is expressed in multiple cancers, but not in the vast majority of normal cells. The enzyme is responsible for telomere protection and maintenance, and supports the proliferative immortality of cancer cells. Thus, it has been proposed that the specific inhibition of telomerase activity in tumors might have significant and beneficial therapeutic effects. To this goal we have designed, synthesized, and evaluated several oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' phosphoramidates as telomerase inhibitors. These oligonucleotides are complementary to the template region of the RNA domain of telomerase (hTR). The prepared compounds were evaluated in HME50-5E breast epithelial cells, where their effects on telomerase activity were determined using a cell-based telomerase (TRAP) assay at 24 as well as 72 h after exposure to compounds. The oligo-N3'-->P5' phosphoramidate inhibited telomerase activity in cells in the presence of the cellular up-take enhancer (FuGENE6) in a dose- and sequence-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of approximately 1 nM. Inhibition of telomerase activity by this compound without the lipid carrier was not efficient. However, the isosequential oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' thio-phosphoramidate was able to inhibit telomerase activity with or without lipid carriers at nM, or low-microM concentrations, respectively. This inhibition of telomerase activity in HME50-5E cells by the oligonucleotide thio-phosphoramidates was also sequence specific. Long-term treatment of the cells with 0.5 microM of FuGENE6 formulated 13-mer thio-phosphoramidates, fully complementary to hTR, resulted in gradual telomere shortening, followed by cellular senescence and apoptosis, as would be predicted for a telomerase inhibitor. The mismatched control compound had no effect on cell proliferation. The results suggest that the oligonucleotide N3'-->P5' phosphoramidates, and particularly thio-phosphoramidates, might be further developed as selective anti-telomerase reagents."
https://openalex.org/W2146483565,"The tumour supressor protein p53 plays a key role in the cell's decision to arrest the cell cycle or undergo apoptosis following a genotoxic insult. p53 is stabilized and activated after DNA damage, however the cascade of events signalling from DNA lesions to p53 stabilization and activation is still controversial. Poly (ADP-ribosylation) of different nuclear acceptors by PARP-1 is an early event when a single strand DNA lesion is produced. We present here evidences that interplay between PARP-1 and p53 is dependent on the type of damage induced to DNA. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from parp-1−/− mice exhibited decreased p53 accumulation and activation following γ-irradiation compared to parp-1 proficient cells. On the other hand, treatment with the single alkylating agent 2′-methyl-2′-nitrose-urea (MNU), resulted in the rapid and sustained accumulation and activation of p53 in parp-1-deficient cells, while very little accumulation was observed in parp-1+/+ cells. After IR, the turnover of the p53 inhibitory protein MDM-2 is perturbed and the level of phosphorylation of p53 at serine-15 is blunted in parp-1−/− cells. PARP-1 is determinant in the cytotoxic response to alkylating agents but only partially contributes to radiation-induced cell killing, as determined by colony forming assay. Altogether, these results suggest that PARP-1 participates in the p53 response following irradiation, resides upstream of p53 and indirectly modulates the level of phosphorylation of key substrates in this pathway while treatment with MNU results in an enhanced p53-mediated response in parp-1-null cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063833575,"Cre1 of the ascomycete Hypocrea jecorina is a Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA-binding protein functioning as regulator for carbon catabolite repression. It represents the functional equivalent of yeast Mig1, known to be negatively regulated by the Snf1-kinase at the nuclear import level. We demonstrate that Cre1 is also a phosphoprotein, and identify Ser241 within an acidic protein region as phosphorylation target. In contrast to Mig1 phosphorylation is required for DNA binding of Cre1. A S241E mutation mimics phosphorylation, whereas a S241A mutant protein shows phosphorylation-independent DNA binding activity, suggesting that phosphorylation is required to release Cre1 from an inactive conformation involving unphosphorylated Ser241. Retransformation of a H. jecorina cre1-non functional mutant with Cre1-S241A leads to permanent carbon catabolite repression in cellobiohydrolase I expression. Contrary to Mig1, the amino acid sequence surrounding Ser241 (HSNDEDD) suggests that phosphorylation may occur by a casein kinase II-like protein. This is supported by a mutation of E244V leading to loss of phosphorylation, loss of DNA binding, and gain of carbon catabolite derepression.

Carbon catabolite repression is a means by which cells manage priority use of easy and fast metabolizable carbon sources over more complex ones. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations inMIG1 or in respective binding sites in Mig1 regulated promoters partially relieve the yeast from carbon catabolite repression (1.Nehlin J.O. Ronne H.

Mig1 function is regulated by glucose-dependent nuclear import/export, Mig1 being nuclear when glucose is present and being transported to the cytoplasm when glucose becomes limiting (9.De Vit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, Mig1 has been shown to be phosphorylated under derepressing conditions (10.Ostling J. Ronne H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 11.Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Present genetic evidence suggests that both of these events are mediated by the Snf1 kinase complex: a mutation in MIG1 suppresses thesnf1 mutant defects in SUC2 and GAL1expression (3.Vallier L.G. Carlson M. Genetics. 1994; 137: 49-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Johnston M. Flick J.S. Pexton T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3834-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), indicating that SNF1 negatively regulates repression by Mig1. Furthermore, Mig1 is permanently localized in the nucleus in snf1 mutants, even under glucose-limiting conditions (9.De Vit M.J. Waddle J.A. Johnston M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Results from the mutations of all four phosphorylation target sites present in Mig1 suggest that some of them are phosphorylated in vivo, but elimination of none of them reduced phosphorylation as completely as snf1 (11.Treitel M.A. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6273-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This points to the possibility that other kinases, indirectly under Snf1 control, may also phosphorylate Mig1 (12.Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1281) Google Scholar). Several filamentous fungi are efficient industrial producers of various enzymes and secondary metabolites frequently subject to regulation by carbon catabolite repression. Yet the molecular details of glucose repression are only at the beginning of being understood: genes homologous to MIG1 have been cloned and characterized from several fungi, i.e. Emericella nidulans (13.Dowzer C.E.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that the respective gene products share a high degree of similarity with each other and with the Mig1 homologue from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (22.Tanaka N. Ohuchi N. Mukai Y. Osaka Y. Ohtani Y. Tabuchi M. Bhuiyan M.S. Fukui H. Harashima S. Takegawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) throughout several parts of the entire amino acid sequence, whereas a high degree of similarity with Mig1 is only apparent in the N-terminal DNA-binding zinc finger domain. As the Cre protein C-terminal part exhibits several features characteristic for transactivation domains (13.Dowzer C.E. Kelly J.M. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 376: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) one may speculate that the regulation of Cre-mediated repression is different from that exerted by Mig1 inS. cerevisiae. In support of this, Vautard et al.(21.Vautard G. Cotton P. Fevre M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that S. sclerotiorum cre1 cannot complement a Mig1 mutant of S. cerevisiae. However, using A. nidulans as heterologous host, they found that the nuclear location of Cre1 is dependent on glucose as is Mig1 in yeast (23.Vautard-Mey G. Cotton P. Fevre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a S. sclerotiorum Cre1 mutated in a postulated AMPK/Snf1-kinase target serine and expressed in A. nidulansleads to an allyl alcohol-sensitive phenotype when grown on glucose (24.Vautard-Mey G. Fevre M. Curr. Genet. 2000; 37: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although the latter findings were not accompanied by corresponding changes in Cre1 localization, the other data nevertheless suggest that the mechanisms leading to carbon catabolite repression in yeast and filamentous fungi are largely conserved. Trichoderma reesei, the anamorph of the ascomycete H. jecorina (25.Kuhls K. Lieckfeldt E. Samuels G.J. Kovacs W. Meyer W. Petrini O. Gams W. Borner T. Kubicek C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Using H. jecorina as a model for Cre1 regulation, we will show in this paper that Cre1 is indeed a phosphoprotein, but that both the kinase phosphorylating H. jecorina Cre1, as well as the effect of phosphorylation, are different from that known for S. cerevisiae. H. jecorina (T. reesei) QM 9414 was used as wild-type strain throughout these studies. The mutant strain H. jecorina RUT C-30 (ATCC 56756), carrying a truncated and non-functional cre1 gene (17.Ilmen M. Thrane C. Penttila M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 451-460Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the recipient strain for hph-mediated transformation experiments. Conditions for growth were as described previously (15.Strauss J. Mach R.L. Zeilinger S. Hartler G. Stoffler G. Wolschek M. Kubicek C.P.

To create the truncated versions, pGEX-cre1 was digested with SacI/NotI or with NcoI/NotI, respectively. Plasmids were religated, using the oligonucleotide Cre1link240 to generate pCre1-(54–240), and blunt ending the 5′ protruding ends with Sequenase Version 2.0 (Amersham Bioscience, Little Chalfont, UK) to generate pCre1-(54–250). To insert the respective point mutations, pGEX-cre1 was digested withSacI/NcoI and religated (i) with a stuffer created by annealing oligonucleotides Cre1ANDEf and Cre1ANDEr, thus leading to pCre1-(S241A), (ii) with a stuffer made from annealing oligonucleotides Cre1ENDEf and Cre1ENDEr resulting in pCre1-(S241E), and (iii) with a stuffer consisting of Cre1SNDVf and Cre1SNDVr leading to pCre1-(E244V). To fuse the identified kinase target SNDE to GST, pGEX-4T1 was digested with BamHI/NotI and religated with a stuffer formed by annealing the oligonucleotides SNDEf and SNDEr, thus generating pGEXSNDE1 containing the fusion GST::HSNDEDD. All described expression vectors, i.e. pGEX-cre1, pCre1-(54–292), pCre1-(54–250), pCre1-(54–240), pCre1-(S241A), pCre1-(S241E), pCre1-(E244V), and pGEXSNDE1, were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (Amersham Bioscience). Expression, purification, and thrombin cleavage were carried out as described by the manufacturers. For construction of plasmid pACEC1, a derivative of pRLMEX30 (30.Mach R.L. Schindler M.

Vectors pACEC31 and pACEC41 carrying full-length copies of thecre1 gene harboring the mutations S241A and E244V, respectively, and the hph transformation marker were constructed as follows: the respective mutations were first introduced by PCR into a 250-bp cre1 fragment, using CreS241A-f and CreE244V-f, respectively, as the respective forward primers (Table I), CreMutr as the reverse primer (Table I) and pACEC2, a pUC19 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) derivative, which harbors a 5.5-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragment containing the entire cre1 coding region plus its flanking sequences (15.Strauss J.

PCR amplifications were performed withTaq ™ polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Trio Thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using an initial denaturation cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min annealing at 62 °C and 30 s elongation at 74 °C. The amplicons were cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and, after verification of the mutations by sequencing, used to replace the respective SacI-NcoI fragment of the wild-typecre1 gene as follows: first a 4.6-kbClaI-HindIII cre1 fragment of pACEC2 was cloned into pUC19, the SacI site in the multiple cloning site removed by digestion with EcoRI and SmaI, filling in the protruding ends with Klenow polymerase (Promega) and finally religating to yield pACEC21. After digestion of pACEC21 withSacI and NcoI, correspondingSacI/NcoI fragments (250 bp) of the PCR-mutatedcre1 genes were cloned into it to obtain pACEC3 and pACEC4.

Strain HphT was derived from transformation ofH. jecorina RutC30 with plasmid pRLMEX30.H. jecorina recombinant strains SA19 and EV7, carrying the Cre1 mutant alleles S241A and E244V were prepared by transformingH. jecorina RUTC-30 with pACEC31 and pACEC41, respectively. All transformations and transformant purifications were carried out following the Biolistic Bombardment method as described by Hazellet al. (31.Hazell B.W. Te'o V.S. Bradner J.R. Bergquist P.L.

Transformants were streaked twice on selective media, and then transferred onto malt extract agar plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for sporulation. Spore suspensions were plated on selective medium to obtain colonies derived from single spores for further analysis. Fungal genomic DNA was isolated as described elsewhere (32.Gruber F. Visser J.

Gruber F. Kubicek C.P. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). DNA binding was achieved by incubating 100 μg (cell free extract) or 25 ng (recombinant Cre1) of protein with 5 ng of the respective labeled oligonucleotide. Synthetic, double-stranded oligonucleotides Cre1WT and Cre1MU were generated as described previously (26.Mach R.L. Strauss J. Zeilinger S. Schindler M. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) (i) by annealing the respective oligonucleotides Cre1WTf and Cre1MUf with a complementary synthetic oligonucleotide Cre op for EMSA with recombinant Cre1 protein and (ii) by annealing the respective oligonucleotides Cre1WTfwd and Cre1MUfwd with the complementary synthetic oligonucleotide Cre1rev for EMSA with cell-free extracts. After annealing, double strands were filled in using Sequenase version 2.0; for labeling [α-32P]dCTP was added to the fill-in reaction. Dephosphorylation of Cre1 proteins, produced either by expression in E. coli or present in H. jecorinacell-free extracts, was performed by incubation of 25 ng of recombinant protein or 100 μg of cell-free extract for 15 min at 30 °C with 20 units of bovine intestinal mucose alkaline phosphatase (BIMAP; Sigma) in a reaction mixture of 15 μl containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm MgCl2, and 0.01 mmZnCl2. For phosphorylation of Cre1, 25 ng of the dephosphorylated recombinant protein was incubated in a total volume of 20 μl containing 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 μm EDTA, 1% (w/v) Me2SO, and 0.6 mm ATP. The reaction was started by the addition of 5 units of protein kinase from porcine heart (Sigma) exhibiting 3′,5′-cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation activity. Incubation was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. In selected cases, a total amount of 18.5 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (111 mBq/mol) replaced the 0.6 mm ATP in the above described assay. The mixture from the incubation was then subjected to SDS-PAGE (labeled probes), followed by autoradiography (35.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1990Google Scholar) or used for EMSA (unlabeled probes). For both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation assays, controls with heat-inactivated (10 min; 68 °C) enzymes were always included. To identify phosphorylation of Ser241 in the GST:HSNDEDD fusion by cell-free extracts derived from glucose grown cultures, 5 μg of BIMAP-treated GST::HSNDEDD and 2 mg of cell-free extract of H. jecorina were incubated under the above described conditions for phosphorylation with a total of 18.5 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (111 mBq/mol) per assay. Incubation was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Following incubation, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of pre-swollen glutathione-Sepharose suspension (Amersham Bioscience), followed by thorough mixing and spinning down in an Eppendorf centrifuge. After washing the pellet five times with 500 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, the pellet was incubated with 2 units of thrombin (15 min, room temperature). Thereafter, released HSNDEDD was separated from glutathione-Sepharose by centrifugation, followed by three washing steps with 5 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The radioactivity was measured both in the supernatant and in the gluthatione-Sepharose pellets. An analysis of the aa sequence of Cre1/CreA proteins from several filamentous ascomycetes includingTrichoderma (Hypocrea) revealed the presence of several target sites for protein kinases, such as protein kinase C, casein kinase II, and cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which were conserved among these fungi (Fig. 1), but not in S. cerevisiae.In contrast, no Snf1 kinase-like target motif (ΦXRX2SX3Φ (36.Dale S. Wilson W.A. Edelman A.M. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar)), as present in Mig1, could be found. To investigate whether the H. jecorina Cre1 protein indeed is a phosphoprotein, and which of the putative phosphorylation sites may function as a target for phosphorylationin vitro, we expressed a cre1 fragment encoding amino acids 54–292, which bears all the mentioned phosphorylation consensus sites (Fig. 1), as a GST fusion protein in E. coli. As shown in Fig. 2, this fusion protein (Cre1-(54–292)) could indeed be phosphorylated, yet efficiently only, if previously treated with bovine intestinal mucose alkaline phosphatase (not pretreated samples, data not shown). This indicates that the recombinant Cre1 protein is, at least partially, phosphorylated in E. coli. The GST control alone was not phosphorylated.Figure 2In vitrophosphorylation of recombinant Cre1 proteins. GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli, purified, cleaved by thrombin, and dephosphorylated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” GST alone was used as a control in the phosphorylation experiments. All lanes were loaded with 6.25 ng (1.25 ng/μl) of recombinant protein from the phosphorylation reaction. Pre-stained Broad Range Marker Proteins (Amersham Bioscience, Uppsala, Sweden) were applied in an additional lane; M r of the marker proteins are given in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To identify which of the detected phosphorylation target sequences are phosphorylated in vitro, C-terminal truncated versions (Cre1-(54–250) and Cre1-(54–240); Fig. 1) were constructed and overexpressed. Among these, only Cre1-(54–250) served as an acceptor for phosphorylation, whereas Cre1-(54–240) did not (Fig. 2), thus localizing the phosphorylated amino acid between amino acids 240 and 250 (Fig. 1), i.e. within the sequence HSNDEDDHYH. To prove that Ser241 within this region serves as an acceptor for phosphorylation, we mutated this Ser241 to an Ala (Cre1-(S241A)). The result from this experiment (Fig. 2) demonstrates that the mutation renders Cre1 inert for phosphorylation. Consequently, we deduce that Cre1 is phosphorylated at Ser241. To investigate whether the phosphorylation status of Cre1 has any effect on its DNA binding ability, we tested the binding of dephosphorylated recombinant Cre1-(54–292) to the oligonucleotide Cre1WT (bearing two Cre1-binding sites; cf. Table I) by EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) analysis (Fig. 3 A). Cre1WT has previously been demonstrated to span the essential Cre1-binding sites of thexyn1 promoter of H. jecorina (26.Mach R.L. Strauss J. Zeilinger S. Schindler M. Kubicek C.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Two specific complexes, presumably representing the binding of a single and of two Cre1 molecules to the target sequence were observed with Cre1-(54/292). Dephosphorylation reduced their binding almost completely (Fig. 3 A). A control, incubated with heat-inactivated BIMAP, produced no inhibition of the DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 A,lane 3), and rephosphorylation of the dephosphorylated protein with varying amounts of protein kinase from porcine heart and cold ATP led to a regain of DNA binding activity (Fig. 3 B,lanes 2–6). Coherent data were obtained with the truncated Cre1-(54–250) and Cre1-(54–240) proteins, thus further supporting the hypothesis of a regulatory role of Ser241 (Fig. 3 A, lane 5-10). All these data are consistent with a positive regulation of DNA binding of Cre1 by phosphorylation. Interestingly, incubation with increasing amounts of protein kinase favored the formation of the higher molecular weight Cre1-DNA complex, suggesting that the phosphorylated form of Cre1-(54–292) binds as a dimer. As all these experiments had been carried out with a truncated version of Cre1, we further investigated whether the effect of phosphorylation would also be observed with the full-length native Cre1 protein. To this end, cell-free extracts from glucose-grown cultures of H. jecorina QM 9414 were dephosphorylated as described above, and tested in EMSA. To prove the specificity of the Cre1-DNA complex, we included (i) controls with oligonucleotide Cre1MU containing mutated, non-binding Cre1 sites (Table I), and (ii) experiments with cell-free extracts from the Cre1 mutant strain H. jecorina RUT C-30. These results (data not shown) confirmed that dephosphorylation completely destroys the specific DNA binding of Cre1 present in cell-free extracts of H. jecorina. From these data, we conclude that Cre1 requires phosphorylation to be capable of binding to its target sequence. From the results described hitherto, we expected that a mutation in Ser241 would lead to a loss of DNA binding. Consequently, we mutated Ser241 to an Ala, and tested the effect of this mutation on the ability of Cre1 to bind to its target sequence. However, in contrast to this expectation, a recombinant Cre1-(S241A) mutant protein showed equally strong DNA binding as the control (compare Figs. 3 A and 4 A), despite its inability to accept phosphorylation, and a similar finding was obtained with the truncated recombinant Cre1 fragment Cre1-(54/240) (Fig. 3 A), which terminates before Ser241. We interpret these findings in such a way that the presence of Ser241 in Cre1 requires its phosphorylation for Cre1 being able to bind to DNA, whereas in the absence of Ser241 Cre1 can do so even without phosphorylation. This result was further endorsed by the fact that also a Cre1-(S241E) mutant protein shows permanent DNA binding in vitro (Fig. 4 A). Interestingly, the Cre1-(S241A) and Cre1-(S241E) mutant proteins only formed the lower molecular weight Cre1-DNA complex, indicating that the mutation of Ser to Ala and Glu, respectively, results in binding as a monomer only. In contrast, Cre1-(54–240) exhibits both DNA-protein complexes. To demonstrate that the results described so far are not just in vitro artifacts, we transformed H. jecorin"
https://openalex.org/W2329991259,"The tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in response to DNA damage, including DNA repair. One DNA repair pathway, nucleotide excision repair (NER), has been well-documented to be regulated by p53. It seemed probable that p53 may affect other DNA repair pathways. We employed matched isogenic pairs of cell lines, wild-type or p53-deficient, to investigate this question using methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), a base-damaging agent. Alkylation damage induced by MMS is repaired exclusively by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Cells carrying mutant or no p53 genes exhibited slow BER of MMS-induced DNA damage, and exhibited MMS-sensitivity. One contributing factor is the abundance of DNA polymerase beta (beta-pol), an enzyme required for BER, which was almost absent in p53 mutant and p53-null cells. Our findings demonstrate an in vivo requirement for p53 in regulating the base excision repair response, a novel finding of great potential importance in understanding the DNA repair branch of the p53 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2010110394,"The breast cancer promoting effects of estrogen and the chemopreventive effects of tamoxifen are thought to be mediated by the estrogen receptor, a ligand-dependent transcription factor. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles following estrogen or tamoxifen treatment may help us better understand the role estrogen plays in tumorigenesis. We utilized SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expression) technology to identify genes regulated by estrogen and tamoxifen in the ZR75-1 estrogen dependent breast cancer cell line. In this manner we have identified several genes that were regulated by estrogen or tamoxifen. Here we report the identification and initial characterization of EIT-6 (Estrogen Induced Tag-6), a novel nuclear protein and a new member of the evolutionarily conserved SM-20 family of growth regulatory immediate-early genes. EIT-6 appears to be a direct transcriptional target of the estrogen receptor and constitutive expression of EIT-6 promotes colony growth in human breast cancer cells. These data indicate that EIT-6 may play a role in estrogen induced cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2155442043,"The quinol-fumarate reductase (QFR) respiratory complex of Escherichia coli is a four-subunit integral-membrane complex that catalyzes the final step of anaerobic respiration when fumarate is the terminal electron acceptor. The membrane-soluble redox-active molecule menaquinol (MQH2) transfers electrons to QFR by binding directly to the membrane-spanning region. The crystal structure of QFR contains two quinone species, presumably MQH2, bound to the transmembrane-spanning region. The binding sites for the two quinone molecules are termed QP and QD, indicating their positions proximal (QP) or distal (QD) to the site of fumarate reduction in the hydrophilic flavoprotein and iron-sulfur protein subunits. It has not been established whether both of these sites are mechanistically significant. Co-crystallization studies of the E. coli QFR with the known quinol-binding site inhibitors 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide and 2-[1-(p-chlorophenyl)ethyl] 4,6-dinitrophenol establish that both inhibitors block the binding of MQH2 at the QP site. In the structures with the inhibitor bound at QP, no density is observed at QD, which suggests that the occupancy of this site can vary and argues against a structurally obligatory role for quinol binding to QD. A comparison of the QP site of the E. coli enzyme with quinone-binding sites in other respiratory enzymes shows that an acidic residue is structurally conserved. This acidic residue, Glu-C29, in the E. coli enzyme may act as a proton shuttle from the quinol during enzyme turnover.

Bacterial Metabolism. 2nd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). During this type of anaerobic respiration, electrons are donated to QFR by menaquinol (MQH2) molecules in the membrane. The electrons are transferred to a covalently-bound flavin adenine nucleotide at the active site through three distinct iron-sulfur clusters and ultimately are used to reduce fumarate to succinate (2Kröger A. Geisler V. Lemma E. Theis F. Lenger R. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 158: 311-314Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 3Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 229-297Google Scholar). The QFR respiratory complex is composed of four polypeptide chains. Two of these chains, the flavoprotein (FrdA) and the iron protein (FrdB), comprise the soluble domain, which is involved in fumarate reduction, whereas the remaining two subunits (FrdC and FrdD) are membrane-spanning polypeptides involved in the electron transfer with quinones. High sequence identity between the soluble domain of the E. coliQFR and the soluble domain of succinate-quinone oxidoreductase (SQR, complex II) of the aerobic respiratory chain places these two complexes in the same family (4Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Consistent with the sequence relationship, both enzymes from E. coli can bidirectionally catalyze the interconversion of succinate and fumarate (5Pershad H.R. Hirst J. Cochran B. Ackrell B.A.C. Armstrong F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 262-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and each can functionally replace the other to support growth (6Guest J.R. J. Gen.

In contrast to the soluble domain, the transmembrane anchor subunits of the complex II family have little sequence identity and exhibit variable polypeptide and cofactor composition. Nevertheless, similar structural models for the membrane-spanning subunits have been proposed for the QFR and SQR respiratory complexes (8Hägerhäll C. Hederstedt L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The structures of QFR respiratory complexes from E. coli (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C.

Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) have been determined. Although these QFRs exhibit similar polypeptide-folds and cofactor arrangements in the soluble domain, there are distinctive features in the subunit organization and cofactor composition of the membrane-spanning domains. The structure of the QFR respiratory complex from E. coli (Fig.1A) (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C.

Both of the binding sites for these quinol molecules had been predicted through a variety of techniques (11Ruzicka F.J. Beinert H. Schepler K.L. Dunham W.R. Sands R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

QP is located near the [3Fe:4S] cluster of the soluble domain, whereas QD is positioned at the opposite side of the membrane. The minimum separation distance between the quinol rings of QP and QD is ∼25 Å. (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Although electron transfer has been observed to proceed at this distance (16Winkler J.R. DiBilio A. Farrow N.A. Richards J.H. Gray H.B. Pure Appl. Chem. 1999; 71: 1753-1764Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the separation is much greater than the distance typically observed among redox cofactors that participate in physiological electron transfer (17Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether both quinol-binding sites are functionally relevant or whether quinol binding at the QD site fulfills a structural role. If intervening heme(s) were present between these two quinol-binding sites, as is the case in other members of the QFR/SQR family (3Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Müller F.

Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), electron transfer would be expected to readily proceed from QD to the active site (Fig. 1C). As quinone molecules are carriers of both protons and electrons, the transmembrane positioning of quinone (Fig.2A)/quinol (Fig.2B) molecules during oxidation and reduction can lead to proton translocation across the membrane exemplified by the Q-cycle mechanism employed by cytochrome bc1 (18Mitchell P. Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that some fumarate reductases could participate in energy transduction if the oxidation of the quinol occurs at the QD site and is coupled to the reduction of a quinone positioned on the opposite side of the membrane in a second respiratory protein such as a hydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase (19Ohnishi T.

Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), a cavity search predicts that quinol molecules may bind at a site positioned similarly to QD (20Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Schröder I. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Lancaster C. Groβ R. Haas A. Ritter M. Mantele W. Simon J. Kroger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13051-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutation of Glu-C66 near this cavity results in a loss of enzyme activity, whereas the protein retains a fully native structure (21Lancaster C. Groβ R. Haas A. Ritter M. Mantele W. Simon J. Kroger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13051-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), providing evidence that this location acts as a quinol-binding site. There is no evidence for a site positioned similarly to QP in the W. succinogenes complex; however, the presence of a QPsite is not necessary for energy transduction when coupled to another respiratory complex. To assess whether both the QD and the QPquinol-binding sites of the E. coli QFR respiratory complex are functionally relevant for electron transfer, the E. coliQFR respiratory complex has been co-crystallized with the known quinol-binding inhibitors 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide (HQNO) (Fig.2C) and 2-[1-(p-chlorophenyl)ethyl] 4,6-dinitrophenol (DNP-19) (Fig. 2D), and the structures were determined at resolutions of 2.7 and 3.6 Å, respectively. Additionally, the native E. coli QFR structure has been further refined at 3.3 Å resolution for more accurate comparison to the inhibitor-bound forms. These studies demonstrate unequivocally that both inhibitors bind to the E. coli QFR at the QP site near the [3Fe:4S] cluster. QFR was expressed and purified as previously described (22Luna-Chavez C. Iverson T.M. Rees D.C. Cecchini G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). All crystallizations were performed using a protein concentration of 30 mg/ml in 0.7% (w/v) of the polyoxyethylene detergent C12E9 (Thesit). Previously, optimal crystal formation occurred while using polyethylene glycol (PEG) 10,000 as the precipitant (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 22Luna-Chavez C. Iverson T.M. Rees D.C. Cecchini G. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); however, the variability between protein batches necessitated the use of different molecular weights of PEGs as the precipitant for each preparation. In this study, crystals grown using PEG 5000 monomethyl ether displayed the highest diffraction limit. Crystallization reactions were performed by the vapor diffusion method with hanging drops equilibrated over 12.5% PEG 5000 monomethyl ether, 85 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 100 μm EDTA, 0.001% dithiothreitol, and the appropriate inhibitor. Inhibitor concentrations were 100 μm HQNO (Ki = 0.2 μm) or 10 mm DNP-19 (Ki = 5.2 μm) (23Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol.

Data from co-crystals of QFR and HQNO were collected at 93 K at a wavelength of 1.00 Å on Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratories (SSRL) beamline 9-2 using a Quantum 4 CCD detector, whereas data from co-crystals of QFR and DNP-19 were collected at a wavelength of 0.98 Å on SSRL beamline 9-1 using a MAR345 image plate detector. Data were processed using Denzo and Scalepack (25Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. CCP4 Study Weekend Data Collection and Processing. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Daresbury, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). As the structures are isomorphous, the structure of QFR bound to HQNO was refined following rigid body refinement of the original 3.3-Å resolution model (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) with the CNS program (26Brünger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J. Kuszewski J.

The DNP-19 model was refined starting with the final model of HQNO bound to QFR after rigid body refinement. All models were built using the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out using CNS (26Brünger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.

D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). Tight non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were employed in regions of the molecule that exhibited similar electron densities but were released in crystal contacts and surface regions in which the structures of the two complexes clearly differed. Individual temperature factors were refined for the model of HQNO bound to QFR. For DNP-19 bound to QFR and the additional refinement performed on the previously reported native structure, group temperature factors were employed. The Rfree was calculated for a test set of reflections identical to those used for the original structure determination with additional reflections randomly selected for the QFR + HQNO data set (Table I). Two of the most potent inhibitors of the reactions ofE. coli QFR with quinones are HQNO (Ki = 0.2 μm) and DNP-19 (Ki = 5.2 μm) (23Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These inhibitors were chosen for co-crystallization studies with purified QFR to investigate their binding sites in the membrane domain of the enzyme. Crystallographic analysis of the binding of HQNO and DNP-19 to the E. coliQFR complex reveals density for both of these inhibitors at the QP site (Fig. 3 and Table I). HQNO is nearly isosteric with MQH2 and binds at the QP site in a manner similar to that previously identified for MQH2. Two hydrogen bond donors, Lys-B228 Nζ and Trp-D14 Nɛ are positioned within hydrogen-bonding distance of the negatively charged N-oxide (Fig.4A). These two hydrogen bonds would satisfy the hydrogen bonding capabilities of menaquinone or semimenaquinone. The hydroxyl group on the other side of the HQNO ring is positioned within hydrogen-bonding distance of the side chains of Glu-C29 Oɛ2 and Arg-D81 Nη1. Although DNP-19 also binds at the QP position, the binding site is shifted by over 2 Å with respect to HQNO or MQH2 (Fig. 4A), and the inhibitor molecule only makes hydrogen-bonding contacts with one side of the quinol-binding pocket. The hydrogen bonds form between the DNP-19 O2 and Lys-B228 Nζ and between the DNP-19 O13 and Trp-D14 Nɛ, whereas Glu-C29 and Arg-D81 do not make contacts. Significant positional differences between the QFR proteins in these structures are limited to the movement of the side chains of Gln-B225, Arg-C28, and Leu-C89 in the DNP-19-bound enzyme (Fig. 4A). These side chains would sterically clash with DNP-19 if they adopted the same conformation as exhibited in the other structures.Figure 4Comparison of inhibitors binding at QP and side chains surrounding the M site. A, comparison of inhibitor-binding position and side chain movements. Residues from FrdB have the carbon atoms colored inred, residues from FrdC have the carbon atoms colored indark green, whereas residues from FrdD have the carbon atoms colored in purple. Oxygen atoms are colored inred, nitrogen atoms are blue, and sulfur atoms are in yellow. The inhibitor HQNO has the carbon atoms colored in black, whereas the inhibitor DNP-19 has the carbon atoms colored in white. The orientation of the view is looking onto the QP-binding site from the surface of the membrane. The side chain positions are taken from the QFR structure with HQNO bound (Protein Data Bank code 1KF6) and are within the error of the side chain positions from the structure of QFR with MQ bound (Protein Data Bank code 1FUM). The differences in side chain position between the DNP-19 bound enzyme and the other two structures that were greater than the error of the determined structures were limited to Gln-B225, Arg-C28, and Leu-C89. The altered positions of these three side chains that allow for DNP-19 binding are shown with the carbon atoms in white. B, the position M from the structure bound to HQNO with surrounding side chains. The orientation of the molecule in this view is the same as in Fig. 3B. The approximate location of a binding site can be inferred from a cavity calculated using the program VOIDOO (60Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar) (cyan) and difference Fourier (‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖) electron density contoured at 3σ (green). The coloring of atoms is the same as seen in Fig.4A. The position of the quinone at QP is taken from the QFR structure with quinones bound (Protein Data Bank code1L0V), and the quinone molecule is shown with the carbon atoms colored in gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic analyses have established that HQNO is a non-competitive inhibitor of QFR, whereas DNP-19 acts as a pure competitive inhibitor (23Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and have suggested that both inhibitors bind at or near the same site. As the DNP-19 compound is not deeply inserted into QP but rather blocks the entrance to this site, this inhibitor probably acts by sterically preventing quinol from binding as predicted previously (23Yankovskaya V. Sablin S.O. Ramsay R.R. Singer T.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Cecchini G. Miyoshi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21020-21024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Neither inhibitor was observed to bind to the QD site; yet intriguingly, electron density for QD, which was strong in the 3.3 Å resolution structure determination, is absent when either HQNO or DNP-19 is bound to the QP-binding site (Fig. 3). In the 3.3-Å resolution structure containing MQH2 bound at both the QP and QD positions, an unassigned feature in the electron density with a height of 4σ above background was visible between these two sites (Fig. 3A). This extra density, designated “M,” coincides with the only major cavity found in the E. coli QFR structure. The density in this location is additionally present in the inhibitor structures (Fig.3, B and C) and becomes stronger with improved resolution, reaching 5σ in the HQNO co-structure. For comparison, the omission of the HQNO inhibitor from the HQNO co-structure results in a difference Fourier density of 5.8σ, whereas the omission of the quinone molecules bound at QD and QP from the 3.3-Å resolution structures result in difference Fourier densities of 4.5σ and 3.9σ, respectively. It is possible that this additional density at M represents a partially ordered cofactor that has not been previously detected. The distance between the M site and each of the other established quinol-binding sites is ∼13 Å. The side chains near the density (Fig. 4B) associated with this cavity tend to be polar, whereas those in the region not associated with any density tend to be apolar, giving this cavity the hydrophobicity characteristics of a quinone-binding site. Site-directed mutagenesis suggests that the residues lining this location are critical for enzyme function (14Westenberg D.J. Gunsalus R.P. Ackrell B.A.C. Sices H. Cecchini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 815-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the location of this density in the center of the membrane would be unusual for a quinol-binding site when compared with those structurally characterized to date. The binding of a metal ion at this site is also unlikely, because neighboring residues appear too distant to act as metal ligands and no significant peaks are observed near this site in anomalous difference Fourier maps. Thus, the identity of the species at this M site cannot be determined at present. QP is positioned ∼8 Å from the [3Fe:4S] cluster, implicating this quinol-binding site as the immediate electron donor to the redox cofactors in the soluble domain. The fully reduced quinol bound at QP must release two electrons and two protons during oxidation to the quinone. As the [3Fe:4S] cluster is a one electron acceptor, QFR must be able to stabilize both the fully reduced quinol and at least transiently the semiquinone oxidation states at the QP-binding site during turnover. The binding of HQNO to the QP site strengthens the hypothesis that the semiquinone form can be stabilized at this site (15Hägerhäll C. Magnitsky S. Sled V.D. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), because HQNO is proposed to be a mimic of the semiquinone intermediate. In both the QFR structure with HQNO bound at QP and the structure with MQH2 bound, the side chain of Glu-C29 lies within hydrogen-bonding distance of the hydroxyl of the HQNO or MQH2 ring. The proximity of the Glu-C29 residue and the fact that the HQNO elicits a significant change in the EPR line shape of the [3Fe:4S] cluster (30Rothery R.A. Weiner J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are consistent with HQNO binding near the Qp site (Fig. 3). The obligatory presence of an acidic residue near the exchangeable quinone-binding site is emerging as a theme in respiratory proteins. The Qi ubiquinone-binding site of cytochrome bc1 (31Yu D. Xia C. Kim H. Xia J. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Zhang L. Deisenhofer J. Science. 1997; 277: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 32Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B.

Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) contains the conserved Asp-229 (chicken numbering) residue within hydrogen-bonding distance of the ubiquinone. Similarly, the proposed ubiquinol-binding site in quinol oxidase (34Abramson J. Riistama S. Larsson G. Jasaitis A. Svensson-Ek M. Laakkonen L. Puustinen A. Iwata S. Wikström M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) contains a conserved Asp-75, and the co-structures of cytochrome bc1 with the Qo-binding inhibitor stigmatellin shows that Glu-272 of the cytochrome b subunit lies within hydrogen-bonding distance of stigmatellin (35Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15926Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the W. succinogenes QFR, Glu-C66 has been shown to be an essential component of the menaquinol oxidation site (21Lancaster C. Groβ R. Haas A. Ritter M. Mantele W. Simon J. Kroger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13051-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas in the Bacillus subtilis SQR, the conserved Asp-C52 is part of the predicted HQNO-binding site (36Smirnova I.A. Hägerhall C. Konstantinov A.A. Hederstedt L.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 23-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Additionally, in the Paracoccus denitrificans SQR, the mutation of Asp-D88 to a glycine confers resistance to the known quinone-binding inhibitor carboxin (37Matsson M. Hederstedt L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, the small membrane anchor (FrdD/SdhD/cyt bS) gene of QFR/SQR (38Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

Ferrell R.E. Willett-Brozick J.E. Lawrence E.C. Myssiorek D. Bosch A. van der Mey A. Taschner P.E.M. Rubinstein W.S. Myers E.N. Richard C.W.I. Cornelisse C.J. Devilee P. Devlin B.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17867-17872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) predicts that Asp-92 is located within a region important for ubiquinone binding. Because variants of cytochrome bc1 altering Glu-272 of the cytochrome b subunit impair enzyme turnover while maintaining ubiquinol binding to Qo (35Crofts A.R. Barquera B. Gennis R.B. Kuras R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15807-15926Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), Glu-272 is proposed to participate in proton shuttling rather than be involved in stabilizing the binding of a protonated quinone species. Similarly, in the soluble quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida, Asp-33γ is presumed to be the proton shuttle (44Satoh A. Kim J.-K. Miyahara I. Devreese B. Vandenberghe I. Hacisalihoglu A. Okajima T. Kuroda S. Adachi O. Duine J.A. Van Beeumen J. Tanizawa K. Hirotsu K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2830-2834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for the covalently attached cysteine tryptophylquinone. Although the photosynthetic reaction center does not contain an acidic residue that directly hydrogen-bonds to the ubiquinone, two acidic residues inRhodobacter sphaeroides reaction center, Glu-L212 and Asp-L213, are located within 5 Å of the semiquinone bound at QB (45Stowell M. McPhillips T. Rees D. Soltis S. Abresch E. Feher G. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) and have been implicated as proton shuttles (46Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 861-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). A role with the carboxyl group primarily involved in proton transfer is consistent with the EPR analysis of the FrdC E29L variant of theE. coli QFR (15Hägerhäll C. Magnitsky S. Sled V.D. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Quinol molecules have two hydroxy groups located on opposite sides of the molecule (Fig. 2); each is deprotonated during oxidation. As discussed above, the acidic residue Glu-C29 may act as the proton shuttle during quinol oxidation. In cytochromebc1 (both Qi and Qo), ubiquinol oxidase and the W. succinogenes QFR, a conserved histidine residue is located on the opposite side of the quinone-binding site from the acidic residue. Because the photosynthetic reaction center quinone-binding site also contains a conserved histidine residue (His-L190), searches for consensus quinone-binding sequences have focused on conserved histidine residues (47Fisher N. Rich P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The E. coli QFR departs from the use of a histidine in the quinol-binding site. Although several histidine side chains are near the QP site and may therefore act as secondary proton shuttles in a chain from Glu-C29 (Fig. 4A), none of them is optimally positioned to form hydrogen bonds with the quinol hydroxyl groups. Instead, on the opposite side of the quinol, DNP-19, and HQNO molecules from Glu-C29, all of these molecules are positioned within hydrogen-bonding distance of Trp-D14 Nɛ and Lys-B228 Nζ that could participate in the proton transfer pathway. By analogy to the photosynthetic reaction center in which the quinone bound at the QB site undergoes a propeller twist during reduction (45Stowell M. McPhillips T. Rees D. Soltis S. Abresch E. Feher G. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), multiple positions of the quinone may also be utilized in QFR to generate additional contacts with residues involved in the proton shuttle. In addition to HQNO and DNP, the other known inhibitors of the E. coli QFR have been either shown or predicted to bind to the QP site (15Hägerhäll C. Magnitsky S. Sled V.D. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Ohnishi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26157-26164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the available kinetic data are consistent with a single dissociable binding site in the QFR complex (24Maklashina E. Cecchini G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 48Rothery R.A. Chatterjee I. Kiema G. McDermott M.T. Weiner J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the E. coli QFR is insensitive to many of the other known complex II quinone-binding inhibitors, the locations of mutations that confer resistance to carboxin and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone in the single heme containingP. denitrificans SQR (37Matsson M. Hederstedt L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 49Matsson M. Ackrell B.A.C. Cochran B. Hederstedt L. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggest that both of these inhibitors bind at a site positioned similarly to QP. Thus, the insensitivity of the E. coli QFR to these inhibitors does not reflect the binding of these inhibitors to a non-functional site. Three molecules of ubiquinone have recently been proposed to bind specifically to the two quinone-binding sites, Qi and Qo, of cytochromebc1 respiratory complex (50Bartoschek S. Johansson M. Geierstanger B.H. Okun J.G. Lancaster C.R.D. Yu E. Yu L. Humpfer C.A. Griesinger C. Brandt U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35231-35234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). One molecule is proposed to bind at the ubiquinone reduction center, Qi, whereas two are proposed to bind at the ubiquinol oxidation site, Qo. In the E. coli QFR structure, the entity at the M site is separated from QP by the side chain of Arg-D81 (Fig. 4B). Thus, the double occupancy model proposed for the cytochrome bc1 Qo site (50Bartoschek S. Johansson M. Geierstanger B.H. Okun J.G. Lancaster C.R.D. Yu E. Yu L. Humpfer C.A. Griesinger C. Brandt U. J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15979-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) would require an alternative position for the side chain of Arg-D81. The position of Arg-D81 on an α-helix and facing in toward the center of the protein would make it difficult for this side chain to move out of the pocket into solvent, constraining any repositioning relative to the M cavity. Although it seems more likely that M is a separate entity from QP, the rearrangement of Arg-D81 to form a larger binding pocket cannot be entirely ruled out. Quinol oxidation at the QD site of the E. coli QFR has not been demonstrated. However, one intriguing aspect of the QFR structures with inhibitor bound at the QP site is that no density corresponding to quinol bound at QD is observed. In the cytochrome bc1 complex, the binding of either of the inhibitors stigmatellin or methoxyacrylate stilbene at Qo reduces the affinity for the inhibitor or quinol at the second Qo site in the dimer (52Gutierrez-Cirlos E.B. Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1195-1202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a result of the anti-cooperative binding behavior, these two compounds can inhibit the cytochrome bc1 complex with a stoichiometry of 0.5 molecules of inhibitor/Qo-binding site. In the E. coli QFR, the absence of quinol density at QD when an inhibitor is tightly associated at QP could suggest a similar anti-cooperative behavior in these binding sites. Although the native structure of QFR containing only quinones bound shows density at both QP and QD (9Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), the density at QP is much weaker. This finding may reflect a disorder in quinol binding or it may reflect partial occupancy of the site or both. Although the experiments presented here cannot establish the functional relevance of QD, the observation that the occupancy at the QD site decreases in the structures with inhibitors bound to the QP site indicates that the binding of a quinone species at the QD site is not required for protein stability. QFRs and SQRs exhibit variability in membrane subunit composition, heme content, and quinol/quinone association, suggesting that electron transfer through the membrane-spanning region differs between the various enzymes of this family. The experiments on many heme-containing members of the QFR/SQR family have yielded evidence for the participation of a site positioned similarly to QD during electron transfer (21Lancaster C. Groβ R.

Quinol oxidation at a site positioned similarly to QD indicates that transmembrane electron transfer occurs and would be obligatory for the generation of a transmembrane electrochemical potential gradient during turnover (54Geisler V. Ullmann R. Kröger A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 219-226Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar,55Kim Y.J. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2000; 10: 48-50Google Scholar). The existence of the M site near the middle of the membrane possibly identifies an additional center that could participate in an electron transfer pathway between QP and QD in the E. coli QFR. A more definitive proposal for the mechanistic role of QD during catalysis by the E. coli QFR will require determination of whether the non-functional mutants generated at the QD and M positions retain the native structure and identification of the molecular species at the M site.

https://openalex.org/W2168650364,"Fibulin-1 is an extracellular matrix protein induced by estradiol in estrogen receptor (ER) positive ovarian cancer cell lines. Alternative splicing of fibulin-1 mRNA results in four different variants named A, B, C and D that may have distinct biological functions. We studied the relative expression of fibulin-1 mRNA variants and their estrogen regulation in human ovarian cancer cells. In ovarian tissues and cancer cell lines, fibulin-1C and -1D are the predominant forms, whereas fibulin-1A and -1B are weakly expressed. We developed a competitive PCR assay based on coamplification of fibulin-1C and -1D to study the relative expression of these fibulin-1 variants in human ovarian samples. In ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer samples, there was a marked increase in the fibulin-1C:1D and fibulin-1C:HPRT mRNA ratios as compared to normal ovaries. In the BG1 estrogen receptor positive ovarian cancer cell line, fibulin-1C mRNA was induced by estradiol in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Since others and we have previously shown an increased expression of ERalpha as compared to ERbeta in ovarian cancer cells, we investigated whether ERalpha or ERbeta is involved in this induction. For this aim, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, which expresses both low basal levels of ERs and fibulin-1, was infected with recombinant ERalpha or ERbeta encoding adenovirus and treated with estradiol. Fibulin-1C was induced by estradiol in ERalpha- but not ERbeta-infected cells, suggesting that fibulin-1C induction is mediated through ERalpha. In ovarian tumors, a trend towards a correlation between fibulin-1C and ERalpha expression levels was noted. In conclusion, this study showed an increased fibulin-1C:-1D mRNA ratio in ovarian cancer cells as compared to normal ovaries. This finding suggests that the C variant may be involved in ovarian carcinogenesis. Fibulin-1C overexpression may thus be a clue for the understanding of a putative role of estrogens in ERalpha promoted ovarian tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2312787052,"In this work, the full-length hTERT gene was isolated and the sequence of the previously unknown region in intron 6 as well as that of upstream and downstream hTERT regions was determined. We have shown that intron 6 includes a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) of a 38 bp sequence, (hTERT-VNTR 6-1). Eight alleles of hTERT-VNTR 6-1 were identified among 103 unrelated individuals, ranging from 27 to 47 repeats. hTERT-VNTR 2-2 is another new 61 bp minisatellite repeat found in intron 2 of hTERT. At least four alleles of hTERT-VNTR 2-2 can be distinguished. Previous studies have described polymorphisms for minisatellites hTERT-VNTR 2-1, a 42 bp repeat in intron 2, and hTERT-VNTR 6-2, a 36 bp repeat in intron 6. These, together with another minisatellite found in intron 12, add up to five such structures within the hTERT gene. The segregation of hTERT minisatellites was analysed in families, revealing that the VNTRs are transmitted through meiosis following a Mendelian inheritance. Minisatellites in hTERT were also analysed in matching normal and cancer tissues from patients with tumors; in one patient with a kidney tumor, the two VNTRs in intron 6 had undergone concomitant rearrangements. This observation suggests that chromosomal rearrangements implicating these VNTRs may be associated with the activation of telomerase expression in cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2028679301,"p53 protein is phosphorylated in response to various stresses. Here we examined phosphorylation of p53 protein in normal human diploid cells after heat shock at 43°C for 2 h. We found that heat shock stimulates phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 but not at Ser20, while X-irradiation at 4 Gy and 10 J/m2 of UV induces phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and less significantly at Ser20. Increased phosphorylation of Ser15 was also observed in heat shocked GM638, the SV40-transformed human fibroblast cell line. Although X-ray irradiation induced phosphorylation of Ser6, 9, 20, and 37 in GM638 cells, heat shock did not affect the phosphorylation level of these serines. We observed little or no phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 in two primary ataxia telangiectasia fibroblast cells, that are defective in ATM. Using an in vitro kinase assay, we confirmed that immunoprecipitated ATM from both heat-shocked and X-irradiated normal human diploid cells can phosphorylate p53 at Ser15 to a similar extent. These results indicate that heat shock induces phosphorylation of p53, especially at Ser15, and its phosphorylation is mediated by ATM kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1987801675,"We have prepared full-lengthDrosophila and human topoisomerase II and truncation constructs containing the amino-terminal ATPase domain, and we have analyzed their biochemical properties. The ATPase activity of the truncation proteins, similar to that of the full-length proteins, is greatly stimulated by the presence of DNA. This activity of the truncation proteins is also sensitive to the inhibition by the drug bisdioxopiperazine, ICRF-193, albeit at a much lower level than the full-length protein. Therefore, bisdioxopiperazine can directly interact with the NH2-terminal ATPase domain, but the drug-enzyme interaction may involve other domains as well. The ATPase activity of the ATPase domain protein showed a quadratic dependence on enzyme concentration, suggesting that dimerization of the NH2-terminal domain is a rate-limiting step. Using both protein cross-linking and sedimentation equilibrium analysis, we showed that the ATPase domain exists as a monomer in the absence of cofactors but can readily dimerize in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate.

They play essential roles in many aspects of DNA transactions in vivo, including chromosome condensation and segregation, and removal of the supercoils generated during replication and transcription.

Biophys. 1998; 31: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic topo II is a homodimer with a primary dimeric interface at its COOH terminus. The enzyme binds to a segment of DNA (G-segment) and generates a reversible double strand break to serve as a gateway for the strand passage. The binding of ATP to the ATPase domain leads to the dimerization of this domain and closure of the NH2-terminal protein clamp (N-gate). This movement in the NH2-terminal clamp can entrap another DNA segment (T-segment) and initiate a series of conformational changes that include the passage of the T-segment through the protein-mediated DNA break, the religation of the DNA gate, and release of the T-segment through the opening of its COOH-terminal dimer interface. Recent rapid kinetic measurements have provided further insights into this process (17Harkins T.T. Lindsley J.E. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7292-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 18Baird C.L. Harkins T.T. Morris S.K. Lindsley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13685-13690Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The two ATP molecules bound to each topo II homodimer are hydrolyzed at very different rates, and strand passage of T-segment occurs after the hydrolysis of the first ATP. The ATPase activity of topo II is reduced by a unique class of catalytic inhibitors, bisdioxopiperazines like ICRF-193 and ICRF-159 (7Andoh T. Ishida R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Bisdioxopiperazines are anti-tumor agents that target eukaryotic topo II in vivo (19Ishida R. Hamatake M. Wasserman R.A. Nitiss J.L. Wang J.C. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2299-2303PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study on a member of this drug family, ICRF-193, has shown that in the presence of ATP, the drug inhibits yeast topo II activities by trapping the enzyme in a closed clamp form (20Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Using rapid kinetic analysis, Morris et al.(21Morris S.K. Baird C.L. Lindsley J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2613-2618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) have shown that ICRF-193, which does not work as a competitive inhibitor of ATP, can bind to a closed clamp complex but still allow ATP hydrolysis at a much lower rate. Initial analysis of some of the cell lines resistant to this drug indicates that mutations in the ATPase domain of topo II are responsible for the resistance (22Sehested M. Wessel I. Jensen L.H.

Nitiss J.L. Sehested M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3442-3450PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study on the ATPase domain of yeast topo II has shown that ICRF-193 can inhibit the ATP hydrolysis, indicating a direct interaction between the drug and ATPase domain (24Olland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, a study with the 52-kDa ATPase domain of human topo II did not find any significant inhibition of ATPase activity by ICRF-193 (25Gardiner L.P. Roper D.I. Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16997-17004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Analysis of the cytotoxicity of this drug in the yeast model system indicates that cell killing requires more than just the irreversibly closed clamp conformation of intracellular topo II (26Jensen L.H. Nitiss K.C. Rose A. Dong J. Zhou J., Hu, T. Osheroff N. Jensen P.B. Sehested M. Nitiss J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2137-2146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Our previous study on the core domain of Drosophila topo II, which lacks the ATPase domain, also raised the possibility of the involvement of other topo II domains in the protein-drug interaction (27Chang S., Hu, T. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19822-19828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Whether this class of drugs can stimulate topo II-mediated DNA cleavage is still another issue remaining to be clarified. Earlier works have demonstrated that these drugs can inhibit the catalytic activities of the enzyme without stabilizing the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate (28Ishida R. Miki T. Narita T. Yui R. Sato M. Utsumi K.R. Tanabe K. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4909-4916PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tanabe K. Ikegami Y. Ishida R. Andoh T. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4903-4908PubMed Google Scholar). Recent experiments using a different procedure to trap the topo II-DNA cleavable complex showed that ICRF-193 can promote DNA cleavage mediated by human topo II (30Huang K.C. Gao H. Yamasaki E.F. Grabowski D.R. Liu S. Shen L.L. Chan K.K. Ganapathi R. Snapka R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44488-44494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To further probe the action of bisdioxopiperazines, especially on the ATPase domain of topo II, we examined the effects of this drug on three types of topo II constructs: the ATPase domain; the GyrB homologous domain, which includes both the ATPase domain and the GyrB′ domain; and the full-length enzyme. We have also monitored the effect of nucleotide cofactors on the dimerization of the ATPase domain to gain insights into the effects of cofactors on the clamp closure at the N-gate. We used PCRs to construct the expression vectors for Drosophila and human NH2-terminal ATPase domains (DmATPD and HsATPD, respectively). The sequences of 5′ and 3′ PCR primers for generating HsATPD were 5′-CCT GGT TTG TAC AAA ATC TTT G-3′ and 5′-GGC AAC CTA GG T TA A TGG TGA TGA TGA TGG TGC TTG TTT AAC TGG ACT TGG GC-3′, respectively. The 5′ primer contains the sequence encoding residues 79–85 of human topo II including a BsrGI digestion site (underlined) that is unique on the yeast expression vector containing the entire human topo II coding sequence, YEpWOB6 (31Wasserman R.A. Austin C.A. Fisher L.M. Wang J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3591-3596PubMed Google Scholar). The 3′ primer contains the sequence encoding residue 419–425 of human topo II and His6 tag (italicized) followed by a stop codon (boldface type) and a unique AvrII site (underlined). The sequences of 5′ and 3′ PCR primers for generating DmATPD are 5′ CAT TCCGGT GAC CAT GCA CAA G 3′ and 5′ GGC TTG CAT GC T TA A TGG TGA TGA TGA TGG TGC TTG GCA ATG TCA TTT TGG GCC 3′, respectively. The 5′ primer contains the sequence encoding residues 106–113 of Drosophila topo II including aBstEII site (underlined) that is unique on the yeast expression vector containing the entire Drosophila topo II coding sequence, YGBBXΔ22 (32Wyckoff E. Hsieh T.-s. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 3′ primer contains the sequence encoding residues 397–403 of Drosophila topo II and His6 tag (italicized), followed by a stop codon (boldface type) and a unique SphI site (underlined). The PCR fragments were cloned back to the YEpWOB6 and YGBBXΔ22 vector using the above restriction enzymes. To generate the DmGyrB construct, we used TM10, which is a linker insertion construct containing a 4-residue (His-Ala-Cys-Lys) insertion between residues 668 and 669 ofDrosophila topo II (33Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This insertion site is located at the junction of GyrB and GyrA domains, and there is a uniqueMluI site in the linker sequence. To generate a truncation at this site, the following two oligonucleotides were synthesized: 5′-CGC G CA TCA TCA TCA TCA C TA GCTGAC ATG-3′ and 5′-TCA GCT A GT GAT GAT GAT GAT G-3′. These sequences contain a 5′ MluI cohesive end and a 3′ SphI cohesive end (underlined), a 5-histidine tag (italicized), and a stop codon (boldface type). They were annealed to form the adapter and inserted into TM10 between the MluI site and SphI site to generate the DmGyrB construct. The sequence 5′ to that coding for pentahistidine, derived from part of the linker insertion sequence, codes for His-Ala. Together, they generate His-Ala-His5 at the carboxyl terminus of the DmGyrB protein construct. Both the wild-type and truncation proteins were overexpressed and purified as described previously (27Chang S., Hu, T. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19822-19828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purification of the His-tagged truncation proteins was performed as follows. The cleared lysate prepared from an 8-liter culture was passed through a 5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) in the presence of 15 mm imidazole, pH 7.0. 250 mm NaCl was also included in all of the buffers throughout the purification. After washing with 50 ml of 30 mm imidazole solution, stepwise concentrations of 60, 120, 240, and 500 mm imidazole were used to elute the protein, with a volume of 10 ml at each step. The His-tagged topo II protein was eluted between the 120 and 240 mm imidazole steps. The peak fractions were combined and further purified by HQ and HE column chromatography (PerSeptive Biosystem) using a procedure modified from our published methods (34Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The final peak fractions were dialyzed against the storage buffer containing 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 50 mmKAc, 5 mm Mg(Ac)2, and 50% glycerol. Also included in solutions used throughout the steps of purification and storage was a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Prior to the ATPase assay, the proteins were concentrated and exchanged into a buffer of 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9, using a Microcon centrifugal device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Two methods were used to measure the ATP hydrolysis. The TLC method was done as described previously (34Hu T. Chang S. Hsieh T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9586-9592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The coupled PEP/LDH spectrophotometric assay was performed at 30 °C on an HP 8453 diode array spectrophotometer with a thermostat cuvette cell according to a published procedure (35Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8096-8104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all of the experiments, only the data from the linear range of ATP hydrolysis were used to calculate the reaction rate. We have tested for the optimal conditions for these proteins. Both ATPD proteins have shown the highest activity in a buffer with an ionic strength that is less than 10 mmin monovalent salt and 2–4 mm in divalent cation (data not shown). In most experiments, the standard reaction mixture contained 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 5 mm KAc, 2.5 mm Mg(Ac)2, and 1.25 mm ATP. The optimal ionic conditions for ATPase activity of DmGyrB fragment were also determined to be 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 25 mm KAc, 10 mm Mg(Ac)2. The ionic strength for DmGyrB is higher than that optimal for the HsATPD and DmATPD but still much lower than that for full-length topo II. One apparent effect of the truncation of the carboxyl portion of topo II is that optimal ATPase activity in these proteins occurs at a much lower ionic strength in the reaction conditions. Samples of HsATPD were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 30 mmpotassium phosphate, and 5 mm Mg(Ac)2. 75-μl samples (1 mg/ml) were successively brought to sedimentation equilibrium at 9,000, 12,000, and 15,000 rpm over a period of 2 days at 20 °C in an analytical ultracentrifuge (XL-A ultracentrifuge; Beckman Instruments). To establish a base line, the samples were subjected then to an overspeed at 50,000 rpm, and, where needed, the data were base line-corrected. Cofactors like ATP, AMPPNP, and ICRF-193 were included in some samples at the concentrations indicated. In each case, the same concentration of cofactor was included both in the sample and in the reference solvent. Absorbance measurements were made routinely at 290 nm, where the absorbance due to the cofactors is low compared with the protein. The data were fitted by theIdeal-1 program (Beckman Instruments) using a value ofv̄ = 0.7384 (partial specific volume of HsATPD), calculated from the amino acid composition, and a value of ρ20 = 1.006 (solvent density), measured by picnometry. Achievement of sedimentation equilibrium was confirmed by time lapse scans and, more importantly, by the agreement of calculated best fit molecular weights from sequential sedimentation scans at each speed. To calculate the dimerization constants, we used two software programs provided by Dr. Allen Minton to process and analyze the sedimentation equilibria data. The best fit weight average molecular weight data from all three speeds were obtained first by using the programMWAVCALC6. The dimerization constants were then obtained by using the program F-MWN50-N to globally fit the molecular weight data from all three speeds. This program uses Marquardt-Levenberg χ2 minimization in a nonlinear least squares model to globally fit the sedimentation data. The S.E. in all of the dimerization constants calculated from such analysis is usually smaller than 10%. We assume that the following three equilibria best describe the reactions of HsATPD in the presence of ADP under the conditions of sedimentation equilibrium experiments. N+N↔K0N2Equation 1 N+A↔K1NAEquation 2 NA+NAâ†”K2(NA)2Equation 3 N and NA represent the unliganded and liganded monomer of ATPD, respectively, and A represents the cofactor ADP.K 1 defines the association constant of ADP with ATPD. K 0 and K 2 are the dimerization constants for unliganded and liganded monomer, respectively. Inclusion of the equilibrium involving the association of heterotypic monomer, N and NA, does not alter the curve-fitting described below, suggesting that the above equilibria are parsimonious with respect to the data analysis presented here. The apparent dimerization constant K Dapp obtained from sedimentation equilibrium includes all of the dimer and monomer species and is defined as the following. KDapp=(Dimer species)(Monomer species)2=((N)2+(NA)2)(N+NA)2Equation 4 Substituting Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3 into Equation 4, we obtain the following. KDapp=K12K2(A)2+K0(1+K1(A))2Equation 5 By curve-fitting of the plot K Dapp versus ADP concentration using Equation 5 with KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), we can obtain the equilibrium constants defined in Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3. The assay was performed as described in Ref. 25Gardiner L.P. Roper D.I. Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16997-17004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar with the following modifications. The protein was dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 5 mm KCl, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 mmMg(Ac)2. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, dimethylsuberimidate was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml followed by an additional 1-h incubation at 25 °C. The reactions were quenched by adding Tris-glycine, pH 8.0, to 50 mm and analyzed by 6% SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). To study the functions of the ATPase domain and the GyrB homologous domain of eukaryotic topo II, we have constructed two NH2-terminal truncation fragments ofDrosophila topo II and one from human topo II. The truncation end points are based on the domain structures ofDrosophila topo II, as determined by protease-sensitive site and linker insertion analysis (Fig.1 A) (33Lee M.P. Hsieh T.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 436-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The domain structure of eukaryotic topo II is conserved as shown by similar analysis with yeast topo II (37Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C.

Nature. 1996; 379: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). For theDrosophila truncation constructs, the 47-kDa fragment of the ATPase domain (DmATPD) contains the first 406 amino acid residues plus a hexahistidine tag, whereas the 77-kDa fragment of the GyrB homologous domain (DmGyrB) contains the first 668 amino acid residues plus a hexahistidine tag (Fig. 1, B and C). The 46-kDa fragment of ATPase domain of human topo II, HsATPD, contains the first 6 amino acid residues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae topo II followed by Ser-29 to Lys-425 of human topo II and a hexahistidine tag (Fig. 1 D). All three constructs were overexpressed in a protease-deficient yeast strain BCY123 and purified to over 95% of homogeneity (Fig. 2).Figure 2Purification of the truncated topo II. 2 μg each of molecular weight size markers and three truncation topo II proteins were run in a 7% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. DmATPD, HsATPD, and DmGyrB are shown inlanes 2, 3, and 4, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For both DmATPD and HsATPD, the presence of DNA greatly stimulates their ATPase activity (comparing A and B of Fig.3). In the absence of DNA, both proteins had only a low level of ATPase activity, with a reduction of about 20-fold when compared with the conditions in the presence of DNA and at the identical protein concentrations. The DNA dependence of the proteins has been explored over a range of concentrations from 0 to 300 μm in base pairs. The maximal DNA stimulation for DmATPD and HsATPD happens at a concentration of 100 and 30 μm bp, respectively (data not shown). The optimal DNA concentration in the stimulation of ATPase activity for DmGyrB protein is also estimated to be around 100 μm bp. Interestingly, when the ATPase activities were measured at different protein concentrations, both the DNA-independent and the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of DmATPD and HsATPD have shown a parabolic dependence on the enzyme concentration, suggesting that the dimerization of the subunits is the rate-limiting step in ATP hydrolysis under such conditions (Fig. 3). In contrast, the concentration dependence for the DmGyrB proteins follows an expected linear relationship, just like that for the full-length proteins ofDrosophila topo II or human topo IIα (data not shown). Therefore, dimerization of the GyrB domain of topo II is favored at equilibrium, and this process is not rate-limiting for the ATPase reaction. While all the truncation proteins, similar to the full-length enzymes, exhibited ATPase activities that can be further stimulated by the presence of DNA, their ATPase activities are much reduced in comparison with the holoenzymes. To gain quantitative insight into these rate differences, we have analyzed the ATP hydrolysis rates as a function of substrate concentrations. For HsATPD and DmATPD, these rate curves can be fit with a Michaelis-Menten kinetic equation (Fig.4, A and B). For the holoenzymes and DmGyrB, their rate data can also fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics. While the apparent K m values for these constructs are comparable, ranging between 0.4 and 0.6 mm (data not shown), there is a 10-fold difference in apparent k cat between the full-length proteins and the ATPase domain fragments (TableI). These data suggest that substrate binding may remain unaffected whether the ATPase domain is part of the holoenzyme or exists by itself, assuming that the apparentK m values in this case can give an estimate of the ATP binding affinities. However, protein domains other than the ATPase part can have a major role for the ATP hydrolysis activity.Table IApparent k cat for the topo II proteinsWith DNAWithout DNAs−1Human holoenzyme2.30.1Drosophilaholoenzyme2.00.1Drosophila GyrB0.60.03Human ATPD0.210.02DrosophilaATPD0.350.02k cat is obtained by dividing theV max of ATPase activity by the monomeric concentration of the enzymes. V max values were determined using the data analysis similar to what was shown in Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab k cat is obtained by dividing theV max of ATPase activity by the monomeric concentration of the enzymes. V max values were determined using the data analysis similar to what was shown in Fig. 4. The anti-cancer agent bisdioxopiperazine is a topo II inhibitor and can lock up the N-gate in the presence of ATP (20Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It remains unclear, however, whether bisdioxopiperazine only targets the ATPase domain and thereby inhibits its ATPase activity. Whereas an NH2-terminal ATPD of yeast topo II (residues 1–409) expressed in yeast cells can be inhibited by ICRF-193 (24Olland S. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), another drug in this family, ICRF-159, cannot inhibit the ATPase activity from a similar NH2-terminal fragment (residues 1–439) of human topo II purified from the renatured fraction of a bacterial expression system (25Gardiner L.P. Roper D.I. Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16997-17004Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The difference could be due to different expression/purification systems and ATPD from different organisms. To further investigate the inhibition of eukaryotic topo II by bisdioxopiperazine drugs, we studied the effect of ICRF-193 on the ATPase activities of both human and Drosophila topo II holoenzymes, DmGyrB, and both human and Drosophila ATPase domain fragments. As shown in Fig. 5, the ATPase activity of both holoenzymes is exquisitely sensitive to the drug, with the IC50 of the human and Drosophilaproteins being around 0.1 and 0.3 μm, respectively. The inhibition of the ATPase domains by ICRF-193 could also be detected, although at much higher drug concentrations, with the IC50of HsATPD and DmATPD being 60 and 30 μm, respectively. For DmGyrB protein, the sensitivity of its ATPase activity to the drug is between those of the holoenzyme and the ATPase domain, with an IC50 of 3 μm. Comparing the result shown in Fig. 5 and the ATPase activity of the different constructs listed in Table I, we have found that the sensitivity of topo II proteins to ICRF-193 correlates with the ATPase activity of these proteins. For the topo II constructs with a higher ATPase activity, there is a concomitant increase in the sensitivity toward bisdioxopiperazine. These results also suggest the bisdioxopiperazine drugs can directly effect the ATPase domain of eukaryotic topo II to inhibit its ATP hydrolysis activity. However, we cannot rule out the possible involvement of the other domains of the enzyme in the action of these drugs, since the drug sensitivity increases when other domains of the holoenzyme are also included in the protein constructs. The closure of the N-gate through dimerization of the NH2-terminal domain plays a critical role in the initiation of the catalytic cycle of topo II reaction. Furthermore, since the mechanism of action of bisdioxopiperazine drugs involves the closure of the N-gate, they may affect the dimerization of ATPD. We have examined the effects of cofactors on the dimerization of the ATPD by monitoring the change in the molecular mass by chemical cross-linking and by sedimentation equilibrium. In the cross-linking experiments, dimethylsuberimidate was used to covalently bridge the dimerized protein (Fig.6). For ATPD from bothDrosophila and human topo II, no dimerized species were detected in the absence"

We examined the role of cAMP as a survival factor, and the signaling pathways through which cAMP affords protection. Rat thyroid cells were selected for these studies given the predominant role of cAMP in thyrotropin (TSH)-stimulated proliferation and as an oncogene in thyroid cells. Wistar rat thyroid (WRT) cells perished via apoptosis following sodium nitroprusside (SNP) treatment. Elevations in cAMP following treatment with forskolin, 8BrcAMP or IBMX rescued cells from SNP-induced cell death. Notably, TSH prevented apoptosis, implicating an important role for this hormone as a survival factor. Cyclic AMP activates multiple signaling pathways including those mediated through PKA, PI3K, p70S6k and the Ras-related small G protein, Rap1. Intriguingly, multiple pathways modulate thyroid cell survival. Interference with cAMP-stimulated p70S6k, but not PI3K, activity abrogated cell survival. Treatment with PKA inhibitors was sufficient to stimulate apoptosis in hormone-deprived cells and markedly enhanced cell death in response to SNP. Cells expressing an activated Rap1A mutant exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to SNP-induced apoptosis, while those expressing dominant negative Rap1A were resistant to SNP-initiated cell death. Together, these findings establish an important role for PKA and Rap1 in the control of thyroid cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W2000394421,"The signaling pathways of TC21-mediated transformation and cell survival are not well-established. In this study, we have investigated the role of PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway in oncogenic-TC21-mediated transformation and cell survival. We found that oncogenic-TC21 stimulated the PI3-K activity. This was associated with the activation of Akt, a key component of PI3-K signaling pathway. We also found that TC21 interacted and formed complex with PI3-K. Mutations in the GTP-binding region of TC21, which enhanced GTP-binding potential of this protein, also stimulated its association with PI3-K, suggesting that PI3-K may preferentially interact with the GTP-bound form. Suppression of PI3-K and Akt by specific inhibitors LY294002 and Wortmannin reversed TC21-induced transformation. Likewise, inhibition of PI3-K activity by the PI3-K phosphotase PTEN reduced TC21-mediated focus formation in NIH3T3 cells. Investigation of TC21's effect on cell survival revealed that mutant-TC21 expressing cells were more resistant to etoposide- and cisplatin-induced cell death, and this was associated with the activation of anti-apoptotic protein NF-kappaB, a downstream target of Akt. Treatment of PI3-K inhibitor LY294002 significantly suppressed TC21-mediated NF-kappaB activation. In conclusion, we have identified PI3-K as an effector of TC21 and demonstrated that the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway plays important roles in TC21-mediated transformation and cell survival."

https://openalex.org/W2027643111,"Human involucrin (hINV) is a keratinocyte protein that is expressed in the suprabasal compartment of the epidermis and other stratifying surface epithelia. Involucrin gene expression is initiated early in the differentiation process and is maintained until terminal cell death. The distal regulatory region (DRR) is a segment of the hINV promoter (nucleotides -2473/-1953) that accurately recapitulates the normal pattern of suprabasal (spinous and granular layer) expression in transgenic mouse epithelia. To identify sequences that mediate expression at specific stages of differentiation, we divided the DRR into two segments, a 376 nucleotide upstream region (DRR(-2473/-2100)) and a 147 nucleotide downstream region (DRR(-2100/-1953)), and evaluated the ability of these sequences to drive expression in transgenic mice. The DRR(-2473/-2100) segment drives expression at a level comparable to that observed for the DRR, but expression is restricted to the upper granular layers (i.e., no spinous layer expression). In contrast, the DRR(-2100/-1953) segment does not drive expression. However, reassembling the DRR restores the complete range of expression. These results suggest that two distinct, spatially-separate elements are required to specify the complete differentiation-dependent program of involucrin gene expression. To identify specific transcription factor binding sites involved in this regulation, we mutated an activator protein-1 binding site, AP1-5, located within DRR(-2473/-2100) segment. This site binds AP1 transcription factors present in mouse epidermal extracts, and its mutation eliminates appropriate hINV expression. This result suggests that AP1 factors participate as components of a multi-component transcription factor complex that is required for regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2327615593,"The mechanism of bFGF-induced cell death in tumours of the Ewing's sarcoma family (ESFT) has been investigated. bFGF-induces phosphorylation of FGFr 1 and activation of Ras/ERK in ESFT cells that die when exposed to bFGF. Induction of cell death was associated with activation of both initiator (caspases-2, -8 and -10) and effector (caspases-3, -6 and -7) caspases. Moreover, the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK protected cells from bFGF-induced cell death. After treatment with bFGF, a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was accompanied by down-regulation of Bcl-2. However, the observed cell death was not associated with release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. Furthermore, expression of wild-type p53 was not required for bFGF-induced cell death. These observations suggest that bFGF-induced cell death may be mediated through a cell death receptor mechanism, supported by up-regulation of the p75 neurotrophin receptor. bFGF-induced cell death was associated with up-regulation of p21 and p53, down-regulation of PCNA and cyclin A and a decrease in active pRb1, changes consistent with accumulation of cells in G1. These data demonstrate that bFGF-induced cell death is effected through a caspase-dependent and p53-independent mechanism, that may be mediated through a cell death receptor pathway."

Here we report that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction pathway elevates βTrCP levels but inhibits expression of HOS in 293T cells. Similar disparity is likely to exist in human colorectal tumors. In the NIH3T3 cells, which express HOS, but not βTrCP, Wnt/β-catenin signaling leads to inhibition of HOS promoter activity and NF-κB-driven transcription as well as to stabilization of β-catenin. These results indicate that expression and activities of HOS are negatively regulated by Wnt/β-catenin pathway."

The ATM protein kinase is a master regulator of the response to double-strand breaks (DSBs), the most cytotoxic DNA lesion caused by ionizing radiation. ATM is the protein missing or inactive in patients with the pleiotropic genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T). A major response to DNA damage is altered expression of numerous genes. While studying gene expression in control and A-T cells following treatment with the radiomimetic chemical neocarzinostatin (NCS), we identified an expressed sequence tag that represented a gene that was induced by DSBs in an ATM-dependent manner. The corresponding cDNA encoded a dual specificity phosphatase of the MAP kinase phosphatase family, MKP-5. MKP-5 dephosphorylates and inactivates the stress-activated MAP kinases JNK and p38. The phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle of JNK and p38 by NCS was attenuated in A-T cells. Thus, ATM modulates this cycle in response to DSBs. These results further highlight ATM as a link between the DNA damage response and major signaling pathways involved in proliferative and apoptotic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1973200886,"Transfection of primate tissue explants with a specific sub-fragment (p31) of EBV DNA results in epithelial (but no other) cells proliferating indefinitely (becoming ‘immortalized’) without evidence of a ‘growth crisis’. Molecular evidence supports integration of viral information into the host chromosome, and an early genotypic alteration involving specific amplification of a sub-component (IR1) of p31 DNA, followed by apparent loss of viral DNA from chromosomes, consistent with a ‘hit and run’ mechanism. However, analysis at the individual cell level during long-term culture, by FISH techniques, reveals chromosomal alterations, and viral sequences surviving within double minute (DM) bodies. Changing growth patterns occurring at different stages during propagation (>a year in culture) may be explained by sporadic reintegration of surviving viral DNA into the host chromosome. Notably, throughout culture, telomere lengths in chromosomal DNAs do not alter but rather retain the length observed in the primary cell populations. Introduction of a growth stimulating function of EBV, BARF1, into the immortalized, non-clonable epithelial cells under conditions which permit overexpression, allows clonal populations to be derived. Based on the data, mechanisms of immortalization, in the absence of a proven viral oncogene in p31 DNA, and possible genes involved, are considered."

To determine whether p63 proteins, members of the family of p53-related genes, are also involved in this process, we examined their expression in serially passaged rat embryo fibroblasts. Upon senescence, two truncated DeltaNp63 proteins decreased in abundance whereas two TAp63 isoforms accumulated. 2-D gel analysis showed that the DeltaNp63 proteins underwent post-translational modifications in both proliferating and senescent cells. Direct binding of DeltaNp63 proteins to a p53 consensus motif was greater in proliferating cells than senescent cells. In contrast p63alpha isoforms bound to DNA in a p53 dependent manner and this was higher in senescent cells than proliferating cells. An interaction of p63alpha proteins with SV40 large tumour antigen was also detected and ectopic expression of DeltaNp63alpha can extend the lifespan of rat embryo fibroblasts. Taken together the results indicate that p63 proteins may play a role in replicative senescence either by competition for p53 DNA binding sites or by direct interaction with p53 protein bound to DNA."

This protein shares high sequence homology to the yeast vacuolar H(+)-ATPase subunit, Vph1p, and the 116 kDa proton pump of the rat and bovine synaptic vesicle, Vpp1. We examined the function of ShIF in the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). ShIF inhibited HUVEC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Recombinant ShIF added at 10 and 20 ng/ml inhibited HUVEC proliferation by 21.6 and 44.3%, respectively and increasing the concentration of ShIF to 100 ng/ml inhibited proliferation by as much as 55.5%. When HUVEC cells were cultured at various concentrations of ShIF in the presence of anti-ShIF antibody, the inhibitory effects of ShIF to HUVEC proliferation were abrogated by 89-91% indicating that the activity of ShIF to HUVEC was specific. HUVEC cultured in the presence of ShIF and bafilomycin, a specific inhibitor of ATPase, resulted to a 90% growth inhibition. Thus, ShIF may act as an antagonist to the ATPase complex by disrupting the production of cellular ATP thereby decreasing the ability of HUVEC to proliferate."
