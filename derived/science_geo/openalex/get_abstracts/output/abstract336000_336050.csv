https://openalex.org/W1988195463,Soybean exudates contain iron compounds which can be separated electrophoretically into anodic bands and eluted with water. Chromatography of the water extracts separated iron from chelating agents which were identified as malic acid and malonic acid. Hence organic acids seem to function in the translocation of iron in plants.

The observations, combined with the vertical profiles of ozone and fission products whose origin is the stratosphere, suggest that a rising motion, rather than turbulent mixing, is the more likely mode of transfer in the upper atmosphere.

The presence of fixed charges, polarizable molecules, or electric fields does not alter the flux-force relation."
