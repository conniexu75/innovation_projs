https://openalex.org/W2528263447,"Chromosome conformation capture methods have identified subchromosomal structures of higher-order chromatin interactions called topologically associated domains (TADs) that are separated from each other by boundary regions. By subdividing the genome into discrete regulatory units, TADs restrict the contacts that enhancers establish with their target genes. However, the mechanisms that underlie partitioning of the genome into TADs remain poorly understood. Here we show by chromosome conformation capture (capture Hi-C and 4C-seq methods) that genomic duplications in patient cells and genetically modified mice can result in the formation of new chromatin domains (neo-TADs) and that this process determines their molecular pathology. Duplications of non-coding DNA within the mouse Sox9 TAD (intra-TAD) that cause female to male sex reversal in humans, showed increased contact of the duplicated regions within the TAD, but no change in the overall TAD structure. In contrast, overlapping duplications that extended over the next boundary into the neighbouring TAD (inter-TAD), resulted in the formation of a new chromatin domain (neo-TAD) that was isolated from the rest of the genome. As a consequence of this insulation, inter-TAD duplications had no phenotypic effect. However, incorporation of the next flanking gene, Kcnj2, in the neo-TAD resulted in ectopic contacts of Kcnj2 with the duplicated part of the Sox9 regulatory region, consecutive misexpression of Kcnj2, and a limb malformation phenotype. Our findings provide evidence that TADs are genomic regulatory units with a high degree of internal stability that can be sculptured by structural genomic variations. This process is important for the interpretation of copy number variations, as these variations are routinely detected in diagnostic tests for genetic disease and cancer. This finding also has relevance in an evolutionary setting because copy-number differences are thought to have a crucial role in the evolution of genome complexity."

https://openalex.org/W2527708324,"Advances in genome assembly and phasing provide an opportunity to investigate the diploid architecture of the human genome and reveal the full range of structural variation across population groups. Here we report the de novo assembly and haplotype phasing of the Korean individual AK1 (ref. 1) using single-molecule real-time sequencing, next-generation mapping, microfluidics-based linked reads, and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequencing approaches. Single-molecule sequencing coupled with next-generation mapping generated a highly contiguous assembly, with a contig N50 size of 17.9 Mb and a scaffold N50 size of 44.8 Mb, resolving 8 chromosomal arms into single scaffolds. The de novo assembly, along with local assemblies and spanning long reads, closes 105 and extends into 72 out of 190 euchromatic gaps in the reference genome, adding 1.03 Mb of previously intractable sequence. High concordance between the assembly and paired-end sequences from 62,758 BAC clones provides strong support for the robustness of the assembly. We identify 18,210 structural variants by direct comparison of the assembly with the human reference, identifying thousands of breakpoints that, to our knowledge, have not been reported before. Many of the insertions are reflected in the transcriptome and are shared across the Asian population. We performed haplotype phasing of the assembly with short reads, long reads and linked reads from whole-genome sequencing and with short reads from 31,719 BAC clones, thereby achieving phased blocks with an N50 size of 11.6 Mb. Haplotigs assembled from single-molecule real-time reads assigned to haplotypes on phased blocks covered 89% of genes. The haplotigs accurately characterized the hypervariable major histocompatability complex region as well as demonstrating allele configuration in clinically relevant genes such as CYP2D6. This work presents the most contiguous diploid human genome assembly so far, with extensive investigation of unreported and Asian-specific structural variants, and high-quality haplotyping of clinically relevant alleles for precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2528061128,"Chaperomes are dynamic assemblies of proteins that regulate cellular homeostasis but specific cellular stresses remodel chaperome components into a stable chaperome network called the epichaperome, which might offer a new cancer target. The chaperome describes the assembly of chaperones, co-chaperones, adaptors and folding enzymes into dynamic complexes that regulate cellular homeostasis. Whereas in normal cells, these assemblies are transient, Gabriela Chiosis and colleagues show that under conditions of stress, such as cancer, the chaperome forms a stable network that aids deleterious cell survival. The authors investigate the presence of such larger 'epichaperome' complexes in patient samples and find that they occur irrespective of tissue of origin or genetic background, and can be present in more than half of all cancers. These findings hint that targeting the epichaperome, rather than the chaperome components, could lead the way for developing new cancer treatments. Transient, multi-protein complexes are important facilitators of cellular functions. This includes the chaperome, an abundant protein family comprising chaperones, co-chaperones, adaptors, and folding enzymes—dynamic complexes of which regulate cellular homeostasis together with the protein degradation machinery1,2,3,4,5,6. Numerous studies have addressed the role of chaperome members in isolation, yet little is known about their relationships regarding how they interact and function together in malignancy7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. As function is probably highly dependent on endogenous conditions found in native tumours, chaperomes have resisted investigation, mainly due to the limitations of methods needed to disrupt or engineer the cellular environment to facilitate analysis. Such limitations have led to a bottleneck in our understanding of chaperome-related disease biology and in the development of chaperome-targeted cancer treatment. Here we examined the chaperome complexes in a large set of tumour specimens. The methods used maintained the endogenous native state of tumours and we exploited this to investigate the molecular characteristics and composition of the chaperome in cancer, the molecular factors that drive chaperome networks to crosstalk in tumours, the distinguishing factors of the chaperome in tumours sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition, and the characteristics of tumours that may benefit from chaperome therapy. We find that under conditions of stress, such as malignant transformation fuelled by MYC, the chaperome becomes biochemically ‘rewired’ to form a network of stable, survival-facilitating, high-molecular-weight complexes. The chaperones heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and heat shock cognate protein 70 (HSC70) are nucleating sites for these physically and functionally integrated complexes. The results indicate that these tightly integrated chaperome units, here termed the epichaperome, can function as a network to enhance cellular survival, irrespective of tissue of origin or genetic background. The epichaperome, present in over half of all cancers tested, has implications for diagnostics and also provides potential vulnerability as a target for drug intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2551890370,"Despite decades of research, the effects of spectral quality on plant growth, and development are not well understood. Much of our current understanding comes from studies with daily integrated light levels that are less than 10% of summer sunlight thus making it difficult to characterize interactions between light quality and quantity. Several studies have reported that growth is increased under fluorescent lamps compared to mixtures of wavelengths from LEDs. Conclusions regarding the effect of green light fraction range from detrimental to beneficial. Here we report the effects of eight blue and green light fractions at two photosynthetic photon fluxes (PPF; 200 and 500 μmol m-2 s-1; with a daily light integral of 11.5 and 29 mol m-2 d-1) on growth (dry mass), leaf expansion, stem and petiole elongation, and whole-plant net assimilation of seven diverse plant species. The treatments included cool, neutral, and warm white LEDs, and combinations of blue, green and/or red LEDs. At the higher PPF (500), increasing blue light in increments from 11 to 28% reduced growth in tomato, cucumber, and pepper by 22, 26, and 14% respectively, but there was no statistically significant effect on radish, soybean, lettuce or wheat. At the lower PPF (200), increasing blue light reduced growth only in tomato (41%). The effects of blue light on growth were mediated by changes in leaf area and radiation capture, with minimal effects on whole-plant net-assimilation. In contrast to the significant effects of blue light, increasing green light in increments from 0 to 30% had a relatively small effect on growth, leaf area and net assimilation at either low or high PPF. Surprisingly, growth of three of the seven species was not reduced by a treatment with 93% green light compared to the broad spectrum treatments. Collectively, these results are consistent with a shade avoidance response associated with either low blue or high green light fractions."
https://openalex.org/W2508224378,"In quantum mechanics, measurements cause wavefunction collapse that yields precise outcomes, whereas for non-commuting observables such as position and momentum Heisenberg's uncertainty principle limits the intrinsic precision of a state. Although theoretical work has demonstrated that it should be possible to perform simultaneous non-commuting measurements and has revealed the limits on measurement outcomes, only recently has the dynamics of the quantum state been discussed. To realize this unexplored regime, we simultaneously apply two continuous quantum non-demolition probes of non-commuting observables to a superconducting qubit. We implement multiple readout channels by coupling the qubit to multiple modes of a cavity. To control the measurement observables, we implement a 'single quadrature' measurement by driving the qubit and applying cavity sidebands with a relative phase that sets the observable. Here, we use this approach to show that the uncertainty principle governs the dynamics of the wavefunction by enforcing a lower bound on the measurement-induced disturbance. Consequently, as we transition from measuring identical to measuring non-commuting observables, the dynamics make a smooth transition from standard wavefunction collapse to localized persistent diffusion and then to isotropic persistent diffusion. Although the evolution of the state differs markedly from that of a conventional measurement, information about both non-commuting observables is extracted by keeping track of the time ordering of the measurement record, enabling quantum state tomography without alternating measurements. Our work creates novel capabilities for quantum control, including rapid state purification, adaptive measurement, measurement-based state steering and continuous quantum error correction. As physical systems often interact continuously with their environment via non-commuting degrees of freedom, our work offers a way to study how notions of contemporary quantum foundations arise in such settings."
https://openalex.org/W2528153572,"In the past decades ancient DNA research has brought numerous insights to archaeological research where traditional approaches were limited. The determination of sex in human skeletal remains is often challenging for physical anthropologists when dealing with incomplete, juvenile or pathological specimens. Molecular approaches allow sexing on the basis of sex-specific markers or by calculating the ratio of DNA derived from different chromosomes. Here we propose a novel approach that relies on the ratio of X chromosome-derived shotgun sequencing data to the autosomal coverage, thus establishing the probability of an XX or XY karyotype. Applying this approach to the individuals of the Upper Paleolithic triple burial of Dolní Věstonice reveals that all three skeletons, including the individual DV 15, whose sex has long been debated due to a pathological condition, were male."
https://openalex.org/W2552999122,"Background Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is a leading cause of infectious death worldwide. Gene-expression microarray studies profiling the blood transcriptional response of tuberculosis (TB) patients have been undertaken in order to better understand the host immune response as well as to identify potential biomarkers of disease. To date most of these studies have focused on pulmonary TB patients with gene-expression profiles of extra-pulmonary TB patients yet to be compared to those of patients with pulmonary TB or sarcoidosis. Methods A novel cohort of patients with extra-pulmonary TB and sarcoidosis was recruited and the transcriptional response of these patients compared to those with pulmonary TB using a variety of transcriptomic approaches including testing a previously defined 380 gene meta-signature of active TB. Results The 380 meta-signature broadly differentiated active TB from healthy controls in this new dataset consisting of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB. The top 15 genes from this meta-signature had a lower sensitivity for differentiating extra-pulmonary TB from healthy controls as compared to pulmonary TB. We found the blood transcriptional responses in pulmonary and extra-pulmonary TB to be heterogeneous and to reflect the extent of symptoms of disease. Conclusions The transcriptional signature in extra-pulmonary TB demonstrated heterogeneity of gene expression reflective of symptom status, while the signature of pulmonary TB was distinct, based on a higher proportion of symptomatic individuals. These findings are of importance for the rational design and implementation of mRNA based TB diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2528986982,"Rare and threatened species are the most frequent focus of conservation science and action. With the ongoing shift from single-species conservation towards the preservation of ecosystem services, there is a greater need to understand abundance trends of common species because declines in common species can disproportionately impact ecosystems function. We used volunteer-collected data in two European countries, the United Kingdom (UK) and Switzerland, since the 1970s to assess national and regional trends for one of Europe’s most abundant amphibian species, the common toad (Bufo bufo). Millions of toads were moved by volunteers across roads during this period in an effort to protect them from road traffic. For Switzerland, we additionally estimated trends for the common frog (Rana temporaria), a similarly widespread and common amphibian species. We used state-space models to account for variability in detection and effort and included only populations with at least 5 years of data; 153 populations for the UK and 141 for Switzerland. Common toads declined continuously in each decade in both countries since the 1980s. Given the declines, this common species almost qualifies for International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red-listing over this period despite volunteer conservation efforts. Reasons for the declines and wider impacts remain unknown. By contrast, common frog populations were stable or increasing in Switzerland, although there was evidence of declines after 2003. “Toads on Roads” schemes are vital citizen conservation action projects, and the data from such projects can be used for large scale trend estimations of widespread amphibians. We highlight the need for increased research into the status of common amphibian species in addition to conservation efforts focusing on rare and threatened species."
https://openalex.org/W2565680151,"Our objective is to study the relationship between the regulatory proteins Bcl-2/Bax and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis during the differentiation of adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) into neurons. Immunocytochemistry and western blotting showed that the cells weakly expressed neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the non-induced group and expressed NSE more strongly in the groups induced for 1 h, 3 h, 5 h and 8 h. NSE expression peaked at 5 h (P < 0.05), although there was no significant difference between 5 and 8 h (P > 0.05). Bcl-2 expression gradually decreased over time in the non-induced group (P < 0.05). However, Bax, caspase-9, Cyt-c and caspase-3 expression gradually increased and peaked at 8 h (P < 0.05). Transmission electron microscopy revealed karyopyknosis, chromatin edge setting, mitochondria swelling and cavitation in cells at 5 h, and the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased over time, as demonstrated by laser scanning confocal microscopy. After a 5 h induction, cells differentiated into typical neurons and expressed Bcl-2, which inhibited apoptosis. Bax showed a strong apoptosis-promoting capacity, leading to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential and structure, and then triggered the caspase-independent apoptotic response through the mitochondrial pathway. At the same time, Cyt-c was directly or indirectly released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm to trigger the caspase-dependent apoptotic response through the mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, Bcl-2/Bax play an important role in regulating caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial pathway during the differentiation of ADSCs into neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2528794188,"The fin-to-limb transition represents one of the major vertebrate morphological innovations associated with the transition from aquatic to terrestrial life and is an attractive model for gaining insights into the mechanisms of morphological diversity between species. One of the characteristic features of limbs is the presence of digits at their extremities. Although most tetrapods have limbs with five digits (pentadactyl limbs), palaeontological data indicate that digits emerged in lobed fins of early tetrapods, which were polydactylous. How the transition to pentadactyl limbs occurred remains unclear. Here we show that the mutually exclusive expression of the mouse genes Hoxa11 and Hoxa13, which were previously proposed to be involved in the origin of the tetrapod limb, is required for the pentadactyl state. We further demonstrate that the exclusion of Hoxa11 from the Hoxa13 domain relies on an enhancer that drives antisense transcription at the Hoxa11 locus after activation by HOXA13 and HOXD13. Finally, we show that the enhancer that drives antisense transcription of the mouse Hoxa11 gene is absent in zebrafish, which, together with the largely overlapping expression of hoxa11 and hoxa13 genes reported in fish, suggests that this enhancer emerged in the course of the fin-to-limb transition. On the basis of the polydactyly that we observed after expression of Hoxa11 in distal limbs, we propose that the evolution of Hoxa11 regulation contributed to the transition from polydactyl limbs in stem-group tetrapods to pentadactyl limbs in extant tetrapods."
https://openalex.org/W2528818502,"For centuries, observational microscopy has greatly facilitated biology education, but we still cannot easily and playfully interact with the microscopic world we see. We therefore developed the LudusScope, an accessible, interactive do-it-yourself smartphone microscopy platform that promotes exploratory stimulation and observation of microscopic organisms, in a design that combines the educational modalities of build, play, and inquire. The LudusScope’s touchscreen and joystick allow the selection and stimulation of phototactic microorganisms such as Euglena gracilis with light. Organismal behavior is tracked and displayed in real time, enabling open and structured game play as well as scientific inquiry via quantitative experimentation. Furthermore, we used the Scratch programming language to incorporate biophysical modeling. This platform is designed as an accessible, low-cost educational kit for easy construction and expansion. User testing with both teachers and students demonstrates the educational potential of the LudusScope, and we anticipate additional synergy with the maker movement. Transforming observational microscopy into an interactive experience will make microbiology more tangible to society, and effectively support the interdisciplinary learning required by the Next Generation Science Standards."
https://openalex.org/W2527947512,"The accumulation of sphingolipids in obesity leads to impairments in insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial metabolism, but the precise species driving these defects is unclear. We have modeled these obesity-induced effects in cultured C2C12 myotubes, using BSA-conjugated palmitate to increase synthesis of endogenous sphingolipids and to inhibit insulin signaling and oxidative phosphorylation. Palmitate (a) induced the accumulation of sphingomyelin (SM) precursors such as sphinganine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide; (b) inhibited insulin stimulation of a central modulator of anabolic metabolism, Akt/PKB; (c) inhibited insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis; and (d) decreased oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis. Under these conditions, palmitate failed to alter levels of SMs, which are the most abundant sphingolipids, suggesting that they are not the primary intermediates accounting for the deleterious palmitate effects. Treating cells with a pharmacological inhibitor of SM synthase or using CRISPR to knock out the Sms2 gene recapitulated the palmitate effects by inducing the accumulation of SM precursors and impairing insulin signaling and mitochondrial metabolism. To profile the sphingolipids that accumulate in obesity, we performed lipidomics on quadriceps muscles from obese mice with impaired glucose tolerance. Like the cultured myotubes, these tissues accumulated ceramides but not SMs. Collectively, these data suggest that SM precursors such as ceramides, rather than SMs, are likely nutritional antagonists of metabolic function in skeletal muscle.

Like the cultured myotubes, these tissues accumulated ceramides but not SMs. Collectively, these data suggest that SM precursors such as ceramides, rather than SMs, are likely nutritional antagonists of metabolic function in skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle is the primary recipient of postprandial glucose, because of the ability of insulin to activate anabolic signaling pathways to increase glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. Excessive delivery of lipids to muscle impairs this insulin response, and the resulting hyperinsulinemia and impaired glucose tolerance places individuals at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Herein, we evaluated the role of sphingomyelins versus sphingomyelin precursors (e.g. ceramides) as the intermediates linking lipid oversupply to insulin resistance and dysregulated metabolism. Fatty acids entering the muscle fiber rapidly traffic into either mitochondria, for production of ATP, or the endoplasmic reticulum, for synthesis of complex lipids. Two endoplasmic reticulum-resident biosynthetic pathways convert the incoming acyl-CoA into either glycerolipids or sphingolipids, respectively. We have found the sphingolipid pathway to be particularly relevant to insulin resistance and its associated diseases (i.e. diabetes and cardiovascular disease) (1.Chaurasia B. Summers S.A.

CrossTalk proposal: intramyocellular ceramide accumulation does modulate insulin resistance.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 3167-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sphingolipid biosynthesis involves a series of four sequential reactions as follows: (a) serine palmitoyltransferase condenses palmitoyl-CoA with serine to produce 3-ketosphinganine; (b) 3-ketosphinanine reductase rapidly converts the transient intermediate into sphinganine; (c) (dihydro)ceramide synthases add an acyl chain to produce dihydroceramides; and (d) dihydroceramide desaturases insert a double bond to produce ceramides. Ceramides are an important branch point, serving as the common precursor of glucosylceramides, phosphorylceramides, and sphingomyelins. This pathway produces nearly 4000 distinct sphingolipid species, and the identity of the relevant antagonists of insulin action has been an area of intense investigation and controversy (2.Summers S.A.

Findings obtained with this simple system have been faithfully recapitulated in isolated muscles as well as in mice infused with saturated lipids or fed a high fat diet (18.Holland W.L.

The reductionist approach has thus shown tremendous utility as a tool for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying lipid-induced insulin resistance. Herein, we applied it to decipher the relative contributions of ceramides versus sphingomyelins as modulators of muscle metabolism. To investigate which sphingolipids might mediate the palmitate effects, we used liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry to measure sphingolipids in myotubes exposed to BSA-conjugated palmitate (Fig. 1). SM is by far the most abundant sphingolipid, being present at severalfold higher concentrations than any other sphingolipid measured. SM levels were unaffected by palmitate. By contrast, several less abundant SM precursors (e.g. ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphinganine) accumulated. The individual species that accrued the most included C16-ceramide, C18-ceramide, C16-dihydroceramide, C20-dihydrosphingomyelin, and C16-glucosylceramide (Table 1). No specific sphingomyelins increased in abundance (Table 1).TABLE 1Sphingolipid profiling of C2C12 myotubes exposed to GW4869 or D609 with or without palmitate (n ≥ 5)View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab To further investigate the relevance of the ceramide to SM conversion in palmitate action, we treated cells with a well characterized inhibitor of sphingomyelin synthases (i.e. D609) (19.Adibhatla R.M.

Lipids. 2012; 165: 760-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). D609 failed to alter levels of SM, even at very high doses (300 μm) (Fig. 1). Nonetheless, the turnover of ceramide to SM was clearly affected, as the drug increased levels of ceramide, dihydroceramide, and sphinganine (Fig. 1). We also treated a subset of cells with the neutral sphingomyelinase inhibitor GW4869. GW4869 also failed to alter SM levels, but it decreased levels of SM precursors (Table 1). Thus, SMs are maintained at relatively stable levels, but the less abundant SM precursors (e.g. ceramides and dihydroceramides, etc.) react markedly to palmitate or SMS modulators. We have previously demonstrated that palmitate inhibits insulin signaling to Akt/PKB (10.Chavez J.A. Knotts T.A. Wang L.P. Li G. Dobrowsky R.T. Florant G.L. Summers S.A.

The effects of the fatty acid are entirely dependent upon its conversion into sphingolipids, as inhibitors of any of the sphingolipid-synthesizing enzymes (e.g. serine palmitoyltransferase, ceramide synthases, or dihydroceramide desaturase-1) negate its inhibitory actions (9.Chavez J.A.

D609, which recapitulated the effects of palmitate on ceramide and other SM precursors, similarly inhibited insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and glycogen synthesis (Fig. 2). By contrast, the neutral SMase inhibitor, GW4869, lowered ceramide levels and negated the palmitate effect. Ceramide reduction approaches have also been shown to stimulate mitochondrial metabolism in vivo (15.Raichur S. Wang S.T. Chan P.W. Li Y. Ching J. Chaurasia B. Chaurasia B. Dogra S. Öhman M.K.

However, we had never before investigated the effect of endogenous ceramides on mitochondrial function in this cultured model of skeletal muscle. Using a Seahorse XF analyzer, we measured rates of oxygen consumption in the C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 3). Although palmitate and D609 failed to affect basal rates of oxygen consumption, both impaired maximal respiratory capacity and coupled respiration (i.e. respiration linked to ATP synthesis) to a comparable extent. The effects of palmitate and D609 were additive, as they were with ceramide induction. We conducted quantitative, real time PCR (qPCR) of several genes involved in SM synthesis or degradation in C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate (Fig. 4). Transcripts measured included those encoding sphingomyelin synthases 1 and 2 (Sgms1–2), as well as those encoding sphingomyelinases (i.e. Smpd1–4). Palmitate induced expression of Sgms2, an isoform of particular interest, as its depletion from mice was previously shown to increase insulin sensitivity (6.Mitsutake S. Zama K. Yokota H. Yoshida T.

Acta. 2016; 1861: 688-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the expression of mRNA for SMPD1, which encodes acid sphingomyelinase, decreased; by contrast, the transcripts encoding the other sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) and sphingomyelinase (SMase) isoforms were unchanged. The aforementioned D609 is a low affinity inhibitor of SMS that also targets several other lipid-modifying enzymes (19.Adibhatla R.M. Hatcher J.F. Gusain A. Tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609) mechanism of actions: a mini-review of literature.Neurochem. Res. 2012; 37: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To examine more precisely the SMS isoforms, we excised them from C2C12 myoblasts using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed the efficacy of the Sgms2 (Fig. 4A) deletion. Sgms2 ablation induced compensatory changes in transcripts encoding ceramide synthase 5 (Cers5), which adds the C16 acyl chain to the sphinganine backbone, and dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (Degs1), which inserts a double bond into dihydroceramide to produce ceramide (Fig. 4B). Sgms2 depletion caused a buildup of SM precursors (i.e. ceramide and dihydroceramide), without affecting levels of the more abundant SMs (Fig. 4D). These predominant ceramide species that accrued were C16-ceramides (Fig. 4E). Sgms2 ablation recapitulated the D609 and palmitate effects on insulin signaling (i.e. Akt/PKB and GSK3β phosphorylation, Fig. 5, A–C), insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis (Fig. 5D), and maximal and coupled mitochondrial respiration (Fig. 5E). We also applied the CRISPR/Cas9 approach to produce C2C12 lines in which Sgms1 was removed. This intervention had no effect on Sgms2 expression, nor did it markedly affect sphingolipid levels (Table 2). Unlike the cell line lacking Sgms2, myotubes lacking Sgms1 did not accumulate ceramides (Table 1). Moreover, the intervention had no impact on insulin signaling to Akt/PKB, nor did it influence the inhibitory effects of palmitate (Fig. 6). We speculate that the different SM isoforms may influence different subcellular pools of sphingolipids, with Sms2 affecting the ones relevant to the regulation of metabolism.TABLE 2Sphingolipid profiling of C2C12 myotubes lacking either of the Sgms isoforms (n ≥ 3) Open table in a new tab FIGURE 6Sgms1 ablation does not impact insulin signaling.

Such a regimen increases weight gain (data not shown), impairs glucose tolerance, and decreases insulin sensitivity (Fig. 7, A and B). The muscle obtained from this model of overnutrition displayed marked increases in ceramides, although total SM levels were largely unaffected (Fig. 7C). Of note, the ceramide species that accumulated were predominantly composed of the C18 acyl chain (Fig. 7D), which is consistent with the dominant expression of ceramide synthase 1 in that tissue. We observed compensatory decreases in the very long chain ceramides that do not impair insulin actions. For SMs, the most abundant 36:1 species was unaffected, although most minor species were decreased or unchanged (Fig. 7E). Pharmacological reagents, mRNA knockdown, or genetic knock-out of enzymes required for sphingolipid biosynthesis is insulin-sensitizing in an enormously broad range of experimental models (e.g. isolated skeletal muscles treated with BSA-conjugated fatty acids; rats and mice infused with lard emulsions; mice and rats lacking leptin and/or the leptin receptor; and mice, rats, or hamsters fed obesogenic diets) (1.Chaurasia B. Summers S.A. Ceramides–lipotoxic inducers of metabolic disorders.Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2015; 26: 538-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In nearly every case, the efficacy of such interventions was first demonstrated using the C2C12 myotube system described herein. This simple model of hyperlipidemia has been essential for dissecting the role of several lipid-modifying enzymes as modulators of muscle insulin signaling, predicting important information about relevant molecular mechanisms that were later validated in vivo. Herein, we applied this useful model to dissect the relative importance of sphingomyelins and the sphingomyelin synthases. The data obtained strongly suggest that ceramide, rather than SM itself, is the relevant antagonist of insulin signaling in muscle. First, under conditions where palmitate inhibited insulin signaling, levels of ceramides were elevated, although levels of total SMs or any individual SM species were unchanged. Second, the sphingomyelin synthase inhibitor D609 induced ceramide accumulation and inhibited insulin signaling. Third, Sgms2 ablation induced ceramide accumulation and inhibited insulin signaling. Surprisingly, SM levels were unchanged by these manipulations. Similar findings were seen in vivo, as muscle SM levels were unchanged by overnutrition, under conditions where ceramide levels were markedly increased (Fig. 7). Straczkowski et al. (23.Straczkowski M. Kowalska I. Baranowski M. Nikolajuk A. Otziomek E. Zabielski P. Adamska A. Blachnio A. Gorski J. Gorska M. Increased skeletal muscle ceramide level in men at risk of developing type 2 diabetes.Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 2366-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) reported similar alterations in the SM to ceramide ratio in man, finding that muscle SM is actually lower in obese men with impaired glucose tolerance, although ceramide levels are elevated. One should note that SM is considerably more abundant than ceramide. In our experience, intermediaries that exist at much lower concentrations respond much more dynamically to changes in nutrient status. Moreover, the mRNA profiling studies presented herein reveal that the cell reacts to Sgms deficiency by up-regulating other genes required for sphingolipid synthesis (e.g. Cers5 and Degs1). Several groups (8.Li Z. Zhang H. Liu J. Liang C.P. Li Y. Li Y. Teitelman G. Beyer T. Bui H.H. Peake D.A. Zhang Y. Sanders P.E. Kuo M.S. Park T.S. Cao G. Jiang X.C.

The data presented herein suggest that SM is unlikely to be a direct antagonist of insulin action in skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that the ablation of Sgms2 in the liver, which produces the SM for packaging into LDLs (8.Li Z. Zhang H. Liu J. Liang C.P. Li Y. Li Y. Teitelman G. Beyer T. Bui H.H. Peake D.A.

The altered delivery of SM to various peripheral tissues likely gets recycled back into the ceramides that influence tissue metabolism. The results presented herein are interesting to consider in parallel with our prior studies looking at other ceramide metabolites as inhibitors of insulin signaling in muscle. (a) Inhibition of ceramidase, which deacylates ceramides to generate sphingosine, leads to a buildup of ceramide and inhibition of insulin signaling (9.Chavez J.A. Holland W.L. Bär J. Sandhoff K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20148-20153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of ceramidase negates palmitate-induced ceramide accumulation, as well as its inhibition of insulin signaling (9.Chavez J.A. Holland W.L. Bär J. Sandhoff K. Summers S.A.

Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) demonstrated that adiponectin exerted its broad spectrum of cardioprotective and anti-diabetic actions by activating a ceramidase to deplete ceramides. (b) Inhibition or knockdown of glucosylceramide synthase induces ceramides and antagonizes insulin signaling in cultured myotubes (11.Chavez J.A. Siddique M.M. Wang S.T. Ching J. Shayman J.A. Summers S.A. Ceramides and glucosylceramides are independent antagonists of insulin signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of glucosylceramide synthase in myotubes depleted ceramides and negated palmitate effects on insulin signaling (11.Chavez J.A. Siddique M.M. Wang S.T. Ching J. Shayman J.A.

Collectively, the body of work suggests that ceramides are the likely modulators of insulin signaling in muscle. Studies for ceramide as a modulator of Akt/PKB are further supported by work with exogenous ceramide analogs. C2-ceramide inhibits Akt/PKB through two independent mechanisms (28.Stratford S. Hoehn K.L. Liu F. Summers S.A. Regulation of insulin action by ceramide: dual mechanisms linking ceramide accumulation to the inhibition of Akt/protein kinase B.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36608-36615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). First, it blocks the translocation of Akt/PKB to the plasma membrane (28.Stratford S. Hoehn K.L. Liu F. Summers S.A. Regulation of insulin action by ceramide: dual mechanisms linking ceramide accumulation to the inhibition of Akt/protein kinase B.J. Biol.

This occurs without impacting upstream signaling events, such as the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or the production of 3′-polyphosphoinositides (29.Stratford S. DeWald D.B.

Second, C2-ceramide promotes the dephosphorylation of Akt/PKB via PP2A (10.Chavez J.A. Knotts T.A. Wang L.P. Li G. Dobrowsky R.T. Florant G.L. Summers S.A.

Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. Ceramide activates heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15523-15530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in knock-out mice have identified a second prominent mechanism by which sphingolipids influence metabolic homeostasis. In particular, two groups found that altering the acylation patterns of ceramides in mice led to substantive changes in lipid oxidation because of impairments in oxidative phosphorylation (15.Raichur S.

Kolesnick R. C16:0-ceramide signals insulin resistance.Cell Metab. 2014; 20: 703-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Herein, we tested the ability of endogenous ceramides to recapitulate this effect in this cell autonomous system. Using the Seahorse respirometer, we confirmed that manipulations that induced the accumulation of SM precursors (i.e. D609 addition or SMS2 deletion) disrupted maximal respiratory capacity and ATP synthesis. Thus, endogenous ceramides are also the likely lipid modulators that impair mitochondrial function. We previously found that dihydroceramides also influence mitochondrial activities (34.Siddique M.M. Li Y. Wang L. Ching J. Mal M. Ilkayeva O. Wu Y.J. Bay B.H. Summers S.A. Ablation of dihydroceramide desaturase 1, a therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, simultaneously stimulates anabolic and catabolic signaling.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2013; 33: 2353-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the additive effects we observe of D609 and palmitate may be explained by the additional contribution of these intermediates. A large number of different nutritional metabolites are likely to serve as markers of nutritional overload and inducers of insulin resistance. Indeed, one would predict that multiple mechanisms likely exist to allow mammals to alter metabolic performance in response to nutrient status. In cultured myotubes and isolated muscles, ceramides appear to be particularly important in metabolic regulation. Inhibition of enzymes required for ceramide synthesis (i.e. Sptl2, CerS, or Des1) prevent lipid-driven inhibition of insulin signaling and improve mitochondrial activity. By contrast, inhibition of enzymes that metabolize ceramide (i.e. glucosylceramide synthase, acid ceramidase, and SMS2) exacerbate the lipid effects. These biosynthetic intermediates appear to be an important gauge of nutritional excess that induces a broad range of different cellular responses. Therapies aimed at reducing these sphingolipid metabolites hold enormous potential as a means of combating the metabolic impairments caused by dyslipidemia that underlie diabetes and heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2529270130,"We describe two new cynodonts from the early Late Triassic of southern Brazil. One taxon, Bonacynodon schultzi gen. et sp. nov., comes from the lower Carnian Dinodontosaurus AZ, being correlated with the faunal association at the upper half of the lower member of the Chañares Formation (Ischigualasto-Villa Unión Basin, Argentina). Phylogenetically, Bonacynodon is a closer relative to Probainognathus jenseni than to any other probainognathian, bearing conspicuous canines with a denticulate distal margin. The other new taxon is Santacruzgnathus abdalai gen. et sp. nov. from the Carnian Santacruzodon AZ. Although based exclusively on a partial lower jaw, it represents a probainognathian close to Prozostrodon from the Hyperodapedon AZ and to Brasilodon, Brasilitherium and Botucaraitherium from the Riograndia AZ. The two new cynodonts and the phylogenetic hypothesis presented herein indicate the degree to which our knowledge on probainognathian cynodonts is incomplete and also the relevance of the South American fossil record for understanding their evolutionary significance. The taxonomic diversity and abundance of probainognathians from Brazil and Argentina will form the basis of deep and complex studies to address the evolutionary transformations of cynodonts leading to mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2568727443,"Habitat fragmentation has been suggested to be responsible for major genetic differentiations in a range of marine organisms. In this study, we combined genetic data and environmental information to unravel the relative role of geography and habitat heterogeneity on patterns of genetic population structure of corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops), a rocky shore species at the northern limit of its distribution range in Scandinavia. Our results revealed a major genetic break separating populations inhabiting the western and southern coasts of Norway. This genetic break coincides with the longest stretch of sand in the whole study area, suggesting habitat fragmentation as a major driver of genetic differentiation of this obligate rocky shore benthic fish in Scandinavia. The complex fjords systems extending along the western coast of Norway appeared responsible for further regional genetic structuring. Our findings indicate that habitat discontinuities may lead to significant genetic fragmentation over short geographical distances, even for marine species with a pelagic larval phase, as for this rocky shore fish."

Zinc transporter Zip14 KO mice display a phenotype that includes impaired intestinal barrier function with low grade chronic inflammation, hyperinsulinemia, and increased body fat, which are signatures of diet-induced diabetes (type 2 diabetes) and obesity in humans. Hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes and obesity is caused by insulin resistance. Insulin resistance results in inhibition of glucose uptake by liver and other peripheral tissues, principally adipose and muscle and with concurrently higher hepatic glucose production. Therefore, modulation of hepatic glucose metabolism is an important target for antidiabetic treatment approaches. We demonstrate that during glucose uptake, cell surface abundance of zinc transporter ZIP14 and mediated zinc transport increases. Zinc is distributed to multiple sites in hepatocytes through sequential translocation of ZIP14 from plasma membrane to early and late endosomes. Endosomes from Zip14 KO mice were zinc-deficient because activities of the zinc-dependent insulin-degrading proteases insulin-degrading enzyme and cathepsin D were impaired; hence insulin receptor activity increased. Transient increases in cytosolic zinc levels are concurrent with glucose uptake and suppression of glycogen synthesis. In contrast, Zip14 KO mice exhibited greater hepatic glycogen synthesis and impaired gluconeogenesis and glycolysis related to low cytosolic zinc levels. We can conclude that ZIP14-mediated zinc transport contributes to regulation of endosomal insulin receptor activity and glucose homeostasis in hepatocytes. Therefore, modulation of ZIP14 transport activity presents a new target for management of diabetes and other glucose-related disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2558468785,"Birth defects are defined as structural and functional defects that develop during the organogenesis period and present at birth or detected later in life. They are one of the leading causes of infant and child mortality, morbidity, and long term disability. The magnitude of birth defects varies from country to country and from race/ethnicity to race/ethnicity, and about 40-60% of their causes are unknown. The known causes of birth defects are genetic and environmental factors which may be prevented. For various reasons, there is lack of data and research on birth defects in Ethiopia.The major objective of this study is to estimate the magnitude of birth defects in Ethiopia.A hospital based, retrospective, cross sectional, descriptive study was conducted. The subjects were babies/children aged 0-17years who visited selected hospitals between 2010 and 2014. Fourteen hospitals (8 in Addis Ababa, 6 in Amhara Region) were selected purposively based on case load. A data retrieving form was developed to extract relevant information from record books.In the hospitals mentioned, 319,776 various medical records of children aged 0-17years were found. Of these, 6,076 (1.9% with 95% CI: 1.85%-1.95%) children were diagnosed as having birth defects. The majority (58.5%) of the children were male and 41.5% female. A slightly more than half (51.1%) of the children were urban dwellers, while 48.9% were from rural areas. Among the participants of the study the proportion of birth defects ranged as follows: orofacial (34.2%), neural tube (30.8%), upper and lower limb (12.8%), cardiovascular system (10.3%), digestive system and abdominal wall (4.8%), unspecified congenital malformations (2.5%), Down syndrome (2%), genitourinary system (2%), head, face, and neck defects (0.4%), and others (0.3%). The trend of birth defects increased linearly over time [Extended Mantel-Haenszel chi square for linear trend = 356.7 (P<0.0001)]. About 275 (4.5%) of the cases had multiple (associated) birth defects and 5,801 (95.5%) isolated (single) birth defects. Out of the total birth defects, 6,018 (99%) were major and 58 (1%) minor.The magnitude of birth defects increased from 2010-2014. Orofacial and neural tube defects contributed about two thirds of the birth defects. There is an urgent need for registry and surveillance system strategies for intervention and control of birth defects in Ethiopia."

In the current study, we used mass spectrometry to demonstrate that human NSun6 indeed introduces 5-methylcytosine (m5C) into tRNA, as expected. To further reveal the tRNA recognition mechanism of human NSun6, we measured the methylation activity of human NSun6 and its kinetic parameters for different tRNA substrates and their mutants. We showed that human NSun6 requires a well folded, full-length tRNA as its substrate. In the acceptor region, the CCA terminus, the target site C72, the discriminator base U73, and the second and third base pairs (2:71 and 3:70) of the acceptor stem are all important RNA recognition elements for human NSun6. In addition, two specific base pairs (11:24 and 12:23) in the D-stem of the tRNA substrate are involved in interacting with human NSun6.

https://openalex.org/W2529555756,"Clostridium difficile is the principal cause of nosocomial infectious diarrhea worldwide. The pathogen modifies its flagellin with either a type A or type B O-linked glycosylation system, which has a contributory role in pathogenesis. We study the functional role of glycosyltransferases modifying type B flagellin in the 023 and 027 hypervirulent C. difficile lineages by mutagenesis of five putative glycosyltransferases and biosynthetic genes. We reveal their roles in the biosynthesis of the flagellin glycan chain and demonstrate that flagellar post-translational modification affects motility and adhesion-related bacterial properties of these strains. We show that the glycosyltransferases 1 and 2 (GT1 and GT2) are responsible for the sequential addition of a GlcNAc and two rhamnoses, respectively, and that GT3 is associated with the incorporation of a novel sulfonated peptidyl-amido sugar moiety whose structure is reported in our accompanying paper (Bouché, L., Panico, M., Hitchen, P., Binet, D., Sastre, F., Faulds-Pain, A., Valiente, E., Vinogradov, E., Aubry, A., Fulton, K., Twine, S., Logan, S. M., Wren, B. W., Dell, A., and Morris, H. R. (2016) J. Biol. Chem. 291, 25439–25449). GT2 is also responsible for methylation of the rhamnoses. Whereas type B modification is not required for flagellar assembly, some mutations that result in truncation or abolition of the glycan reduce bacterial motility and promote autoaggregation and biofilm formation. The complete lack of flagellin modification also significantly reduces adhesion of C. difficile to Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells but does not affect activation of human TLR5. Our study advances our understanding of the genes involved in flagellar glycosylation and their biological roles in emerging hypervirulent C. difficile strains."
https://openalex.org/W2519157545,"Creativity is a complex, multi-faceted concept encompassing a variety of related aspects, abilities, properties and behaviours. If we wish to study creativity scientifically, then a tractable and well-articulated model of creativity is required. Such a model would be of great value to researchers investigating the nature of creativity and in particular, those concerned with the evaluation of creative practice. This paper describes a unique approach to developing a suitable model of how creative behaviour emerges that is based on the words people use to describe the concept. Using techniques from the field of statistical natural language processing, we identify a collection of fourteen key components of creativity through an analysis of a corpus of academic papers on the topic. Words are identified which appear significantly often in connection with discussions of the concept. Using a measure of lexical similarity to help cluster these words, a number of distinct themes emerge, which collectively contribute to a comprehensive and multi-perspective model of creativity. The components provide an ontology of creativity: a set of building blocks which can be used to model creative practice in a variety of domains. The components have been employed in two case studies to evaluate the creativity of computational systems and have proven useful in articulating achievements of this work and directions for further research."

We document the decline of the population in the eastern Caribbean by tracing demographic changes of well-studied social units. We address hypotheses that, over a ten-year period of dedicated effort (2005-2015), unit size, numbers of calves and/or calving rates have each declined. Across 16 units, the number of adults decreased in 12 units, increased in two, and showed no change in two. The number of adults per unit decreased at -0.195 individuals/yr (95% CI: -0.080 to -0.310; P = 0.001). The number of calves also declined, but the decline was not significant. This negative trend of -4.5% per year in unit size started in about 2010, with numbers being fairly stable until then. There are several natural and anthropogenic threats, but no well-substantiated cause for the decline."
https://openalex.org/W2536940629,"Subtropical reefs provide an important habitat for flora and fauna, and proper monitoring is required for conservation. Monitoring these exposed and submerged reefs is challenging and available resources are limited. Citizen science is increasing in momentum, as an applied research tool and in the variety of monitoring approaches adopted. This paper aims to demonstrate an ecological assessment and mapping approach that incorporates both top-down (volunteer marine scientists) and bottom-up (divers/community) engagement aspects of citizen science, applied at a subtropical reef at Point Lookout, Southeast Queensland, Australia. Marine scientists trained fifty citizen scientists in survey techniques that included mapping of habitat features, recording of substrate, fish and invertebrate composition, and quantifying impacts (e.g., occurrence of substrate damage, presence of litter). In 2014 these volunteers conducted four seasonal surveys along semi-permanent transects, at five sites, across three reefs. The project presented is a model on how citizen science can be conducted in a marine environment through collaboration of volunteer researchers, non-researchers and local marine authorities. Significant differences in coral and algal cover were observed among the three sites, while fluctuations in algal cover were also observed seasonally. Differences in fish assemblages were apparent among sites and seasons, with subtropical fish groups observed more commonly in colder seasons. The least physical damage occurred in the most exposed sites (Flat Rock) within the highly protected marine park zones. The broad range of data collected through this top-down/bottom-up approach to citizen science exemplifies the projects’ value and application for identifying ecosystem trends or patterns. The results of the project support natural resource and marine park management, providing a valuable contribution to existing scientific knowledge and the conservation of local reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2528988404,"Background and Aims Real-time shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) is a two-dimensional transient elastography and a competitor as a biomarker of liver fibrosis in comparison with the standard reference transient elastography by M probe (TE-M). The aims were to compare several criteria of applicability, and to assess inflammation and steatosis impact on elasticity values, two unmet needs. Methods We took FibroTest as the fibrosis reference and ActiTest and SteatoTest as quantitative estimates of inflammation and steatosis. After standardization of estimates, analyses used curve fitting, quantitative Lin concordance coefficient [LCC], and multivariate logistic regression. Results A total of 2,251 consecutive patients were included. We validated the predetermined 0.2 kPa cut-off as a too low minimal elasticity value identifying not-reliable 2D-SWE results (LCC with FibroTest = 0.0281[-0.119;0.175]. Other criteria, elasticity CV, body mass index and depth of measures were not sufficiently discriminant. The applicability of 2D-SWE (95%CI) 89.6%(88.2–90.8), was significantly higher than that of TE, 85.6%(84.0–87.0; P<0.0001). In patients with non-advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F0F1F2), elasticity values estimated by 2D-SWE was less impacted by inflammation and steatosis than elasticity value estimated by TE-M: LCC (95%CI) 0.039 (0.021;0.058) vs 0.090 (0.068;0.112;P<0.01) and 0.105 (0.068;0.141) vs 0.192 (0.153;0.230; P<0.01) respectively. The three analyses methods gave similar results. Conclusions Elasticity results including very low minimal signal in the region of interest should be considered not reliable. 2D-SWE had a higher applicability than TE, the reference elastography, with less impact of inflammation and steatosis especially in patients with non-advanced fibrosis, as presumed by blood tests.

https://openalex.org/W2528168467,"When inhaled, ozone (O3) interacts with cholesterols of airway epithelial cell membranes or the lung-lining fluid, generating chemically reactive oxysterols. The mechanism by which O3-derived oxysterols affect molecular function is unknown. Our data show that in vitro exposure of human bronchial epithelial cells to O3 results in the formation of oxysterols, epoxycholesterol-α and -β and secosterol A and B (Seco A and Seco B), in cell lysates and apical washes. Similarly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from human volunteers exposed to O3 contained elevated levels of these oxysterol species. As expected, O3-derived oxysterols have a pro-inflammatory effect and increase NF-κB activity. Interestingly, expression of the cholesterol efflux pump ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1), which is regulated by activation of the liver X receptor (LXR), was suppressed in epithelial cells exposed to O3 Additionally, exposure of LXR knock-out mice to O3 enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the lung, suggesting LXR inhibits O3-induced inflammation. Using alkynyl surrogates of O3-derived oxysterols, our data demonstrate adduction of LXR with Seco A. Similarly, supplementation of epithelial cells with alkynyl-tagged cholesterol followed by O3 exposure causes observable lipid-LXR adduct formation. Experiments using Seco A and the LXR agonist T0901317 (T09) showed reduced expression of ABCA1 as compared with stimulation with T0901317 alone, indicating that Seco A-LXR protein adduct formation inhibits LXR activation by traditional agonists. Overall, these data demonstrate that O3-derived oxysterols have pro-inflammatory functions and form lipid-protein adducts with LXR, thus leading to suppressed cholesterol regulatory gene expression and providing a biochemical mechanism mediating O3-derived formation of oxidized lipids in the airways and subsequent adverse health effects."

The other three enzymes are also regarded as essential for siderophore biosynthesis. The structure of PvdN has been solved recently, but no function could be assigned. Here we present the first in-frame deletion of the PvdN-encoding gene. Unexpectedly, PvdN turned out to be required for a specific modification of pyoverdine, whereas the overall amount of fluorescent pyoverdines was not altered by the mutation. The mutant strain grew normally under iron-limiting conditions. Mass spectrometry identified the PvdN-dependent modification as a transformation of the N-terminal glutamic acid to a succinamide.

In addition, we find that R838S substitution makes RetGC1 less sensitive to inhibition by retinal degeneration-3 protein (RD3). We selectively expressed human R838S RetGC1 in mouse rods and documented the decline in rod vision and rod survival. To verify that changes in rods were specifically caused by the CORD6 mutation, we used for comparison cones, which in the same mice did not express R838S RetGC1 from the transgenic construct. The R838S RetGC1 expression in rod outer segments reduced inhibition of cGMP production in the transgenic mouse retinas at the free calcium concentrations typical for dark-adapted rods. The transgenic mice demonstrated early-onset and rapidly progressed with age decline in visual responses from the targeted rods, in contrast to the longer lasting preservation of function in the non-targeted cones. The decline in rod function in the retina resulted from a progressive degeneration of rods between 1 and 6 months of age, with the severity and pace of the degeneration consistent with the extent to which the Ca2+ sensitivity of the retinal cGMP production was affected. Our study presents a new experimental model for exploring cellular mechanisms of the CORD6-related photoreceptor death. This mouse model provides the first direct biochemical and physiological in vivo evidence for the Arg838 substitutions in RetGC1 being the culprit behind the pathogenesis of the CORD6 congenital blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2528845646,"CRAF kinase maintains cell viability, growth, and proliferation by participating in the MAPK pathway. Unlike BRAF, CRAF requires continuous chaperoning by Hsp90 to retain MAPK signaling. However, the reason behind the continuous association of Hsp90 with CRAF is still elusive. In this study, we have identified the bipartite role of Hsp90 in chaperoning CRAF kinase. Hsp90 facilitates Ser-621 phosphorylation of CRAF and prevents the kinase from degradation. Co-chaperone Cdc37 assists in this phosphorylation event. However, after folding, the stability of the kinase becomes insensitive to Hsp90 inhibition, although the physical association between Hsp90 and CRAF remains intact. We observed that overexpression of Hsp90 stimulates MAPK signaling by activating CRAF. The interaction between Hsp90 and CRAF is substantially increased under an elevated level of cellular Hsp90 and in the presence of either active Ras (RasV12) or EGF. Surprisingly, enhanced binding of Hsp90 to CRAF occurs prior to the Ras-CRAF association and facilitates actin recruitment to CRAF for efficient Ras-CRAF interaction, which is independent of the ATPase activity of Hsp90. However, monomeric CRAF (CRAFR401H) shows abrogated interaction with both Hsp90 and actin, thereby affecting Hsp90-dependent CRAF activation. This finding suggests that stringent assemblage of Hsp90 keeps CRAF kinase equipped for participating in the MAPK pathway. Thus, the role of Hsp90 in CRAF maturation and activation acts as a limiting factor to maintain the function of a strong client like CRAF kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2528844447,"The aim of this study was to identify and characterize mechanisms of resistance to antifolate drugs in African trypanosomes. Genome-wide RNAi library screens were undertaken in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei exposed to the antifolates methotrexate and raltitrexed. In conjunction with drug susceptibility and folate transport studies, RNAi knockdown was used to validate the functions of the putative folate transporters. The transport kinetics of folate and methotrexate were further characterized in whole cells. RNA interference target sequencing experiments identified a tandem array of genes encoding a folate transporter family, TbFT1–3, as major contributors to antifolate drug uptake. RNAi knockdown of TbFT1–3 substantially reduced folate transport into trypanosomes and reduced the parasite's susceptibly to the classical antifolates methotrexate and raltitrexed. In contrast, knockdown of TbFT1–3 increased susceptibly to the non-classical antifolates pyrimethamine and nolatrexed. Both folate and methotrexate transport were inhibited by classical antifolates but not by non-classical antifolates or biopterin. Thus, TbFT1–3 mediates the uptake of folate and classical antifolates in trypanosomes, and TbFT1–3 loss-of-function is a mechanism of antifolate drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2559007044,"Potamopyrgus antipodarum (New Zealand mud snail) is a prosobranch mollusk native to New Zealand with a wide invasive distribution range. Its non-indigenous populations are reported from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. Being an extremely tolerant species, Potamopyrgus is capable to survive in a great range of salinity and temperature conditions, which explains its high invasiveness and successful spread outside the native range. Here we report the first finding of Potamopyrgus antipodarum in a basin of the Cantabrian corridor in North Iberia (Bay of Biscay, Spain). Two haplotypes already described in Europe were found in different sectors of River Nora (Nalon basin), suggesting the secondary introductions from earlier established invasive populations. To enhance the surveillance of the species and tracking its further spread in the region, we developed a specific set of primers for the genus Potamopyrgus that amplify a fragment of 16S rDNA. The sequences obtained from PCR on DNA extracted from tissue and water samples (environmental DNA, eDNA) were identical in each location, suggesting clonal reproduction of the introduced individuals. Multiple introduction events from different source populations were inferred from our sequence data. The eDNA tool developed here can serve for tracing New Zealand mud snail populations outside its native range, and for inventorying mud snail population assemblages in the native settings if high throughput sequencing methodologies are employed."
https://openalex.org/W2493545506,"It is well known that a network structure plays an important role in addressing a collective behavior. In this paper we study a network of firms and corporations for addressing metastable features in an Ising based model. In our model we observe that if in a recession the government imposes a demand shock to stimulate the network, metastable features shape its response. Actually we find that there exists a minimum bound where any demand shock with a size below it is unable to trigger the market out of recession. We then investigate the impact of network characteristics on this minimum bound. We surprisingly observe that in a Watts-Strogatz network, although the minimum bound depends on the average of the degrees, when translated into the language of economics, such a bound is independent of the average degrees. This bound is about 0.44ΔGDP, where ΔGDP is the gap of GDP between recession and expansion. We examine our suggestions for the cases of the United States and the European Union in the recent recession, and compare them with the imposed stimulations. While the stimulation in the US has been above our threshold, in the EU it has been far below our threshold. Beside providing a minimum bound for a successful stimulation, our study on the metastable features suggests that in the time of crisis there is a ""golden time passage"" in which the minimum bound for successful stimulation can be much lower. Hence, our study strongly suggests stimulations to arise within this time passage."

While many acknowledge their importance and vulnerability, these ecosystems still remain poorly studied, particularly for taxa that are difficult to sample such as bats. Aiming to estimate the amount of cryptic diversity among bats of a Neotropical montane cloud forest in Talamanca Range-south-east Central America-, we performed a 15-night sampling campaign, which resulted in 90 captured bats belonging to 8 species. We sequenced their mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and screened their inter- and intraspecific genetic variation. Phylogenetic relations with conspecifics and closely related species from other geographic regions were established using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian inference methods, as well as median-joining haplotype networks. Mitochondrial lineages highly divergent from hitherto characterized populations (> 9% COI dissimilarity) were found in Myotis oxyotus and Hylonycteris underwoodi. Sturnira burtonlimi and M. keaysi also showed distinct mitochondrial structure with sibling species and/or populations. These results suggest that mountains in the region hold a high degree of endemicity potential that has previously been ignored in bats. They also warn of the high extinction risk montane bats may be facing due to climatic change, particularly in isolated mountain systems like Talamanca Range."

Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (rHAT), also known as acute sleeping sickness is caused by Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and transmitted by tsetse flies. The disease is commonly associated with wilderness areas of east and southern Africa. Such areas hold a diverse range of species which form communities of hosts for disease maintenance. The relative importance of different wildlife hosts remains unclear. This study quantified tsetse feeding preferences in a wilderness area of great host species richness, Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, assessing tsetse feeding and host density contemporaneously. Methods Glossina swynnertoni and G. pallidipes were collected from six study sites. Bloodmeal sources were identified through matching Cytochrome B sequences amplified from bloodmeals from recently fed flies to published sequences. Densities of large mammal species in each site were quantified, and feeding indices calculated to assess the relative selection or avoidance of each host species by tsetse. Results The host species most commonly identified in G. swynnertoni bloodmeals, warthog (94/220), buffalo (48/220) and giraffe (46/220), were found at relatively low densities (3-11/km2) and fed on up to 15 times more frequently than expected by their relative density. Wildebeest, zebra, impala and Thomson’s gazelle, found at the highest densities, were never identified in bloodmeals. Commonly identified hosts for G. pallidipes were buffalo (26/46), giraffe (9/46) and elephant (5/46). Conclusions This study is the first to quantify tsetse host range by molecular analysis of tsetse diet with simultaneous assessment of host density in a wilderness area. Although G. swynnertoni and G. pallidipes can feed on a range of species, they are highly selective. Many host species are rarely fed on, despite being present in areas where tsetse are abundant. These feeding patterns, along with the ability of key host species to maintain and transmit T. b. rhodesiense, drive the epidemiology of rHAT in wilderness areas."
https://openalex.org/W2529037389,"A novel mechanism of rifampicin (Rif) resistance has recently been reported in Nocardia farcinica. This new mechanism involves the activity of rifampicin monooxygenase (RifMO), a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the hydroxylation of Rif, which is the first step in the degradation pathway. Recombinant RifMO was overexpressed and purified for biochemical analysis. Kinetic characterization revealed that Rif binding is necessary for effective FAD reduction. RifMO exhibits only a 3-fold coenzyme preference for NADPH over NADH. RifMO catalyzes the incorporation of a single oxygen atom forming an unstable intermediate that eventually is converted to 2′-N-hydroxy-4-oxo-Rif. Stable C4a-hydroperoxyflavin was not detected by rapid kinetics methods, which is consistent with only 30% of the activated oxygen leading to product formation. These findings represent the first reported detailed biochemical characterization of a flavin-monooxygenase involved in antibiotic resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2528710633,"Timely linkage to care by newly-diagnosed HIV+ individuals remains a significant challenge to achieving UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals. Current World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines recommend initiating anti-retroviral treatment (ART) regardless of CD4+ count, with priority given to those with CD4+ <350 cells/μl. We evaluated the impact of not having a day-of-diagnosis CD4+ count blood draw, as recommended by South African guidelines, on time to linkage, using data from a prospective cohort study.Individuals (N = 2773) were interviewed prior to HIV counseling and testing at three public sector primary care clinics in the greater Durban area; 785 were newly-diagnosed and eligible for the cohort study; 459 (58.5%) joined and were followed for eight months with three structured assessments. Linkage to care, defined as returning to clinic for CD4+ count results, and day-of-diagnosis blood draw were self-reported.Overall, 72.5% did not have a day-of-diagnosis CD4+ count blood draw, and 19.2% of these never returned. Compared with a day-of-diagnosis blood draw, the adjusted hazard ratio of linkage (AHRlinkage) associated with not having day-of-diagnosis blood draw was 0.66 (95%CI: 0.51, 0.85). By 4 months, 54.8% of those without day-of-diagnosis blood draw vs. 75.2% with one were linked to care (chi-squared p = 0.004). Of those who deferred blood draw, 48.3% cited clinic-related and 51.7% cited personal reasons. AHRlinkage was 0.60 (95%CI: 0.44, 0.82) for clinic-related and 0.53 (95%CI: 0.38, 0.75) for personal reasons relative to having day-of-diagnosis blood draw.Newly-diagnosed HIV+ individuals who did not undergo CD4+ count blood draw on the day they were diagnosed-regardless of the reason for deferring-had delayed linkage to care relative to those with same-day blood draw. To enhance prompt linkage to care even when test and treat protocols are implemented, all diagnostic testing required before ART initiation should be performed on the same day as HIV testing/diagnosis. This may require modifying clinic procedures to enable overnight blood storage if same-day draws cannot be performed, and providing additional counseling to encourage newly-diagnosed individuals to complete day-of-diagnosis testing. Tracking HIV+ individuals via clinic registries should commence immediately from diagnosis to reduce these early losses to care."
https://openalex.org/W2528912229,"Poststroke depression (PSD) is a critical complication which might lead to unfavorable outcomes. However, most cases of PSD in the acute phase, during the 2 or 3 weeks following a stroke, are neglected because of the variable comorbid conditions. In this study, aimed at revealing the outstanding symptoms of PSD during the acute phase, consecutive patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or brain infarction (BI) were asked to fill out a depression questionnaire (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report: QIDS-SR) at 1 week and 1 month following stroke onset. Patients with disturbed consciousness or aphasia were excluded from this study. Forty-nine ICH patients and 222 BI patients completed the QIDS-SR at 1 week and 27 of ICH and 62 of BI at 1 month. The PSD rate was 67% and 46% at 1 week in ICH and BI, respectively. Although sleep disturbance was the most frequent symptom of PSD, psychomotor agitation and appetite disturbance were the most distinguishing symptoms in ICH at 1 week and fatigue at 1 month. On the other hand, most of the depressive symptoms addressed in QIDS-SR were observed in PSD of BI patients both at 1 week and 1 month. In conclusion, while sleep disturbance was a frequent but non-specific symptom, appetite disturbance and fatigue might be critical symptoms to suggest PSD during the acute phase of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2527853334,"Patients with chronic intestinal ulcerative diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, tend to exhibit abnormal lipid profiles, which may affect the gut epithelial integrity. We hypothesized that epithelial cholesterol depletion may trigger inflammation-checking machinery via cholesterol sentinel signaling molecules whose disruption in patients may aggravate inflammation and disease progression. In the present study, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) as the cholesterol sentinel was assessed for its involvement in the epithelial inflammatory responses in cholesterol-depleted enterocytes. Patients and experimental animals with intestinal ulcerative injuries showed suppression in epithelial SREBP2. Moreover, SREBP2-deficient enterocytes showed enhanced pro-inflammatory signals in response to inflammatory insults, indicating regulatory roles of SREBP2 in gut epithelial inflammation. However, epithelial cholesterol depletion transiently induced pro-inflammatory chemokine expression regardless of the well known pro-inflammatory nuclear factor-κB signals. In contrast, cholesterol depletion also exerts regulatory actions to maintain epithelial homeostasis against excessive inflammation via SREBP2-associated signals in a negative feedback loop. Mechanistically, SREBP2 and its induced target EGR-1 were positively involved in induction of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a representative anti-inflammatory transcription factor. As a crucial target of the SREBP2-EGR-1-PPARγ-associated signaling pathways, the mRNA stabilizer, human antigen R (HuR) was retained in nuclei, leading to reduced stability of pro-inflammatory chemokine transcripts. This mechanistic investigation provides clinical insights into protective roles of the epithelial cholesterol deficiency against excessive inflammatory responses via the SREBP2-HuR circuit, although the deficiency triggers transient pro-inflammatory signals."
https://openalex.org/W2529208584,"We study the overall topological structure properties of global oil trade network, such as degree, strength, cumulative distribution, information entropy and weight clustering. The structural evolution of the network is investigated as well. We find the global oil import and export networks do not show typical scale-free distribution, but display disassortative property. Furthermore, based on the monthly data of oil import values during 2005.01–2014.12, by applying random matrix theory, we investigate the complex spatiotemporal dynamic from the country level and fitness evolution of the global oil market from a demand-side analysis. Abundant information about global oil market can be obtained from deviating eigenvalues. The result shows that the oil market has experienced five different periods, which is consistent with the evolution of country clusters. Moreover, we find the changing trend of fitness function agrees with that of gross domestic product (GDP), and suggest that the fitness evolution of oil market can be predicted by forecasting GDP values. To conclude, some suggestions are provided according to the results."
https://openalex.org/W2529807866,"The aim of this study was to assess whether the case volume of surgeons and hospitals affects the rates of postoperative complications and survival after liver transplantation. This population-based retrospective cohort study included 2938 recipients of liver transplantation performed between 1998 and 2012, enrolled from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. They were divided into two groups, according to the cumulative case volume of their operating surgeons and the case volume of their hospitals. The duration of intensive care unit stay and post-transplantation hospitalization, postoperative complications, and mortality were analyzed. The results showed that, in the low and high case volume surgeons groups, respectively, acute renal failure occurred at the rate of 14.11% and 5.86% (p<0.0001), and the overall mortality rates were 19.61% and 12.44% (p<0.0001). In the low and high case volume hospital groups, respectively, acute renal failure occurred in 11% and 7.11% of the recipients (p = 0.0004), and the overall mortality was 18.44% and 12.86% (p<0.0001). These findings suggest that liver transplantation recipients operated on higher case volume surgeons or in higher case volume hospitals have a lower rate of acute renal failure and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W2530431518,"Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN) but outcomes of many clinical trials are controversial. To define the role of antioxidants in kidney protection during the development of diabetic nephropathy, we have generated a novel genetic antioxidant mouse model with over- or under-expression of lipoic acid synthase gene (Lias). These models have been mated with Ins2Akita/+ mice, a type I diabetic mouse model. We compare the major pathologic changes and oxidative stress status in two new strains of the mice with controls. Our results show that Ins2Akita/+ mice with under-expressed Lias gene, exhibit higher oxidative stress and more severe DN features (albuminuria, glomerular basement membrane thickening and mesangial matrix expansion). In contrast, Ins2Akita/+ mice with highly-expressed Lias gene display lower oxidative stress and less DN pathologic changes. Our study demonstrates that strengthening endogenous antioxidant capacity could be an effective strategy for prevention and treatment of DN."
https://openalex.org/W2551152890,"Protein kinase C α (PKCα) is a nodal regulator in several intracellular signaling networks. PKCα is composed of modular domains that interact with each other to dynamically regulate spatial-temporal function. We find that PKCα specifically, rapidly and reversibly self-assembles in the presence of calcium in vitro. This phenomenon is dependent on, and can be modulated by an intramolecular interaction between the C1a and C2 protein domains of PKCα. Next, we monitor self-assembly of PKC—mCitrine fusion proteins using time-resolved and steady-state homoFRET. HomoFRET between full-length PKCα molecules is observed when in solution with both calcium and liposomes containing either diacylglycerol (DAG) or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Surprisingly, the C2 domain is sufficient to cluster on liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2, indicating the C1a domain is not required for self-assembly in this context. We conclude that three distinct clustered states of PKCα can be formed depending on what combination of cofactors are bound, but Ca2+ is minimally required and sufficient for clustering."
https://openalex.org/W2559480865,"Moist high-altitude grasslands in South Africa are renowned for high avifaunal diversity and are priority areas for conservation. Conservation management of these areas conflicts with management for other uses, such as intensive livestock agriculture, which requires annual burning and leads to heavy grazing. Recently the area has become target for water storage schemes and renewable electricity energy projects. There is therefore an urgent need to investigate environmental factors and habitat factors that affect bird species richness in order to optimise management of those areas set aside for conservation. A particularly good opportunity to study these issues arose at Ingula in the eastern South African high-altitude grasslands. An area that had been subject to intense grazing was bought by the national power utility that constructed a pumped storage scheme on part of the land and set aside the rest for bird conservation. Since the new management took over in 2005 the area has been mostly annually burned with relatively little grazing. The new management seeks scientific advice on how to maintain avian species richness of the study area. We collected bird occurrence and vegetation data along random transects between 2006 and 2010 to monitor the impact of the new management, and to study the effect of the habitat changes on bird species richness. To achieve these, we convert bird transect data to presence only data to investigate how bird species richness were related to key transect vegetation attributes under this new grassland management. First we used generalised linear mixed models, to examine changes in vegetation grass height and cover and between burned and unburned habitats. Secondly, we examined how total bird species richness varied across seasons and years. And finally we investigated which habitat vegetation attributes were correlated with species richness of a group of grassland depended bird species only. Transects that were burned showed a larger decrease in vegetation cover compared to transects that were not burned. Grass height increased over time. Bird species richness was highest in summer compared to other seasons and increased over time. Overall bird species richness increased over the three summer surveys but species richness of birds that prefer heavily grazed habitat showed little change over the three years. Changes in bird species richness were best explained by the model with grass height for combined species richness of grassland depended birds but also for birds that prefer heavy grazing when treated alone. On one hand birds that prefer moderate grazing were best explained by a null model. However, overall bird species richness was better positively correlated to grass height than grass cover or dead grass. We conclude that frequent burning alone with relatively reduced grazing led to higher but less dense grass, which benefited some species and disadvantaged others. We suggest that management of this grassland use combination of fire and grazing and leave some areas unburned to accommodates birds of various habitat needs."
https://openalex.org/W2529510388,"In this study, assessment of the safety of transgenic rice T1C-1 expressing Cry1C was carried out by: (1) studying horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in Sprague Dawley rats fed transgenic rice for 90 d; (2) examining the effect of Cry1C protein in vitro on digestibility and allergenicity; and (3) studying the changes of intestinal microbiota in rats fed with transgenic rice T1C-1 in acute and subchronic toxicity tests. Sprague Dawley rats were fed a diet containing either 60% GM Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) rice T1C-1 expressing Cry1C protein, the parental rice Minghui 63, or a basic diet for 90 d. The GM Bt rice T1C-1 showed no evidence of HGT between rats and transgenic rice. Sequence searching of the Cry1C protein showed no homology with known allergens or toxins. Cry1C protein was rapidly degraded in vitro with simulated gastric and intestinal fluids. The expressed Cry1C protein did not induce high levels of specific IgG and IgE antibodies in rats. The intestinal microbiota of rats fed T1C-1 was also analyzed in acute and subchronic toxicity tests by DGGE. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles revealed significant individual differences in the rats' intestinal microbiota."
https://openalex.org/W2528865187,"Increased understanding of the molecular components involved in reproduction may assist in understanding the evolutionary adaptations used by animals, including hermaphrodites, to produce offspring and retain a continuation of their lineage. In this study, we focus on the Mediterranean snail, Theba pisana, a hermaphroditic land snail that has become a highly invasive pest species within agricultural areas throughout the world. Our analysis of T. pisana CNS tissue has revealed gene transcripts encoding molluscan reproduction-associated proteins including APGWamide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and an egg-laying hormone (ELH). ELH isoform 1 (ELH1) is known to be a potent reproductive peptide hormone involved in ovulation and egg-laying in some aquatic molluscs. Two other non-CNS ELH isoforms were also present in T. pisana (Tpi-ELH2 and Tpi-ELH3) within the snail dart sac and mucous glands. Bioactivity of a synthetic ELH1 on sexually mature T. pisana was confirmed through bioassay, with snails showing ELH1-induced egg-laying behaviours, including soil burrowing and oviposition. In summary, this study presents a detailed molecular analysis of reproductive neuropeptide genes in a land snail and provides a foundation for understanding ELH function."
https://openalex.org/W2552498596,"Knowledge of atrial electrophysiological properties is crucial for clinical intervention of atrial arrhythmias and the investigation of the underlying mechanism. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a novel noninvasive cardiac electrical imaging technique in imaging bi-atrial activation sequences from body surface potential maps (BSPMs).The study includes 7 subjects, with 3 atrial flutter patients, and 4 healthy subjects with normal atrial activations. The subject-specific heart-torso geometries were obtained from MRI/CT images. The equivalent current densities were reconstructed from 208-channel BSPMs by solving the inverse problem using individual heart-torso geometry models. The activation times were estimated from the time instant corresponding to the highest peak in the time course of the equivalent current densities. To evaluate the performance, a total of 32 cycles of atrial flutter were analyzed. The imaged activation maps obtained from single beats were compared with the average maps and the activation maps measured from CARTO, by using correlation coefficient (CC) and relative error (RE).The cardiac electrical imaging technique is capable of imaging both focal and reentrant activations. The imaged activation maps for normal atrial activations are consistent with findings from isolated human hearts. Activation maps for isthmus-dependent counterclockwise reentry were reconstructed on three patients with typical atrial flutter. The method was capable of imaging macro counterclockwise reentrant loop in the right atrium and showed inter-atria electrical conduction through coronary sinus. The imaged activation sequences obtained from single beats showed good correlation with both the average activation maps (CC = 0.91±0.03, RE = 0.29±0.05) and the clinical endocardial findings using CARTO (CC = 0.70±0.04, RE = 0.42±0.05).The noninvasive cardiac electrical imaging technique is able to reconstruct complex atrial reentrant activations and focal activation patterns in good consistency with clinical electrophysiological mapping. It offers the potential to assist in radio-frequency ablation of atrial arrhythmia and help defining the underlying arrhythmic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2529192140,"Increasing trade between countries and gains in income have given consumers around the world access to a richer and more diverse set of commercial plant products (i.e., foods and fibers produced by farmers). According to the economic theory of comparative advantage, countries open to trade will be able to consume more–in terms of volume and diversity–if they concentrate production on commodities that they can most cost-effectively produce, while importing goods that are expensive to produce, relative to other countries. Here, we perform a global analysis of traded commercial plant products and find little evidence that increasing globalization has incentivized agricultural specialization. Instead, a country’s plant production and consumption patterns are still largely determined by local evolutionary legacies of plant diversification. Because tropical countries harbor a greater diversity of lineages across the tree of life than temperate countries, tropical countries produce and consume a greater diversity of plant products than do temperate countries. In contrast, the richer and more economically advanced temperate countries have the capacity to produce and consume more plant species than the generally poorer tropical countries, yet this collection of plant species is drawn from fewer branches on the tree of life. Why have countries not increasingly specialized in plant production despite the theoretical financial incentive to do so? Potential explanations include the persistence of domestic agricultural subsidies that distort production decisions, cultural preferences for diverse local food production, and that diverse food production protects rural households in developing countries from food price shocks. Less specialized production patterns will make crop systems more resilient to zonal climatic and social perturbations, but this may come at the expense of global crop production efficiency, an important step in making the transition to a hotter and more crowded world."
https://openalex.org/W2550824362,"Work-related factors have been found to be influential in shaping a number of return-to-work outcomes including return-to-work expectations. Based on the idea that work-related factors have the potential for modification through workplace-based initiatives, this study involved a detailed examination of work-related factors referenced by workers as being taken into consideration when estimating timeframes for returning to work.Focus groups were conducted with 30 employees, currently off work (≤ 3 months) due to a musculoskeletal condition. During the focus groups, participants wrote and spoke about the factors that they considered when forming their expectations for returning to work. Data were subjected to thematic content analysis.Discussions revealed that participants' considerations tended to differ depending on whether or not they had a job to return to. Those with jobs (n = 23) referenced specific influences such as working relationships, accommodations, physical and practical limitations, as well as concerns about their ability to do their job. Those without a job to return to (n = 7) talked about the ways they would go about finding work, and how long they thought this would take. Both groups mentioned the influence of wanting to find the ""right"" job, retraining and being limited due to the need for income.Findings indicate that employees reference numerous work-related factors when estimating their timeframes for returning to work, and that many of these have been previously identified as relating to other return-to-work outcomes. Findings suggest the potential to improve return-to-work expectation through addressing work-related influences, and helping people work through the tasks they need to complete in order to move forward in the return-to-work process."

By attaching oligonucleotides or cDNA onto the chip surface, DNA chip technology provides a rapid method to analyze gene expression. However, challenges remain regarding increasing probe density and improving detection time. To address these challenges, we proposed a DNA chip that was self-assembled from single stranded DNA in combination with high probe density and a rapid detection method. Over 200 probes could be attached to the surface of this 100-nm diameter DNA chip. For detection, the chips were adsorbed onto a mica surface and then incubated for ten minutes with HPV-DNA; the results were directly observable using atomic force microscopy (AFM). This bottom-up fabricated DNA nano chip combined with high probe density and direct AFM detection at the single molecule level will likely have numerous potential clinical applications for gene screening and the early diagnosis of cancer."
