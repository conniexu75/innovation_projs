https://openalex.org/W2735065218,"A two-year study of mercury deposition in the Arctic finds that the main source of mercury is gaseous elemental mercury, which is deposited throughout the year and leads to very high soil mercury levels. Anthropogenic activities have led to large-scale mercury pollution in the Arctic, but it remains uncertain whether wet deposition of oxidized mercury via precipitation and sea-salt-induced chemical cycling of mercury are responsible for the high Arctic mercury load. This paper presents a mass-balance study of mercury deposition and stable isotope data from the Arctic tundra, and finds that the main source of mercury is in fact derived from gaseous elemental mercury, with only minor contributions from the other two suggested sources. Consistently high soil mercury concentrations derived from gaseous elemental mercury along an inland-to-coastal transect suggest that the Arctic tundra might be a globally important mercury sink and might explain why Arctic rivers annually transport large amounts of mercury to the Arctic Ocean. Anthropogenic activities have led to large-scale mercury (Hg) pollution in the Arctic1,2,3,4,5,6. It has been suggested that sea-salt-induced chemical cycling of Hg (through ‘atmospheric mercury depletion events’, or AMDEs) and wet deposition via precipitation are sources of Hg to the Arctic in its oxidized form (Hg(ii)). However, there is little evidence for the occurrence of AMDEs outside of coastal regions, and their importance to net Hg deposition has been questioned2,7. Furthermore, wet-deposition measurements in the Arctic showed some of the lowest levels of Hg deposition via precipitation worldwide8, raising questions as to the sources of high Arctic Hg loading. Here we present a comprehensive Hg-deposition mass-balance study, and show that most of the Hg (about 70%) in the interior Arctic tundra is derived from gaseous elemental Hg (Hg(0)) deposition, with only minor contributions from the deposition of Hg(ii) via precipitation or AMDEs. We find that deposition of Hg(0)—the form ubiquitously present in the global atmosphere—occurs throughout the year, and that it is enhanced in summer through the uptake of Hg(0) by vegetation. Tundra uptake of gaseous Hg(0) leads to high soil Hg concentrations, with Hg masses greatly exceeding the levels found in temperate soils. Our concurrent Hg stable isotope measurements in the atmosphere, snowpack, vegetation and soils support our finding that Hg(0) dominates as a source to the tundra. Hg concentration and stable isotope data from an inland-to-coastal transect show high soil Hg concentrations consistently derived from Hg(0), suggesting that the Arctic tundra might be a globally important Hg sink. We suggest that the high tundra soil Hg concentrations might also explain why Arctic rivers annually transport large amounts of Hg to the Arctic Ocean9,10,11."

https://openalex.org/W2613794917,"Quantum mechanics dictates that a continuous measurement of the position of an object imposes a random back action perturbation on its momentum. This randomness translates with time into position uncertainty, thus leading to the well known uncertainty on the measurement of motion. Here we demonstrate that the quantum back action on a macroscopic mechanical oscillator measured in the reference frame of an atomic spin oscillator can be evaded. The collective quantum measurement on this novel hybrid system of two distant and disparate oscillators is performed with light. The mechanical oscillator is a drum mode of a millimeter size dielectric membrane and the spin oscillator is an atomic ensemble in a magnetic field. The spin oriented along the field corresponds to an energetically inverted spin population and realizes an effective negative mass oscillator, while the opposite orientation corresponds to a positive mass oscillator. The quantum back action is evaded in the negative mass setting and is enhanced in the positive mass case. The hybrid quantum system presented here paves the road to entanglement generation and distant quantum communication between mechanical and spin systems and to sensing of force, motion and gravity beyond the standard quantum limit."
https://openalex.org/W2734990933,"To evaluate whether ethnicity is independently associated with vaginal microbiota (VMB) composition in women living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as has been shown for American women.Women (18-34 years, non-pregnant, N = 610) representing the six largest ethnic groups (Dutch, African Surinamese, South-Asian Surinamese, Turkish, Moroccan, and Ghanaian) were sampled from the population-based HELIUS study. Sampling was performed irrespective of health status or healthcare seeking behavior. DNA was extracted from self-sampled vaginal swabs and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq (16S rRNA gene V3-V4 region).The overall prevalence of VMBs not dominated by lactobacilli was 38.5%: 32.2% had a VMB resembling bacterial vaginosis and another 6.2% had a VMB dominated by Bifidobacteriaceae (not including Gardnerella vaginalis), Corynebacterium, or pathobionts (streptococci, staphylococci, Proteus or Enterobacteriaceae). The most prevalent VMB in ethnically Dutch women was a Lactobacillus crispatus-dominated VMB, in African Surinamese and Ghanaian women a polybacterial G. vaginalis-containing VMB, and in the other ethnic groups a L. iners-dominated VMB. After adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral and clinical factors, African Surinamese ethnicity (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 5.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-12.0) and Ghanaian ethnicity (aOR 4.8, 95% CI 1.8-12.6) were associated with having a polybacterial G. vaginalis-containing VMB, and African Surinamese ethnicity with a L. iners-dominated VMB (aOR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2-6.2). Shorter steady relationship duration, inconsistent condom use with casual partners, and not using hormonal contraception were also associated with having a polybacterial G. vaginalis-containing VMB, but human papillomavirus infection was not. Other sexually transmitted infections were uncommon.The overall prevalence of having a VMB not dominated by lactobacilli in this population-based cohort of women aged 18-34 years in Amsterdam was high (38.5%), and women of sub-Saharan African descent were significantly more likely to have a polybacterial G. vaginalis-containing VMB than Dutch women independent of modifiable behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2736065286,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the western world. Screening is an efficient method of reducing cancer-related mortality. Molecular biomarkers for cancer in general and CRC in particular have been proposed, and hypermethylated DNA from stool or blood samples are already implemented as biomarkers for CRC screening. We aimed to evaluate the performance of proven hypermethylated DNA promoter regions as plasma based biomarkers for CRC detection.We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study of 193 CRC patients and 102 colonoscopy-verified healthy controls. Using methylation specific polymerase chain reaction, we evaluated 30 DNA promoter regions previously found to be CRC specific. We used multivariable logistic regression with stepwise backwards selection, and subsequent leave-pair-out cross validation, to calculate the optimism corrected area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) for all stage as well as early stage CRC.None of the individual DNA promoter regions provided an overall sensitivity above 30% at a reasonable specificity. However, seven hypermethylated promoter regions (ALX4, BMP3, NPTX2, RARB, SDC2, SEPT9, and VIM) along with the covariates sex and age yielded an optimism corrected AUC of 0.86 for all stage CRC and 0.85 for early stage CRC. Overall sensitivity for CRC detection was 90.7% at 72.5% specificity using a cut point value of 0.5.Individual hypermethylated DNA promoter regions have limited value as CRC screening markers. However, a panel of seven hypermethylated promoter regions show great promise as a model for CRC detection."
https://openalex.org/W2734568032,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly chronic lung disease. Extracellular accumulation of adenosine and subsequent activation of the ADORA2B receptor play important roles in regulating inflammation and fibrosis in IPF. Additionally, alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs) expressing ADORA2B have been implicated in mediating adenosine’s effects in IPF. Although hypoxic conditions are present in IPF, hypoxia’s role as a direct modulator of macrophage phenotype and identification of factors that regulate ADORA2B expression on AAMs in IPF is not well understood. In this study, an experimental mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis and lung samples from patients with IPF were used to examine the effects and interactions of macrophage differentiation and hypoxia on fibrosis. We demonstrate that hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1A) inhibition in late stages of bleomycin-induced injury attenuates pulmonary fibrosis in association, with reductions in ADORA2B expression in AAMs. Additionally, ADORA2B deletion or pharmacological antagonism along with HIF1A inhibition disrupts AAM differentiation and subsequent IL-6 production in cultured macrophages. These findings suggest that hypoxia, through HIF1A, contributes to the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis through its regulation of ADORA2B expression on AAMs, cell differentiation, and production of profibrotic mediators. These studies support a potential role for HIF1A or ADORA2B antagonists in the treatment of IPF.—Philip, K., Mills, T. W., Davies, J., Chen, N.-Y., Karmouty-Quintana, H., Luo, F., Molina, J.

https://openalex.org/W2736083923,"Few studies have examined rates and causes of short-term readmissions among adults across age and insurance types. We compared rates, characteristics, and costs of 30-day readmission after all-cause hospitalizations across insurance types in the US. We retrospectively evaluated alive patients ≥18 years old, discharged for any cause, 1/1/13-11/31/13, 2006 non-federal hospitals in 21 states in the Nationwide Readmissions Database. The primary stratification variable of interest was primary insurance. Comorbid conditions were assessed based on Elixhauser comorbidities, as defined by administrative billing codes. Additional measures included diagnoses for index hospitalizations leading to rehospitalization. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models, with hospital site as a random effect, were used to calculate the adjusted odds of 30-day readmissions by age group and insurance categories. Cost and discharge estimates were weighted per NRD procedures to reflect a nationally representative sample. Diagnoses for index hospitalizations leading to rehospitalization were determined. Among 12,533,551 discharges, 1,818,093 (14.5%) resulted in readmission within 30 days. Medicaid insurance was associated with the highest adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for readmission both in those ≥65 years old (AOR 1.12, 95%CI 1.10–1.14; p <0.001), and 45–64 (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.66–1.69; p < 0.001), and Medicare in the 18–44 group (Medicare vs. private insurance: AOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.96–2.01; p <0.001). Discharges for psychiatric or substance abuse disorders, septicemia, and heart failure accounted for the largest numbers of readmissions, with readmission rates of 24.0%, 17.9%, 22.9% respectively. Total costs for readmissions were 50.7 billion USD, highest for Medicare (29.6 billion USD), with non-Medicare costs exceeding 21 billion USD. While Medicare readmissions account for more than half of the total burden of readmissions, costs of non-Medicare readmissions are nonetheless substantial. Medicaid patients have the highest odds of readmission in individuals older than age 44, commonly due to hospitalizations for psychiatric illness and substance abuse disorders. Medicaid patients represent a population at uniquely high risk for readmission."
https://openalex.org/W2734619116,"Opposition to gay rights is prevalent in countries around the world. Recent correlational research suggests that opposition to gay rights may be driven by an interaction between one’s own short-term mating orientation (i.e. willingness to engage in casual sex) and representations of gay people as sexually promiscuous. Here, we experimentally manipulated representations of gay men by randomly assigning participants to read one of two versions of a fictitious newspaper article, one of which contained faux scientific evidence confirming the stereotype that gay men are promiscuous, and the other containing faux scientific evidence refuting the stereotype. We found that the manipulation interacted with short-term mating orientation (STMO) to predict opposition to gay rights, such that low-STMO individuals (i.e. more averse to casual sex) exhibited more support for gay rights when assigned to read the stereotype-refuting article compared to the stereotype-confirming article, whereas high-STMO individuals (i.e. less averse to casual sex) were not significantly influenced by the manipulation. We discuss the implications of these findings for the study of antigay attitudes, as well as for recent societal changes in acceptance of homosexuality."
https://openalex.org/W2734370230,"Seed development culminates in programmed cell death (PCD) and hardening of organs enclosing the embryo (e.g., pericarp, seed coat) providing essentially a physical shield for protection during storage in the soil. We examined the proposal that dead organs enclosing embryos are unique entities that store and release upon hydration active proteins that might increase seed persistence in soil, germination and seedling establishment. Proteome analyses of dead seed coats of Brassicaceae species revealed hundreds of proteins being stored in the seed coat and released upon hydration, many are stress-associated proteins such as nucleases, proteases and chitinases. Functional analysis revealed that dead seed coats function as long-term storage for multiple active hydrolytic enzymes (e.g., nucleases) that can persist in active forms for decades. Substances released from the dead seed coat of the annual desert plant Anastatica hierochuntica displayed strong antimicrobial activity. Our data highlighted a previously unrecognized feature of dead organs enclosing embryos (e.g., seed coat) functioning not only as a physical shield for embryo protection but also as a long-term storage for active proteins and other substances that are released upon hydration to the ""seedsphere"" and could contribute to seed persistence in the soil, germination and seedling establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2735114142,"Little is known about oral health related to electronic-cigarette (EC) use, even though EC use is increasing rapidly. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between EC use and oral health, including 'gingival pain and/or bleeding', 'tongue and/or inside-cheek pain', and 'cracked or broken teeth' among adolescents.A total of 65,528 students in 2016 were included in this cross-sectional study.For EC use, 0.5% (n = 297) students were daily users, 1.9% (n = 1259) were '1 to 29 days past month users', and 5.9% (n = 3848) were former users. Overall, 18.5% students reported they had experienced 'gingival pain and/or bleeding', 11.0% reported 'tongue and/or inside-cheek pain', and 11.4% reported a 'cracked or broken tooth' within the past 12 months. When comparing 'daily EC users', '1 to 29 days past month EC users', and 'former EC users' with 'never EC users', the adjusted ORs for 'cracked or broken tooth' were 1.65 (95% CI: 1.19-2.27), 1.26 (95% CI: 1.06-1.51), and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.04-1.30), respectively. Comparing 'daily EC users' with 'never EC users', the adjusted OR for 'tongue and/or inside-cheek pain' was 1.54 (1.05-2.26). However, EC use among adolescents was not associated with 'gingival pain and/or bleeding' when adjusted for the potential confounders.Based on the results, the odds of cracked or broken teeth among daily, '1 to 29 days past month', and former EC users were significantly higher than those among never EC users. The odds of tongue and/or inside-cheek pain among daily EC users were significantly higher than those among never EC users. In conclusion, the results suggest that daily EC use among adolescents may be a risk factor for cracked or broken teeth and tongue and/or inside-cheek pain."
https://openalex.org/W2734980640,"Animal studies have linked the estrogenic properties of bisphenol A (BPA) to adverse effects on the endocrine system. Because of concerns for similar effects in humans, there is a desire to replace BPA in consumer products, and a search for BPA replacements that lack endocrine-disrupting bioactivity is ongoing. We used multiple cell-based models, including an established multi-parametric, high throughput microscopy-based platform that incorporates engineered HeLa cell lines with visible ERα- or ERβ-regulated transcription loci, to discriminate the estrogen-like and androgen-like properties of previously uncharacterized substituted bisphenol derivatives and hydroquinone. As expected, BPA induced 70–80% of the estrogen-like activity via ERα and ERβ compared to E2 in the HeLa prolactin array cell line. 2,2’ BPA, Bisguaiacol F, CHDM 4-hydroxybuyl acrylate, hydroquinone, and TM modified variants of BPF showed very limited estrogen-like or androgen-like activity (< 10% of that observed with the control compounds). Interestingly, TM-BFP and CHDM 4-hydroxybuyl acrylate, but not their derivatives, demonstrated evidence of anti-estrogenic and anti-androgenic activity. Our findings indicate that Bisguaiacol F, TM-BFP-ER and TM-BPF-DGE demonstrate low potential for affecting estrogenic or androgenic endocrine activity. This suggest that the tested compounds could be suitable commercially viable alternatives to BPA."
https://openalex.org/W2735348640,"Heart and skeletal muscle inflammation (HSMI) is associated with Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV) infection and is an important disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture. Since PRV infects erythrocytes and farmed salmon frequently experience environmental hypoxia, the current study examined mutual effects of PRV infection and hypoxia on pathogenesis and fish performance. Furthermore, effects of HSMI on hypoxia tolerance, cardiorespiratory performance and blood oxygen transport were studied. A cohabitation trial including PRV-infected post-smolts exposed to periodic hypoxic stress (4 h of 40% O2; PRV-H) at 4, 7 and 10 weeks post-infection (WPI) and infected fish reared under normoxic conditions (PRV) was conducted. Periodic hypoxic stress did not influence infection levels or histopathological changes in the heart. Individual incipient lethal oxygen saturation (ILOS) was examined using a standardized hypoxia challenge test (HCT). At 7 WPI, i.e. peak level of infection, both PRV and PRV-H groups exhibited reduced hypoxia tolerance compared to non-infected fish. Three weeks later (10 WPI), during peak levels of pathological changes, reduced hypoxia tolerance was still observed for the PRV group while PRV-H performed equal to non-infected fish, implying a positive effect of the repeated exposure to hypoxic stress. This was in line with maximum heart rate (fHmax) measurements, showing equal performance of PRV-H and non-infected groups, but lower fHmax above 19°C as well as lower temperature optimum (Topt) for aerobic scope for PRV, suggesting reduced cardiac performance and thermal tolerance. In contrast, the PRV-H group had reduced hemoglobin-oxygen affinity compared to non-infected fish. In conclusion, Atlantic salmon suffering from HSMI have reduced hypoxia tolerance and cardiac performance, which can be improved by preconditioning fish to transient hypoxic stress episodes."

Chemokines and vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules (VECAMs) of Leptospira-infected mice and leptospirosis patients were detected by microarray and immunohistochemistry. Leptospira-phagocytosing and -killing abilities of human or mouse macrophages and neutrophils, and the roles of intracellular ROS, NO and [Ca2+]i in Leptospira-killing process were evaluated by confocal microscopy and spectrofluorimetry.Peripheral blood mononuclear-macrophages rather than neutrophils were the main infiltrating phagocytes in the lungs, liver and kidneys of infected mice. Levels of macrophage- but not neutrophil-specific chemokines and VECAMs were significantly increased in the samples from infected mice and patients. All macrophages tested had a higher ability than neutrophils to phagocytose and kill leptospires. Higher ROS and NO levels and [Ca2+]i in the macrophages were involved in killing leptospires. Human macrophages displayed more phagolysosome formation and a stronger leptospire-killing ability to than mouse macrophages.Mononuclear-macrophages but not neutrophils represent the main infiltrating and anti-leptospiral phagocytes during leptospirosis. A lower level of phagosome-lysosome fusion may be responsible for the lower Leptospira-killing ability of human macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2735185933,"The use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in the treatment of ischemic stroke is limited by its propensity to exacerbate brain edema and hemorrhage. The mechanisms underlying these deleterious effects of tPA remain incompletely understood. The purpose of this study was to delineate a pathway of tPA-mediated complement cascade activation in stroke and to determine whether complement inhibition ameliorates the adverse effects of post-ischemic tPA administration. We found that tPA promotes C3 cleavage both in vitro and in ischemic brain through a plasmin-mediated extrinsic pathway. Using cell culture models, we then showed that the C3a-receptor is strongly expressed on ischemic endothelium and that exogenous C3a dramatically enhances endothelial cell permeability. Next, we assessed the effect of tPA administration on brain edema and hemorrhage in a transient model of focal cerebral ischemia in C57BL/6 mice. We found that intravenous tPA exacerbates brain edema and hemorrhage in stroke, and that these effects are abrogated by a small-molecule antagonist of the C3a receptor. These findings establish for the first time that intravenous tPA dramatically upregulates complement cascade activation in ischemic brain and that pharmacologic complement inhibition protects against the adverse effects of tPA-mediated thrombolysis in stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2736283965,"The autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic hepatitis driven by the adaptive immunity that affects all age groups. A functional and numerical regulatory T cell (Treg) defect has been reported in pediatric AIH (pAIH), while an intrahepatic increase in adult AIH (aAIH) patients has been detected in current research findings.Therefore, we quantified the intrahepatic numbers of Treg, T and B cells, as well as serum cytokine levels before and during therapy in pAIH.We found a disproportional intrahepatic enrichment of Tregs in untreated pAIH compared to pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The increase of Treg/total T cells was even more pronounced than in aAIH due to fewer infiltrating T and B cells. Portal densities of Treg, as well as total T and B cells, declined significantly during therapy. However, portal Treg densities decreased disproportionately, leading to even decreasing ratios of Treg to T and B cells during therapy. Out of 28 serum cytokines IL-2 showed the strongest (10fold) decrease under therapy. This decline of IL-2 was associated with decreasing intrahepatic Treg numbers under therapy. None of the baseline T and B cell infiltration parameters were associated with the subsequent treatment response in pAIH.Intrahepatic Tregs are rather enriched in untreated pAIH. The disproportional decrease of Tregs during therapy may be caused by a decrease of IL-2 levels. New therapies should, therefore, aim in strengthening intrahepatic immune regulation."

Methods This retrospective cohort study included 62 asymptomatic women with cervical insufficiency (n = 27) or an asymptomatic short cervix (n = 35) at 18–27 weeks. CVF swab samples were taken for assays of vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), interleukin (IL)-8, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, and Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3) before cervical examination, and maternal blood was collected for the determination of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level. The primary outcome measurement was SPTD at <32 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves were used for the statistical analyses. Results The rate of SPTD at <32 weeks was 40.3% (25/62). The CVF levels of VDBP, TIMP-1, and DKK3, but not IL-8 and MMP-9, were significantly higher in the women who had SPTD at <32 weeks than in those who did not deliver spontaneously at <32 weeks. The women who had SPTD at <32 weeks had a significantly more advanced cervical dilatation at presentation and a higher level of serum CRP. Using the stepwise regression analysis, a prediction model was developed by combining various proteins in the CVF and clinical factors, resulting in the inclusion of cervical dilatation, CVF VDBP, and use of corticosteroids (area under curve, 0.909). Conclusions In women with cervical insufficiency or a short cervix, VDBP, TIMP-1, and DKK3 in the CVF may be useful as non-invasive predictors of SPTD at <32 weeks. A combination of these markers and clinical factors appears to improve the predictability of SPTD compared with the markers alone."
https://openalex.org/W2734962454,"Objective Computer-aided-surgery in ENT surgery is mainly used for sinus surgery but navigation accuracy still reaches its limits for skull base procedures. Knowledge of navigation accuracy in distinct anatomical regions is therefore mandatory. This study examined whether navigation accuracy can be improved in specific anatomical localizations by using hybrid registration technique. Study design Experimental phantom study. Setting Operating room. Subjects and methods The gold standard of screw registration was compared with automatic LED-mask-registration alone, and in combination with additional surface matching. 3D-printer-based skull models with individual fabricated silicone skin were used for the experiments. Overall navigation accuracy considering 26 target fiducials distributed over each skull was measured as well as the accuracy on selected anatomic localizations. Results Overall navigation accuracy was <1.0 mm in all cases, showing the significantly lowest values after screw registration (0.66 ± 0.08 mm), followed by hybrid registration (0.83± 0.08 mm), and sole mask registration (0.92 ± 0.13 mm).On selected anatomic localizations screw registration was significantly superior on the sphenoid sinus and on the internal auditory canal. However, mask registration showed significantly better accuracy results on the midface. Navigation accuracy on skull base localizations could be significantly improved by the combination of mask registration and additional surface matching. Conclusion Overall navigation accuracy gives no sufficient information regarding navigation accuracy in a distinct anatomic area. The non-invasive LED-mask-registration proved to be an alternative in clinical routine showing best accuracy results on the midface. For challenging skull base procedures a hybrid registration technique is recommendable which improves navigation accuracy significantly in this operating field. Invasive registration procedures are reserved for selected challenging skull base operations where the required high precision warrants the invasiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2735751653,"The process of cryopreservation results in over-production of reactive oxygen species, which is extremely detrimental to spermatozoa. The aim of this study was to investigate whether addition of cysteine to freezing extender would facilitate the cryosurvival of rabbit spermatozoa, and if so, how cysteine protects spermatozoa from cryodamages. Freshly ejaculated semen was diluted with Tris-citrate-glucose extender supplemented with different concentrations of cysteine. The motility, intact acrosomes, membrane integrity, mitochondrial potentials, 8-hydroxyguanosine level and sperm-zona pellucida binding capacity were examined. Furthermore, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, glutathione content (GSH), and level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide of spermatozoa were analyzed. The values of motility, intact acrosomes, membrane integrity, mitochondrial potentials and sperm-zona pellucida binding capacity of the frozen-thawed spermatozoa in the treatment of cysteine were significantly higher than those of the control. Addition of cysteine to extenders improved the GPx activity and GSH content of spermatozoa, while lowered the ROS, DNA oxidative alterations and lipid peroxidation level, which makes spermatozoa avoid ROS to attack DNA, the plasma membrane and mitochondria. In conclusion, cysteine protects spermatozoa against ROS-induced damages during cryopreservation and post-thaw incubation. Addition of cysteine is recommended to facilitate the improvement of semen preservation for the rabbit breeding industry."

https://openalex.org/W2734500993,"Recently, zebrafish and human cytochrome P450 (P450) 27C1 enzymes have been shown to be retinoid 3,4-desaturases. The enzyme is unusual among mammalian P450s in that the predominant oxidation is a desaturation and in that hydroxylation represents only a minor pathway. We show by proteomic analysis that P450 27C1 is localized to human skin, with two proteins of different sizes present, one being a cleavage product of the full-length form. P450 27C1 oxidized all-trans-retinol to 3,4-dehydroretinol, 4-hydroxy (OH) retinol, and 3-OH retinol in a 100:3:2 ratio. Neither 3-OH nor 4-OH retinol was an intermediate in desaturation. No kinetic burst was observed in the steady state; neither the rate of substrate binding nor product release was rate-limiting. Ferric P450 27C1 reduction by adrenodoxin was 3-fold faster in the presence of the substrate and was ∼5-fold faster than the overall turnover. Kinetic isotope effects of 1.5–2.3 (on kcat/Km) were observed with 3,3-, 4,4-, and 3,3,4,4-deuterated retinol. Deuteration at C-4 produced a 4-fold increase in 3-hydroxylation due to metabolic switching, with no observable effect on 4-hydroxylation. Deuteration at C-3 produced a strong kinetic isotope effect for 3-hydroxylation but not 4-hydroxylation. Analysis of the products of deuterated retinol showed a lack of scrambling of a putative allylic radical at C-3 and C-4. We conclude that the most likely catalytic mechanism begins with abstraction of a hydrogen atom from C-4 (or possibly C-3) initiating the desaturation pathway, followed by a sequential abstraction of a hydrogen atom or proton-coupled electron transfer. Adrenodoxin reduction and hydrogen abstraction both contribute to rate limitation."

However, the underlying cellular changes accompanying brain maturation are less understood. Examining regional age-related changes in metabolite levels provides insight into the physiology of neurodevelopment. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) measures localize brain metabolism. The majority of neuroimaging studies of healthy development are from the developed world. In a longitudinal MRS study of 64 South African children aged 5 to 10 years old (29 female; 29 HIV exposed, uninfected), we examined the age-related trajectories of creatine (Cr+PCr), N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), the combined NAA+N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate (NAAG), choline (GPC+PCh), glutamate (Glu) and the combined Glu+glutamine (Glu+Gln) in voxels within gray and white matter, as well as subcortically in the basal ganglia (BG). In frontal gray matter, we found age-related increases in Cr+PCr, NAA, NAA+NAAG and Glu+Gln levels pointing to synaptic activity likely related to learning. In the BG we observed increased levels of Glu, Glu+Gln and NAA+NAAG with age that point to subcortical synaptic reorganization. In white matter, we found increased levels of Cr+PCr, NAA, NAA+NAAG, Glu and Glu+Gln with age, implicating these metabolites in ongoing myelination. We observed no sex-age or HIV exposure-age interactions, indicating that physiological changes are independent of sex during this time period. The metabolite trajectories presented, therefore, provide a critical benchmark of normal cellular growth for a low socioeconomic pediatric population in the developing world against which pathology and abnormal development may be compared."

All-cause mortality was assessed at five time intervals: I) 30 days after surgery to 1 year; II) 1 to 3 years; III) 3 to 5 years; IV) 5 to 10 years; and V) 10 to 15 years. For the adjustment of mortality for comorbidity and pre-, intra- and postoperative variables, Cox proportional hazard regression models were conducted within each period. The overall incidence of AKI was 36.1%. AKI was an independent predictor of death only during the first five years after surgery (30 days to 1 year: HR 1.834, 95% CI 1.459 to 2.306; 1 to 3 years: HR 1.285, 95% CI 1.023 to 1.610; and 3 to five years: HR 1.330, 95% CI 1.123 to 1.750). Only age, diabetes mellitus and CHF were associated with increased risk of death over the entire follow-up period. Our study demonstrates a transient association of AKI with long-term mortality that progressively decreases and vanishes five years after surgery. The knowledge of this dynamic is crucial to understanding this complex association, planning health care and allocating resources."
https://openalex.org/W2734388245,"Immunosenescence is a hallmark of the aging immune system and is considered the main cause of a reduced vaccine efficacy in the elderly. Although γδ T cells can become activated by recombinant influenza hemagglutinin, their age-related immunocompetence during a virus-induced immune response has so far not been investigated. In this study we evaluate the kinetics of γδ T cells after vaccination with the trivalent 2011/2012 northern hemisphere seasonal influenza vaccine. We applied multi-parametric flow cytometry to a cohort of 21 young (19–30 years) and 23 elderly (53–67 years) healthy individuals. Activated and proliferating γδ T cells, as identified by CD38 and Ki67 expression, were quantified on the days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21. We observed a significantly lower number of activated and proliferating γδ T cells at baseline and following vaccination in elderly as compared to young individuals. The kinetics changes of activated γδ T cells were much stronger in the young, while corresponding changes in the elderly occurred slower. In addition, we observed an association between day 21 HAI titers of influenza A and the frequencies of Ki67+ γδ T cells at day 7 in the young. In conclusion, aging induces alterations of the γδ T cell response that might have negative implications for vaccination efficacy."

Information on the economic burden of DR in Singapore is limited. We aim to identify the total annual direct medical costs of DR at different stages, and to examine factors influencing the costs. Four hundreds and seventy T2DM patients who attended the Diabetes Centre in a secondary hospital in Singapore in 2011–2014 were included. Digital color fundus photographs were assessed for DR in a masked fashion. Retinopathy severity was further categorized into non-proliferative DR (NPDR), including mild, moderate and severe NPDR, and proliferative DR (PDR). Medical costs were assessed using hospital administrative data. DR was diagnosed in 172 (39.5%) patients, including 51 mild, 62 moderate and 18 severe NPDR, and 41 PDR. The median cost in DR [2012.0 (1111.2–4192.3)] was significantly higher than that in non-DR patients [1158.1 (724.1–1838.9)] (p<0.001). The corresponding costs for mild, moderate, severe NPDR and PDR were [1167.1 (895.4–2012.0)], [2212.0 (1215.5–3825.5)], [2717.5 (1444.0–6310.7)], and [3594.8.1 (1978.4–8427.7)], respectively. After adjustment, the corresponding cost ratios for mild, moderate, severe NPDR, and PDR relative to non-DR were 1.1 (p = 0.827), 1.8 (p = 0.003), 2.0 (p = 0.031) and 2.3 (p<0.001), respectively. The other factors affecting the total cost include smoking (ratio = 1.7, p = 0.019), neuropathy (ratio = 1.9, p = 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (ratio = 1.4, p = 0.019). The presence and severity of DR was associated with increased direct medical costs in T2DM. Our results suggest that preventing progression of DR may reduce the economic burden of DR."
https://openalex.org/W2734865955,"The ability to reproduce novel words is a sensitive marker of language impairment across a variety of developmental disorders. Nonword repetition tasks are thought to reflect phonological short-term memory skills. Yet, when children hear and then utter a word for the first time, they must transform a novel speech signal into a series of coordinated, precisely timed oral movements. Little is known about how children’s oromotor speed, planning and co-ordination abilities might influence their ability to repeat novel nonwords, beyond the influence of higher-level cognitive and linguistic skills. In the present study, we tested 35 typically developing children between the ages of 5−8 years on measures of nonword repetition, digit span, memory for non-verbal sequences, reading fluency, oromotor praxis, and oral diadochokinesis. We found that oromotor praxis uniquely predicted nonword repetition ability in school-age children, and that the variance it accounted for was additional to that of digit span, memory for non-verbal sequences, articulatory rate (measured by oral diadochokinesis) as well as reading fluency. We conclude that the ability to compute and execute novel sensorimotor transformations affects the production of novel words. These results have important implications for understanding motor/language relations in neurodevelopmental disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2734632277,"Ricin toxin’s binding subunit (RTB) is a galactose-/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNac)-specific lectin that mediates uptake and intracellular trafficking of ricin within mammalian cells. Structurally, RTB consists of two globular domains, each divided into three homologous sub-domains (α, β, γ). In this report, we describe five new murine IgG monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against RTB: MH3, 8A1, 8B3, LF1, and LC5. The mAbs have similar binding affinities (KD) for ricin holotoxin, but displayed a wide range of in vitro toxin-neutralizing activities. Competition ELISAs indicate that the two most potent toxin-neutralizing mAbs (MH3, 8A1), as well as one of the moderate toxin-neutralizing mAbs (LF1), recognize distinct epitopes near the low affinity Gal recognition domain in RTB subdomain 1α. Evaluated in a mouse model of systemic ricin challenge, all five mAbs afforded some benefit against intoxication, but only MH3 was protective. However, neither MH3 nor 24B11, another well-characterized mAb against RTB subdomain 1α, could passively protect mice against a mucosal (intranasal) ricin challenge. This is in contrast to SylH3, a previously characterized mAb directed against an epitope near RTB’s high affinity Gal/GalNac recognition element in sub-domain 2γ, which protected animals against systemic and mucosal ricin exposure. SylH3 was significantly more effective than MH3 and 24B11 at blocking ricin attachment to host cell receptors, suggesting that mucosal immunity to ricin is best imparted by antibodies that target RTB’s high affinity Gal/GalNac recognition element in subdomain 2γ, not the low affinity Gal recognition domain in subdomain 1α."
https://openalex.org/W2734777740,"The aim of this study was to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which food-derived casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) maintains internal homeostasis in the intestinal mucosa and to investigate the effects of CGMP on the intestinal mucosal immunological barrier and related signal transduction pathways.In this study, a famoxadone (OXZ)-induced mouse experimental ulcerative colitis (UC) model was built. The experimental UC mice were intragastrically administered milk-derived CGMP for four consecutive days. The molecular mechanisms by which milk-derived CGMP improved and restored the inflammatory status in UC symptoms were elucidated by H&E staining, immunohistochemical staining and western blotting.The results indicated that CGMP (50 mg/(kg bw·d)) could significantly improve morphological injury to intestinal mucosa in OXZ-induced UC mice to the same extent that did sulfasalazine (SASP, 40 mg/(kg bw·d)), a medicine used to treat UC, in the control group. The study found that CGMP could significantly reduce the expression of Human mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), Cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and Cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8) in the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa and significantly stimulate the secretion of sIgA to increase intestinal immunity. Furthermore, CGMP was found to be directly involved in inhibiting the MAPK pathway and activating the TGF-β1/Smad signal transduction cascade, which could maintain immunological regulation of the intestinal mucosa and protect the functions of the intestinal mucosal barrier.This study elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which CGMP maintained homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa and further confirmed its pharmaceutical value as a food-derived functional component with promising potential for further exploration/utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2735285858,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) mediates the firm adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells and initiates subsequent signaling that promotes their transendothelial migration (TEM). Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin plays a critical role in endothelial cell–cell adhesion, thereby controlling endothelial permeability and leukocyte transmigration. This study aimed to determine the molecular signaling events that originate from the ICAM-1–mediated firm adhesion of neutrophils that regulate VE-cadherin’s role as a negative regulator of leukocyte transmigration. We observed that ICAM-1 interacts with Src homology domain 2–containing phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), and SHP-2 down-regulation via silencing of small interfering RNA in endothelial cells enhanced neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells but inhibited neutrophil transmigration. We also found that VE-cadherin associated with the ICAM-1–SHP-2 complex. Moreover, whereas the activation of ICAM-1 leads to VE-cadherin dissociation from ICAM-1 and VE-cadherin association with actin, SHP-2 down-regulation prevented ICAM-1–VE-cadherin association and promoted VE-cadherin–actin association. Furthermore, SHP-2 down-regulation in vivo promoted LPS-induced neutrophil recruitment in mouse lung but delayed neutrophil extravasation. These results suggest that SHP-2—via association with ICAM-1— mediates ICAM-1–induced Src activation and modulates VE-cadherin switching association with ICAM-1 or actin, thereby negatively regulating neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells and enhancing their TEM.—Yan, M., Zhang, X., Chen, A., Gu, W., Liu, J., Ren, X., Zhang, J., Wu, X., Place, A.T., Minshall, R.D., Liu, G.

https://openalex.org/W2734395416,"In 2013, national serosurveillance detected a high seroprevalence of antibodies to pertussis toxin (PT) from Bordetella pertussis among Japanese adults. Thus, we aimed to determine the cause(s) of this high seroprevalence, and analyzed the titers of antibodies to PT and filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) among adults (35-44 years old), young children (4-7 years old), and older children (10-14 years old). Our quantitative analyses revealed that adults had higher seroprevalences of anti-PT IgG and PT-neutralizing antibodies, and similar titers of anti-FHA IgG, compared to the young and older children. Positive correlations were observed between the titers of PT-neutralizing antibodies and anti-PT IgG in all age groups (rs values of 0.326-0.522), although the correlation tended to decrease with age. The ratio of PT-neutralizing antibodies to anti-PT IgG was significantly different when we compared the serum and purified IgG fractions among adults (p = 0.016), although this result was not observed among young and older children. Thus, it appears that some adults had non-IgG immunoglobulins to PT. Our analyses also revealed that adults had high-avidity anti-PT IgG (avidity index: 63.5%, similar results were observed among the children); however, the adults had lower-avidity anti-FHA IgG (37.9%, p < 0.05). It is possible that low-avidity anti-FHA IgG is related to infection with other respiratory pathogens (e.g., Bordetella parapertussis, Haemophilus influenzae, or Mycoplasma pneumoniae), which produces antibodies to FHA-like proteins. Our observations suggest that these adults had been infected with B. pertussis and other pathogen(s) during their adulthood."

Serum thyroglobulin (Tg) is a sensitive and easily obtained biomarker. Hence, we aimed to assess the predicting value of quantitative response of Tg in earlier identifying the RAIR-DTC with pulmonary metastasis.Pulmonary metastatic DTC patients who underwent total or near-total thyroidectomy and at least two times of RAI therapy were included in this study. The pre-ablative stimulated Tg at the first and second RAI therapy were defined as pstim-Tg1 and pstim-Tg2, while the suppressed Tg before and after the second RAI therapy were designated sup-Tg1 and sup-Tg2. The predicted value of pstim-Tg2/Tg1 and sup-Tg2/Tg1 ratio were detected using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and logistic regression analyses.Totally 115 patients were involved in this study. ROC curves showed a cut-off value of 0.544 for pstim-Tg2/ pstim-Tg1 in detecting RAIR, with a sensitivity of 0.9 and specificity of 0.477, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.744. Similarly, the cut-off of sup-Tg2/ sup-Tg1 was 0.972, with a sensitivity of 0.733 and specificity of 0.935, and AUC of 0.898. Univariate analysis illustrated that age, tumor size, pstim-Tg2/Tg1, sup-Tg2/ sup-Tg1 and BRAFV600E mutation were eligible to predict RAIR. While from multivariate analysis, only age, pstim-Tg2/Tg1, sup-Tg2/ sup-Tg1 and BRAFV600E mutation were verified to be the independent predictive factors.The quantitative Tg response was encouraging in identifying RAIR-DTC with pulmonary metastasis. Age, BRAFV600E mutation and Tg response were independent predictors in predicting RAIR-DTC."
https://openalex.org/W2949626269,"Background Vitamin D modulates the inflammatory and immune response to tuberculosis (TB) and also mediates the induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. Deficiency of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene may increase the risk of TB disease and decrease culture conversion rates in drug susceptible TB. Whether these VDR SNPs are found in African populations or impact multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB treatment has not been established. We aimed to determine if SNPs in the VDR gene were associated with sputum culture conversion among a cohort of MDR TB patients in South Africa. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult MDR TB patients receiving second-line TB treatment in KwaZulu-Natal province. Subjects had monthly sputum cultures performed. In a subset of participants, whole blood samples were obtained for genomic analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted and genotyped with Affymetrix Axiom Pan-African Array. Cox proportional models were used to determine the association between VDR SNPs and rate of culture conversion. Results Genomic analyses were performed on 91 MDR TB subjects enrolled in the sub-study; 60% were female and median age was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29–42). Smoking was reported by 21% of subjects and most subjects had HIV (80%), were smear negative (57%), and had cavitary disease (55%). Overall, 87 (96%) subjects initially converted cultures to negative, with median time to culture conversion of 57 days (IQR 17–114). Of 121 VDR SNPs examined, 10 were significantly associated (p<0.01) with rate of sputum conversion in multivariable analyses. Each additional risk allele on SNP rs74085240 delayed culture conversion significantly (adjusted hazard ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.14–0.67). Conclusions Polymorphisms in the VDR gene were associated with rate of sputum culture conversion in MDR TB patients in this high HIV prevalence setting in South Africa."

We performed a combination of both a detailed autopsy and a molecular autopsy by whole exome sequencing (WES) to investigate the cause of SUDS in Thai sudden death victims.A detailed forensic autopsy was performed to identify the cause of death, followed by a molecular autopsy, in 42 sudden death victims who died between January 2015 and August 2015. The coding sequences of 98 SUDS-related genes were sequenced using WES. Potentially causative variants were filtered based on the variant functions annotated in the dbNSFP database. Variants with inconclusive clinical significance evidence in ClinVar were resolved with a variant prediction algorithm, metaSVM, and the frequency data of the variants found in public databases, such as the 1000 Genome Project, ESP6500 project, and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc) project.Combining both autopsy and molecular autopsy enabled the potential identification of cause of death in 81% of the cases. Among the 25 victims with WES data, 72% (18/25) were found to have potentially causative SUDS mutations. The majority of the victims had at a mutation in the TTN gene (8/18 = 44%), and only one victim had an SCN5A mutation.WES can help to identify the genetic causes in victims of SUDS and may help to further guide investigations into their relatives to prevent additional SUDS victims."
https://openalex.org/W2735252816,"Purpose No method has been established to evaluate the dissociation between subjective and objective vertical positions with respect to the self-awareness of postural deformity in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The purpose of this study was to demonstrate, from the relationship between an assessment of the dissociation of subjective and objective vertical positions of PD patients and an assessment based on established PD clinical evaluation scales, that the dissociation regarding vertical position is a factor in the severity of the forward flexion of trunk (FFT). Methods Subjects were 39 PD patients and 15 age-matched healthy individuals (control group). Posture was evaluated with measurement of FFT angle during static standing and the subjective vertical position (SV) of the patient. For evaluation of motor function, the Modified Hoehn & Yahr scale, Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), 3-m Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), and Functional Reach Test (FRT) were used. Results In PD patients, FFT angle in the 3rd tertile of patients was 13.8±9.7°, significantly greater than those in the control group and the 1st and 2nd tertiles of PD patients (control group vs 3rd tertile, p = 0.008; 1st tertile vs 3rd tertile, p<0.001; 2nd vs 3rd tertile, p = 0.008). In multiple regression analysis for factors in the FFT angle, significant factors were SV, disease duration, and the standard deviation of each SV angle measurement. Conclusion The dissociation between SV and objective vertical position affects the FFT of PD patients, suggesting an involvement of non-basal ganglia pathologies."

In the pulmonary environment, we have previously demonstrated a heterogeneous population of circulating fibroblast precursors (CFPs), which are defined by expression of the pan-leukocyte marker CD45 and the collagen receptor, discoidin domain receptor-2 (DDR2). This population is derived from the hematopoietic stem cell, expresses collagen, and has a fibroblastic morphology in vitro. Herein, we demonstrate a novel subset of CFPs expressing immune markers CD11b, CD11c, and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II). The CFP population was skewed toward this immune marker expressing subset in animals with silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Data indicate that this CFP subset upregulates co-stimulatory molecules and MHC II expression in response to silica-induced fibrosis in vivo. Functionally, this population was shown to promote T cell skewing away from a Th1 response and toward a pro-inflammatory profile. These studies represent the first direct flow cytometric and functional evaluation of the novel immune marker expressing CFP subset in an exposure-induced model of pulmonary fibrosis. Elucidating the role of this CFP subset may enhance our understanding of the complex immune balance critical to mediating exposures at the pulmonary-host interface and may be a valuable target for the treatment of exposure-induced pulmonary fibrosis."

Mol. Biol. 2014; 426: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Yeast strains carrying a deletion in the gene encoding MS exhibit multiple phenotypes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans, methionine auxotrophy caused by MS dysfunction can be fully rescued by methionine supplementation (3.Suliman H.S. Appling D.R. Robertus J.D.

Transcriptional regulation of methionine synthase by homocysteine and choline in Aspergillus nidulans.Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 517-524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, C. albicans carrying deletion of both the alleles encoding MS (met6/met6) cannot grow on media supplemented with exogenous methionine (3.Suliman H.S. Appling D.R. Robertus J.D. The gene for cobalamin-independent methionine synthase is essential in Candida albicans: a potential antifungal target.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 467: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Similarly, the met6 strain of C. neoformans grows at a slow rate in minimal media supplemented with methionine (4.Pascon R.C. Ganous T.M. Kingsbury J.M. Cox G.M. McCusker J.H. Cryptococcus neoformans methionine synthase: expression analysis and requirement for virulence.Microbiology. 2004; 150: 3013-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas the met6 strain of Fusarium graminearum is defective in aerial hyphal growth when cultured on methionine-supplemented media (11.Seong K. Hou Z. Tracy M. Kistler H.C. Xu J.R. Random insertional mutagenesis identifies genes associated with virulence in the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum.Phytopathology. 2005; 95: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the case of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, disruption of met26 encoding MS results in methionine as well as adenine auxotrophy due to homocysteine accumulation and defective purine biosynthesis (12.Fujita Y. Ukena E. Iefuji H. Giga-Hama Y. Takegawa K. Homocysteine accumulation causes a defect in purine biosynthesis: further characterization of Schizosaccharomyces pombe methionine auxotrophs.Microbiology. 2006; 152: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to its role in methionine biosynthesis, MS may have other unknown functions in certain yeast species. The genome of P. pastoris, a methylotrophic yeast, encodes a cobalamin-independent MS (PpMS), which shares 77 and 79% amino acid sequence identity with the MS of S. cerevisiae (ScMS) and CaMS, respectively (13.Huang L. Li D.Y. Wang S.X. Zhang S.M. Chen J.H. Wu X.F. Cloning and identification of methionine synthase gene from Pichia pastoris.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2005; 37: 371-378Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Here, we report that deletion of MET6 results in methionine as well as adenine auxotrophy in P. pastoris but only methionine auxotrophy in S. cerevisiae. MS is uniquely localized to the nucleus of P. pastoris and C. albicans, although it localizes to the cytosol in S. cerevisiae. Arg-742 and Asp-113 located in the C- and N-terminal regions of PpMS interact with each other and facilitate association between two monomers in a dimer-like configuration. Interaction between Arg-742 and Asp-113 is essential for the stability, catalytic activity, and nuclear localization of MS. Taken together, our results suggest that MS is present in the nucleus of respiratory yeasts such as P. pastoris and C. albicans, and it possesses unique biochemical properties that have not been reported in any other species. Our laboratory has been studying key transcription factors involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism in the respiratory yeast, P. pastoris (14.Kranthi B.V. Balasubramanian N. Rangarajan P.N.

While studying methionine metabolism, a methionine auxotroph (Ppmet6) was generated by replacing the coding region of MET6 encoding MS with a Zeocin expression cassette in the P. pastoris GS115 strain (Fig. 1, A and B). MS deficiency resulted in methionine auxotrophy, and Ppmet6 was unable to grow in a methionine-deficient medium, as expected (Fig. 1C). However, methionine supplementation did not restore the growth of Ppmet6 (Fig. 1D) under conditions in which it readily restored the growth of S. cerevisiae met6 strain (Scmet6) (Fig. 1, E and F). Of the various components tested, adenine when added to YNBD + methionine medium restored growth of Ppmet6 (Fig. 1, G and H) indicating that MS deficiency results in methionine as well as adenine auxotrophy in P. pastoris. To further characterize P. pastoris MS (PpMS),we first examined its subcellular localization. PpMS was expressed as a histidine-tagged protein in E. coli, purified, and injected into rabbits to generate anti-PpMS antibodies that reacted with a protein of ∼86 kDa in the cell lysates of GS115 but not Ppmet6 (Fig. 2, A and B). Immunofluorescence studies revealed that PpMS is present in the nucleus of P. pastoris cells cultured in YPD, YPG, or YPM media (Fig. 2C). To further validate these results, P. pastoris strain expressing chromosomally tagged PpMS-GFP (Pp-PpMSGFP) was constructed, and the localization of GFP fusion protein was visualized by direct examination of GFP fluorescence as well as immunofluorescence of DAPI-stained cells using anti-GFP and anti-PpMS antibodies. The results indicate that PpMSGFP localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 2, D and E). To further confirm nuclear localization of PpMS, P. pastoris GS115 strain was transformed with pGAP-PpMSMyc plasmid expressing c-Myc epitope-tagged PpMS (PpMSMyc) from the GAPDH promoter, and immunofluorescence studies were carried out with anti-c-Myc antibodies. The results indicate that PpMSMyc localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 2F). PpMSMyc expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting of whole-cell extracts using anti-c-Myc as well as anti-PpMS antibodies (Fig. 2G). Because nuclear localization of MS has not been reported in any species thus far and to study the generality of this phenomenon, MS localization was examined in C. albicans, another respiratory yeast, which also exhibits methionine as well as adenine auxotrophy when MET6 is deleted (3.Suliman H.S. Appling D.R. Robertus J.D. The gene for cobalamin-independent methionine synthase is essential in Candida albicans: a potential antifungal target.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 467: 218-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We confirmed that CaMS is immunoreactive to anti-PpMS antibodies by Western blotting (Fig. 2H). Immunofluorescence studies indicate that CaMS localizes to the nucleus in C. albicans as well (Fig. 2I). Because the S. cerevisiae met6 strain does not exhibit adenine auxotrophy, we examined MS localization in this yeast species. ScMS was expressed as a GFP fusion protein (ScMSGFP) in S. cerevisiae met6 strain to generate Sc-ScMSGFP strain. Direct visualization of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3A) as well as immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 3B) indicates that ScMSGFP is localized to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, when ScMSGFP was expressed in the Ppmet6 strain (Pp-ScMSGFP), it localized to the nucleus as evident from the direct visualization of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3C) and by immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 3D). When PpMSGFP was expressed in S. cerevisiae (Sc-PpMSGFP), it localized to the cytoplasm as evident from the direct visualization of GFP fluorescence (Fig. 3E) and by immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 3F). Differential subcellular localization of MS in P. pastoris and S. cerevisiae was further confirmed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3G). Western blot analysis revealed that PpMS is present in the cytoplasm as well as nuclear fractions of P. pastoris, although it is present only in the cytoplasm of S. cerevisiae (Fig. 3H). Taken together, these results indicate that ScMS is cytosolic in S. cerevisiae but nuclear in P. pastoris, and PpMS is nuclear in P. pastoris but cytoplasmic in S. cerevisiae. To understand the mechanism of nuclear localization of PpMS, we examined whether catalytic activity is required for its nuclear localization. In CaMS, the Asp-614 residue in the active site is essential for binding to homocysteine, and consequently, CaMSD612A mutant enzyme possesses only 2% of the native enzyme activity (22.Prasannan P. Suliman H.S. Robertus J.D. Kinetic analysis of site-directed mutants of methionine synthase from Candida albicans.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 382: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because this aspartate residue is conserved in PpMS (Fig. 4A), we introduced the D612A mutation into PpMSGFP. The Ppmet6 strain expressing PpMSD612AGFP was catalytically inactive as evident from its inability to grow in YNBD medium (Fig. 4B). Direct fluorescence as well as immunofluorescence using anti-GFP antibodies revealed that PpMSD612AGFP localizes to the nucleus (Fig. 4, C–E) indicating that catalytic activity is not required for nuclear localization of PpMS. Analysis of PpMS amino acid sequence using PSort II, PredictNLS, and NetNTS databases indicated that PpMS does not possess a canonical nuclear localization signal (NLS). To examine whether PpMS possesses a non-canonical NLS, we generated pGAPZA vectors encoding PpMSΔ99GFP in which 99 N-terminal amino acids of PpMS are deleted. PpMSΔ99GFP was localized to the nucleus (Fig. 4, C–E), indicating that the 99 N-terminal amino acids are not required for nuclear localization. To examine the role of C-terminal amino acids, we generated pGAPZA vector encoding the PpMSΔ661–768GFP mutant carrying a deletion of 107 C-terminal amino acids, and when expressed in the P. pastoris GS115 strain, it remained in the cytosol (Fig. 4, C–E). Thus, the C-terminal region is essential for nuclear localization of PpMS. Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) also known as S-adenosylmethionine synthetase. In mammalian cells, MATI/III was reported to be present in the nucleus, and basic amino acid residues in the C-terminal region of MATI/III are important for nuclear localization (23.Reytor E. Pérez-Miguelsanz J. Alvarez L. Pérez-Sala D. Pajares M.A. Conformational signals in the C-terminal domain of methionine adenosyltransferase I/III determine its nucleocytoplasmic distribution.FASEB J. 2009; 23: 3347-3360Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of PpMS also contains basic amino acid residues, many of which are conserved in ScMS as well as CaMS (Fig. 4F). To examine their role in nuclear localization, we substituted specific arginine/lysine residues present in the C-terminal region of PpMS by alanine. P. pastoris strains expressing PpMSK740AGFP, PpMSR742AGFP, PpMSK759AGFP, or PpMSR762AGFP were generated, and their expression was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 4G). Analysis of MS-GFP localization by fluorescence microscopy indicates that all the mutants localize to the nucleus except PpMSR742AGFP, which remained in the cytosol (Fig. 4H). Expression of PpMSR742AGFP in Ppmet6 did not result in the restoration of the growth of cells cultured in methionine- and adenine-deficient medium (Fig. 5, A and B). To understand the effect of R742A mutation on enzyme function, the same mutation was introduced into ScMS to generate ScMSR742AGFP. ScMSR742AGFP as well as PpMSR742AGFP were expressed in the Scmet6 strain, and their expression was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 5C). ScMSR742AGFP and PpMSR742AGFP failed to reverse the methionine auxotrophy of Scmet6 (Fig. 5, D and E) indicating that the R742A mutant is catalytically inactive. To examine the effect of extranuclear localization on enzyme stability and function, we generated Ppmet6 strains expressing PpMSGFP-NES and PpMSGFP-MAS in which a nuclear export signal (NES) or a membrane anchor signal was fused to the C terminus of PpMS, respectively (Fig. 6A). We also generated PpMSGFP-NLS, in which a nuclear localization signal was fused to the C terminus of PpMSGFP (Fig. 6A). As expected, PpMSGFP-NES and PpMSGFP-NLS were targeted to the cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively (Fig. 6B). Although PpMSGFP-MAS was targeted to the plasma membrane, nuclear localization was not completely abrogated (Fig. 6, B and C). Although expression of PpMSGFP-NLS and PpMSGFP-MAS was observed in almost all cells, expression of PpMSGFP-NES was restricted to a small subset of cells (Fig. 6B). Western blot analysis indicated that expression of PpMSGFP-NES was the lowest among the three proteins (Fig. 6D), and as a result, PpMSGFP-NES expression does not result in the reversal of methionine and adenine auxotrophy of Ppmet6. Pp-PpMSGFP-NES strain exhibited severe growth retardation even in medium containing methionine and adenine (Fig. 6, E and F). To understand the mechanism by which the R742A mutation affects enzyme function, structural modeling exercise was carried out to examine the role and significance of Arg-742 at the C-terminal end on the enzyme activity. BLAST search revealed that PpMS shares the highest similarity with CaMS (PDB codes 3PPC, 3PPF, and 3PPH) with a query coverage of 99%, e-value of ∼0, and amino acid sequence identity of 78% (Fig. 7A). 3PPC was used as the base template, and the short stretches of 8 and 6 residues that were missing in the N and C termini, respectively, were modeled based on corresponding regions in 3PPH (Fig. 7A). Superposition of all the structural templates revealed that the substrate-binding site for homocysteine, zinc ion, and the methyl donor have distinct pockets and are seen in between the N- and C-terminal barrel domains (6.Pejchal R.

Structure of Candida albicans methionine synthase determined by employing surface residue mutagenesis.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2011; 513: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In our structural model, Arg-742 is located at a distance of 8 Å from the nearest atom in the substrate-binding pocket and clearly far away from the substrate-binding pocket. Hence, it cannot have any direct effect on the binding of any of the substrates, nor can it be critically involved in stabilizing the pocket. Therefore, we focused our attention on the quaternary structure of cobalamin-independent MS of C. albicans (3PPC) and T. maritima (PDB code 1XPG). The biological assemblies obtained from the PDB database for these two proteins consisted of two subunits of the same polypeptide chain that form a “dimer-like” assembly. With this information, a corresponding dimer-like association was modeled for the PpMS as well, by superposing the whole-length polypeptide chain of our protein with the A and B chains of the structural templates as shown in Fig. 7B. A subsequent energy minimization of the interface of the dimer-like association was also carried out. It was observed that Arg-742 of one subunit makes extensive interactions, mainly hydrogen bonding and ionic in nature, with the residues of the other subunit. Of the many interactions, ionic interaction of Arg-742 with Asp-113 was identified, whose side chains were positioned appropriately for forming a salt bridge (Fig. 6, C and D, and supplemental Fig. 1). Apart from the Arg-742–Asp-113 salt bridge, hydrogen-bonding interactions of Thr-106–Ser-527, Gln-449–Lys-85, Ser-711–Lys-681, Arg-103–Glu-23, Glu-745–Lys-179, Glu-745–Arg-82, and Arg-748–Asp-180 could also be deciphered from the model. The full-length model of the protein in the PDB format is given as supplemental material. The extensive nature of interactions between the two subunits was suggestive of a biological association between the two subunits rather than as an artifact of crystallization. Thus, structural modeling indicated that Arg-742 could play an important role in the stabilization of a dimer-like assembly through an ionic interaction with Asp-113 of a neighboring subunit. To validate these in silico studies, detailed biochemical investigations were carried out. Because R742A mutation results in an inactive enzyme, we examined the effect of the D113R/D113A mutation on enzyme function. PpMSD113AGFP and PpMSD113RGFP were expressed in Scmet6 as well as Ppmet6 strains. Western blot analysis of multiple clones of each mutant indicated that PpMSD113AGFP and PpMSD113RGFP are expressed at lower levels than PpMSGFP (Fig. 8, A–C) suggesting that Asp-113 is essential for the stability of the protein. D113A mutation abrogates enzyme function as evident from the inability of PpMSD113AGFP/PpMSD113RGFP to restore the growth of Scmet6 and Ppmet6 in methionine-deficient media (Fig. 8, D and E"

Our approach was to focus first on identifying bioactive small molecules followed by chemical lead prioritization and target identification. Within this annotated library of bioactives, we identified a small molecule with activity against efflux-deficient Escherichia coli and other sensitized Gram-negatives. Further studies suggested that this compound inhibited DNA replication and selection for resistance identified mutations in a subunit of E. coli DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase. Our initial compound demonstrated weak inhibition of DNA gyrase activity while optimized compounds demonstrated significantly improved inhibition of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa DNA gyrase and caused cleaved complex stabilization, a hallmark of certain bactericidal DNA gyrase inhibitors. Amino acid substitutions conferring resistance to this new class of DNA gyrase inhibitors reside exclusively in the TOPRIM domain of GyrB and are not associated with resistance to the fluoroquinolones, suggesting a novel binding site for a gyrase inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2735924327,"Fluorescent proteins are now indispensable tools in molecular research. They have also been adapted for a wide variety of uses in cases involving creative applications, including textiles, aquarium fish, and ornamental plants. Our colleagues have previously cloned a yellow GFP-like protein derived from the marine copepod Chiridius poppei (YGFP), and moreover, succeeded in generating transgenic flowers with clearly visible fluorescence, without the need for high-sensitivity imaging equipment. However, due to the low Stokes shift of YGFP (10 nm), it is difficult to separate emitted light of a labeled object from the light used for excitation; hence, limitations for various applications remain. In this study, which was aimed at developing YGFP mutants with increased Stokes shifts, we conducted stepwise molecular evolution experiments on YGFP by screening random mutations at three key amino acids, based on their fluorescent characteristics and structural stabilities, followed by optimization of their fluorescence output by DNA shuffling of the entire coding sequence. We successfully identified an eYGFPuv that had an excitation maximum in UV wavelengths and a 24-fold increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the previously reported YGFP mutant (H52D). In addition, eYGFPuv exhibited almost 9-fold higher fluorescence intensity compared to the commercially available GFPuv when expressed in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells and without any differences in cytotoxicity. Thus, this novel mutant with the desirable characteristics of bright fluorescence, long Stokes shift, and low cytotoxity, may be particularly well suited to a variety of molecular and biological applications."

https://openalex.org/W2734482405,"Background Pulmonary embolism continues to be a significant cause of death. The aim was to derive and validate a risk prediction model for in-hospital death after acute pulmonary embolism to identify low risk patients suitable for outpatient management. Methods A confirmed acute pulmonary embolism database of 1,426 consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary-center (2000–2012) was analyzed, with odd and even years as derivation and validation cohorts respectively. Risk stratification for in-hospital death was performed using multivariable logistic-regression modelling. Models were compared using receiver-operating characteristic-curve and decision curve analyses. Results In-hospital mortality was 3.6% in the derivation cohort (n = 693). Adding day-1 sodium and bicarbonate to simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI) significantly increased the C-statistic for predicting in-hospital death (0.71 to 0.86, P = 0.001). The validation cohort yielded similar results (n = 733, C-statistic 0.85). The new model was associated with a net reclassification improvement of 0.613, and an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.067. The new model also increased the C-statistic for predicting 30-day mortality compared to sPESI alone (0.74 to 0.83, P = 0.002). Decision curve analysis demonstrated superior clinical benefit with the use of the new model to guide admission for pulmonary embolism, resulting in 43 fewer admissions per 100 presentations based on a risk threshold for admission of 2%. Conclusions A risk model incorporating sodium, bicarbonate, and the sPESI provides accurate risk prediction of acute in-hospital mortality after pulmonary embolism. Our novel model identifies patients with pulmonary embolism who are at low risk and who may be suitable for outpatient management."

By tracking the ratings given to the rewarded objects, we present a method to identify the user perceptibility, which is defined as the capability that a user can identify these objects at their early lifespan. Moreover, we investigate the behavior patterns of the perceptive users from three dimensions: User activity, correlation characteristics of user rating series and user reputation. The experimental results for the empirical networks indicate that high perceptibility users show significantly different behavior patterns with the others: Having larger degree, stronger correlation of rating series and higher reputation. Furthermore, in view of the hysteresis in finding the rewarded objects, we present a general framework for identifying the high perceptibility users based on user behavior patterns. The experimental results show that this work is helpful for deeply understanding the collective behavior patterns for online users."

Therefore, they need different radiotherapy treatment plans and thus have different needs for medical resources. This research aims to explore the best method of scheduling the admission of patients receiving radiotherapy so as to reduce patient loss and maximize the usage efficiency of service resources. Materials and methods A mix integer programming (MIP) model integrated with special features of radiotherapy is constructed. The data used here is based on the historical data collected and we propose an exact method to solve the MIP model. Results Compared with the traditional First Come First Served (FCFS) method, the new method has boosted patient admission as well as the usage of linear accelerators (LINAC) and beds. Conclusions The integer programming model can be used to describe the complex problem of scheduling radio-receiving patients, to identify the bottleneck resources that hinder patient admission, and to obtain the optimal LINAC-bed radio under the current data conditions. Different management strategies can be implemented by adjusting the settings of the MIP model. The computational results can serve as a reference for the policy-makers in decision making."
