https://openalex.org/W1984584567,"We have developed a method to separate metallic from semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes from suspension using alternating current dielectrophoresis. Our method takes advantage of the difference of the relative dielectric constants of the two species with respect to the solvent, resulting in an opposite movement of metallic and semiconducting tubes along the electric field gradient. Metallic tubes are attracted toward a microelectrode array, leaving semiconducting tubes in the solvent. Proof of the effectiveness of separation is given by a comparative Raman spectroscopy study on the dielectrophoretically deposited tubes and on a reference sample."
https://openalex.org/W2105050095,"Although mice lacking rod and cone photoreceptors are blind, they retain many eye-mediated responses to light, possibly through photosensitive retinal ganglion cells. These cells express melanopsin, a photopigment that confers this photosensitivity. Mice lacking melanopsin still retain nonvisual photoreception, suggesting that rods and cones could operate in this capacity. We observed that mice with both outer-retinal degeneration and a deficiency in melanopsin exhibited complete loss of photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator, pupillary light responses, photic suppression of arylalkylamine- N -acetyltransferase transcript, and acute suppression of locomotor activity by light. This indicates the importance of both nonvisual and classical visual photoreceptor systems for nonvisual photic responses in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2115806010,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that activates a cell-surface signaling assembly composed of IL-6, the IL-6 α-receptor (IL-6Rα), and the shared signaling receptor gp130. The 3.65 angstrom–resolution structure of the extracellular signaling complex reveals a hexameric, interlocking assembly mediated by a total of 10symmetry-related, thermodynamically coupled interfaces. Assembly of the hexameric complex occurs sequentially: IL-6 is first engaged by IL-6Rα and then presented to gp130in the proper geometry to facilitate a cooperative transition into the high-affinity, signaling-competent hexamer. The quaternary structures of other IL-6/IL-12 family signaling complexes are likely constructed by means of a similar topological blueprint."
https://openalex.org/W2004507292,"Deep tropical lakes are excellent climate monitors because annual mixing is shallow and flushing rates are low, allowing heat to accumulate during climatic warming. We describe effects of warming on Lake Tanganyika: A sharpened density gradient has slowed vertical mixing and reduced primary production. Increased warming rates during the coming century may continue to slow mixing and further reduce productivity in Lake Tanganyika and other deep tropical lakes."
https://openalex.org/W2121266814,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) activates cells by binding to the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) and subsequent formation of a glycoprotein 130 homodimer. Cells that express glycoprotein 130, but not the IL-6R, can be activated by IL-6 and the soluble IL-6R which is generated by shedding from the cell surface or by alternative splicing. Here we show that cholesterol depletion of cells with methyl-β-cyclodextrin increases IL-6R shedding independent of protein kinase C activation and thus differs from phorbol ester-induced shedding. Contrary to cholesterol depletion, cholesterol enrichment did not increase IL-6R shedding. Shedding of the IL-6R because of cholesterol depletion is highly dependent on the metalloproteinase ADAM17 (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme), and the related ADAM10, which is identified here for the first time as an enzyme involved in constitutive and induced shedding of the human IL-6R. When combined with protein kinase C inhibition by staurosporine or rottlerin, breakdown of plasma membrane sphingomyelin or enrichment of the plasma membrane with ceramide also increased IL-6R shedding. The effect of cholesterol depletion was confirmed in human THP-1 and Hep3B cells and in primary human peripheral blood monocytes, which naturally express the IL-6R. For decades, high cholesterol levels have been considered harmful. This study indicates that low cholesterol levels may play a role in shedding of the membrane-bound IL-6R and thereby in the immunopathogenesis of human diseases.

Galle P.R. Rose-John S. Exp. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 1999; 8: 1327-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cellular responses to IL-6 are elicited by binding of IL-6 to the transmembrane IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) which is followed by recruitment of two gp130 molecules into an active, multisubunit receptor complex (2Grötzinger J. Kernebeck T. Kallen K.J. Rose-John S. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 803-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Homodimerization of gp130 triggers activation of several intracellular signaling pathways, which include the Janus kinase/STAT-, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways (3Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Neither IL-6 nor the IL-6R alone bind or activate gp130, which indicates that the heterodimeric complex IL-6·IL-6R constitutes the “active cytokine,” similar to the p35 and p40 subunits of interleukin-12 and interleukin-23, respectively (4Gearing D.P. Cosman D. Cell. 1991; 66: 9-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Oppmann B. Lesley R. Blom B. Timans J.C. Xu Y. Hunte B. Vega F. Yu N. Wang J. Singh K. Zonin F. Vaisberg E.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2230) Google Scholar). Importantly, the IL-6R is not involved in signal transduction. A soluble form of the IL-6R (sIL-6R) is able to bind IL-6, and the complex of IL-6 and the sIL-6R activates target cells expressing gp130 in a process termed “trans-signaling” (6Rose-John S. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The IL-6·sIL-6R complex may therefore either potentiate the IL-6 activity on cells expressing the transmembrane IL-6R or substantially widen the array of potential IL-6 targets to cells devoid of the transmembrane IL-6R, because all body cells express gp130 (7Peters M. Müller A.M. Rose John S. Blood. 1998; 92: 3495-3504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that the pathophysiological effects of IL-6 may depend strongly on a soluble form of the receptor (8Atreya R. Mudter J. Finotto S. Müllberg J. Jostock T. Wirtz S. Schütz M. Bartsch B. Holtmann M. Becker C. Strand D. Czaja J. Schlaak J.F. Lehr H.A. Autschbach F. Schürmann G. Nishimoto N. Yoshizaki K. Ito H. Kishimoto T. Galle P.R. Rose-John S. Neurath M.F.

The soluble form of the IL-6 receptor is generated either by alternative splicing (11Horiuchi S. Koyanagi Y. Zhou Y. Miyamoto H. Tanaka Y. Waki M. Matsumoto A. Yamamoto M. Yamamoto N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or by proteolytic release of the ectodomain of the membrane-bound IL-6R (12Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Gunther M. Graeve L. Buse G. Mackiewicz A. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Shedding is also observed for a variety of other transmembrane proteins, comprising growth factors and their receptors, membrane-bound chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules (13Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Phorbol esters trigger shedding of the IL-6R and other proteins, implicating protein kinase C (PKC) in the process (14Müllberg J. Schooltink H. Stoyan T. Heinrich P.C. Rose-John S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 794-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In human multiple myeloma, the isoenzymes PKCδ and PKCη regulate shedding of the IL-6R (15Thabard W. Collette M. Bataille R. Amiot M. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inhibition of cleavage of the human IL-6R and the p60 TNFα receptor from the cell surface by hydroxamic acid-based inhibitors indicated that one or more metalloproteinases are involved in ectodomain shedding (16Müllberg J. Durie F.H. Otten Evans C. Alderson M.R. Rose-John S. Cosman D. Black R.A. Mohler K.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5198-5205PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα-Converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM17) belongs to the adamalysin (ADAM, adisintegrin and metalloproteinase domain) family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases, which also includes ADAM10. Elimination of the TACE gene was perinatally lethal for most homozygous knock-out mice, although some mice survived for several weeks (17Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P.

In TACE-/- cells, ectodomain shedding of the structurally unrelated proteins transforming growth factor-α (a type I transmembrane protein) and L-selectin was largely reduced in addition to that of TNFα (a type II transmembrane protein) (18Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J.

Since the initial report, a variety of proteins has been identified as substrates for TACE including fractalkine (19Garton K.J. Gough P.J. Blobel C.P. Murphy G. Greaves D.R. Dempsey P.J. Raines E.W.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). TACE is also capable of activation-induced autocleavage (27Schlondorff J. Becherer J.D. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Although cleavage sites for TACE have been identified in individual proteins (17Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 4958-4968PubMed Google Scholar), there is no apparent similarity. Furthermore, transfer of the cleavage site from one protein to another may either result in spontaneous or largely diminished shedding (26Althoff K. Reddy P. Voltz N. Rose-John S. Müllberg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2624-2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 29Althoff K. Müllberg J. Aasland D. Voltz N. Kallen K.-J. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), so that elements apart from the amino acid sequence of a protein appear to be involved in regulation of ectodomain shedding. Shedding of the IL-6R is also evoked by several bacterial metalloproteinases, bacterial pore-forming toxins, and importantly, by C-reactive protein (30Jones S.A. Horiuchi S. Topley N. Yamamoto N. Fuller G.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). IL-6 and the sIL6R activate STAT3 and the expression of acute phase proteins including C-reactive protein in human liver cells, whereas on human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), IL-6 and sIL6R activate STAT3, up-regulate gp130 and LIFR, and stimulate secretion of IL-6 and MCP-1 (31Romano M. Sironi M. Toniatti C. Polentarutti N. Fruscella P. Ghezzi P. Faggioni R. Luini W. van Hinsbergh V. Sozzani S. Bussolino F. Poli V. Ciliberto G. Mantovani A.

This results in an autocrine activation loop and results in proliferation of VSMC, a key event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and contributes to the immigration of inflammatory cells stimulated via MCP-1 (32Klouche M. Bhakdi S. Hemmes M. Rose-John S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4583-4589PubMed Google Scholar). The mitogenic effect of IL-6 and the sIL-6R on VSMC is particularly interesting, because recent evidence stresses the inflammatory component in the genesis of atherosclerosis in addition to known risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia (33Shoenfeld Y. Sherer Y. Harats D. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 293-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Secondary prevention studies with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have exemplified the clinical importance of cholesterol reduction in cardiovascular disease (34Group H.P.S.C. Lancet. 2002; 360: 7-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7581) Google Scholar), but HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors also exert direct anti-inflammatory effects (35Sparrow C.P. Burton C.A.

Recently, it was shown that cholesterol lowering in cells because of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition or methyl-β-cyclodextrin (mβCD) treatment had a stimulating effect on the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) presumably by increasing the α-secretase activity of ADAM10 (37Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W. Fahrenholz F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5815-5820Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). α-Cleavage of APP prevents generation of amyloidogenic APP products by β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme and γ-secretases (38Nunan J.

Other authors have shown that sphingomyelin depletion in the plasma membrane causes shedding of L-selectin (45Walev I. Tappe D. Gulbins E. Bhakdi S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar), which is a substrate for TACE (18Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). Sphingomyelin has a higher affinity toward cholesterol than other phospholipids, and sphingolipids and cholesterol are enriched in lipid rafts (46Simons K. Ehehalt R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Because the results presented above suggested an effect of the lipid phase on the activity of ADAM metalloproteinases in the shedding of plasma membrane proteins, we endeavored to ascertain the effect of lipid phase alterations on the shedding of the human IL-6R. Reagents—The metalloprotease inhibitor TAPI was kindly donated by Dr. R. Black (Amgen, Seattle, WA). Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, PMA, staurosporine, Nonidet P-40, mβCD, phorbol dibutyrate (PBt2), C16- and C18-ceramide, 2-hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin, nystatin, filipin, BSA (fatty acid-free), cholesterol, sphingomyelinase (derived from Staphylococcus aureus), lipid standards, polylysine, actinomycin D, cycloheximide, bisindolylmaleimide I, and rottlerin were purchased from Sigma. Complete protease inhibitor tablets (aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) were purchased from Roche Diagnostics, Tran35S-label (44 TBq/mmol) was from ICN (Meckenheim, Germany). The murine monoclonal antibody 6276 (anti-β-actin) was bought from Abcam (Cambridge, UK); the polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-phospho-STAT3 (Tyr-705) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, CA); horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies were obtained from Pierce. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were obtained from ATTC (Manassas, VA). TACE-/- and TACE-/-/+ mouse ear fibroblasts have been described previously (17Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J.

All cells were grown in DMEM or RPMI 1640 (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria), supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum. Peripheral blood samples were freshly collected into EDTA (5 mm) containing tubes for isolation of human blood monocytes. The monocytes were adjusted to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, seeded into culture dishes, and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 5 × 10-5m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% human AB serum (Sigma). In all lipid depletion experiments, fatty acid free-BSA (10 μg/ml) was substituted for fetal calf or human AB serum. Alterations of the Cellular Cholesterol and Sphingomyelin Content—Cells undergoing cholesterol depletion were washed with PBS and then treated with mβCD (20 mm), nystatin (240 units/ml), or 2-hydroxylpropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2-OH-P-β-CD; 20 mm) for 90 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. All depletion agents were diluted in DMEM or RPMI 1640 containing fatty acid-free BSA (10 mg/ml). Cholesterol enrichment was conducted as described previously (37Kojro E. Gimpl G. Lammich S. Marz W.

Plasma membrane sphingomyelin was digested by exogenous sphingomyelinase (SMase) from S. aureus (Sigma) (48Kallen K.-J. Quinn P. Allan D. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Filipin Staining—Cells were grown on polylysine-coated coverslips, rinsed with PBS, and fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde (Fluka, Taufkirchen, Germany) on ice for 15 min. Cells were then rinsed three times with PBS and treated with 50 μg/ml filipin for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were again rinsed thoroughly and mounted in slow Fade Anti-Fade (Molecular Probes, MoBiTec, Göttingen, Germany) and examined using a UV filter. Lipid Analysis—Cellular lipid composition was determined using methods described previously (48Kallen K.-J. Quinn P. Allan D. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lipids were observed using charring densitometry. Briefly, TLC plates (Merck) were dried for 10 min at 180 °C, allowed to cool, and then exposed to a solution of 10% copper sulfate in 8% aqueous phosphoric acid. The plates were then dried for 2 min at 110 °C and charred at 175 °C for 10 min or until lipid bands became visible. After scanning the TLC plates, lipids were quantified using the ImageQuant program. Transient Transfections, Metabolic Labeling, and Immunoprecipitation of Cell Surface Proteins—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the expression vector pCDM8-IL-6R (12Müllberg J.

One day after transfection, cells were trypsinized, pooled, and reseeded onto 10-cm cell culture dishes to ensure equal transfection efficiency for all plates. ADAM10-/- and ADAM17-/- cells were transiently transfected with the pCDM8-IL-6R, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Transfection efficiencies on average were 80-90% for COS-7 cells and 20% for ADAM10-/- and ADAM17-/- cells. For pulse-chase experiments, transfected cells (48 h post-transfection) were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free DMEM at 37 °C for 30 min. The cellular proteins were then radioactively labeled with 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label in methionine/cysteine-free medium for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were chased with DMEM containing methionine/cysteine. Cells were then incubated with or without compounds as indicated in the figure legends. Immunoprecipitation of the IL-6R in supernatants and cell lysates followed by autoradiography was performed as described before (51Vollmer P. Oppmann B. Voltz N. Fischer M. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for Differentially Spliced IL-6R mRNA—Total RNA was extracted from cells by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with oligo(dT) primers (0.1 μg/ml, Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and then treated with RNase B (10 units, Stratagene) at 37 °C for 1 h. cDNA was amplified in a Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene) using 1 unit of Taq polymerase (MBI Fermentas, St. Leon, Germany) in a 50-μl reaction containing 2 mm MgCl2,5 μl of 10× buffer with (NH4)2SO4 and 10 mm dNTPs. PCR conditions and primers were as stated in Horiuchi et al. (11Horiuchi S. Koyanagi Y. Zhou Y. Miyamoto H. Tanaka Y. Waki M. Matsumoto A. Yamamoto M. Yamamoto N. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Soluble IL-6R ELISA—The levels of soluble IL-6R in culture media were determined as described before (9Hurst S.M.

Briefly, 960-well ELISA plates (Microlon, Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with the monoclonal anti-sIL-6R 227 antibody (R & D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany). After blocking, samples and standards (rhIL-6sR; R & D Systems) were added as a dilution in PBS and 1% BSA. The plates were washed, and the biotinylated polyclonal anti-sIL-6R BAF-227 antibody was added, followed by streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution) for 1 h. BM Blue peroxidase (Roche Diagnostics) was added as substrate and incubated in the dark for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 1.8 m sulfuric acid (50 μl/well). Absorbance values were measured at 450 nm. Cholesterol Depletion and Cytokine Stimulation of Hep3B Cells—Hep3B cells were grown to 70-80% confluency in 10-cm dishes after which cells were trypsinized and seeded into 24-well culture plates (TPP, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). After adherence, cells were washed twice with PBS and starved in serum-free medium. On the following day, serum-free medium was added. After 4 h, cells underwent the following treatments: (i) DMEM containing fatty acid-free BSA with or without 12.5 mm mβCD for 15 min or (ii) DMEM containing fatty acid-free BSA with or without 20 mm mβCD for 90 min. After treatment, supernatants were collected and subjected to sIL-6R ELISA measurements. Medium with or without cytokines (IL-6, 50 ng/ml, or oncostatin M, 50 ng/ml) was added for 10 min. Medium was removed; cells were washed once with PBS, and cells were lysed directly in 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were incubated with the anti-phospho-STAT3 antibody (Cell Signaling, Schwalbach, Germany) before being labeled with a secondary antibody coupled to peroxidase. Subsequently, the membranes were developed using the Amersham Biosciences ECL PLUS chemiluminescence kit. Loading was controlled by a Western blot against β-actin. In other Western blotting experiments, anti-ADAM10 (B 42.1; 1 in 1000), anti-ADAM9 (5 μg/ml; Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany), anti-ADAM17 (M220; 0.1 μg/ml), anti-hemagglutinin (0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany), or anti-PC-tag (HPC4, 0.8 μg/ml; Roche Diagnostics) were used as primary antibodies. The M220 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. R. Black (52Doedens J.R. Black R.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2116885714,"Deletion of Phe-508 (ΔF508) is the most common mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) causing cystic fibrosis. ΔF508-CFTR has defects in both channel gating and endoplasmic reticulum-to-plasma membrane processing. We identified six novel classes of high affinity potentiators of defective ΔF508-CFTR Cl– channel gating by screening 100,000 diverse small molecules. Compounds were added 15 min prior to assay of iodide uptake in epithelial cells co-expressing ΔF508-CFTR and a high sensitivity halide indicator (YFP-H148Q/I152L) in which ΔF508-CFTR was targeted to the plasma membrane by culture at 27 °C for 24 h. Thirty-two compounds with submicromolar activating potency were identified; most had tetrahydrobenzothiophene, benzofuran, pyramidinetrione, dihydropyridine, and anthraquinone core structures (360–480 daltons). Further screening of >1000 structural analogs revealed tetrahydrobenzothiophenes that activated ΔF508-CFTR Cl– conductance reversibly with Kd < 100 nm. Single-cell voltage clamp analysis showed characteristic CFTR currents after ΔF508-CFTR activation. Activation required low concentrations of a cAMP agonist, thus mimicking the normal physiological response. A Bayesian computational model was developed using tetrahydrobenzothiophene structure-activity data, yielding insight into the physical character and structural features of active and inactive potentiators and successfully predicting the activity of structural analogs. Efficient potentiation of defective ΔF508-CFTR gating was also demonstrated in human bronchial epithelial cells from a ΔF508 cystic fibrosis subject after 27 °C temperature rescue.

CF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, a cAMP-activated Cl– channel expressed in airway, intestinal, pancreatic, and other secretory and absorptive epithelia. The principal clinical problem in CF is recurrent lung infections that result in progressive deterioration in lung function. The most common CFTR mutation, deletion of Phe-508 (ΔF508-CFTR), is present in at least one allele in ∼90% of CF patients (1Bobadilla J. Macek M. Fine J.P. Farrell P.M. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 575-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). The ΔF508 mutation causes two distinct defects in CFTR that produce Cl–-impermeable cells: (i) retention at the endoplasmic reticulum caused by misfolding and/or defective interactions with molecular chaperones (2Denning G.M.

Benharouga M. Hu W. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8942-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A sustained increase in intracellular calcium concentration by thapsigargin also corrects defective ΔF508-CFTR processing (10Egan M.E. Glockner-Pagel J. Ambrose C. Cahill P.A. Pappoe L. Balamuth N. Cho E. Canny S. Wagner C.A. Geibel J. Caplan M.J. Nature Med. 2002; 8: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), possibly by interfering with interactions with molecular chaperones. Compounds like phenylbutryate facilitate ΔF508-CFTR cellular processing by altering chaperone function and/or transcriptional enhancement (11Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C259-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kang H.L. Benzer S. Min K.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 838-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar).ΔF508-CFTR has significantly impaired channel activity (“gating defect”) even when present at the cell plasma membrane (4Dalemans W. Barbry P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1991; 354: 526-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Cell-attached patch clamp measurements showed reduced ΔF508-CFTR open channel probability and prolonged closed times even with maximal cAMP stimulation (5Haws C.M. Nepomuceno I.B. Krouse M.E.

Vetrivel L. Yang H. Pedemonte N. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37235-37241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although more than a dozen classes of compounds were identified with submicromolar activating potency, most activators of wild-type CFTR did not activate ΔF508-CFTR, even after targeting to the cell surface and stimulation by high concentrations of cAMP agonists. Only two of the most potent activators of wild-type CFTR had near micromolar potency for ΔF508-CFTR activation. Given the apparent and quite different requirements for activation of wild-type versus ΔF508-CFTR, we postulated that there may exist novel classes of high affinity ΔF508-CFTR activators.The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize compounds (termed “potentiators”) that correct defective ΔF508-CFTR gating. A stably transfected epithelial cell line co-expressing ΔF508-CFTR and a green fluorescent protein mutant with ultra-high halide sensitivity (YFP-H148Q/I152L, Ref. 16Galietta L.J.V. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) was generated in which growth of cells at low temperature (27 °C) for 24 h gave consistent ΔF508-CFTR expression at the plasma membrane. A collection of 100,000 diverse drug-like small molecules was screened for activation of halide transport in these cells. We identified >30 compounds that corrected defective ΔF508-CFTR Cl– channel gating with submicromolar affinity, with most compounds belonging to six distinct chemical classes that are structurally unrelated to known CFTR activators or inhibitors. Tetrahydrobenzothiophenes with ΔF508-CFTR-activating potencies down to 60 nm were identified and characterized. The compounds were shown to correct defective ΔF508-CFTR gating in low temperature-rescued human bronchial cells from a ΔF508 CF patient. Also, the hypothesis was tested that the ΔF508-CFTR potentiators could correct ΔF508-CFTR misprocessing and retention at the endoplasmic reticulum.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—Clonal populations of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) epithelial cells stably co-expressing human ΔF508-CFTR and the high sensitivity halide-sensing green fluorescent analog YFP-H148Q/I152L (16Galietta L.J.V. Haggie P.M. Verkman A.S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 499: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) were generated by liposome transfection and limiting dilution with Zeocin/G418 selection. More than 100 clones were evaluated for high fluorescence and ΔF508-CFTR plasma membrane targeting after growth at 27 °C for 24 h. For screening, cells were cultured on plastic in Coon's modified F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and plated on black 96-well microplates (Corning-Costar 3904) at 30,000 cells/well. For short-circuit measurements, cells were cultured on Snapwell permeable supports (Corning-Costar) at 500,000 cells/insert. Human bronchial epithelial cells homozygous for the ΔF508-CFTR mutation were cultured on Snapwell inserts and allowed to differentiate in a hormone-supplemented medium, as described previously (17Galietta L.J.V. Musante L. Romio L. Caruso U. Fantasia A. Gazzolo A. Romano L. Sacco O. Rossi G.A. Varesio L. Zegarra-Moran O. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L917-L923PubMed Google Scholar). Some measurements were done with stably transfected FRT cells expressing YFP-H148Q and wild-type or G551D-CFTR (18Galietta L.J.V. Springsteel M.F. Eda M. Niedzinski E.J. By K. Haddadin M.J. Kurth M.J. Nantz M.H. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Patch clamp experiments were done on ΔF508-CFTR-expressing FRT cells plated on 35-mm Petri dishes.Compounds—A collection of 100,000 diverse drug-like compounds (molecular sizes = 350–550 daltons, ChemBridge Co.) was used for initial screening. For optimization, >1000 analogs of activators identified in the primary screen were purchased from ChemBridge or Chem-Div (of ∼600,000 available compounds) or synthesized and purified. Compounds were prepared as 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO. Secondary plates containing one or four compounds/well were prepared for screening (0.25 mm in Me2SO). Compounds for secondary analysis were purified and confirmed by NMR and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.Synthesis of Tetrahydrobenzothiophenes—Compounds with different R1 substituents (see Fig. 3A) were synthesized by first preparing the 2-aminotetrahydrobenzo[b]thiophene derivative by reaction of cyclohexanone and sulfur with 2-cyanoacetamide in the presence of diethylamine (19Gewald K. Schinke E. Bottcher H. Chem. Ber. 1996; 99: 94-100Crossref Scopus (808) Google Scholar). The product in pyridine was reacted with 2-chlorobenzoylchloride in benzene, extracted in benzene, and recrystallized in ethyl acetate-hexane (yield 70–80%). Compound structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry.Screening Procedures—Screening was carried out using a Beckman integrated system containing a 3-meter robotic arm, CO2 incubator containing microplate carousel, plate washer, liquid handling work station, bar code reader, delidding station, plate sealer, and two FLU-Ostar fluorescence plate readers (Galaxy, BMG Lab Technologies), each equipped with dual syringe pumps and HQ500/20X (500 ± 10 nm) excitation and HQ535/30M (535 ± 15 nm) emission filters (Chroma) (details in Ref. 15Ma T. Vetrivel L. Yang H. Pedemonte N. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37235-37241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Software was written in Visual Basic for Applications version 6.3 to compute baseline-subtracted fluorescence slopes (giving halide influx rates).For assay of ΔF508-CFTR potentiator activity, the incubator (27 °C, 90% humidity, 5% CO2/95% air) was loaded with 40–60 96-well plates containing FRT cells. After an 18- to 24-h incubation, plates were washed three times with PBS (300 μl/wash), leaving 50 μl of PBS. 10 μl of PBS containing 120 μm forskolin was added, and after 5 min, test compounds (0.6 μl of 0.25 mm Me2SO solution) were added to each well to give final compound concentrations of 2.5 μm. After 15 min, 96-well plates were transferred to a plate reader for fluorescence assay. Each well was assayed individually for I– influx by recording fluorescence continuously (200 ms/point) for 2 s (baseline) and then for 12 s after the rapid (<1 s) addition of 160 μl of isomolar PBS in which 137 mm Cl– was replaced by I–. I– influx rates were computed from initial fluorescence versus time-curve slopes (determined by 3rd order polynomial regression) after normalization for total fluorescence (background-subtracted initial fluorescence).Assays of cAMP and Phosphatase Activity—cAMP activity was measured with the BIOTRAK enzymatic immunoassay (Amersham Biosciences) on FRT cell lysates after incubation with activators for 10 min without or with 0.5 μm forskolin. Phosphatase activity was determined on cell homogenates by using a nonradioactive assay kit (Promega), as described previously (18Galietta L.J.V. Springsteel M.F. Eda M. Niedzinski E.J. By K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19723-19728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).Short-circuit Current Measurements—Ussing chamber experiments were performed 7–9 days after plating ΔF508-CFTR-expressing FRT cells on Snapwell inserts. The basolateral solution contained (in mm): 130 NaCl, 2.7 KCl, 1.5 KH2PO4, 1 CaCl2, 0.5 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 Na-Hepes (pH 7.3). In the apical bathing solution, 65 mm NaCl was replaced by sodium gluconate, and CaCl2 was increased to 2 mm. Solutions were bubbled with air and maintained at 37 °C. The basolateral membrane was permeabilized with 250 μg/ml amphotericin B. For human bronchial epithelial cells, apical and basolateral chambers contained 126 mm NaCl, 0.38 mm KH2PO4, 2.1 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 24 mm NaHCO3, and 10 mm glucose (basolateral membrane not permeabilized). The hemichambers were connected to a DVC-1000 voltage clamp (World Precision Instruments) by means of Ag/AgCl electrodes and 1 m KCl agar bridges for recording short-circuit current.Whole-cell Patch Clamp—Cells were seeded at a density of 104 cells/well and used 2–4 days after plating. Borosilicate glass pipettes were fire-polished to obtain tip resistances of 2–4 megaohms. Currents were sampled at 500 Hz using a patch clamp amplifier (EPC-7, List, Darmstadt) and low pass filtered using a 4-pole Bessel filter set at a cutoff frequency of 250 Hz. The extracellular (bath) solution contained (in mm): 150 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 10 mannitol, and 10 TES, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained (in mm): 120 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 10 TEA-Cl, 0.5 EGTA, 1 Mg ATP, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.3). Membrane conductances were monitored by alternating the membrane potential between –80 and –100 mV. Current-voltage relationships were generated by applying voltage pulses between –100 and –100 mV in 20-mV steps.Analysis of ΔF508-CFTR Misprocessing—Cells were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm ΔF508-CFTR potentiators. For functional studies, the plate reader assay was carried out 15 min after washing potentiators and adding forskolin (20 μm) and the potentiator ΔF508act-02 (2 μm). For biochemical analysis of ΔF508-CFTR glycosylation, baby hamster kidney cells expressing ΔF508-CFTR-HA (hemagglutinin-tagged, Ref. 9Sharma M. Benharouga M. Hu W. Lukacs G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8942-8950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) were incubated with test compounds (10 μm) for 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with an anti-CFTR antibody mixture (M3A7 and L12B4 antibodies) or with anti-Na/K-ATPase antibody.Computational Analysis—Data manipulations, property calculations, and model building were performed with Pipeline Pilot (Scitegic, Inc.). The data set for modeling consisted of 3025 tetrahydrobenzothiophenes containing 40 active compounds. The Bayesian learning model contained the following parameters: molecular weight, surface area, polar surface area, number of H-bond donors, number of H-bond acceptors, AlogP, and the functional class fingerprint of Scitegic with a diameter of 6 bonds (FCFP_6). The data set of 3025 tetrahydrobenzothiophenes was partitioned randomly into four sets of approximately equal size. The Bayesian learner was trained on three of the four data partitions to distinguish between active and inactive tetrahydrobenzothiophenes, producing four different models. Each Bayesian model reduced information from the inputted parameters into a single dimension, or “model score.” The Mann-Whitney test for nonparametric two-group comparisons was used to assess the likelihood that the distributions of model scores for active and inactive tetrahydrobenzothiophenes represent different populations. Favorable and unfavorable structural elements were extracted from the learning models using Pipeline Pilot's Learned Property Viewer component. A congeneric series for structure-activity analysis was generated by removing the R group from each active compound and using the resulting scaffold to perform a substructure search for inactive tetrahydrobenzothiophenes.RESULTSInvestigation of the plasma membrane ΔF508-CFTR gating defect and identification of potentiators required the development of cell lines and culture methods to reliably target ΔF508-CFTR to the plasma membrane. FRT cell clones were isolated that co-expressed human ΔF508-CFTR and a high sensitivity yellow fluorescent protein-based halide indicator. Cell lines were screened for ΔF508-CFTR plasma membrane function 18–36 h after growth at different temperatures and/or in the presence of agents reported previously to facilitate ΔF508-CFTR plasma membrane targeting (e.g. butyrate, glycerol, trimethylamine oxide). A cell clone was isolated that showed consistent ΔF508-CFTR plasma membrane targeting after 24 h of growth at 27 °C and had bright fluorescence, rapid growth on plastic support, and low basal halide leak. By short-circuit current analysis, strong ΔF508-CFTR Cl– currents were seen in transfected cells cultured at 27 °C but not at 37 °C (Fig. 1A). Notably, the plasma membrane-corrected ΔF508-CFTR had a significant gating defect, as seen from the submaximal activation by a high concentration of forskolin. Full activation required the addition of the known ΔF508-CFTR potentiator genistein. Other cell clones showed lower Cl– currents after 24 h of growth at 27 °C and no significant current when grown at 37 °C. To verify the gating defect in a native airway cell expressing ΔF508-CFTR, we were able to demonstrate consistent 27 °C rescue in human bronchial epithelial cells from a CF patient homozygous for the ΔF508-CFTR mutation (Fig. 1B). Full ΔF508-CFTR activation required genistein, as was found for the transfected cells, indicating the need for a potentiator after ΔF508-CFTR low temperature rescue.Fig. 1Low temperature correction of ΔF508-CFTR misprocessing in transfected FRT cells (A) and primary cultures of human bronchial epithelium from a homozygous CF patient (B). Transepithelial short-circuit current (Isc) was measured (at 37 °C) after a 24-h incubation at 37 °C (top) or 27 °C (bottom). Where indicated, forskolin (20 μm), CFTRinh-172 (10 μm), amiloride (100 μm), or indicated concentrations of genistein were added.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A high throughput screen was designed to identify ΔF508-CFTR potentiators. FRT cells were incubated at 27 °C for 24 h to permit ΔF508-CFTR plasma membrane targeting (Fig. 2A). After washing, forskolin (20 μm) and test compounds (2.5 μm) were added to individual wells of 96-well plates. A high concentration of forskolin was used to identify ΔF508-CFTR potentiators that may interact directly with ΔF508-CFTR rather than alter cAMP concentration. The I– influx assay was carried out ∼15 min later by measurement of the time course of decreasing YFP fluorescence after creation of an inwardly directed I– gradient.Fig. 2ΔF508-CFTR potentiators identified by high throughput screening. A, high throughput screening procedure. Cells co-expressing ΔF508-CFTR and the halide-sensitive fluorescent protein YFP-H148Q/I152L were grown for 24 h at 27 °C (to give plasma membrane ΔF508-CFTR expression). After washing, test compounds (2.5 μm) and forskolin (20 μm) were added, and I– influx was assayed at 37 °C from the time course of YFP-H148Q/I152L fluorescence after adding I– to the external solution. B, representative time courses of YFP-H148Q/I152L fluorescence in control wells (saline, negative control; 50 μm genistein, positive control) with examples of inactive and active test compounds.

D, concentration response data for selected ΔF508-CFTR activators.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2B (top curve) shows representative time course data from a control well (“saline”) in which slow I– influx was seen when forskolin was added without test compounds. Examples of inactive compounds are shown. Each plate also contained positive control wells in which a dose-response was done for genistein, a known (though low potency) ΔF508-CFTR potentiator. Rapid I– influx was found for some of the 100,000 test compounds (Fig. 2B, bottom curves). Fig. 2C summarizes the results of the primary screen. Although most compounds had no significant ΔF508-CFTR potentiating activity at 2.5 μm, there were 75 strong (I– influx > 0.1 mm/s) and 252 weaker potentiators.The strong potentiators were subjected to secondary analysis to select a subset for further analysis. None of the strong potentiators stimulated I– influx in the fluorescence assay using FRT-null cells (expressing YFP-H148Q/Y152L alone) or in ΔF508-CFTR-expressing cells in the absence of forskolin. The increased I– influx for each potentiator was blocked by the thiazolidinone CFTR inhibitor CFTRinh-172 (20Ma T. Thiagarajah J.R. Yang H. Sonawane N.D. Folli C. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Dose-response studies were done to determine Kd and V max, with representative data shown in Fig. 2D. Of the 75 strong potentiators with >0.1 mm/s I– influx in the primary screen (at 2.5 μm), there were 32 compounds with Kd < 1 μm and V max greater than that of the reference compound genistein (at 50 μm).Short-circuit current analysis was done on each of these compounds to confirm bona fide activation of ΔF508-CFTR Cl– currents. Experiments were done after basolateral membrane permeabilization and in the presence of a transepithelial Cl– gradient, so that short-circuit current represents apical membrane Cl– current. Representative data are shown in Fig. 3B. Thirteen compounds increased short-circuit current to levels comparable with that of maximal genistein but with Kd < 2 μm. None of the compounds activated short-circuit current in FRT-null cells or in ΔF508-CFTR-expressing FRT cells in the absence of forskolin. Most of the strong potentiators of ΔF508-CFTR Cl– conductance belonged to six distinct structural classes, with the chemical structures of the most potent compound of each class shown in Fig. 3A. A compound similar to class “03” potentiators was identified in our previous screening for activators of wild-type CFTR (15Ma T. Vetrivel L. Yang H. Pedemonte N. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J.V. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37235-37241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whereas the other compounds represent novel scaffolds. Interestingly, four of the compounds producing strong halide influx in the fluorescence assay did not produce Cl– currents by short-circuit current analysis (not shown), suggesting that they may induce electroneutral halide transport through ΔF508-CFTR.Whole-cell patch clamp was done to characterize the channels activated by ΔF508-CFTR potentiators. Fig. 3C (top) shows membrane currents after forskolin alone and then forskolin with genistein, demonstrating again the gating defect. After genistein washout, a ΔF508-CFTR potentiator gave similar membrane current. Current-voltage relationships generated in the presence of genistein or ΔF508 potentiators had the same linear ohmic behavior (Fig. 3C, bottom) as that found for activated wild-type CFTR. The currents showed no relaxation phenomena at positive or negative membrane potentials, thus providing evidence against the involvement of volume-sensitive or Ca2–-activated Cl– channels.The six ΔF508-CFTR potentiators shown in Fig. 3A were tested for activation of wild-type and G551D-CFTR in transfected FRT cells. None of the compounds gave measurable G551D-CFTR activation at 10 μm in the presence of 20 μm forskolin, whereas strong activation was found for the positive control (50 μm genistein –20 μm forskolin). All ΔF508-CFTR potentiators activated wild-type CFTR, but only in the presence of a low concentration of forskolin (50 nm), which did not itself activate CFTR. Kd values for activation of wild-type CFTR by ΔF508act-01 through ΔF508act-06 were (in μm): 0.18 ± 0.02, 1.3 ± 0.2, 2.2 ± 0.3, 0.02 ± 0.005, 0.06 ± 0.01, and 0.05 ± 0.01, respectively. These potencies are quite different from those for ΔF508-CFTR activation. For comparison, Kd values for the activation of ΔF508-CFTR by ΔF508act-01 through ΔF508act-06 from the fluorescence assay were (in μm): 1.3 ± 0.1, 0.18 ± 0.03, 0.70 ± 0.04, 0.87 ± 0.1, 0.10 ± 0.01, and 0.65 ± 0.08, respectively.A secondary library of >1000 compounds with structural similarity to each class of ΔF508-CFTR potentiators was screened to establish structure-activity relationships and to identify the best compounds for further analysis.

Although crystal structures of activated, near full-length, Stat1 and Stat3 illustrate how STATs bind to DNA, they provide little insight into the dynamic regulation of STAT activity. To explore the unique structural changes Stat1 and Stat3 undergo when they become activated, full-length inactive recombinant proteins were prepared. To our surprise, even though these proteins are unable to bind DNA, our studies demonstrate that they exist as stable homodimers. Similarly, the Stat1 and Stat3 found in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells also exhibit a dimeric structure.

This family consists of seven members, Stat1, Stat2, Stat3, Stat4, Stat5a, Stat5b, and Stat6. Structural and functional studies have led to the identification of six conserved STAT domains (3Chen X.

Gene (Amst.). 2002; 285: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar); 2) the coiled-coil domain (∼amino acids 125–325), which has been shown to mediate interactions with several other proteins (2Kisseleva T.

In this model, a specific interaction between a cytokine and its cognate receptor brings the cytoplasmic domains of this receptor into apposition, thereby promoting the transphosphorylation of receptor associated tyrosine kinases from the Janus kinase family. These activated Janus kinases in turn phosphorylate specific tyrosine motifs found in receptor endodomains, which then serve to mediate recruitment of the specific monomeric STATs to the receptor complex. Once at the receptor, the STATs become activated by a single tyrosine phosphorylation event. The activated STATs are then released, where upon they dimerize through the interaction between the SH2 domain of one STAT and the tyrosine-phosphorylated tail segment of the other STAT. This renders them competent for both rapid translocation into the nucleus and DNA binding. Both the ability to translocate into the nucleus and to bind DNA are attributed to dimerization. Although countless studies support this model (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E.

To learn more about the conformational changes regulating ligand dependent nuclear translocation, structural studies on unphosphorylated (i.e. inactive) Stat1 and Stat3 were undertaken. Unexpectedly, we found that these proteins purified as stable homodimers. Subsequent studies demonstrated that these inactive homodimers are also found in cells prior to ligand stimulation. These observations necessitate modification of the traditional STAT-signaling paradigm.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Cell ExtractsCell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. 3T3, 293T, SF9, and HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (3T3, HeLa, and 293T cells) or Grace's medium (SF9 cells), supplemented with either 10% fetal calf serum (3T3, 293T, SF9 cells) or calf serum (HeLa cells). To prepare extracts, cells were washed in cold (4 °C) phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 4 mm DTT, 0.8 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), adjusted to 150 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol, lysed by Dounce homogenization (25 strokes), and then cleared by centrifugation. For cross-linking studies the 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, was substituted with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4.Preparation of Recombinant Stat1 and Stat3Human Stat1- and murine Stat3-encoding baculoviruses (8Gupta S. Yan H. Wong L.H. Ralph S. Krolewski J. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1075-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18Collum R.G. Brutsaert S. Lee G. Schindler C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10120-10125Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were plaque-purified and then expressed in Sf9 cells (7.5 × 105 cells/ml) at a multiplicity of infection of 1–2. After 43 h, cells were harvested and lysed by Dounce homogenization (15 strokes) in ice-cold non-detergent “lysis buffer” (see above). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless noted otherwise. Stat1, precipitated from lysates with solid ammonium sulfate (25–35%; Sigma), was dissolved in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, 4 mm DTT, 0.8 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (Buffer A). After dialysis against 1 liter of Buffer A, the material was cleared (100,000 rpm, 30 min, 4 °C) and loaded onto an Uno-Q1 anion-exchange column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in Buffer A. Stat1 was eluted with a linear salt gradient (75–500 mm NaCl) and identified by immunoblotting (9Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 19Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Minor contaminating levels of phosphorylated Stat1, either detected with a phospho-specific Stat1 antibody (New England Biolabs) or an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (20Pine R. Canova A. Schindler C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 21Park C. Schindler C. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 15: 175-188Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were found to elute at higher salt concentrations and thus easily separated from unphosphorylated Stat1. The purity of the Stat1 containing fractions was assessed by Coomassie Blue staining (see Fig. 1) and mass spectroscopy. Yields from 1 liter of Sf9 cell culture were typically ∼1.5 mg for Stat1. Stat3 was purified through a similar procedure, except that it was precipitated in 0–25% ammonium sulfate fraction, and Buffer A was adjusted to 50 mm NaCl. One liter of Sf9 cell culture typically yielded ∼5 mg of Stat3.Prior to analytical ultracentrifugation, STAT samples (∼200 μl at 1–3 mg/ml) were fractionated by size-exclusion on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences; 22 °C), equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 4 mm DTT. Fractions containing Stat1 or Stat3 were pooled, concentrated to 1 mg/ml (Centricon 30,000 dalton molecular mass cutoff), and dialyzed overnight against equilibration buffer. The column was calibrated using thyreoglobulin (bovine, 670 kDa), γ-globulin (bovine, 158 kDa), ovalbumin (chicken, 44 kDa), myoglobin (horse, 17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa; Bio-Rad).The concentration of purified proteins was determined by UV spectroscopy at 280 nm (Amersham Biosciences). Molar extinction coefficients of 109,300 for Stat1 and 115,300 for Stat3 were calculated based on the number of tryptophans and tyrosines present in each sequence.Biochemical StudiesNative PAGE/Ferguson Plots—Molecular mass determination by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis was carried by a standard protocol that entails fractionation on 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9% native gels (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The migration of purified preparations of Stat1, Stat3, HeLa, and/or 293T cell extracts was evaluated by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting.Cross-linking—Cross-linking studies were performed with DSS (disuccinimidyl suberate; Pierce). Stat1 containing extracts were dialyzed into 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 4 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol and then treated with 1 or 5 mm DSS for 2 h (4 °C). The reaction was quenched through the addition of 80 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (20 min at room temperature).Sucrose Gradient Analysis—These sedimentation studies were performed on a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. 100 μl of HeLa whole cell extracts, prepared before or after treatment with IFN-α (2000 units/ml, 30 min), were loaded onto 2.2 ml of 10–40% sucrose gradients (22Tanese N. Methods. 1997; 12: 224-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These gradients were spun at 50,000 rpm for 16 h in a TLS55 rotor. ∼30 μl of fractions were collected and run on 10% SDS-PAGE for analysis. Proteins were either visualized with Coomassie Blue staining or by immunoblotting with Stat3 (C20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phosphospecific Stat3 (Cell Signaling Technology) antibodies.Sedimentation Equilibrium Studies—These studies were carried out in a Beckman/Coulter XLI analytical ultracentrifuge. For studies on solutions with higher protein concentrations, Stat1 and Stat3 were prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 4 mm DTT. Proteins at the specific concentrations of 0.75 mg/ml (8.2 mm for Stat1 and 8.7 mm for Stat3), 0.5 mg/ml (5.5 mm for Stat1 and 5.8 mm for Stat3), and 0.2 mg/ml (2.2 mm for Stat1 and 2.3 mm for Stat3) were loaded into a six-channel cell with sapphire windows. Water blanks, taken before and after the experiment, were subtracted from the interference data using the program WinReedit (23Kenney W.C. Haniu M. Herman A.C. Arakawa T. Costigan V.J. Lary J. Yphantis D.A. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12351-12359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loaded sample cells were spun in an AN-50Ti rotor at 8,000, 11,000, and 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. Scans were taken at 1-h intervals. Proteins were detected by absorbance when lower concentrations of protein were loaded and by Rayleigh interference optics when higher concentrations of proteins were loaded.For studies on solutions with lower protein concentrations, Stat1 and Stat3 were prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl. Proteins at concentrations of 0.05 and 0.02 mg/ml were loaded into a six-sector equilibrium cell (Beckman/Coulter) with quartz windows and evaluated as described above. Absorbance scans were acquired at 229 nm with 0.001-cm spacing and ten replicates per point. The program MATCH (41Yphantis D. MATCH program. National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center, Storrs, CT1999Google Scholar) was used to confirm that equilibrium had been attained, and data for individual channels were extracted and edited using REEDIT (42Lary J. REEDIT program.

The partial specific volume, v̄, and the solution density, ρ, were calculated using SEDNTERP, version 1.05 (43Hayes, D. T., Laue, T. M., and Philo, J. (2000) SEDNTERP program, version 1.05 (available at www.bbri.org/RASMB/rasmb.html)Google Scholar). For Stat1, v̄ was 0.7301 ml/g, and ρ was 1.00794 g/ml. For Stat3, v̄ was 0.7277 ml/g, and ρ was 1.00794 g/ml. Sedimentation Velocity Studies—These studies were also carried out in a Beckman/Coulter XLI analytical ultracentrifuge with Rayleigh interference optics. Stat1 and Stat3 were prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 4 mm DTT at a concentration of 1 mg/ml for Stat1 and 0.35 mg/ml for Stat3. 400 μl of sample was loaded into a double-sector cell and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm (20 °C). Interference scans were taken at intervals of 30 s for Stat1 and 20 s for Stat3. Best-fit profiles according to the continuous distribution c(S) Lamm equation model from SEDFIT (44Schuck, P.

The absence of contaminating tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, immunoblotting with Stat1 and Stat3 phospho-specific antibodies, and mass spectroscopy (data not shown). As a final step in purification, Stat1 and Stat3 were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. Unexpectedly, each protein eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular mass greater than the 158-kDa marker (i.e. γ-globulin; Fig. 1). Stat1 eluted with an apparent molecular mass of 176 kDa and Stat3 with an apparent molecular mass of 167 kDa. Of note, no or little monomer was detected at concentrations of 1–3 mg/ml (i.e. 11–33 μm). These observations suggested that purified preparations of unphosphorylated Stat1 and Stat3 associate to form homodimers. As expected, these preparations of Stat1 and Stat3 exhibited no DNA binding activity (9Schindler C. Shuai K. Prezioso V. Darnell J.E. Science. 1992; 257: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 25Zhang X. Blenis J. Li H.-C. Schindler C. Chen-Kiang S. Science. 1995; 267: 1990-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar).To further explore the oligomeric state of purified unphosphorylated Stat1 and Stat3, the proteins were studied by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Previous studies have determined that there is a direct relationship between the molecular mass of a protein (or complex) and its relative migration through a series of gels that vary in acrylamide concentration (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative migration of purified Stat1 and Stat3 was compared with that of several molecular mass standards in 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9% native polyacrylamide gels (see Fig. 2). Analysis of the relative migration of each protein through these gels yielded a linear series of retardation coefficients, which were directly proportional to molecular mass. These Ferguson plots indicated that purified unphosphorylated Stat1 migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 170 kDa and that Stat3 migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa. Although it was not apparent why the Stat1 results differed from a previously published study (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), they were quite consistent with the other biochemical approaches outlined in the current study.Fig. 2Molecular mass of Stat1 and Stat3 complexes evaluated by native PAGE. A, the relative migration (Rm (Rm)) of purified proteins in a series of native gels. Preparations of unphosphorylated recombinant Stat1, Stat3, and four molecular mass standards (Sigma) were simultaneously fractionated on a series of 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9% native polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Blue as indicated (ρ, Stat1; ○, Stat3; ♦, urease trimer (272 kDa); ▪, BSA dimer (132 kDa); ▴, BSA monomer (66 kDa); ×, chicken egg albumin (44 kDa)). The percent acrylamide concentration is plotted on the x axis and Rm , specifically 100[log(Rm × 100)], plotted on the y axis. The negative slope of each line represents the retardation coefficient. B, retardation coefficient correlates linearly with molecular mass. Retardation coefficients from A are plotted on the y axis versus known molecular masses on the x axis. The retardation coefficients for Stat1 and Stat3 are indicated and correlate with molecular masses of 170 and 160 kDa, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next, Stat1 and Stat3 were subjected to equilibrium sedimentation studies. Purified preparations of both unphosphorylated STATs were loaded at three concentrations and then spun to equilibrium at three different speeds (see Fig. 3). A global non-linear least squares fit of the nine data sets for Stat1 yielded a molecular mass of 182.5 kDa, which is within 5% of the expected size of a Stat1 dimer (i.e. 174.7 kDa, as calculated from the amino acid sequence; Table I). Analysis of the nine corresponding data sets for Stat3 yielded a molecular mass of 182.8 kDa, which differed less than 4% from the calculated molecular mass for the Stat3 homodimer (176.1 kDa; see Table I). Neither the data set for Stat1 nor the data set for Stat3 could be fit to a monomer equilibrium sedimentation model (with molecular mass fixed at 87.3 kDa for Stat1 and 88.1 kDa for Stat3). Both data sets were also poor fits to a monomer plus dimer equilibrium model. However, both data sets exhibited a good fit to a dimer-tetramer equilibrium model, where the dimer molecular mass was either fixed or fit as a separate variable (see Fig. 3). Of note, in both cases the data indicated that tetramers constituted only a minor fraction of the total protein pool and only at the highest protein concentrations. These observations indicate that both unphosphorylated Stat1 and Stat3 form stable homodimers. Moreover, since the lower limit for dissociation constants that can be measured by ultracentrifugation is in the low nanomolar range, and the monomer form was not detected, it is reasonable to assume the Kd of the dimer was low (i.e. less than 10 nm; see Table I).Fig. 3Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of purified recombinant Stat1 and Stat3.

Open table in a new tab The oligomeric states of Stat1 and Stat3 were also evaluated by sedimentation velocity studies. Sedimentation profiles obtained from purified preparations of Stat1 and Stat3 were evaluated by a continuous distribution c(S) Lamm equation model (see Fig. 4). When the sedimentation coefficient distribution was determined for Stat1, a single major peak at 6.27 S (s 20, w = 6.39 S) was revealed. This corresponded to a molecular mass of 192.5 kDa and was consistent with homodimer formation. Importantly, a peak corresponding to a lower molecular mass monomer species was not evident. However, a second small and faster sedimenting peak was seen. This peak may represent an aggregated species (5Vinkemeier U. Moarefi I. Darnell Jr., J.E. Kuriyan J. Science. 1998; 279: 1048-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The c(S) distribution for Stat3 also exhibited a single major peak at 6.55 S (s 20, w = 6.67 S). This corresponded to a molecular mass of 166.3 kDa and was again consistent with a homodimeric species. Similarly, no smaller species were detected, highlighting an absence of Stat3 monomers. Velocity sedimentation data were also exploited to crudely model the shape of the Stat1 and Stat3 dimers. Assuming a hydration coefficient of 0.403 g-water/g-protein and a prolate ellipsoid shape, a maximal axial ratio of 8.6 was determined for Stat1 and 8.0 for Stat3 from the S values. These values are consistent with a relatively elongated shape of 36.4 × 4.2 nm for Stat1, and 34.5 × 4.3 nm for Stat3. In summary, these observations provide compelling evidence that purified preparations of Stat1 and Stat3 exist as stable homodimers and that they are likely to exhibit an elongated ellipsoid shape.Fig. 4Sedimentation velocity analysis of purified recombinant Stat1 and Stat3.

https://openalex.org/W2089049577,"Antigenic variation in Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites results from switches in expression among members of the multicopy var gene family. This family is subject to allelic exclusion by which particular genes are expressed while the rest of the family remains transcriptionally silent. Evidence from reporter constructs indicates that var gene silencing involves a cooperative interaction between the var intron and an upstream element and requires transition of the parasites through S-phase of the cell cycle. These findings implicate chromatin assembly in the process of regulating var gene expression and antigenic variation. Here we characterize the var intron and the elements within it that are necessary for var transcriptional silencing. Alignments of var introns show a highly conserved structure that consists of three discreet regions with distinct base pair compositions. The middle region is highly AT-rich and is sufficient to silence an associated var promoter. Constructs that include a typical var intron upstream of a reporter gene or drug-selectable marker reveal that the intron also possesses promoter activity, presumably providing an explanation for the origin of the previously described var “sterile” transcripts. Deletions that disable the promoter activity of the intron also eliminate its ability to function as a silencer. These findings suggest that interactions between the regions of these two promoters and the generation of the sterile transcripts play a significant role in regulating var gene expression.

These findings suggest that interactions between the regions of these two promoters and the generation of the sterile transcripts play a significant role in regulating var gene expression. The deadliest form of malaria is the result of infection by the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The disease is characterized by recurrent waves of parasitemia in which each wave represents a population of infected red blood cells with distinct antigenic properties and cytoadherent phenotypes (1Kyes S. Horrocks P. Newbold C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 673-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The parasites in these waves use a mechanism of antigenic variation to switch among major variable parasite-produced proteins (PfEMP1) that are placed on the surface of the infected host red blood cells. These switches allow parasites to escape clearance by the host antibody response, leading to persistent infections of variable severity. Antigenic variation thus ensures against the elimination of P. falciparum by interfering with the development of complete anti-PfEMP1 immunity.PfEMP1 is encoded by a multicopy gene family termed var (2Baruch D.I.

About 60 different var genes are present within the haploid genome of each parasite (3Su X. Heatwole V.M. Wertheimer S.P. Guinet F. Herrfeldt J.V. Peterson D.S. Ravetch J.V. Wellems T.E.

Barrell B. Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3404) Google Scholar), encoding forms of PfEMP1 with unique antigenic and cytoadherent properties. Switches in expression between individual members of the var gene family account for the antigenic variation in a P. falciparum population over the course of an infection (4Smith J.D. Chitnis C.E. Craig A.G. Roberts D.J. Hudson-Taylor D.E. Peterson D.S. Pinches R. Newbold C.I. Miller L.H. Cell. 1995; 82: 101-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). A mechanism of allelic exclusion appears to control expression of the individual genes (6Chen Q. Fernandez V. Sundstrom A. Schlichtherle M. Datta S. Hagblom P. Wahlgren M. Nature. 1998; 394: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 7Scherf A. Hernandez-Rivas R. Buffet P. Bottius E. Benatar C. Pouvelle B. Gysin J. Lanzer M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5418-5426Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), thus enabling the parasite population to survive. Without such exclusion, expression of all copies simultaneously would result in premature expenditure of the antigenic repertoire, whereas incomplete silencing of previously expressed copies would lead to clearance by antibodies generated against them. The molecular mechanisms responsible for activating and silencing the genes within this family, and thus coordinating the process of antigenic variation, therefore represent a process imperative for parasite survival.Although gene duplications, deletions, and recombinations within the family are not uncommon, switches in expression were not found to be accompanied by promoter DNA sequence alterations (8Deitsch K.W. del Pinal A. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Silent promoters were shown to be rendered transcriptionally active when removed from the chromosome and placed on transfected episomes (8Deitsch K.W. del Pinal A. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These results indicated that switches in expression were probably not the result of changes in transcription factors. Silencing of episomal var promoters was restored, however, when a var intron was also incorporated into the transfected plasmid (9Deitsch K.W. Calderwood M.S. Wellems T.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 875-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Silencing because of the presence of the intron was specific to var promoters and depended upon transition of the transfected parasite through S-phase of the cell cycle. These findings associate control of var expression with changes in chromatin structure and epigenetic mechanisms of regulation that may have some features in common with chromatin-mediated gene regulation in other organisms.Members of the var gene family are found in tandem arrayed clusters within the internal regions of chromosomes 4, 7, 8, and 12 and as individual genes within subtelomeric regions that also contain genes of the rifin and stevor families (1Kyes S. Horrocks P. Newbold C. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 673-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 10Hall N. Pain A. Berriman M. Churcher C. Harris B. Harris D. Mungall K. Bowman S. Atkin R.

Nature. 2002; 419: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In both internal and subtelomeric regions, transcriptionally active var genes have been found adjacent to silent copies, indicating that chromosomal position does not dictate expression. Gene clusters appear to be partitioned into transcriptionally active and silent regions. Chromatin “boundaries” or “insulators” typically separate such regions to prevent the spread of silent and active chromatin structure into adjacent regions and to prevent inappropriate “cross-talk” between the regulatory elements of genes in close proximity to one another (11West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 12Gerasimova T.I. Corces V.G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 193-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As a result, DNA elements that function as silencers are frequently found to include boundaries so as not to influence the transcriptional activity of adjacent genes. A number of boundaries and insulators have been identified and studied in several eukaryotic organisms; they vary greatly in their sequence and structure. Several of these elements have been shown to contain binding sites for characterized proteins, including transcription factors or RNA polymerase complexes (11West A.G. Gaszner M. Felsenfeld G. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). A few, including the scs and scs′ elements in Drosophila (13Avramova Z. Tikhonov A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 138-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and several elements described in yeast, have been shown to include functional promoters associated with active transcription (14Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Fourel G. Boscheron C. Revardel E. Lebrun E. Hu Y.F. Simmen K.C. Muller K. Li R. Mermod N. Gilson E. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Exactly how these binding sites and transcriptional activity relate to gene silencing or boundary/insulator activity is not yet fully understood.Here we describe experiments indicating that each var gene contains two functional promoters, the first upstream of var exon I and the second within the intron. The upstream promoter contains an initiator element at a transcription start site similar to the metazoan Inr sequence that has also been found in Trichomonas vaginalis parasites. Comparative alignments show that var introns exhibit a conserved architecture consisting of three regions differing in base pair composition. Dissection of a typical var intron demonstrates that these regions have different effects on var silencing, particularly the AT-rich central region, which alone is sufficient to silence the upstream var promoter. This central region is also necessary for the promoter activity of the intron, which presumably gives rise to the previously identified “sterile” transcripts associated with the intron and var exon 2 (3Su X.

Deletions that remove the promoter activity of the intron also impair its ability to function as a silencer. These results provide the first evidence that the intron promoter and sterile transcripts play a role in var gene regulation and allelic exclusion in P. falciparum.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESParasite Cultivation and Gradient Purification—The P. falciparum parasite line Dd2 was cultivated at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen), 0.25% sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mg ml–1 gentamicin. The cultures were kept under an atmosphere of 90% nitrogen, 5% oxygen, and 5% carbon dioxide at 37 °C. Percoll/sorbitol gradient purification (17Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was performed by layering 3 ml of 40% Percoll/6% sorbitol/RPMI 1640 medium over 3 ml of 70% Percoll/6% sorbitol/RPMI 1640 medium in a 15-ml centrifuge tube. One ml of parasitized erythrocytes at 50% hematocrit was layered on top of the gradient, the gradient was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 20 °C, and the cells at the gradient interface were recovered and washed twice with 10 volumes of complete media. Microscopic evaluation of the recovered cells verified that they were over 95% infected with late stage parasites, and these cells were reintroduced into culture.For drug resistance assays, the parasite line 3D7 was transfected with pVLH/IDH as described above, then cultured in media containing 40 ng/ml pyrimethamine (18Wu Y.

These fragments were cloned into BamHI/NotI-digested pVLH-1 to create the plasmids pVLH/intΔ1Δ3, pVLH/intΔ1Δ2, pVLH/intΔ3, and pVLH/intΔ1, respectively, where the Δ refers to the deleted intron region(s). pVLH/intΔ2Δ3 was created by cutting out region 1 of the intron from pVLH/int by restriction digestion with BamHI/DraI and cloning this fragment directly into BamHI/SmaI-digested pVLH-1. pVLH/intΔ2 was the result of a spontaneous deletion in pVLH/int that occurred while propagating the plasmid in E. coli. This plasmid was sequenced and found to be missing bp 161–686 of the intron. The plasmid pILH-1 was made by digesting pVLH/int with SstI and SmaI. The intron fragment was then cloned upstream of the luciferase coding region of similarly digested pGL2-basic (Promega). The simian virus 40 polyadenylation site of pGL2-basic was then replaced with a BamHI/ClaI fragment containing the hrp2 3′ sequence from the plasmid pHLH-1. The various intron fragments were also cloned into BamHI/NotI-digested pILH-1 to generate plasmids in which the individual portions of the intron replaced the full-length intron to drive luciferase expression. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the manufacturer's protocols.Fig. 1Sequence alignments and nucleotide composition analysis of var introns from the subtelomeric and internal regions of different P. falciparum chromosomes. A, the intron sequences align into three distinct regions with prominent asymmetry in strand composition. Conserved repeats 5′-TGT(G/A)T(G/A)TG-3′ are found only in region 1, whereas copies of the complementary repeat 5′-ACA(C/T)A(C/T)AC-3′ are found only in region 3 (shaded). Conserved GT and AG dinucleotides at the intron splice boundaries are highlighted in reverse. Conserved repeat elements containing a putative initiator element are boxed, and the Inr-like initiator sequence (TCATA) is shaded.

Driskill C.L. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Briefly, uninfected human erythrocytes were electroporated in the presence of 50 μg of plasmid DNA in incomplete cytomix using a Bio-Rad gene pulser, 0.2-cm cuvettes, and conditions of 0.31 kV and 960 microfarads. Erythrocytes from two such electroporations were combined for each 5-ml culture and inoculated with late stage parasites purified using a Percoll/sorbitol gradient. Luciferase assays were performed on 5-ml cultures at selected times after transfection (9Deitsch K.W. Calderwood M.S. Wellems T.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 875-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Error bars in graphs represent standard deviations of experiments done in triplicate.Previous work has shown that plasmids containing an intron require passage through S-phase to silence an upstream var promoter (9Deitsch K.W. Calderwood M.S. Wellems T.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 875-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, because var promoters are only active during the ring stage (prior to S-phase), silencing is not detected after transfection until the ring stage of the following cycle, after which silencing is maintained through subsequent cell cycles. All transfection experiments described in this manuscript were performed by allowing parasites to invade DNA-loaded erythrocytes (20Deitsch K.W. Driskill C.L. Wellems T.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and then separating the parasites from the DNA-loaded erythrocytes by Percoll/sorbitol gradients. Return of the purified parasites to culture with fresh, unloaded erythrocytes thus ensured that all transfected plasmids had been through at least one S-phase. Activity of the var7b promoter was always measured in ring-stage parasites unless otherwise stated.RESULTSAnalysis of var Intron Structure—Typical var genes contain two exons separated by a 0.8–1.2 kb intron (3Su X. Heatwole V.M. Wertheimer S.P. Guinet F. Herrfeldt J.V. Peterson D.S. Ravetch J.V. Wellems T.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A shows an alignment of the sequences of introns from 11 different var sequences in the GenBank™ data base. These sequences are from several different parasite lines and include genes from both subtelomeric and internal regions of chromosomes. All show similar structure with three distinct regions that are distinguished by their sequence similarity and nucleotide composition (Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A). Several repeat sequence elements occur in these regions, including TGTATGTG in region 1 and the direct complement of this sequence (ACATACAC) in region 3.Forward strand composition data, summarized by the histograms in Fig. 1B, show prominent asymmetry of the G versus C and A versus T contents of regions 1 and 3. The forward strand of region 2 consists of over 70% A with very little G or C. The differences among regions 1, 2, and 3 were found to be distinct without ambiguity of their borders in the alignments.Identification of an INR Element in a var Promoter—Primer extension was previously performed by using mRNA from an expressed internal gene (var7b), and the transcription start site was mapped to a conserved A residue at the center position within the sequence TCATA (8Deitsch K.W. del Pinal A. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this 5-base pair sequence was recently identified as a promoter element of numerous genes in the parasite T. vaginalis (21Liston D.R. Johnson P.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2380-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In all cases, the A at position 3 was the transcription start point, and certain specific point mutations within the sequence resulted in substantially reduced promoter activity. This element is very similar in function and sequence to a metazoan initiator element (Inr), suggesting that these elements were present in an ancestor early in eukaryotic evolution.To test whether the TCATA sequence found at the transcription start site of the var7b promoter has a similar function to this sequence in Inr, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on the construct pVLH-1, which incorporates the var7b promoter driving expression of a luciferase reporter gene (8Deitsch K.W. del Pinal A. Wellems T.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 101: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three specific mutations that reduce promoter activity in the T. vaginalis sequence were engineered into pVLH-1, and the resulting plasmids were transfected into P. falciparum parasites. These mutations produced reductions in promoter activity similar to those seen with experiments in T. vaginalis, suggesting the P. falciparum TCATA element has a function similar to that of the Inr in other organisms (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effect on luciferase expression of nucleotide changes in an Inr-like element containing the var7b transcription start point. The transcription start point is located within the upstream var7b promoter region that resembles an Inr-like element also present in T. vaginalis. The transcription start point (A) is shown in bold. Luciferase expression levels from constructs containing site-specific mutations in the var initiator element are shown in the histogram. The sequence of the mutations is shown below the horizontal axis. Luciferase expression was detected from ring-stage parasites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Promoter Activity within the Var Intron—Inspection of the intron sequence alignment shown in Fig. 1A,Fig. 1A identified several conserved copies of the putative Inr element described above. Therefore, we considered whether the var intron might also have promoter activity, thus providing a possible explanation for the origin of the “sterile” or “aberrant” exon 2 containing transcripts previously described (3Su X. Heatwole V.M. Wertheimer S.P. Guinet F. Herrfeldt J.V. Peterson D.S. Ravetch J.V. Wellems T.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 89-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 16Kyes S. Christodoulou Z. Raza A. Horrocks P. Pinches R. Rowe J.A. Newbold C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These transcripts were shown to include a portion of the intron and exon II. Although a case has been made for low level translation of a few of these transcripts (22Bischoff E. Guillotte M. Mercereau-Puijalon O. Bonnefoy S. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the majority have no consistent start methionine or other features indicative of translation.To determine whether a var intron can act as a functional promoter, we excised the intron previously used as a silencer in the plasmid pVLH/int (intron 2b in Fig. 1B) and placed it upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. The resulting constructs, pILH-1 and pVLH-1, were then transfected separately into P. falciparum parasites, which were then synchronized by Percoll/sorbitol gradient purifications (17Aley S.B. Sherwood J.A. Howard R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Luciferase expression levels were measured in both ring-stage parasites and late trophozoites (Fig. 3). As expected, the var7b promoter activity in the construct pVLH-1 was ring-specific, with expression levels falling substantially in late trophozoites. var genes were previously shown to be expressed in the ring stages of asexual parasites, between 3 and 18 h after merozoite invasion (23Kyes S. Pinches R. Newbold C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 105: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). By contrast, the construct that included intron 2b as a promoter showed very little activity in rings and much higher levels of activity in late trophozoites. This activity period is in agreement with the timing of the sterile transcripts detected by RNA blot analysis (16Kyes S. Christodoulou Z. Raza A. Horrocks P. Pinches R. Rowe J.A. Newbold C. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1339-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 24Taylor H.M. Kyes S.A. Harris D. Kriek N. Newbold C.I. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 1998; 92: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Trophozoite stage activity of the intron promoter may thus relate to the dependence of var gene silencing on the transition of the parasite through S-phase (9Deitsch K.W. Calderwood M.S. Wellems T.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 875-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and assembly of silent chromatin that occurs during this period of the cell cycle (26Miller A.M. Nasmyth K.A.

Histograms indicate the luciferase levels of ring stages 12 h after invasion and of late trophozoite stages 36 h after invasion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further characterize the intron promoter and to determine what portion or portions were necessary for promoter activity, we transfected parasites with constructs that included either the entire intron 2b in forward or reverse orientation, region 2 alone, or intron 2b with region 2 deleted. To determine the relative strength of the intron promoter, we compared the luciferase activity of these constructs to that of pVLH-1. Late trophozoites containing reporter constructs driven by intron 2b and ring-stage parasites transfected with pVLH-1 were assayed to allow a direct comparison of the peak activity of both promoters. The results (Fig. 4A) show that the intron can function as a promoter in either orientation, a characteristic previously described for several TATA-less promoters in other organisms (29Ikeda S. Mochizuki A. Sarker A.H. Seki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Liao W.C. Geng Y. Johnson L.F.

Acta. 2003; 1625: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Further, the luciferase levels from the various constructs show that intron region 2, the region that includes putative Inr elements similar to that in the upstream var promoter, is necessary for intron promoter activity and is sufficient on its own for luciferase expression.Fig. 4Luciferase expression levels from parasites transfected with plasmids containing either the var7b upstream region or portions of intron 2b as a promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2069292608,"Cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) is one prominent substrate through which protein kinase C (PKC) exerts its effect on cardiomyocyte function. To determine the specific functional effects of the cTnT PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites (Thr197, Ser201, Thr206, and Thr287) we first mutated these residues to glutamate (E) or alanine (A). cTnT was selectively mutated to generate single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants. Bacterially expressed mutants were evaluated in detergent-treated mouse left ventricular papillary muscle fiber bundles where the endogenous troponin was replaced with a recombinant troponin complex containing either cTnT phosphorylated by PKC-α or a mutant cTnT. We simultaneously determined isometric tension development and actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity of the exchanged fiber bundles as a function of Ca2+ concentration. Our systematic analysis of the functional role of the multiple PKC phosphorylation sites on cTnT identified a localized region that controls maximum tension, ATPase activity, and Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments. An important and novel finding of our study was that Thr206 is a functionally critical cTnT PKC phosphorylation residue. Its exclusive phosphorylation by PKC-α or replacement by Glu (mimicking phosphorylation) significantly decreased maximum tension, actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity, myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, and cooperativity. On the other hand the charge modification of the other three residues together (T197/S201/T287-E) had no functional effect. Fibers bundles containing phosphorylated cTnT-wt (but not the T197/S201/T206/T287-E) exhibited a significant decrease of tension cost as compared with cTnT-wt.

Contraction and relaxation of the sarcomere of cardiac muscle represents the integrated activity of highly synchronized and fine-tuned protein-protein interactions. Post-translational modifications and mutations leading to alterations in the charges of sarcomeric proteins are critical to these protein-protein interactions. Charge-charge interactions are involved in the reaction of the molecular motor myosin with actin and in the control of the actin-myosin interaction by Tm and the troponin complex (Tn). 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; cTn, cardiac troponin; cTnT, cardiac troponin T; cTnI, cardiac troponin I; cTnC, cardiac troponin C; Tm, tropomyosin; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; DCM, dilated cardiomyopathy; MOPS, 3-[N-morpholino]propane-sulfonic acid; BES, N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; wt, wild type; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). Troponin is a heterotrimeric protein consisting of a Ca2+-binding protein, TnC; an actomyosin Mg-ATPase-inhibiting protein, TnI, and a Tm-binding protein, TnT (for reviews see Refs. 1Tobacman L.S.

Moreover, charge modifications induced by phosphorylation of cTnI at tissue-specific PKA sites and at PKC sites modifies the Ca2+ sensitivity, tension, and velocity of shortening of the myofilaments (8Burkart E.M.

In experiments reported here we have focused on the functional significance of PKC phosphorylation and specific charge modifications, mimicking phosphorylation, of cardiac cTnT. cTnT is the “lever” that transmits the signal generated by Ca2+-induced conformational changes in cTnC-cTnI structures to the filamentous protein, Tm. Upon Ca2+-activation Tm undergoes both a movement and a rotation on the actin filament to facilitate the binding of myosin heads to actin and to promote the process of contraction (11Bacchiocchi C. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1524-1536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Squire J.M. Morris E.P.

Biol. 1995; 246: 108-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As a critically positioned molecule in the thin filament, it is clear that modifications of cTnT have the potential for versatile interactions with adjacent proteins and for producing significant functional effects (14Communal C. Sumandea M. de Tombe P. Narula J. Solaro R.J. Hajjar R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Even so, the specific effects of cTnT phosphorylation on tension and ATP hydrolysis have not been well studied in the myofilament lattice. There is no evidence for phosphorylation of cTnT by PKA. However, in vitro studies demonstrated that there are four main sites for PKC-dependent phosphorylation on cTnT (15Jideama N.M. Noland Jr., T.A. Raynor R.L. Blobe G.C. Fabbro D. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hannun Y.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23277-23283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), which are at Thr197, Ser201, Thr206, and Thr287 (mouse sequence). These sites are located in the functionally significant C-terminal half of the molecule. It is this region of cTnT that is likely to interact with cTnI and cTnC and possibly with Tm, and is essential in the transmission of the Ca2+-binding signal to Tm-actin (16Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Noland and Kuo (17Noland Jr., T.A. Kuo J.F. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1993; 25: 53-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported that exclusive phosphorylation of cTnT results in a ∼50% decrease in maximum actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity using in vitro fully reconstituted systems. When cTnI was exclusively phosphorylated under the same conditions, there was a much smaller, ∼20%, decrease. A recent study in our laboratory has indicated that pan-activation of PKC results in phosphorylation of cTnT and cTnI and induces a 30% reduction of maximum force of mouse cardiac myofilaments (18Montgomery D.E. Chandra M. Huang Q. Jin J. Solaro R.J. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H1011-H1018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When cTnT was partially replaced with a fast skeletal (fs) isoform, which is not phosphorylated by PKC, the effect of PKC activation was no longer evident. These results indicated that cTnT phosphorylation might be pivotal for the PKC-induced depression of tension in the myofilament. However given the large number of PKC isoforms, multiple phosphorylation sites, the lack of homogeneously phosphorylated samples and inability of performing site-directed phosphorylation, the role of each cTnT phosphorylation site remains unknown. In the present study we generated cTnT mutants in which Glu (mimic of phosphorylation) or Ala residues were placed at the PKC phosphorylation sites. cTnT was selectively mutated to generate single, double, triple, and quadruple mutants (see Fig. 3). The wild-type and mutated cTnTs were used to reconstitute a recombinant cTn complex, which was incorporated into detergent extracted left ventricular papillary muscle fiber bundles by replacing the endogenous troponin complex (19Brenner B. Kraft T. Yu L.C. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2677-2691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20She M. Trimble D. Yu L.C. Chalovich J.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We simultaneously determined tension development and actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity in the reconstituted preparations as a function of Ca2+ concentration (21Janssen P.M. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2415-H2422PubMed Google Scholar). Our data provide the first evidence that Thr206 is the functionally critical phosphorylation residue. Its exclusive phosphorylation by PKC-α or replacement by Glu (mimicking phosphorylation) significantly decreased maximum tension, actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity, myofilament Ca2+-sensitivity and cooperativity. On the other hand the charge modification of the other 3 residues together (T197/S201/T287-E) had no functional effect. Fibers bundles containing cTnT-wt-P (but not T197/S201/T206/T287-E) exhibited a significant decrease of tension cost as compared with cTnT-wt implicating cTnT phosphorylation in regulation of cross-bridge detachment rate.

Bovine cardiac Tm for the cosedimentation assay was purified as previously described by Tobacman and Adelstein (24Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recombinant adult mouse cTnT-wt and mutants were expressed and purified by a modified method of Chandra et al. (25Chandra M. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). cTnT was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells using the pSBETa expression plasmid. BL21(DE3) cells grown over night in Luria Broth supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin, were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. at 4 °C. The cell pellet was then resuspended well in a suitable volume (about 200 ml) of TnT-Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 6 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm DTT) containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The cells were lysed by sonication on ice, followed by 60 min of centrifugation at 48,000 × g, at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation as previously reported (25Chandra M. Kim J.J. Solaro R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The final ammonium sulfate pellet was solubilized in TnT-Buffer A, and then dialyzed at 4 °C against TnT-Buffer A. The dialyzed sample was applied on a DEAE-Fast Flow Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a FPLC System (Amersham Biosciences). cTnT was eluted with a 0.0–0.4 m KCl gradient in TnT-Buffer A. The fractions containing cTnT were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and those containing >90% pure cTnT were pooled, extensively dialyzed against 0.1% formic acid, 1 mm DTT in H2O, lyophilized, and stored in powder form at –80 °C. PKC-α Expression and Purification—Recombinant human PKC-α (26Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Hug H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was purchased from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC 80045). The following sense primers (from Operon) were used for the creation of a 5′-BglII and 3′-EcoRI restriction sites by PCR, for the subsequent subcloning into pVL1392 vector (BD Pharmingen): PKCAB-glII, 5′-ata ata aga tct atg gct gac gtt ttc ccg ggc aac-3′; PKCAEcoRI 5′-att aat gaa ttc tca tac tgc act ctg taa gat ggg-3′. Mutated residues are underlined. The identity of constructs was verified by DNA sequencing. Sf-9 cells (Invitrogen) transfected with PKC-α using the BaculoGold Kit (BD Pharmingen) were used to produce high-titer baculovirus stock. For protein expression, Sf-9 cells were grown at 27 °C in suspension culture to 2 × 106 cells/ml and infected with a MOI of 10. After 3 days cells were harvested and resuspended in 40 ml of Lysis Buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell suspension was lysed in a 50-ml hand-held homogenizer chilled on ice. The lysate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g and 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a HP Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences). PKC-α was eluted with a 0.0–0.4 m KCl gradient in PKC-Buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). Active PKC fractions were pooled, adjusted to 2 m KCl, and loaded onto a POROS 20 HP2 column (Per-Septive Biosystems) and eluted with linear salt gradient from 2 to 0 m KCl in Buffer A. Active PKC fractions were concentrated in an Ultra-free-15 centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Activity of PKC-α was assayed by measuring the initial rate of [32P]phosphate incorporation into 5 μm cTn (modified from Ref. 27Medkova M. Cho W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4892-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of cTnT by PKC-α—Phosphorylation of cTnT-wt and cTnT-T197A/S201A/T287A mutant (to exclusively phosphorylate Thr206) was accomplished by using 50 ng of PKC-α/μg cTnT in the presence of 0.3 mm phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar-Lipids), 0.02 mm diacylglycerol (Avanti Polar-Lipids), 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm ATPγS (Sigma), 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4 and 300 mm KCl at 30 °C for 1–3 h. The phosphorylated cTnT was then denatured in the Solubilization Buffer (see below) and used to reconstitute the cTn complex. Recombinant cTn Complex Reconstitution—The recombinant heterotrimeric cTn complex was reconstituted by mixing equimolar amounts of cTnT, cTnI and cTnC in a solubilization buffer containing 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT (28Kobayashi T. Zhao X. Wade R. Collins J.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5386-5391Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The solution was subjected to sequential dialysis using 0.7 m KCl, 0.4 m KCl, and finally 0.2 m KCl in the above buffer minus urea. Next the cTn complex was further separated from the monomeric troponins by anion exchange on a RESOURCE-Q column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a FPLC system. The cTn complex identity and purity was verified by 12% SDS-PAGE and then concentrated to about 2 ml using a Centriprep 10K (Millipore) and dialyzed against the Exchange Buffer containing 20 mm MOPS pH 6.5, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT (19Brenner B. Kraft T. Yu L.C. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2677-2691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20She M. Trimble D. Yu L.C. Chalovich J.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Next, the cTn complex was aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until it was used for exchange experiments. Exchange of Recombinant cTn in Left Ventricular Fiber Bundles— Fiber bundles were prepared from hearts of 5–6 months old, FVBN mice purchased from Harlan or Charles Rivers laboratories. The mice were anesthetized with ether and hearts were quickly removed and rinsed free of blood in ice-cold saline (0.9% NaCl). Muscle strips (∼150–200 μm wide and 3–4 mm long) were dissected from left ventricular papillary muscle. Then the fiber bundles were detergent-treated at 4 °C, in a High Relax Buffer containing 20 mm MOPS pH 7.0, 50 mm potassium propionate, 6.8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 25 μm CaCl2, 12 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm Na2ATP, 10 UI/ml creatine kinase, 0.5 mm DTT, a mixture of protease inhibitors and 1% Triton-X100 (21Janssen P.M. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2415-H2422PubMed Google Scholar). Following the detergent treatment the fiber bundles were transferred to a bath containing a recombinant cTn complex in Exchange Buffer (see above) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The extent of recombinant cTn exchange was determined after isometric tension and actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity measurements (see below) by immunoblot analysis of control versus exchanged fiber bundles using anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by treatment of the same membrane (after c-Myc removal) with anti-TnT antibody (clone JLT-12, Sigma). The presence of the 9-amino acid Myc tag at the N terminus of recombinant cTnT (29Tardiff J.C. Factor S.M. Tompkins B.D. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M. Moore R.L. Schwartz S. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2800-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) allowed us to separate it from the endogenous mouse cTnT on a 15% SDS-PAGE (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide ratio 200:1). Isometric Tension and Actomyosin Mg-ATPase Activity Measurements—The method of de Tombe and Stienen used in these experiments was described in detail elsewhere (21Janssen P.M. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: H2415-H2422PubMed Google Scholar). The fiber bundles (control or exchanged) were attached to a displacement generator at one end and a force transducer at the other end using aluminum T-clips. The sarcomere length was adjusted to 2.3 μm using a laser diffraction pattern and the cross-sectional area was determined based on an elliptical model. Fiber bundles were equilibrated for 5 min in Relaxing Buffer (100 mm BES, pH 7.1, 8.37 mm MgCl2, 5.80 mm Na2ATP, 20 mm EGTA, 42.5 mm potassium propionate), followed by 2 min in Pre-Activating Buffer (100 mm BES pH 7.1, 7.78 mm MgCl2, 5.80 mm Na2ATP, 0.50 mm EGTA, 19.5 mm HDTA, 43.6 mm potassium propionate) and then immersed into a bath containing a Maximal Activating Solution (100 mm BES, pH 7.1, 7.63 mm MgCl2, 5.87 mm Na2ATP, 20 mm Ca2+-EGTA, 43.6 mm potassium propionate). Relaxing, pre-activating, and maximum activating solutions also contained 900 μm NADH, 5 mm sodium azide, 10 mm phospho(enol)pyruvate, 1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase (500 units/mg), 0.12 mg/ml lactate dehydrogenase (870 units/mg), 10 μm oligomycin B, 20 μm P1P5-di(adenosine-5′)pentaphosphate, and 10 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After each contraction, fiber bundles were incubated for 1 min in Relaxing Buffer, followed by 2 min in Pre-Activating Buffer. The final contraction was induced in Activating solution containing maximally activating [Ca2+]. Only those fibers able to generate greater than 80% of initial tension in their final contraction were kept for analysis. The isometric tension and actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity were determined simultaneously at 20 °C in the presence of variable Ca2+ concentrations as described (30Janssen P.M. de Tombe P.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1892-H1897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using Labview (National Instruments, Austin, Texas). Tension-, actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity-[Ca2+] relations were fit by a nonlinear fit procedure to a modified Hill equation shown in Equation 1, P=Max·[Ca2+]H/([Ca2+]H+EC50H)(Eq. 1) where P is the parameter of interest (isometric tension, actomyosin Mg-ATPase activity); Max is the maximum value at saturating [Ca2+]; EC50 is the [Ca2+] at which 50% of Max is reached; and H represents the slope of the relationship (Hill coefficient). Cosedimentation Assay—The binding affinity of cTn complexes containing cTnT-wt or mutants to bovine cardiac tropomyosin (Tm) was assessed using a cosedimentation assay (31Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variable amounts of cTn complex (wt or mutant) in the presence of 1 μm Tm were incubated in 10 mm MOPS pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl and of either 1 mm EGTA or 100 μm CaCl2, at 4 °C (conditions shown to promote sedimentation of cTn-Tm complex, (31Hill L.E. Mehegan J.P. Butters C.A. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16106-16113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The Tm-bound cTn was determined by cosedimentation at 74,000 rpm for 45 min using a TLA rotor. Sedimentation supernatants and pellets were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. Densitometric analysis of the gels was carried out using NIH Image software. Materials—Triton X-100 was purchased from Pierce. Ammonium sulfate (enzyme grade) and formic acid (sequencing grade) were from Fisher. 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (phosphatidylserine) and 1,2-sn-dioleoylglycerol (diacylglycerol) were purchased from Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc. Unless mentioned otherwise all the other chemicals were from Sigma. Animal Care—All animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care Committee at the University of Illinois, Chicago. Statistical Analysis—All values are presented as mean ± S.E., and values of p < 0.05 were the criteria for statistical significance. Data was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Dunnett's t test. Recombinant cTn Incorporation into the Myofilament Lattice—To assess the functional role of each cTnT phosphorylation site we used a modified version (see “Materials and Methods”) of the technique of whole troponin exchange introduced by Brenner et al. (19Brenner B. Kraft T. Yu L.C. Chalovich J.M. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2677-2691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This method allows the gentle replacement of the endogenous cTn with a recombinant cTn in muscle fiber bundles. The exchange procedure introduces no major alteration in the structure and properties of the fiber bundles, since the myofilament is never depleted of cTn. Fig. 1 shows the Western blot analysis of representative fibers used in our measurements (1 fiber bundle per lane). The samples were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE, and after transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane probed with an anti-c-Myc antibody (data not shown) and then with anti-cTnT antibody. Lanes 1, 5, 6, and 10 show representative native (no exchange) fibers bundles that have been used in control measurements, whereas the other lanes contain fibers that had undergone exchange with recombinant cTn-wt or Tn-T3SE. The middle lanes 3 and 8 serve as standards for recombinant cTn. The endogenous mouse cTnT and recombinant mouse cTnT have different mobilities on the SDS-PAGE due to the presence of a c-Myc tag at the N terminus of recombinant cTnT. The c-Myc tag retards the recombinant cTnT migration on the gel allowing us to assess the exchange efficiency. The Western blot analysis demonstrated that exchange of endogenous cTn with recombinant cTn was basically 100% since the fibers bundles treated with the recombinant cTn showed no band corresponding to endogenous cTnT. Mechanoenergetic Characteristics of Native and Recombinant cTn-wt Exchanged Fibers—In a first set of experiments, we determined the functional effect of introducing recombinant cTn-wt into the myofilament lattice of left ventricular fiber bundles. To determine the effect of cTn-wt incorporation we compared the mechanoenergetic characteristics of native (no exchange) and recombinant cTn-wt exchanged fiber bundles. The data (Fig. 2 and Table II) indicate that the basal mechanics and energetics of native versus cTn-wt were not significantly altered. Native and cTn-wt exchange fibers demonstrated no significant differences in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity or Hill coefficients for any parameter (Table II).Table IIMechanical and energetic profiles of left ventricular papillary fiber bundlesIsometric TensionActomyosin Mg-ATPaseMaximumEC50Hill CoefficientMaximumEC50Hill CoefficientTension costNmN/mm2μ mpmol/s/mm3μ mNative42.3 ± 3.31.6 ± 0.14.9 ± 0.8369.2 ± 24.31.4 ± 0.15.3 ± 1.110.3 ± 0.78 (6)WT39.2 ± 1.01.7 ± 0.14.7 ± 0.6362.9 ± 15.91.5 ± 0.14.8 ± 0.89.6 ± 0.510 (7)T3SE14.9 ± 2.5ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.22.8 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.5 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.181.1 ± 19.8ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.20.9 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.0 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.10.7 ± 1.57 (4)T3E28.3 ± 1.6ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.7.5 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.5 ± 0.5ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.227.3 ± 17.8ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.6.4 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.8 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.9.0 ± 0.97 (6)T2E24.3 ± 3.9ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.15.7 ± 0.4ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.2 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.230.2 ± 19.0ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.12.0 ± 1.0ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.1.8 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.9.4 ± 1.16 (5)T206E19.1 ± 1.3ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.18.6 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.8 ± 0.6ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.210.3 ± 14.4ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.15.7 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.4 ± 0.5ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.10.1 ± 1.06 (3)T2SE38.2 ± 1.82.3 ± 0.24.2 ± 0.2359.8 ± 16.02.1 ± 0.23.9 ± 0.19.2 ± 0.25 (3)STE38.8 ± 4.12.3 ± 0.14.5 ± 0.8350.6 ± 23.61.6 ± 0.13.9 ± 0.49.0 ± 0.66 (3)T197E42.4 ± 2.02.5 ± 0.14.9 ± 0.2392.9 ± 21.12.2 ± 0.14.2 ± 0.38.9 ± 0.45 (3)T3SA30.6 ± 2.0ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.6.6 ± 0.3ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.3.7 ± 0.7280.3 ± 17.06.2 ± 0.6ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.3.7 ± 0.58.9 ± 0.67 (5)T3A36.8 ± 2.27.5 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.4.1 ± 0.3319.1 ± 14.66.9 ± 0.6ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.3.3 ± 0.38.60 ± 0.46 (3)T206A21.1 ± 3.2ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.12.0 ± 0.8ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.9 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.229.9 ± 3.2ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.10.8 ± 0.7ap < 0.05 as compared with wild-type exchange.2.6 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 as compare"
https://openalex.org/W1996030225,"MUC1, an integral membrane mucin associated with the metastatic phenotype, is overexpressed by most human carcinoma cells. The MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (CT) is postulated to function in morphogenetic signal transduction via interactions with Grb2/Sos, c-Src, and β-catenin. We investigated intracellular trafficking of the MUC1 CT, using epitope-tagged constructs that were overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer cell lines S2-013 and Panc-1. The MUC1 CT was detected at the inner cell surface, in the cytosol, and in the nucleus of cells overexpressing MUC1. Fragments of the MUC1 CT were associated with β-catenin in both cytoplasm and nuclei. Overexpression of MUC1 increased steady state levels of nuclear β-catenin but decreased nuclear levels of plakoglobin (γ-catenin). There was no detectable association between plakoglobin and the MUC1 CT. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the cytoplasmic and nuclear association of MUC1 CT and β-catenin was not affected by disruption of Ca2+-dependent intercellular cadherin interactions. These results demonstrate nuclear localization of fragments of MUC1 CT in association with β-catenin and raise the possibility that overexpression of the MUC1 CT stabilizes β-catenin and enhances levels of nuclear β-catenin during disruption of cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion.

Human MUC1 is a large, type I transmembrane protein normally expressed on the apical surface of ductal epithelia (1Lan M.S. Batra S.K. Qi W.N. Metzgar R.S. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15294-15299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length MUC1 is synthesized as a single polypeptide chain, which undergoes an early proteolytic cleavage (probably in the endoplasmic reticulum) creating two subunits that remain associated during its post-translational processing and transport to the cell surface (2Parry S. Silverman H.S. McDermott K. Willis A. Hollingsworth M.A. Harris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The larger of the two fragments contains most of the extracellular domain, including the signal sequence and a tandem repeat domain (3Ligtenberg M.J. Kruijshaar L. Buijs F. van Meijer M.

Duhig T. Chilton B.S. Gendler S.J. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The function of MUC1 is partially elucidated for normal and transformed cells. The extracellular fragment plays a significant role in configuring the adhesive and anti-adhesive properties of cells and is believed to contribute to the establishment of molecular structures that protect the cell surface in the relatively harsh environment encountered by different ductal epithelia (7Agrawal B. Gendler S.J. Longenecker B.M. Mol. Med. Today. 1998; 4: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the function of the intracellular portion of the MUC1 cytoplasmic tail (CT) is not known. Indirect evidence suggests that the MUC1 CT is involved in signal transduction, as it contains potential docking sites for Grb2/Sos and β-catenin, and can be phosphorylated by GSK-3β, c-Src, EGFR, and PKC-δ (7Agrawal B.

This, together with the general transmembrane structure of the MUC1 molecule, suggests a potential role in morphogenetic signaling; however, little is known about mechanisms by which the MUC1 CT functions in this capacity, and nothing has been reported with regard to the relationship between the extracellular and intracellular functions of MUC1. Previous studies (10Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12492-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 11Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) reported that the cytoplasmic domain of MUC1 interacts with β-catenin at a serine-rich motif, which is similar to binding sites found in E-cadherin and the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor. β-Catenin and its closely related homologue γ-catenin (plakoglobin) play important roles in cell-cell adhesion and transcriptional regulation (17Venkiteswaran K.

Both have signaling activity as members of the Wnt pathway (18Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Binding of Wnt to the Frizzled receptor and the subsequent inhibition of GSK-3β kinase activity on β-catenin result in the translocation of β-catenin from the cytosol to the nucleus, where β-catenin binds to the N terminus of LEF-1/TCF, forming a tertiary complex that is involved in transcriptional transactivation (19Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 20Tetsu O. McCormick F.

To date, the biological consequences of the interaction between MUC1 CT and β-catenin remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated the subcellular localization of MUC1 CT and β-catenin in the human pancreatic cancer cell lines S2-013 and Panc-1. Our results indicated that fragments of MUC1 CT were distributed on the inside of the plasma membrane, in the cytoplasm, and in the nucleus. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed an association between the MUC1 CT and β-catenin in both cytoplasm and nuclei of cells overexpressing MUC1. Steady state levels of nuclear β-catenin were significantly increased by overexpression of MUC1. The steady state levels of nuclear β-catenin and the fragment of MUC1 CT were not affected by disruption of intercellular E-cadherin interactions (by Ca2+ withdrawal) in cells overexpressing MUC1; however, the levels of nuclear β-catenin were dramatically reduced (presumably by the APC-β-catenin degradation pathway (29Hirohashi S. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 333-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar)) upon chelation of extracellular Ca2+ in cells expressing low levels of MUC1. We also determined that overexpression of MUC1 decreased the steady state levels of nuclear γ-catenin (plakoglobin); however, no direct association between MUC1 CT and γ-catenin was detected in our cell lines. The results show that a fragment of the MUC1 CT undergoes cytosol-to-nucleus trafficking in association with β-catenin and suggest the possibility that the MUC1 CT stabilizes β-catenin and thereby influences its transcriptional co-activator function. The findings also suggest that overexpression of the MUC1 CT had opposite effects on the nuclear levels of plakoglobin and β-catenin. Materials—The human pancreatic cancer cell line Panc-1 was originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collections (Manassas, VA). The S2-013 cell line is a cloned subline of human pancreatic tumor cell line (SUIT-2), which was derived from a liver metastasis (30Iwamura T. Katsuki T. Ide K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1987; 78: 54-62PubMed Google Scholar). Armenian Hamster mAb CT-2 against MUC1 CT was kindly provided by Dr. Sandra Gendler, Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ. Murine mAb anti-β-catenin and anti-E-cadherin were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Murine mAbs M2-anti-FLAG, anti-β-actin, and M2-conjugated agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. Mouse mAb 11E4 binds to the N terminus of plakoglobin. Mouse mAb anti-β-actin and goat polyclonal antibody anti-histone H2B (sc-8650) were purchased from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The secondary antibodies used for immunostaining in confocal microscopy, including FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1, Texas Red-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG(H+L), and CyTM5-conjugated Affinipure goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG(H+L) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Cell Culture—The Panc-1 and S2-013 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and passaged at 80–90% confluence using 0.05% trypsin with 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen). Cells were grown in 225-cm2 flasks for collecting cell lysates or on 18-mm glass coverslips for confocal microscopy. Expression of Epitope-tagged MUC1 Deletion Constructs and Generation of Transfectant Cell Lines—FLAG epitope-tagged MUC1 cDNA constructs were used in which 66 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (MUC1 CT3) or the tandem repeat (MUC1(Δ TR) were deleted and subcloned into the expression vector pHβ-Apr1-neo, as described previously (31Burdick M.D. Harris A. Reid C.J. Iwamura T. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24198-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Panc-1 and S2-013 cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using the Lipofectin method (Invitrogen). Cells were plated in 6-well culture plates. At pre-confluence, cells were incubated with 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent and 10 μg of circular plasmid DNA. Cells carrying integrated MUC1 constructs were selected by culture in 600 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and single clones were selected with cloning cylinders and expanded for screening. Expression of FLAG epitope-tagged MUC1 isoforms in each transfectant was evaluated by immunofluorescence with anti-FLAG mAb M2 and by immunoblotting with M2. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—S2-013 and Panc-1 cells were cultured on glass coverslips (Fisher brand microscope cover glass, 12-545-100 18CIR-1) at 4.5 × 105/well for 12 h. All subsequent steps were performed at 25 °C. Cells were washed once in serum-free DMEM for 5 min followed by fixation for 15 min in PBS with 4% paraformaldehyde and 120 mm sucrose. Residual paraformaldehyde was neutralized with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 15 min. For immunofluorescence, cells were permeabilized for 15 min by incubation in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in DMEM. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotech) or indodicarbocyanine (Cy5™)-conjugated goat anti-Armenian hamster IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. Propidium iodide was used as the nuclear dye at a 1:500 dilution with 0.1 mm RNase for triple color confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis (32Pollice A.A. Smith C.A. Brown K. Farkas D.L. Silverman J.F. Shackney S.E. Cytometry. 2000; 42: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After washing with PBS for 5 min, and with serum-free DMEM for another 5 min, cells were mounted in fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech). Isotype controls included mouse myeloma IgG1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and CT-2 antibody blocked with CT-1 peptide (SSLSYTNPAVAATSANL, Dr. Gendler, Mayo Clinic, AZ) to confirm binding specificity. Cells were analyzed on a Zeiss LSM 410 dual beam laser confocal scanning microscope. Preparation of Cell Lysates—Panc-1 and S2-013 cells (∼90% confluent) were lysed on ice for 30 min in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100). Insoluble material was pelleted at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Lysates were diluted in the lysis buffer with protease inhibitor sets (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml Pefabloc SC, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm EDTA (Roche Diagnostics)) to a total protein concentration of 1.5 μg/μl and stored at -80 °C for future analysis. Protein content of the lysates was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Cellular Fractionation—Preparation of membrane/cytoplasmic extracts and nuclear extracts was as described previously (33Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 34Hollingsworth M.A. Closken C. Harris A. McDonald C.D. Pahwa G.S. Maher 3rd, L.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9153) Google Scholar). Panc-1 and S2-013 cells were cultured on 225-cm2 flasks to 90% confluence. All steps were performed on ice unless otherwise indicated. Cells were washed with PBS twice at 4 °C and placed in 1.5 ml of NPB extraction buffer for 2 h (NPB buffer contains 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml Pefabloc SC, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm EDTA (Roche Diagnostics)). Cells were scraped into NPB solution and disrupted with a glass Dounce homogenizer (40–50 strokes with a pestle). The disruption was monitored by light microscopy after staining with 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma). The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatants were designated “membrane/cytoplasmic extract,” and the pellets were designated “nuclear extract” following purification steps described below. Membrane/Cytoplasmic Extracts—The supernatants were dialyzed against Dialysis Buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml Pefabloc SC, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, with 3,500-Dalton Dialysis Cassettes (Pierce) at 4 °C for overnight. The dialyzed solution was stored at -80 °C as membrane/cytoplasmic extracts until further use. Nuclear Extracts—The pellets were purified for nuclear extracts as described previously (36Lee K.A. Green M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Pellets were rinsed with NPB buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The nuclei were resuspended in Nuclear Lysis Buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml Pefabloc SC, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin and extracted for 1 h. Resuspended pellets were disrupted with the Dounce homogenizer (20–30 strokes with pestle B). The homogenate was subjected to centrifugation at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against Dialysis Buffer using the Microdialyzer System with 1000-dalton dialyzer membranes (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The dialyzed extracts were stored at -80 °C as nuclear extract for future analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein from cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were incubated with the following mAbs: anti-β-catenin, anti-E-cadherin, CT-2 anti-MUC1 CT, M2-anti-FLAG or a mouse IgG control. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3 times with NET buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, bound material were eluted from the immunoprecipitates in reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 10% SDS, 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% bromphenol blue at 100 °C for 10 min. Lysates and immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on 6 or 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (with 3% polyacrylamide stacking gels), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes electrophoretically, and blocked in 5% dry milk in TBS (0.9% NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% MgCl2) at 4 °C overnight. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000 or 1:500 in blotto (5% nonfat dry milk in TBS). Incubations were for 1 h at room temperature and were followed by three 10-min washes with TBS. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:20,000 in TBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Second antibody incubations were followed by three washes as described above. ECL reagents were applied as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the membranes were exposed to ECL-sensitive film (Amersham Biosciences) (31Burdick M.D. Harris A. Reid C.J. Iwamura T. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24198-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Depletion of Extracellular Calcium (Ca2+) by EDTA—S2-013 and Panc-1 cells were cultured on glass coverslips or flasks for 12 h in DMEM + 5% FBS until they achieved a monolayer with 90% confluence and established cell-cell adhesions. For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed twice with Ca2+-free PBS, incubated in serum-free DMEM with 10 mm EDTA for 3–6 h, and evaluated every 15 min for loss of cell adhesion and release from the monolayer. Upon release from the monolayer, suspended cells were collected by centrifugation and used for the preparation of cell extracts as described above. Transfection of Cell Lines and Expression of MUC1 Deletion Constructs—Two cell lines were chosen to evaluate epitope-tagged MUC1 constructs. The first, Panc-1, is a poorly differentiated human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line that expresses low levels of endogenous MUC1 and relatively low levels of other glycoproteins (37Yonezawa S. Byrd J.C. Dahiya R. Ho J.J. Gum J.R. Griffiths B. Swallow D.M. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The second, S2-013, is a moderately differentiated human pancreatic tumor cell line that is known to express O-glycosylated mucin-like proteins, including low levels of endogenous MUC1 (38Iwamura T.

Schematics of proteins encoded by the cDNA deletion constructs used in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. DNA encoding the FLAG epitope was added to different MUC1 cDNA constructs, as described previously (4McDermott K.M. Crocker P.R. Harris A. Burdick M.D. Hinoda Y. Hayashi T. Imai K.

This insertion yields recombinant product with the epitope tag on the extracellular domain of the protein. The addition of the epitope tag facilitates identification and analysis of the extracellular domain. Insertion of the FLAG epitope at this position is unlikely to interfere with biological function of the protein because the amino acid sequence of this region is poorly conserved among different species (6Spicer A.P. Duhig T. Chilton B.S. Gendler S.J. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Spicer A.P. Parry G. Patton S. Gendler S.J. J. Biol.

The membrane-associated and cytoplasmic moieties of MUC1 are detected with a monoclonal antibody (CT2) against an epitope near the C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail. FLAG-tagged constructs encoding MUC1 with the tandem repeat-deleted [MUC1F(ΔTR)], cytoplasmic tail-deleted [MUC1F.CT3], or full-length [MUC1F] were stably expressed in S2-013 and Panc-1 human pancreatic cancer cells using the expression vector pHβ-Apr1-neo, as described under “Experimental Procedures” (31Burdick M.D. Harris A.

Expression of recombinant MUC1 was evaluated by immunofluorescence with mAb M2 (anti-FLAG) (data not shown) and by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with M2 (Fig. 1B). Panc-1.MUC1F or S2-013.MUC1F cells expressed a full-length MUC1F isoform of ∼250 kDa. The extracellular domain of the cytoplasmic tail deleted MUC1F.CT3 protein demonstrated mobility on SDS-PAGE slightly different from full-length MUC1F, for unknown reasons. Deletion of the cytoplasmic tail in the MUC1F.CT3 molecule does not affect its trafficking to the cell surface and is not predicted to affect the length of the large extracellular domain fragment (43Silverman H.S. Parry S. Sutton-Smith M. Burdick M.D. McDermott K. Reid C.J. Batra S.K. Morris H.R. Hollingsworth M.A. Dell A. Harris A. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Studies 2Y. Wen, T. C. Caffrey, and M. A. Hollingsworth, unpublished data. from our group have shown that similar carbohydrate structures are expressed on both the full-length and CT3 forms (data not shown), although it is not known if the extracellular domains are glycosylated to the same density. Similar to previous studies (2Parry S. Silverman H.S. McDermott K. Willis A. Hollingsworth M.A. Harris A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4McDermott K.M. Crocker P.R. Harris A. Burdick M.D. Hinoda Y. Hayashi T. Imai K. Hollingsworth M.A. Int. J.

Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Distribution of Fragments of MUC1 CT—Nuclear and membrane/cytoplasmic extracts were prepared from Panc-1.MUC1F, Panc-1.NEO, S2-013.MUC1F, and S2-013.NEO cells by Dounce homogenization of cells incubated in hypotonic buffer (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). Nuclear extracts from washed nuclei were shown not to be contaminated by membrane/cytoplasmic proteins (44Vishwanatha J.K. Jindal H.K. Davis R.G. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 101: 25-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Contamination of membrane/cytoplasmic MUC1 in nuclear extracts was evaluated by performing immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with mAb M2. The FLAG epitope-tagged extracellular domain of MUC1 should only be expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and at the cell surface. Nuclear extracts from the MUC1F-transfected Panc-1 or S2-013 cells showed no detectable levels of the FLAG epitope-tagged extracellular domain of MUC1, whereas membrane/cytoplasmic extracts showed significant levels (Fig. 2). In addition, we evaluated nuclear extracts by immunoblotting with mAb HMFG-2, which binds to the tandem repeat, to confirm that the extracellular domain was not detected in these fractions (in case the FLAG epitope was blocked or cleaved). The results showed that the extracellular domain was not contained in nuclear fractions (data not shown). The distribution of the MUC1 CT in membrane/cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from Panc-1.MUC1F, Panc-1.NEO, S2-013.MUC1F, or S2-013.NEO cells was investigated by immunoblotting with mAb CT-2 (raised against the last 17 amino acids on the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of MUC1, precise epitope not known). The results indicated that fragments of MUC1 CT were detected in a broad band at 26–30 kDa from cytosolic lysates and a narrower band of ∼26 kDa in nuclear extracts of cells Panc-1.MUC1F and S2-013.MUC1F cells. Lower but detectable amounts of endogenous MUC1 CT were detected in the cytosol and nuclei from Panc-1.NEO or S2-013.NEO cells (Fig. 2A). β-Actin (42 kDa) was used as an internal reference for protein loading in each lane (Fig. 2). Membranes were also reprobed with a mAb against histone 2B as a second reference for protein loading. Consistent with previous reports (45Wolff D.J. Ross J.M. Thompson P.N.

https://openalex.org/W2066196230,"SPECIFIC AIMSBacterial CpG DNA has been shown to activate immune cells through Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR-9). We sought to determine whether 1) enteric epithelial cell lines express TLR-9 and 2) exposure to Escherichia coli DNA would elicit an epithelial response as defined by mediator synthesis (i.e., IL-8, PGE2) or altered barrier or ion transport.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Expression of TLR-9 mRNA in human colonic epithelial cellsThe human colonic HT-29, Caco-2, T84, and airway A549 epithelial cells were analyzed for the expression of TLR-9 by RT-PCR. THP-1 (human monocyte cell line) and CCD-18Co (human fibroblast cell line) cells served as positive and negative controls, respectively. All four epithelia constitutively expressed TLR-9 mRNA. Purification and sequencing of the PCR product from Caco-2 cells revealed a 100% match with the published human TLR-9 cDNA sequence. Demonstration of TLR-9 expression complements recent reports of other TLRs (e.g., TLR-4) on gut epithelia.2. E. coli DNA induces epithelial ..."
https://openalex.org/W2103497223,"Reticulon (RTN) genes code for a family of proteins relatively recently described in higher vertebrates. The four known mammalian paralogues (RTN1, -2, -3, and -4/Nogo) have homologous carboxyl termini with two characteristic large hydrophobic regions. Except for RTN4-A/Nogo-A, thought to be an inhibitor for neurite outgrowth, restricting the regenerative capabilities of the mammalian CNS after injury, the functions of other family members are largely unknown. The overall occurrence of RTNs in different phyla and the evolution of the RTN gene family have hitherto not been analyzed. Here we expound data showing that the RTN family has arisen during early eukaryotic evolution potentially concerted to the establishment of the endomembrane system. Over 250 reticulon-like (RTNL) genes were identified in deeply diverging eukaryotes, fungi, plants, and animals. A systematic nomenclature for all identified family members is introduced. The analysis of exon-intron arrangements and of protein homologies allowed us to isolate key steps in the history of these genes. Our data corroborate the hypothesis that present RTNs evolved from an intron-rich reticulon ancestor mainly by the loss of different introns in diverse phyla. We also present evidence that the exceptionally large RTN4-A-specific exon 3, which harbors a potent neurite growth inhibitory region, may have arisen de novo approximately 350 MYA during transition to land vertebrates. These data emphasize on the one hand the universal role of reticulons in the eukaryotic system and on the other hand the acquisition of putative new functions through acquirement of novel amino-terminal exons."

This reaction is mediated by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), a cytosolic enzyme, and perilipin, which coats the lipid droplet surface in adipocytes. Both HSL and perilipin are substrates for polyphosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), and phosphorylation of perilipin is required to induce HSL to translocate from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplet, a critical step in the lipolytic reaction (Sztalryd C., Xu, G., Dorward, H., Tansey, J. T., Contreras, J.A, Kimmel, A. R., and Londos, C. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 161, 1093–1103). In the present paper we demonstrate that phosphorylation at one of the two more recently discovered PKA sites within HSL, serines 659 and 660, is also required to effect the translocation reaction. Translocation does not occur when these serines residues are mutated simultaneously to alanines. Also, mutation of the catalytic Ser-423 eliminates HSL translocation, showing that the inactive enzyme does not migrate to the lipid droplet upon PKA activation. Thus, HSL translocation requires the phosphorylation of both HSL and perilipin. Lipolysis in adipocytes governs the release of fatty acids for the supply of energy to various tissues of the body.

Thus, HSL translocation requires the phosphorylation of both HSL and perilipin. Hormone-sensitive lipase is a broadly expressed enzyme that mediates the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols in adipose cells of animals, leading to the release of fatty acids which are transported in the plasma to supply the energy needs of various tissues (1Holm C. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Contreras J.A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This lipolytic process is under strict hormonal and neural regulation, to guarantee an appropriate supply of fatty acids to the peripheral tissues according to the metabolic needs at each moment. Activation of the lipolytic process is mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase A; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; wt, wild type; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase A; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; wt, wild type; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. which is acutely stimulated by hormones that elevate cAMP, like catecholamines, corticotropin, glucagon, and others (2Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15130-15138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSL contains three sites for PKA serine phosphorylation (Ser-563, Ser-659, and Ser-660) (3Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HSL in vitro with exogenous PKA causes a modest (2-fold) activation of HSL, and mututational analysis has revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-659 or Ser-660, but not Ser-563, are required for this modest activation of HSL in vitro (3Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, this meager increase in the specific activity of HSL cannot account for the 30–100-fold increases in lipolysis observed upon elevation of PKA activity in intact cells. Rather, we have proposed that PKA-mediated translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the surface of lipid droplets more likely explains the large cellular response to lipolytic stimuli (4Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 5Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S.

Furthermore, while PKA-mediated lipolysis has long been thought to be attributed solely to HSL, more recent developments point to a role for the perilipins in lipolytic activation. Perilipin A is an adipocyte protein that coats the lipid storage droplet (7Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contains six sites for PKA phosphorylation (8Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), most of which are phosphorylated upon lipolytic stimulation. In a separate paper (9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 161: 1093-1103Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the interaction of HSL with the intracellular neutral lipid droplets is critically regulated by the presence of perilipin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fully phosphorylatable perilipin A is required to induce HSL to translocate from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplets, a key process for the activation of lipolysis. In the present study we examine the role of the various PKA sites within HSL in the translocation reaction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and identify the sites that are required for HSL to associate with the lipid droplet. We further demonstrate that the mutation of the catalytic serine (Ser-423) abrogates the translocation phenomenon, showing that the enzyme must be catalytically competent to undergo translocation. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 fibroblasts, from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit), 2 mm glutamine (Biofluids), 100 units/ml penicillin (Biofluids), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biofluids), 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate (Sigma), and 8 μg/ml biotin (Invitrogen). Bosc23 cells, from the ATCC, were maintained in DMEM described above without biotin. Cells were maintained in culture flasks and dishes (Corning) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. For experiments, cells were split into cell 6-well culture plates with or without glass cover slips (Fisher). Differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was initiated by culturing the cells with 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Aldrich), and 10 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) in serum-free medium (DMEM/F-12; Invitrogen) supplemented with 3.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine (Biofluids), 100 units/ml penicillin (Biofluids), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biofluids), 110 μg/ml sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 8 μg/ml biotin (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml fetuin from fetal calf serum (Sigma) for 3 days. Cells were subsequently maintained in the serum free medium after 3 days of hormone treatment For purposes of the present study, this switch to serum-free medium was necessary, because when maintained in serum-replete medium the cells infected with pBabe detached from the culture dishes. The cAMP analogs, 8-thiomethyl- and N 6-benzoyl-cAMP, were from Sigma. Construction of HSL Mutants and Expression in 3T3-L1 Cells—The C-terminal FLAG-tagged (10Hopp T.P. Biotechnology. 2002; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (743) Google Scholar) wt HSL with BglII and SalI sites was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) against rat wt HSL in pSVL (11Holm C. Belfrage P. Osterlund T. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Langin D. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The sequence of the sense oligonycleotide is 5′-CGCAGATCTATGGATTTACGCACAATGACACAGTCG-3′ and that of the antisense oligonucleotide is 5′-CGCGTCGACTCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGTCAGCGGTGCAGCAGGGGGGGG-3′. The BglII and SalI digestion of this product was cloned into the retroviral pBabe-puro vector (12Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3587-3596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) digested with SalI. The sequence of FLAG-tagged wt HSL in pBabe was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-based automated sequencing, using Taq dye deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The FLAG-tagged mutated HSLs were cloned into pBabe by switching native HSL from pBabe, cut with BamHI and EcoRI, with mutants, cut with BglII and EcoR I, from pSVL (3Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The sequences of FLAG-tagged mutants in pBabe were also confirmed. Bosc23 cells (2 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were seeded 24 h before transfection. On the day of transfection, cells were about 80% confluent. After incubating with 25 μm chloroquine (Sigma) for 30 min, 10 μg of pBabe vector or vectors containing FLAG-tagged wt or mutated HSLs were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation method (Amersham Biosciences) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Fresh medium was replaced 6 h later. The viral supernatants from two 60-mm dishes were collected and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Gelman Sciences) after 48 h. Fresh medium was supplemented, and polybrene (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 6 μg/ml. 3T3-L1 cells on 100-mm dishes were incubated with the viral solution for 24 h. Selection was carried out by splitting the infected 3T3-L1 cells in the DMEM containing 3 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). After 24 h, half of the singly infected 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were re-infected (“doubly infected”) with the viral solution obtained from Bosc23 cells described above. Five rounds of retroviral infections were carried out with each of the HSL-FLAG fusion constructs described in this paper, and in each experiment both single and double infection with the retrovirus were performed. The data shown are representative of the results found with each round of double retroviral infection. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was collected from 3T3-L1 fibroblasts at confluence or from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, 5 days after induction of differentiation, by adding TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Ten μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing formaldehyde, and the RNA was transferred to supercharged Nylon membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) by the Turboblotter system (Schleicher and Schuell). Northern blot hybridization was carried out by incubating 32P-labeled rat HSL cDNA with the membrane. Immunoblotting—3T3-L1 fibroblasts at confluence or adipocytes, 5 days after induction of differentiation, were sonicated with a Sonicator Ultrasonic Processor (Heat Systems) for 30 s in a hypotonic lysis medium containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 100 μm [4-(2-amineothy)benzenesulfluoride] hydrochloride. Proteins from aliquots of the crude sonicates were separated on 10% polyacrylamide SDS-PAGE, 1 mm dithiothreitol gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations). The membrane was blocked with 5% milk and incubated with either affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse HSL immunoglobulin (6Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch), sheep horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse whole phosphatase color development method (Bio-Rad), or by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively. DNA Assay—Sonicated whole cell homogenates were mixed a solution containing 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.02% sodium azide. Standards were prepared by diluting calf thymus double-stranded DNA in the phosphate buffer ranging from 0 to 1500 ng/ml. Samples and standards were incubated with 15 μg/ml bisbenzamide (Molecular Probes) in phosphate buffer containing 2 m NaCl for 10 min. Fluorescence was detected by a LS50B luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (356 nm excitation wavelength and at 458 nm emission wavelength). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Five days after the induction of differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes on coverslips were incubated with 10 μm isoproterenol in the serum-free medium, described above, containing 3% fatty acid free bovine albumin (ICN Biochemicals) at 37 °C. After 20 min of incubation, cells were fixed by 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Biofluids) for 1 h. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized, quenched, and blocked in PBS containing 1 mg/ml saponin (Sigma), 10 mm glycine (ICN Biochemicals), and 1.25 mg/ml goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for another hour. Immunostainning was carried out by incubating cells with affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse HSL (6Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Kodak) for overnight. After three washes with 0.1% saponin in PBS, Oregon green goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes) or anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes), respectively, was incubated with cells for 1 h. Cells were washed three times and mounted with 10 mg/ml p-paraphenylenediamine in 10% PBS and 90% glycerol. The signal was detected with a Zeiss LSM 510 Laser Scanning confocal microscope. Glycerol Assay—3T3-L1 adipocytes on 24-well plates, 5 days after induction of differentiation, were incubated with 200 μl of PBS containing 3% fatty acid-free bovine albumin (ICN Biochemicals) with or without 10 μm isoproterenol for indicated periods of time. 50 μl of the samples were removed from the cells, and the amount of glycerol released from the cells was determined radiometrically based on the microtiter plate method as described (6Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). HSL Activity Assay—3T3-L1 fibroblasts and adipocytes were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm benzamidine by 10 strokes in a Teflon/glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1400 × g for 10 min. The fat cake was removed, and the infranatant was taken for assay of HSL activity according to Holm et al. (13Holm C. Contreras J.A. Verger R. Schotz M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Expression and Activities of FLAG-tagged HSLs—To examine the regulation of HSL translocation, we introduced native and mutated forms of HSL into 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes using infection with the pBabe retroviral vector. Serine to alanine mutations were introduced into the three PKA sites, Ser-563, Ser-659, and Ser-660, as well as into the putative AMP kinase site, Ser-655. A double mutation (Ser-659/Ser-660 to Ala) was also produced, since it was found that simultaneous mutation of these two serines eliminated the in vitro PKA-stimulated activation of HSL (3Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). The expression levels of the ectopic HSL-FLAG proteins and the endogenous HSL are compared in Fig. 1A, which shows that all of the ectopic HSLs, both native and mutated, were expressed at levels three to five times greater than the endogenous HSL. In preliminary experiments the FLAG epitope was placed at either the N or C terminus of HSL, and it was found that translocation to lipid droplets upon stimulation was detectable only with HSL species carrying the FLAG epitope at the C terminus (data not shown). Accordingly, all mutated HSL constructs examined in this work were modified with the FLAG epitope at the C terminus. Moreover, as noted under “Materials and Methods,” double infection with the pBabe retrovirus was required to achieve sufficient levels of HSL-FLAGs for detection by immunofluorescence. Also, it was necessary to perform such studies no later than 5 days after the initiation of differentiation, since after day 5 the expression of HSL-FLAGs declined precipitously, to the point that they were no longer detectable by IF microscopy (Fig. 1A). The data presented herein are representative of five different experiments in which the 3T3-L1 cells were infected with the various HSL constructs, both singly and doubly, and HSL translocation for each construct was examined from 10 min to 1 h after isoproterenol stimulation. The criterion for HSL translocation was the appearance of smooth, uniform rings of staining at the periphery of the lipid droplets. The constructs we designate as non-translocating failed to show such images in any experiment either shortly after stimulation or after prolonged stimulation. HSL activities in homogenates of cells expressing ectopic HSL-FLAG contained approximately four to five times greater lipase activity than cells expressing only endogenous HSL, which is in good agreement with the findings of the immunoblotting, and indicates that the ectopic HSL was active. For example, cells expressing ectopic native HSL-FLAG exhibited lipase activity of 289 ± 25 nmol triolein hydrolyzed per h per μl of homogenate infranate versus 72 ± 4 nmol/h/μl of infranate from cells infected with the empty pBabe vector. Surprisingly, despite their increased HSL content and activity neither basal nor stimulated lipolysis in intact cells was increased in cells with the excess ectopic HSL. Indeed, the only change observed was a slight inhbition of lipolytic activity in the cells expressing the HSL-FLAG. Similar data were observed upon stimulation of cells with either non-hydrolyzable cAMP (Table I) analogs or with isoproterenol (data not shown). This failure to find differences among the different types of cells applied to both maximal and submaximal concentrations of the simulating agents.Table IOverexpression of HSL-FLAG does not increase cellular lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytesCAMP analog concentrationspBabewt HSL-FLAG500/250137 ± 12102 ± 3250/12588 ± 576 ± 2125/62.586 ± 1162 ± 362.5/3255 ± 243 ± 232/1646 ± 129 ± 116/836 ± 122 ± 18/431 ± 229 ± 1 Open table in a new tab Double Mutation of Ser-659 → Ala and Ser-660 → Ala Eliminates HSL Translocation—When introduced into 3T3-L1 adipocytes, all FLAG-HSL constructs were distributed throughout the cytosol in unstimulated adipocytes (Fig. 2A), although, unlike endogenous HSL which is distributed diffusely in the cytosol (6Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the ectopic HSL-FLAGs presented a more punctate distribution; this is especially evident in cells with relatively low levels of expression. Upon stimulation of cells with isoproterenol under conditions known to induce the translocation of native HSL to lipid droplet (6Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the constructs, including FLAG-tagged wt HSL and HSL-FLAGs containing single mutations in each of the three PKA sites, translocated to lipid droplets (Fig. 2B), as indicated by the bright, uniform rings of staining at the periphery of lipid droplets. The only species with mutations within PKA sites that failed to translocate was the double Ser-659 → Ala/Ser-660 → Ala mutant, suggesting that phosphorylation of at least one of these sites is required for the translocation of HSL. All constructs were examined in five separate retroviral infections, and the cells were observed from between 10 and 60 min of stimulation. Typically, those species judged to translocate showed evidence of movement to droplets in the majority of cells, showing the typical uniform bright rings of staining at the periphery of lipid droplets. Mutation of Ser-565 and Ser-423 Eliminates HSL Translocation—In addition to those serines phosphorylated by PKA in HSL, we have mutated Ser-565, named the basal phosphorylation site, and Ser-423, that forms part of the catalytic triad of HSL (14Holm C. Davis R.C. Osterlund T. Schotz M.C. Fredrikson G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ser-565 has been reported to be phosphorylated by AMP-activated kinase (but not by PKA). This site was originally named the basal phosphorylation site, because it was found to be phosphorylated even under conditions were lipolysis was not stimulated (i.e. under basal conditions) (15Stralfors P. Bjorgell P. Belfrage P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3317-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at this site is thought to preclude phosphorylation at Ser-563 by PKA, and it has therefore been proposed that phoshorylation of Ser-565 could have an antilipolytic role. Unexpectedly, mutating Ser-565 into Ala also abolished the translocation of HSL to the lipid droplets (Fig. 2), and in no case was this mutation observed to translocate over the course of five different experiments. To further illustrate the failure of Ser-565 → Ala HSL-FLAG to translocate, we compared the time course of translocation of the endogenous HSL and ser565ala-FLAG in the same population of cells. (Fig. 3). It is readily evident that the endogenous HSL translocated to lipid droplets rapidly and that the mutated FLAG-tagged species did not translocate. Moreover, the data indicate that the expression of excess Ser-565 → Ala HSL does not interfere with the movement of the endogenous lipase. The data are in accord with the findings of Birnbaum and colleagues, 2M. Birnbaum, personal communication. who have found that expression of a dominant-negative form of AMP-kinase inhibits lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Ser-423, together with Asp-703 and His-733, forms the catalytic triad of HSL. Accordingly, mutating Ser-423 abolishes HSL catalytic activity (14Holm C. Davis R.C. Osterlund T. Schotz M.C. Fredrikson G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We tested whether catalytic competence is necessary for HSL to translocate to lipid droplet by introducing a FLAG-tagged construct of HSL containing the Ser-423 → Ala mutation. The results show that mutating this active site residue also abolishes the ability of the protein to translocate to the lipid droplets upon stimulation of the cells with isoproterenol (Fig. 4). Acute regulation of lipolysis in the adipose tissue allows mammals and other organisms to adjust the supply of energy substrates to the peripheral tissues according to their metabolic needs at any given time. Until recently, it was believed that the acute regulation of lipolysis relied solely on the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation and subsequent activation/deactivation of HSL in the adipocytes. More recent developments have shown, however, that the process is significantly more complex, and a role for at least one other protein, perilipin A, in the regulation of lipolysis has become apparent (9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 161: 1093-1103Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The clue to the dramatic changes in the lipolytic rate of intact adipocytes upon exposure to cathecholamines (lipolytic) or insulin (antilipolytic) resides in the subcellular distribution of HSL (5Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8537-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 6Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of the stored triglycerides. In a separate paper, we demonstrate that perilipin A plays an essential role in both preventing the interaction of HSL with its natural substrate (the lipid droplets) under non-stimulated conditions and allowing activated translocation upon stimulation of cells with catecholamines (9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 161: 1093-1103Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Thus, we show that phosphorylation of perilipin A at its N-terminal PKA sites is required to allow the translocation of HSL from the cytosol to the surface of the lipid droplets. This finding raised the question of whether phosphorylation of perilipin A sufficed to allow the translocation of HSL or whether phosphorylation of HSL was also required for this phenomenon to occur. To address this issue, in the present work we have introduced mutated forms of HSL, tagged at its C terminus with the FLAG epitope, into 3T3-L1 cells using the pBabe retroviral system. The stable transfectants obtained were used, upon differentiation into adipocytes, to investigate the ability of the different HSL mutants to translocate to the lipid droplets. To achieve sufficient expression of HSL to enable detection of the FLAG-tagged HSL species, double infections with the pBabe retroviral constructs were necessary. Subsequently, HSL tagged in the C terminus with the FLAG epitope could be easily detected in the cells, and translocation of the tagged lipase was readily evident upon stimulation of the cells with catecholamines. We found that single mutations of each of the serines phosphorylated by PKA in HSL have no effect on the ability of HSL to translocate from the cytosol to the lipid storage droplets in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. However, double mutation of the two C-terminal sites, Ser-659 and Ser-660, prevented HSL translocation. This result demonstrates that phosphorylation of at least one of these two sites of HSL is required to induce HSL to change its subcellular location and to therefore activate lipolysis. We also found that mutation of Ser-423, the catalytic serine, prevented HSL translocation, indicating that only the fully functional enzyme can translocate. This finding is not entirely surprising, since mutations in the active site serine can lead to substantial conformational alterations in lipases, modifying their binding capacity to lipids (16Peters G.H. Svendsen A. Langberg H. Vind J. Patkar S.A. Toxvaerd S. Kinnunen P.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12375-12383Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). More surprising was the finding that mutation of Ser-565 also prevented HSL translocation. This site is not phosphorylated by PKA in response to catecholamines stimulation, but rather seems to be constitutively phosphorylated in non-stimulated adipocytes. Phosphorylation of Ser-565 has been proposed to have an antilipolytic role by precluding phosphorylation of Ser-563 by PKA (17Garton A.J. Campbell D.G. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Colbran R.J. Yeaman S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, the fact that phosphorylation of Ser-563 does not seem to be required neither for HSL activation in vitro (3Anthonsen M.W. Ronnstrand L. Wernstedt C. Degerman E. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 215-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) nor for the translocation of HSL to the surface of the droplets, the current evidence challenges the proposed antilipolytic role of Ser-565. One possible explanation for the inability of the HSL Ser-565-Ala mutant to translocate could be that phosphorylation of Ser-565 may serve a structural role, and mutating Ser-565 to Ala causes a local structural disturbance that prevents the conformational changes required for the translocation of HSL upon phosphorylation of Ser-659 or Ser-660. Examining model systems in which the relevant protein kinases for this site are ablated could cast light on the role of Ser-565 in lipolysis, if any. Unfortunately, the lipolysis experiments do not provide any information on the contribution of HSL phosphorylation to the activity of HSL other than its delivery to the lipid droplet substrate, since cellular lipolytic activity was not increased in the presence of excess active HSL. Similar findings have been reported recently by Lucas et al. (18Lucas S. Tavernier G. Tiraby C. Mairal A. Langin D. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 154-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that the expression of excess active human HSL does not contribute to increased lipolysis in murine adipocytes. In conclusion, the data presented in the present study, plus those in a parallel paper from this laboratory (9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 161: 1093-1103Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar), show that the activation of lipolysis in the adipocytes requires the concerted phosphorylation of both HSL and perilipin. It is clear that HSL translocation is not merely secondary to whatever changes of the droplet surface are rendered upon phosphorylation of perilipin A, as the present paper demonstrates that specific PKA sites within HSL are required to achieve translocation. The precise mechanism by which HSL accumates at the lipid droplet remains a mystery. Previously, we demonstrated a lack of involvement of cytoskeletal systems in this process, since a variety of cytoskeletal poisons failed to interfere with HLS translocation (6Brasaemle D.L. Levin D.M. Adler-Wailes D.C. Londos C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1483: 251-262Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The simplest scenario would be that the translocation merely reflects an increased affinity of HSL for its substrate, whereas phosphorylation of perilipin A would trigger conformational changes in this protein that would clear the access of HSL to the lipids. This speculation is supported in part by the finding that catalytically inactive HSL, in which the catalytic site serine 423 was mutated, is unable to translocate to lipid droplets, presumably due to a reduced ability to bind to its substrate. However, the possibility of more complex protein-protein interactions between HSL, perilipin, and/or third proteins on the surface of the lipid droplets cannot be discarded and should be the focus of future investigations.

Presently, we have only a limited understanding of the signaling cascades and effector proteins through which changes in the cytoskeletal architecture are mediated. The present study identifies phospholipase Cγ2 (PLCγ2) as an important target of the Src-dependent signaling cascade regulated by αIIbβ3. Real time phasecontrast microscopy is used to show that formation of filopodia and lamellapodia in murine platelets on a fibrinogen surface is dramatically inhibited in the absence of PLCγ2. Significantly, the formation of these structures is mediated by Ca2+ elevation and activation of protein kinase C, both directly regulated by PLC activity. With the involvement of Syk, SLP-76, and Btk, αIIbβ3-induced PLCγ2 activation partly overlaps with the pathway used by the collagen receptor glycoprotein VI. Important differences, however, exist between the two signaling cascades in that activation of PLCγ2 by αIIbβ3 is unaltered in murine platelets, which lack the FcR γ-chain or the adaptor LAT, but is abolished in the presence of cytochalasin D. Therefore, PLCγ2 plays not only a crucial role in activation of αIIbβ3 by collagen receptors but also in αIIbβ3-mediated responses.

Therefore, PLCγ2 plays not only a crucial role in activation of αIIbβ3 by collagen receptors but also in αIIbβ3-mediated responses. The integrin αIIbβ3 mediates platelet aggregation in cell suspensions and supports adhesion to fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWf) 1The abbreviations used are: vWf, von Willebrand factor; 2-ABP, 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; FcR γ-chain, Fc receptor γ-chain; Fura 2-AM, Fura 2-acetoxymethylester; PRP, platelet-rich plasma; GPVI, glycoprotein VI; PKC, protein kinase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PLCγ2, phospholipase Cγ2; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoyl)ethane-N, N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid.-coated surfaces. On resting platelets, the integrin is in a low affinity conformation that does not support binding to either adhesion molecule at their normal plasma concentrations. An increase in affinity of αIIbβ3, leading to fibrinogen and vWf binding, is mediated by inside-out signals from G protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase-linked agonists, and thereby promotes aggregation. In addition, binding to αIIbβ3 induces outside-in signals that lead to reorganization of the cytoskeleton and synergize with other agonists to mediate activation. The central role of the integrin αIIbβ3 in thrombosis and hemostasis is highlighted by the severe bleeding disorders in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, which lack functional integrin. One of the earlier events to occur following ligation of αIIbβ3 is the activation of the tyrosine kinase Syk via one or more Src kinases (1Miranti C.K. Leng L. Maschberger P. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J.

Recently, we have shown that αIIbβ3 as well as the receptor for vWF, the glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX-V complex, stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 (11Wonerow P. Obergfell A. Wilde J.I. Bobe R.

PLCγ2 is known to be a major target of signaling by the collagen receptor GPVI in platelets. GPVI exists in a complex with the Fc receptor γ-chain (FcR γ-chain), which contains one copy of an immunoreceptortyrosine-based activation motif (13Gibbins J.M. Okuma M. Farndale R. Barnes M. Watson S.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). GPVI activates platelets through tyrosine phosphorylation of the FcR γ-chain immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif by the Src kinases Lyn and Fyn and recruitment of Syk (14Briddon S.J.

Syk regulates a cascade that involves the adapters LAT, Gads, and SLP-76, the Tec family kinase Btk, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (17Pasquet J.M. Bobe R. Gross B. Gratacap M.P. Tomlinson M.G.

In contrast, phosphorylation of PLCγ2 downstream of GPIb-IX-V does not lead to a functional activation of the phospholipase suggesting that PLCγ2 activity is not required for GPIb-IX-V-mediated signals (12Marshall S.J. Asazuma N. Best D. Wonerow P. Salmon G. Andrews R.K. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The role of PLCγ2 downstream of the fibrinogen receptor αIIbβ3 is not known. In the present study, we show that PLCγ2 is activated downstream of the fibrinogen receptor αIIbβ3 and that this plays a critical role in spreading through the mobilization of calcium and activation of protein kinase C. In addition, we also identify a number of additional proteins that are regulated downstream of the integrin-regulated signaling cascade but demonstrate important differences with the cascade used by GPVI. The present study expands the role of the PLCγ2 in platelet activation by demonstrating a central role in remodeling of the cytoskeleton by immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and integrin receptors.

Preparation of Human Platelets—Human blood was taken from drug-free volunteers on the day of the experiment and drawn into sodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by centrifugation of the blood samples at 200 × g for 20 min. Platelets were isolated from PRP by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml). The pellet was resuspended in modified Tyrode's-HEPES buffer (134 mm NaCl, 0,34 mm Na2HPO4, 2,9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3) containing 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin. The platelets were recentrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min and resuspended at 5 × 108 cells/ml in Tyrode's-HEPES buffer. Preparation of Mouse Platelets—Blood (750–1000 μl) was taken into 100 μl of acid citrate dextrose by cardiac puncture under terminal CO2 narcosis. PRP was obtained by centrifugation of the blood samples at 300 × g for 10 min at room temperature. PRP was centrifuged at 1000 × g in the presence of prostacyclin (0.1 μg/ml) for 6 min at room temperature. The pellet was resuspended in a modified Tyrode's-HEPES buffer to the required concentration and left for 30 min at room temperature prior to stimulation. Adhesion Assays—Surfaces (Petri dishes, 6 well plates, coverslips) were coated with fibrinogen (200 μg/ml) or BSA (5 mg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Surfaces were washed twice with PBS, blocked with denatured BSA (5 mg/ml) for 1 h, and washed again twice with PBS before use in the spreading experiments. Platelets did not adhere or become activated to surfaces coated with BSA. To study tyrosine phosphorylation events in response to ligation to αIIbβ3, platelets (5 × 108) were incubated for 30 min in dishes coated with fibrinogen or BSA in the presence of 2 units/ml apyrase and 10 μm indomethacin (24Haimovich B. Lipfert L. Brugge J.S. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15868-15877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dishes coated with fibrinogen were washed twice with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Platelets adherent to fibrinogen or in suspension over BSA were lysed in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation assays or used directly for SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Resting and convulxin-stimulated platelets (5 × 108/ml, 500 μl) were lysed by adding an equal volume of ice-cold IP buffer (2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.3). Samples were pre-cleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A- or G-Sepharose (50% (w/v) in Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20 (TBS-T: 20 mm Tris, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6). Antibodies were added and samples were rotated overnight at 4 °C. The Sepharose pellet was washed sequentially in lysis buffer and TBS-T before addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and electrically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 10% (w/v) BSA dissolved in TBS-T. Antibodies were diluted in TBS-T containing 2% (w/v) BSA and incubated with polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in TBS-T after each incubation and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Cardiff, United Kingdom). Measurement of Platelet Cytosolic Ca2 + Concentration—Platelets isolated from PRP were resuspended in modified Tyrode's-HEPES buffer to a concentration of 3 × 108 cells/ml and incubated with Fura 2-acetoxymethylester (Fura 2-AM, 3 μm, 1 h, 30 °C) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). After being washed in Tyrode's-HEPES buffer, platelets were resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in the presence of 2 units/ml apyrase and 10 μm indomethacin. Platelets were allowed to spread on a fibrinogen-coated coverslip and real time calcium imaging was performed using Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Microscopy—Platelets (1.5 × 107 in 0.5 ml of Tyrode's-HEPES buffer) were added to fibrinogen-coated coverslips and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Non-adherent platelets were washed away and attached platelets were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Platelets were stained for F-actin with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and viewed under an inverted fluorescence microscope using Openlab imaging software (Improvision). Platelet spreading was observed in real time at 37 °C and recorded using time-lapse laser scanning phase-contrast microscopy. The system consisted of a Bio-Rad Microradiance laser scanning instrument (Bio-Rad) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope equipped with a Solent Scientific environmental chamber; a Ph3 Plan-apochromat 63 × 1.4 NA objective was used and the images were acquired using Laser-sharp 2000 (version 4.2) software. Determination of Phosphatidic Acid Production—Platelets were suspended in Tyrode's-HEPES without phosphate and were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.5 mCi/ml) for 1 h at 30 °C. Platelets were washed twice and resuspended in Tyrode's buffer at a concentration of 5 × 108/ml. Platelets were incubated for 30 min in 6-well plates (5 × 108/well) coated with fibrinogen or over BSA in the presence of 2 units/ml apyrase and 10 μm indomethacin. Dishes coated with fibrinogen were washed twice with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Platelets adherent to fibrinogen or in suspension over BSA were lysed in a buffer containing 100 mm EDTA, 5 n HCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40. Phospholipids were extracted by addition of 400 μl of chloroform-methanol-HCl (100/200/1, v/v/v), and [32P]phosphatidic acid was separated by thin-layer chromatography. Thin-layer chromatography plates were exposed to Kodak PhosphorScreen and phosphatidic acid signals were quantified using Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One Software version 4 for Macintosh (Bio-Rad) Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test. Differential Effects of Cytochalasin D on α IIb β 3 and GPVI-induced Phosphorylation—It has been shown previously that tyrosine phosphorylation by αIIbβ3 is regulated through activation of a Src family kinase and that it is modulated by disruption of actin polymerization using cytochalasin D (2Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus αIIbβ3-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation events can be divided into those that are mediated upstream and downstream of actin polymerization. We have compared the effect of the actin polymerization inhibitor cytochalasin D and the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 on signals mediated by αIIbβ3 and GPVI. Stimulation of αIIbβ3 was achieved by incubation of platelets over a fibrinogen-coated matrix for 30 min. GPVI was activated with the snake toxin convulxin under stirring conditions in suspension using an incubation time of 30 s, a time point known to be the peak for tyrosine phosphorylation induced by this agonist. αIIbβ3 and GPVI induce overlapping patterns of increases in tyrosine phosphorylation as measured using whole cell lysates. Both stimuli induced marked increases in tyrosine-phosphorylated bands of 70–80 kDa, which co-migrate with Syk, Btk, and SLP-76. The constitutively phosphorylated bands between 50 and 60 kDa co-migrate with Src family kinases. There is also a marked increase in a band of 130 kDa and a number of minor bands around this molecular mass in response to the two agonists. In contrast, a doublet of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with a molecular mass between 28 kDa and 32 kDa is regulated downstream of αIIbβ3 but not by GPVI (Fig. 1A, arrows). Convulxin stimulates marked tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins of 36 and 12 kDa, which co-migrate with LAT and the FcR γ-chain, respectively (Fig. 1A, arrows). Both signaling cascades are strongly dependent on the presence of functionally active Src kinases. Incubation of platelets with 20 μm PP2 causes a complete loss of inducible tyrosine phosphorylation following convulxin stimulation and markedly inhibits the response to fibrinogen, although tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa band is preserved (Fig. 1A, arrow). Cytochalasin D has a distinct effect on the degree of phosphorylation by αIIbβ3 and GPVI. Whereas the response to GPVI is only slightly inhibited by 10 μm cytochalasin D, there is a marked reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of all bands by αIIbβ3 showing that it has a much greater dependence on the reorganization of the cytoskeleton (Fig. 1A). As a prelude to comparing the signaling cascades regulated by αIIbβ3 and GPVI, we investigated some of the proteins that undergo increases in tyrosine phosphorylation following incubation of platelets over a fibrinogen-coated matrix for 30 min through immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies and Western blotting with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10. In agreement with studies from other groups, platelet spreading over fibrinogen leads to a substantial phosphorylation of the integrin β3 subunit (Fig. 1C), tyrosine kinase Syk, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (Fig. 1B), adapter proteins SLP-76 (Fig. 1C) and SLAP-130 as well as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav1 and the ubiquitin-regulator c-Cbl (not shown). In addition, we identified a number of proteins that have been previously shown to be phosphorylated downstream of GPVI, namely the FcR γ-chain, the Tec family tyrosine kinase Btk (Fig. 1C), as well as PLCγ2 (Fig. 1B). The adapter molecules Grb2 and Gads were also recruited to signaling complexes downstream of αIIbβ3 and formed associations with unidentified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 32, 55, and 150 kDa, and 50, 76, and 130 kDa, respectively (not shown). There was, however, one important omission in the proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of αIIbβ3 relative to GPVI, namely the adapter LAT. Whereas LAT is one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins downstream of GPVI we were not able to detect an increase in LAT phosphorylation after αIIbβ3 stimulation (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that platelet adhesion to fibrinogen leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and identifies many similarities but also important differences with the events regulated downstream of GPVI. The effect of cytochalasin D and PP2 on phosphorylation of Syk, LAT, FAK, and PLCγ2 by αIIbβ3 and GPVI was explored following their immunoprecipitation and Western blotting for phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk induced by αIIbβ3 and convulxin was reduced in the presence of cytochalasin D (Fig. 1B) and abolished in the presence of PP2 (not shown). In contrast, cytochalasin D had a differential effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of a band of 12 kDa, which co-precipitates with Syk and was shown through immunoprecipitation studies to be the FcR γ-chain (not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain by αIIbβ3 was abolished by treatment with cytochalasin D, whereas it was only slightly inhibited in convulxin-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B, arrows). This demonstrates that tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain is dependent on actin polymerization in response to αIIbβ3. As already discussed, αIIbβ3 does not cause phosphorylation of LAT. In contrast LAT is strongly phosphorylated downstream of GPVI and this phosphorylation is reduced following cytochalasin D treatment (Fig. 1B) and abolished after inhibition of Src kinases with PP2 (not shown). In contrast αIIbβ3 stimulation induces a robust, cytochalasin D-sensitive phosphorylation of FAK, whereas convulxin stimulation only causes minimal tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (Fig. 1B) even at times up to 30 min (not shown). Cytochalasin D had a differential effect on the regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 by αIIbβ3 and GPVI. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2by αIIbβ3 was almost abolished in the presence of cytochalasin D, whereas the response to convulxin was inhibited by ∼50% (Fig. 1B). PP2 completely blocked tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 by both receptors (not shown). The differential effect of cytochalasin D on tyrosine phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain and PLCγ2 by αIIbβ3 and GPVI further distinguishes the two signaling cascades. Thus, activation of Syk by αIIbβ3 is independent of phosphorylation of FcR γ-chain and signals from the kinase are not mediated through tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT. In contrast, Syk is regulated downstream of FcR γ-chain by GPVI (25Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) and signals are associated with robust phosphorylation of LAT. The differential role of FcR γ-chain in these two pathways agrees with previous work from the Shattil group (26Obergfell A. Buensuceso C. Shattil S.J. Blood. 100. The American Society of Hematology, Philadelphia2002: 122aGoogle Scholar) showing that activation of Syk by αIIbβ3 is through a Src kinase-dependent pathway but does not require prior phosphorylation of an immunoreceptor tyrosinebased activation motif-containing protein. Phosphorylation of PLCγ2 Downstream of α IIb β 3 Is Independent of the Adapter LAT and Fc Receptor γ-Chain—Previously, we have reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 through GPVI is abolished in FcR γ-chain-deficient murine platelets, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 is markedly reduced in LAT-deficient cells (21Pasquet J.M. Gross B. Quek L. Asazuma N. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Schweighoffer E. Tybulewicz V. Judd B. Lee J.R. Koretzky G. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Watson S.P. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the role of these two proteins in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 by αIIbβ3. Adhesion of murine platelets to fibrinogen induced a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2, similar to that seen in human platelets. This increase in phosphorylation was not altered in platelets deficient in FcR γ-chain or LAT (Fig. 2). Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter SLP-76 by fibrinogen was unaltered in platelets deficient in FcR γ-chain or LAT (Fig. 2B). As with human platelets, FcR γ-chain coprecipitated with Syk upon stimulation by αIIbβ3. This association was preserved in LAT-deficient platelets (Fig. 2A, arrow). These results confirm that neither FcR γ-chain nor LAT are required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk and PLCγ2 by αIIbβ3 in contrast to signals from GPVI. α IIb β 3 Stimulates Activation of PLCγ2, Calcium Elevation, and Spreading—The functional consequence of PLCγ2 phosphorylation downstream of αIIbβ3 was investigated by measurement of phosphatidic acid and intracellular calcium, two indirect markers of PLC activity. Platelets spread on a fibrinogen-coated surface had a 2.4 ± 0.1-fold increase in the production of phosphatidic acid relative to cells exposed to a BSA-coated surface (p = 0.005, Fig. 3A). The increase in phosphatidic acid was inhibited strongly in the presence of cytochalasin D (1.5 ± 0.1-fold) and reduced to basal levels using the PLC inhibitor U-73122 (0.96 ± 0.13-fold). PP2 also caused a complete inhibition of phosphatidic acid accumulation, reducing the level below that of cells exposed to BSA (0.57 ± 0.11-fold), strongly suggesting that the increase is mediated via PLCγ rather than PLCβ isoforms (Fig. 3A). To further clarify the role of PLCγ2 downstream of αIIbβ3 we determined the production of phosphatidic acid in PLCγ2-deficient murine platelets. As seen in human platelets, spreading of murine platelets on fibrinogen caused an increase in the production of phosphatidic acid (1.5 ± 0.08-fold) relative to cells exposed to a BSA-coated surface (1.0 ± 0.05-fold). This increase was inhibited following cytochalasin D treatment (0.90 ± 0.12-fold) and in PLCγ2- (1.13 ± 0.10-fold) deficient platelets (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that PLCγ2 is the main enzyme responsible for the increase in phosphatidic acid following spreading of platelets on fibrinogen. The increase in formation of phosphatidic acid was associated with a sustained increase in intracellular calcium, as measured using the calcium reporter Fura 2 (delivered as Fura 2-AM). All of the platelets that had undergone partial or complete spreading on fibrinogen had elevated levels of intracellular calcium. Moreover, the increase in calcium and spreading (measured by monitoring fluorescence at 380 nm) occurred in parallel as illustrated in Fig. 4B suggesting that they are causally related. The calcium increase was observed 2–3 min after the initial contact with the fibrinogen-coated surface and is accompanied by the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia. The increase in intracellular calcium and spreading were substantially inhibited by cytochalasin D and PP2 although they had only minimal effects on attachment of the platelets to the fibrinogen-coated surfaces (Fig. 4A). Calcium elevation and spreading was also strongly inhibited by 2-ABP an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor antagonist. The increase in intracellular calcium was specific for αIIbβ3 because it was"

However, hHR23B and RAD23 also have many important functions related to general proteolysis. hHR23B consists of N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UbL), ubiquitin association 1 (UBA1), xeroderma pigmentosum group C binding, and UBA2 domains. The UBA domains interact with ubiquitin (Ub) and inhibit the assembly of polyubiquitin.

Interestingly, the surfaces of UbL and Ub that bind to UBA1, UBA2, and PUbS2 are similar, consisting of five β-strands and their connecting loops. This is the first report that an intramolecular interaction between UbL and UBA domains is possible, and this interaction could be important for the control of proteolysis by hHR23B.

The loss of yeast homologue of hHR23B results in decreased nucleotide excision repair activity, and it is likely that RAD23 stabilizes Rad4 (the yeast homologue of XPC), which is otherwise continually degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (5Russell S.J.

Experiments with knockout mice carrying a homozygous loss of the gene encoding either mHR23A or mHR23B showed that these two proteins are functionally redundant in terms of response to DNA damage by UV light. However, the double knockout mouse was not viable, and only cell lines were established from the embryos. Interestingly, the XPC protein is absent from the double knockout cells but could be detected again after treatment with a proteasome inhibitor. The mHR23B knockout mouse, but not the mHR23A knockout, showed defects in postnatal growth, suggesting that mHR23B may have functions beyond those related to XPC and DNA repair (7Ng J.M. Vrieling H.

Deletion of the UbL domain of RAD23 in yeast gives rise to a sensitivity to UV irradiation that was intermediate between those of wild-type and ΔRAD23 strains (5Russell S.J. Reed S.H. Huang W.

RAD23 and DDI1 were originally identified as the suppressors of a temperature-sensitive pds1 mutant; the pds1 gene encodes a protein that controls the late S phase checkpoint in yeast and becomes polyubiquitinated and degraded. The Pds1 temperature-sensitive mutant protein is more rapidly degraded than the wild type in non-permissive temperature. However, the UBA domains of RAD23 and DDI1 can suppress degradation of the Pds1 temperature-sensitive mutant protein by preventing polyubiquitination (9Clarke D.J. Mondesert G. Segal M.

RAD23 and DDI1 share common motifs, including the N-terminal UbL and C-terminal UBA domains, and could form both homo- and heterodimers (14Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M.

Another binding study using surface plasmon resonance showed that the fission yeast protein Mud1 (the orthologue of budding yeast DDI1) has a higher affinity for tetra-Ub than for mono-Ub (16Wilkinson C.R.

S5a has two well conserved multiubiquitin binding sites (PubS1 and PubS2) and displays a much higher affinity for octa-Ub than for tetra-Ub (18Young P. Deveraux Q. Beal R.E. Pickart C.M.

S5a is the only component of the proteasome that can reside outside of the 26 S proteasome complex, and it is supposed to be a shuttle delivering polyubiquitinated, degradable protein substrates into the proteasome (12Hiyama H.

Deletion of the yeast homologue of S5a (Rpn10) from wild-type yeast yields no serious biological defects; however, the ΔRpn10/ΔRAD23 double mutant displays growth and proteolytic defects (20Lambertson D.

Taking into account all these data, the current model of RAD23 function is that RAD23 delivers polyubiquitinated degradable proteins into the proteasome in an Rpn10-dependent manner (8Chen L.

Biol. 1993; 13: 7757-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) showed that the UbL domain of RAD23 could be functionally replaced by Ub in yeast. Recently, it was shown that the N-teminal Ub of Ub-RAD23, in which the UbL domain is replaced by Ub, is multiubiquitinated in vivo, and this promotes the binding of Ub-RAD23 to S5a (23Lambertson D. Chen L. Madura K. Curr. Genet. 2003; 42: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Many studies have been performed to attempt to elucidate the function of hHR23B (RAD23) in 26 S proteasome-dependent proteolysis, but a precise pathway could not be determined until now. Here, we use NMR techniques to study the three-dimensional structure of the UbL domain of hHR23B and the individual interactions among UbL, UBA1, UBA2, S5a of PUbS2, and ubiquitin, including the determination of binding constants for each domain. We were interested in determining the mode of hHR23B-dependent regulation in protein degradation and in elucidating why hHR23B has both a UbL and UBA domain. From our studies, we observed clear domain-domain interactions between (i) UbL and UBA1 and UBA2; (ii) Ub and UBA1 and UBA2; and (iii) UbL, Ub, and PUbS2 of S5a. Clonings and Protein Purification—The genes that encode hHR23B and the PUbS2 of S5a (81 amino acids, 263–343) were generously provided by Prof. Hanaoka. The UbL domain (82 amino acids, 1–82) was subcloned into the pET15B vector (NdeI/BamHI). The UBA1 (49 amino acids, 185–233) and UBA2 (50 amino acids, 361–410) domains, as well as two versions of the PUbS2 of S5a (45 and 53 amino acids, 263–307 and 263–315), were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-3 vector (BamHI/XhoI) for high levels of expression. PUbS2 of S5a (an 81-amino-acid fragment) has a trimeric hydrodynamic molecular weight from gel permeation chromatography (actually, it is dimeric), but 45-amino-acid and 53-amino-acid forms showed the expected molecular weight in gel permeation chromatography. The Ub gene was isolated from a mammalian expression vector with the hemagglutinin-tagged Ub gene, which was a gift from Dr. Daeyoup Lee, and subcloned into pET15B using the same restriction enzyme sites as for the UbL domain. The correct subclonings were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Ub and UbL domains were purified using a His tag column (Qiagen). UBA1, UBA2, and PUbS2 (the 45-amino-acid and 53-amino-acid fragments) were purified using a glutathione S-transferase affinity column (Amersham Biosciences), and the N-terminal His tag and glutathione S-transferase were removed also by thrombin digestion. All domains were further purified using a Superdex75 column (Amersham Biosciences). For preparation of isotope-labeled proteins, we used M9 minimal media supplemented with a vitamin mixture and trace metal solutions. In the case of PUbS2, we used the 53-amino-acid fragment for further experiments because it had higher expression level and stability during the purification. NMR Experiments and Structure Calculation—NMR samples were prepared in the buffer solution containing 7.5% D2O (50 mm sodium phosphate and 100 mm sodium chloride, pH 6.0). In the case of UBA2, we added 2 mm dithiothreitol to prevent the intermolecular disulfide bridge. All NMR spectra were recorded using a 600-MHz Varian UNITY INOVA. We used general triple resonance experiments for the chemical shift assignments of UbL, Ub, S5a PUbS2, UBA1, and UBA2. For structure determination of the UbL domain, we extracted the NOE distance restraints from the NOESY-N15-HSQC and two-dimensional D2O-NOESY, and we extracted the dihedral angle restraints from TALOS chemical shift analysis (24Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar) and intensity-modulated N15-HSQC experiments (25Permi P. Kilpelainen I. Annila A. Heikkinen S. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 16: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The dihedral angle (Phi) was extracted from the J-coupling constant using the Karplus equation: J(ϕ) = A cos2(ϕ – 60) + B cos(ϕ – 60) + C, where A = 6.51, B = –1.76, C = 1.60 (26Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Structure calculation was performed using Cyana, which combines automated assignment of NOE cross-peaks and structure calculation (27Herrmann T. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 209-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). The UbL structures from Cyana already had a good pairwise backbone root mean square deviation (0.44 Å) and good target functions, but the C-terminal flexible part of the calculated structures is very close to one long α-helix, although there were no distance restraints in that region. We performed further structure calculation (restraint molecular dynamics) using the Amber7 program in a vacuum (28Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Wang J. Ross W.S. Simmerling C. Darden T. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Tsui V. Gohlke H. Radmer R. Duan Y. Pitera J. Massova I. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P. Kollman P.A. Amber 7. University of California, San Francisco2002Google Scholar) including the standard generalized Born model, which can account for the better structures. However, there were serious distance violations when we used the distance restraints from the direct Cyana output, although the distance generation program of Amber introduced the pseudoatom correction. Then we applied an ambiguity distance to the methyl protons of valine and leucine. The calculated structures were overviewed by using PROCHECK program (29Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Chemical Shift Perturbation—N15-HSQC spectra were obtained by varying the ratio of N15-labeled and non-labeled proteins. Protein concentrations were determined using a UV spectrophotometer, and the extinction coefficients of UBA1, UBA2, S5a PUbS2, and Ub were 1480, whereas that of UbL was 2960 (M–1·cm–1) at 280 nm (30Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Although most people use the value of the square root of [0.5 × ΔN 2 + ΔH 2] for chemical shift presentation (17Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 31Shekhtman A. Cowburn D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1222-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we found that the ratios between the summed ΔN and ΔH of all residues varies from ∼5 (N15-labeled Ub) to ∼10 (N15-labeled UbL). Therefore, we added the normalized values of ΔN and ΔH separately for keeping the smaller signal of the ΔH than that of ΔN, such as the percentage of (ΔN i2/ΣΔN i2 + ΔH i2/ΣΔH 12). The binding constants were extracted from the separate fitting of N15 and H chemical shifts to a simple binding equation. All binding interactions were fast exchange processes, and we could trace most of the chemical shift changes by adding counter proteins. However, some peaks with very large perturbations disappeared and reappeared during the courses of titration. NMR Data Manipulations and Three-dimensional Visualizations— The NMR data were processed using NMRpipe (32Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

All structure visualizations were performed with the Chimera (34Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Pettersen E.F. Ferrin T.E. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing. 1996; 1: 724Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (35Koradi R.

Structure of UbL Domain—We first solved the structure of the UbL domain of hHR23B so that we could more accurately analyze the interactions between the various domains that were studied here (Fig. 1). The structure of UbL is very similar to the Ub, and the root mean square deviation of their backbones with secondary structures is only 0.81 Å. The overview of structure is shown in Table I. UbL has four large and one small β-strand (residues 1–7, residues 12–17, residues 44–48, residues 69–74, and residues 51–52, respectively), a long α-helix (residue 23–34), and one turn of α-helix (residues 59–62). There might be another short 310 helix in the vicinity of residues 41–43. The five β-strands form a platform to interact with other proteins, and the long α-helix exists on the other side of this platform. The structure of UbL shows that the UbL domain evolved from an Ub prototype, and its biological functions might be related to the original function of Ub.Table IOverview of structure calculationNumber of peaks for Cyana2262NOESY-N15 HSQC1249D2O-NOESY (with diagonal peak)1013Distance restraints for rMDarMD, restraint molecular dynamics.

Open table in a new tab Binding Surface of the UbL Domain of hHR23B—There are many reports that Ub can specifically interact with the UBA domains (15Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 16Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 37Chen L. Shinde U. Ortolan T.G. Madura K. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 933-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in assessing the interaction between the UbL domain, which is similar to Ub, and UBA domains of hHR23B, and also in comparisons with its binding surface for PUbS2 of S5a. We performed chemical shift perturbation (CSP) experiments with N15-labeled UbL in the presence of UBA1, UBA2, and PUbS2 (Fig. 2). It is interesting and important to note that there is binding between UbL and UBA domains that are present in the same hHR23B protein, although their binding affinity is low (Table II). PUbS2 resulted in strong CSP of the UbL domain, in agreement with a previous report (17Walters K.J. Kleijnen M.F. Goh A.M. Wagner G. Howley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1767-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We attempted to determine the binding constant for PUbS2 and UbL by titrating PUbS2 (20 μm) using CD spectroscopy, but we could not get good binding curves because this interaction is too tight. This means that its binding constant is much less than 10 μm (data not shown). It is possible to infer why UBA1 and UBA2 have a lower binding affinity for UbL than does PUbS2 by comparing the relative heights of CSP in the specific regions (Fig. 2). There are three main chemical shift perturbed regions, at amino acid residues 1–15, 40–60, and 60–80, and all three have similar heights when the PUbS2 interacts with UbL. However, in the case of UBA1 and UBA2, the middle region has a relatively higher CSP when compared with the other two regions. Generally, the binding interface without the extraordinarily high chemical shift perturbing residues, such as a ring current generating or directly hydrogen-bonding residues, could likely produce the equal amount of CSP in the overall interface, and also the area of binding interface could be correlated to the binding strength. Moreover, Ub that has a similar binding surface and higher binding affinity for UBA domains showed the relatively equal amount of summed CSP in these three regions (Fig. 2). Therefore, this could indicate that binding of the UBA domains to UbL depends mainly on the middle region, and the CSP in the other two regions might be caused by the indirect proximity of UBA domains or by the weak interaction during the binding through the prime middle region. However, these different amounts of CSP in these three regions might result from the locally higher effects on chemical shift by UBA molecules because the binding mode of UBA domains for UbL is somewhat different from that of UBA domains to Ub (see below). The binding surface of UbL is mainly formed by the five β-strands, including the loop regions between β1 and β2 and between β3 and β4. It is obvious that residues 48–52 in the β3-bend-β4 region form a major binding surface for the UBA domains, but the binding surface of PUbS2 is well spread over all five β-strands (Fig. 3).Table IIBinding constantsKdUBA1UBA2PUBS2mmUb0.31 ± 0.020aErrors show the value of standard deviation.0.36 ± 0.078aErrors show the value of standard deviation.0.073 ± 0.008aErrors show the value of standard deviation.UbL2.4 ± 0.482aErrors show the value of standard deviation.1.7 ± 0.267aErrors show the value of standard deviation.<0.01bRoughly estimated from the titration of PUbS2 by UbL using CD.a Errors show the value of standard deviation.b Roughly estimated from the titration of PUbS2 by UbL using CD.

Electrostatic potential maps were overlaid on the molecular surface of all domains of hHR23B and Ub with a cutoff value of 10 kT/e. The molecules of (i) UbL and Ub and (ii) UBA1 and UBA2 were matched to have the same surfaces, respectively. The amount of chemical shift perturbation was represented by using the following different colors: violet red, red, orange red, orange, and yellow, respectively, from high to low perturbation residues.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) reported that mono-Ub binds to RAD23 and DDI1 with a 10 μm Kd through the interaction with UBA domains of these proteins, but the fission yeast MUD1, the orthologue of DDI1, has a higher specificity for tetra-Ub. Therefore, we studied the binding surfaces of Ub to ascertain how the UBA domains of hHR23B inhibit multi-Ub formation and to compare it with the binding of PUbS2. In doing so, we hoped to determine the binding specificity of the hHR23B UBA domains to multi-Ub. The CSP patterns showed that Ub binds to the UBA1 and UBA2 domains of hHR23B and to PUbS2 of S5a via the similar surface of UbL (Fig. 2). Mappings of each chemical shift perturbed region on the NMR structure of Ub (38Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Ottiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6840-6841Crossref Scopus (779) Google Scholar) show almost the same patterns as those observed in the UbL (Fig. 3). However, Ub has no locally defined, major binding surface for UBA1, and UBA2, differently from the UbL and the larger surface of Ub, takes part in the interaction with these UBA domains. This finding is reasonable because the binding affinity for the UBA1/2-Ub interactions are high when compared with those of the UbL-UBA interaction (Table II). The binding surface for UBA1/2 on Ub is mainly formed by the same three regions as in UbL. However, Ub showed one additional chemical shift perturbed region (residues 22–36). This region corresponded to the long α-helix that supports the backside of five β-strands, and the CSP in the α-helix might be the result of an indirect effect of PUbS2 binding. We speculated that there might be a secondary binding site for UBA domain in Ub, which would explain the higher binding affinity"

Despite considerable advances in the understanding of copper transfer from copper chaperones to their target, to date, there is no information regarding how the activity of these proteins is regulated in higher eukaryotes. The insertion of copper into the antioxidant enzyme Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) depends on the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS). We have recently reported that CCS protein is increased in tissues of rats fed copper-deficient diets suggesting that copper may regulate CCS expression. Here we show that whereas copper deficiency increased CCS protein in rats, mRNA level was unaffected. Rodent and human cell lines cultured in the presence of the specific copper chelator 2,3,2-tetraamine displayed a dose-dependent increase in CCS protein that could be reversed with the addition of copper but not iron or zinc to the cells. Switching cells from copper-deficient to copper-rich medium promoted the rapid degradation of CCS, which could be blocked by the proteosome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin but not a cysteine protease inhibitor or inhibitors of the lysosomal degradation pathway. In addition, CCS degradation was slower in copper-deficient cells than in cells cultured in copper-rich medium. Together, these data show that copper regulates CCS expression by modulating its degradation by the 26 S proteosome and suggest a novel role for CCS in prioritizing the utilization of copper when it is scarce.

Copper is an essential trace metal and a co-factor for a number of metalloenzymes that function to reduce molecular oxygen. Because of its reactive nature, free copper can participate in reactions that adversely modify proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, which can have detrimental effects on the viability of the cell. Therefore, elaborate mechanisms have evolved to control the uptake and distribution of copper so that in the cell free copper is virtually nonexistent (1Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Copper chaperones are a family of proteins that scavenge for copper in the cell and facilitate incorporation of the metal into specific proteins through direct interaction with their target (2Casareno R.L.

By directly inserting copper into their target, copper chaperones prevent free copper ions from engaging in deleterious reactions in the cell. The copper chaperone HAH1/ATOX1 delivers copper to the P-type intracellular membrane-bound copper transporters ATP7A and ATP7B (5Larin D. Mekios C. Das K. Ross B. Yang A.S. Gilliam T.C. J. Biol.

SOD1 functions as an antioxidant, eliminating toxic superoxide anion radicals. Recently, dominantly inherited mutations in SOD1 have been linked to the fatal motor neuron disorder, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (14Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A.

Pardo C.A. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L.

In vivo, insertion of copper into SOD1 is dependent on the copper chaperone for Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (CCS). In mammals, CCS is a homodimer of ∼33-kDa subunits and is localized mainly to the cytoplasm (2Casareno R.L. Waggoner D. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23625-23628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Corson L.B. Becker M. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Culotta V.C. Wong P.C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Mice genetically engineered to lack CCS show a reduction in SOD1 activity due to the absence of the copper co-factor required for enzymatic activity (18Wong P.C. Waggoner D. Subramaniam J.R. Tessarollo L. Bartnikas T.B. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Rothstein J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). When copper is abundant, CCS is expressed at low levels, and CCS has been estimated to be up to 30-fold less abundant than SOD1 in some tissues (17Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Corson L.B. Becker M. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Culotta V.C. Wong P.C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CCS is composed of three distinct domains. The N-terminal sequence contains an HAH1/ATOX1 copper-binding domain, MXCXXC (M, methionine; X, any amino acid; C, cysteine), and this region has been reported to be required for insertion of copper into SOD1 under conditions where copper is limiting (19Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The central domain is highly homologous to SOD1 and mediates interaction with SOD1. The C-terminal domain is a short sequence that is highly conserved between CCS molecules of different species and contains a CXC motif that can bind copper. Mutations within this motif abrogate copper transfer from CCS to SOD1 (19Schmidt P.J. Rae T.D. Pufahl R.A. Hamma T. Strain J. O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23719-23725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Despite considerable advances in our understanding of the mechanism by which copper chaperones transfer copper to their target (20O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Res. 2001; 34: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), little is known about how the activity of these proteins is regulated. We have recently reported a dose-dependent increase in CCS protein in liver and erythrocytes of rats fed copper-deficient diets (22Bertinato J. Iskandar M. L'Abbe M.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggesting that copper may control CCS expression. In this study, we have explored in more detail the mechanism regulating CCS expression and show that copper determines cellular CCS protein level by modulating the rate of CCS degradation by the 26 S proteosome. Chemicals and Antibodies—The proteosome inhibitors MG132 (carbobenzoxyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucinal) and lactacystin were obtained from Calbiochem and Sigma, respectively. Inhibitors of the lysosomal degradation pathway chloroquine and NH4Cl and the cysteine protease inhibitor calpain inhibitor II (N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-methional-H) were purchased from Sigma. Protein synthesis was blocked with cycloheximide (Sigma). SOD1 and β-tubulin were detected with antibodies FL-154 and H-235 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Generation of the antibody against CCS used to detect CCS by Western blot is described elsewhere (17Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Corson L.B. Becker M. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Culotta V.C. Wong P.C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). CCS antibody FL-274 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to immunoprecipitate CCS in pulse-chase experiments. The specific copper chelator 2,3,2-tetraamine (Aldrich) was used to induce copper deficiency in cultured cell lines. CuSO4·5H2O, ZnSO4·7H2O, and FeSO4·7H2O were added to culture medium from 50 mm aqueous stock solutions. Cell Culture—The rat H4IIE and human HepG2 hepatoma cell lines were cultured in William's Medium E supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes at 30–60% confluency and incubated 16 h prior to experimental treatments. Animals and Test Diets—The animal protocol and test diets have been described in more detail elsewhere (22Bertinato J. Iskandar M. L'Abbe M.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, weanling (21-day-old) male Wistar rats (Charles River Canada) were randomly assigned to one of two diet groups (n = 10/group) and housed individually in wire-bottom stainless steel cages. Rats had free access to demineralized drinking water and one of two test diets nutritionally complete but varying in copper content. Diets were dry-ashed, dissolved in 3 n HCl, and copper content determined by flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry (5100 PC, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Copper-normal and copper-deficient diets contained 5.3 ± 0.06 and 0.34 ± 0.01 mg of copper/kg diet, respectively. After 6 weeks of feeding the diets, rats were killed by exsanguination while under 3% isoflurane anesthesia. Livers were collected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until analysis. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from rat liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 30 μg of total RNA was separated in a 1% agarose gel under denaturing conditions and transferred to a nylon membrane using a vacuum blotter (Boekel Scientific). RNA was cross-linked to the membrane using a UV cross-linker (UVP Laboratory Products). The rat CCS-specific probe was generated by first PCR-amplifying and gel-purifying the rat CCS cDNA from rat liver total RNA using the SuperScript™ One-step reverse transcription-PCR with Platinum® Taq kit (Invitrogen) with CCS-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-ATGGCTTCGAAGTCGGGGGACGGTGGAACT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCAGAGGTGAGCAGGGGGTTGGGCTGAGTC-3′). CCS cDNA was confirmed by restriction digest. The digoxigenin High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit II (Roche Applied Science) was used to generate the digoxigenin-labeled CCS-specific probe by random priming using the full-length rat cDNA as a template. Generation of probe, hybridization of membrane, and detection of CCS mRNA was performed as per manufacturer's instructions. Protein Extracts and Western Blotting—Rat livers were homogenized in 0.2% Triton X-100, supernatant recovered following centrifugation (13,000 × g, 10 min), and protein concentration determined by the BCA method (23Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). For H4IIE and HepG2 cells, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and then gently scraped from the dish in PBS. Cells were spun down (2000 × g, 2 min); PBS was removed, and 0.2% Triton X-100 was added to lyse the cells. Cellular debris was pelletted (13,000 × g, 5 min), and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined. Proteins (25 μg) were separated over 8–16% Tris-glycine gradient gels (Invitrogen) under denaturing and reducing conditions and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in TBS/Tween (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween (v/v), pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) at room temperature (RT) for 1 h. Blots were probed with the indicated antibodies for 1 h at RT at a 1:200 dilution in blocking solution. Membranes were washed with TBS/Tween and probed with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at RT at a 1:5000 dilution in blocking solution. Blots were washed, and proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Film was scanned, and band intensities were determined using Scion Image software (Scion Corp.) at exposures within the linear response range of the film. Pulse-Chase Experiments—H4IIE cells were grown in William's Medium E containing 10% FBS and 40 μm 2,3,2-tetraamine for 24 h. Cells (at 80% confluence) were then starved with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cystine (Sigma) and supplemented with 2% dialyzed FBS (Sigma) for 1 h. Medium was removed, and the cells were incubated with the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml Redivue Pro-mix l-35S in vitro cell labeling mix for 4 h (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were washed and incubated with complete William's Medium E supplemented with 2 mm of unlabeled l-methionine/l-cysteine and containing either 40 μm 2,3,2-tetraamine or 20 μm CuSO4. Cells were harvested at various times and lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) containing Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics). 400 μg of total protein extract was precleared for 1 h at 4 °C with protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated for 16 h with CCS antibody FL-274. Protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads were added for 1 h, and after washing, immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the gel exposed to film. CCS Expression Is Regulated by a Post-transcriptional Mechanism—We have reported recently (22Bertinato J. Iskandar M. L'Abbe M.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that rats fed low copper diets show a dose-dependent up-regulation of CCS protein in liver and erythrocytes that parallels closely the reduction in SOD1 activity and changes in other indices associated with copper deficiency. These results suggest that cellular copper levels may control CCS expression. In this study we sought to determine the mechanism by which CCS expression is regulated and the involvement of copper in this process. An antibody raised against a C-terminal region of human CCS was used to determine CCS expression by Western blot in livers from rats fed a normal or copper-deficient diet for 6 weeks. By using this antibody, a single band that migrated at ∼33 kDa in size was detected (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with the expected molecular weight of CCS and previously reported data using this same antibody (17Rothstein J.D. Dykes-Hoberg M. Corson L.B. Becker M. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Culotta V.C. Wong P.C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Quantification of CCS immunoreactive protein revealed approximately a 9-fold increase in CCS expression in copper-deficient rats compared with rats fed a normal copper diet (Fig. 1B). These results are consistent with our previous data using a different antibody to CCS (22Bertinato J. Iskandar M. L'Abbe M.R. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: 28-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast to CCS, SOD1 protein levels were modestly reduced in liver of copper-deficient rats (Fig. 1A). The increase in CCS protein in copper-deficient rats could indicate increased transcription of the CCS gene or alternatively increased mRNA stability. To test these possibilities, Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA isolated from the same livers used to measure CCS protein expression. Northern blotting using a CCS-specific probe revealed a single transcript of ∼900 bp in size (Fig. 2A). Quantification of CCS signal and normalization to the 18 S rRNA showed that CCS mRNA accumulated to similar levels in copper-normal and copper-deficient rats (Fig. 2B) excluding increased CCS gene transcription and mRNA stability as the mechanism underlying increased CCS expression. High quality of the RNA was confirmed by assessing the integrity of the 18 S and 28 S rRNAs (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Increased CCS protein content without any change in transcript levels suggests that CCS expression is likely controlled by a post-translational mechanism. Copper Deficiency Induces CCS Expression in Rodent and Human Liver Cell Lines—To test whether copper is involved in controlling CCS expression, we examined whether CCS protein levels would change in response to copper deficiency in cultured cell lines. To induce copper deficiency, we used the specific copper chelator 2,3,2-tetraamine that has been shown previously to induce copper deficiency in various cell lines (24Hopkins R.G. Failla M.L. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 257-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Hopkins R.G. Failla M.L. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 596-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Huang Z.L. Failla M.L. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1536-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). From our previous work we found that copper-deficient rats showed the largest increase in CCS expression in liver tissue. Therefore, we chose to use the H4IIE rat liver cell line to examine CCS expression in response to 2,3,2-tetraamine treatment. H4IIE cells were grown in basal medium, medium supplemented with copper, or medium containing 10, 20, or 40 μm 2,3,2-tetraamine for 48 h. Treatment of H4IIE cells with medium containing up to 40 μm 2,3,2-tetraamine showed no adverse effects on cell growth or viability. 2J. Bertinato and M. R. L'Abbé, unpublished data. Following treatment, cells were harvested, and CCS expression was determined by Western blot. CCS protein was increased to over 4-fold with 10 μm 2,3,2-tetraamine and up to 6-fold in cells treated with 40 μm 2,3,2-tetraamine compared with cells cultured in medium supplemented with 10 μm CuSO4 (Fig. 3). To determine whether 2,3,2-tetraamine treatment would induce CCS expression in human cells, we performed the same experiment with HepG2 cells, a well characterized human hepatoma cell line (Fig. 3). In these cells, CCS protein showed a more modest dose-dependent increase compared with H4IIE cells cultured in the same medium (Fig. 3). CCS expression was increased almost 3-fold with 40 μm 2,3,2-tetraamine compared with cells cultured in medium supplemented with 10 μm CuSO4 (Fig. 3). β-Tubulin expression was unaffected by 2,3,2-tetraamine treatment and shows equal protein loading (Fig. 3). Note that CCS expression was often lower in cells cultured with basal medium supplemented with low micromolar (10 μm) concentrations of CuSO4 compared with the same cells grown in basal medium alone, indicating that the basal medium used in our experiments is deficient in copper to an extent that incubation with medium supplemented with copper down-regulates CCS protein (Fig. 3). Up-regulation of CCS Is Specific for Copper Deficiency—To confirm increased CCS content in cells treated with 2,3,2-tetraamine was a result of copper deficiency and not deficiency of other metals, we performed experiments to examine the metal specificity of CCS up-regulation induced by 2,3,2-tetraamine. Elevated levels of CCS were induced in H4IIE cells by treating with 2,3,2-tetraamine. Equal amounts of CuSO4, FeSO4, or ZnSO4 were then added directly to the cells and the cells incubated for 16 h. CCS level was increased 2-fold in cells cultured in the presence of 2,3,2-tetraamine compared with cells grown in basal medium (Fig. 4). Addition of CuSO4 to the cells reduced CCS expression to levels comparable with cells cultured with basal medium alone (Fig. 4). Addition of equimolar amounts of FeSO4 and ZnSO4 did not reduce CCS protein, and levels were comparable with those detected in cells treated solely with 2,3,2-tetraamine (Fig. 4). In similar experiments, addition of CuSO4 but not FeSO4 or ZnSO4 stimulated a decrease in CCS protein in HepG2 cells pretreated with 2,3,2-tetraamine. 2J. Bertinato and M. R. L'Abbé, unpublished data. Together, these results demonstrate that up-regulation of CCS in H4IIE and HepG2 cells induced by 2,3,2-tetraamine is specific for copper deficiency, and addition of copper to 2,3,2-tetraamine-treated cells promotes a decrease in CCS protein level. Copper Promotes a Rapid Decrease in CCS Protein Level in Copper-deficient Cells—To examine the rate of change in CCS protein level stimulated by copper, we performed a time course experiment. Elevated levels of CCS were induced in H4IIE cells with 2,3,2-tetraamine. Copper was then added directly to the cells, and the cells were analyzed for CCS expression at 0, 1, 3, 6, and 10 h following addition of copper (Fig. 5). As a reference, cells cultured in basal medium or medium supplemented with 10 μm CuSO4 were included in the experiment. CCS protein level in cells supplemented with copper was lower than in cells grown in basal medium (Fig. 5A). Addition of CuSO4 to 2,3,2-tetraamine-treated cells induced a rapid decrease in CCS protein level (Fig. 5, A and B). Decreased CCS protein could be detected as early as 1 h following addition of copper (Fig. 5, A and B). By 10 h in the copper-rich medium, CCS protein level fell to 35% (Fig. 5B). Copper Stimulates CCS Degradation by the 26 S Proteosome—The rapid decrease in CCS protein upon switching cells from copper-deficient to copper-rich medium suggests that high copper concentrations increase the turnover rate of CCS. The 26 S proteosome is a large multisubunit protease that controls expression of many short lived regulatory proteins (27Guo B. Phillips J.D. Yu Y. Leibold E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21645-21651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Huang H.C. Yang C.S. Pickett C.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 37254-37259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether copper-stimulated down-regulation of CCS was dependent on degradation by the 26 S proteosome, we tested whether the potent proteosome inhibitor MG132 could block the decrease in CCS protein in response to copper. H4IIE cells treated with 2,3,2-tetraamine were incubated in the presence of MG132 or vehicle (Me2SO) for 1 h prior to addition of CuSO4 to the cells. CCS protein level was determined at 0, 1, 3, and 5 h following addition of copper (Fig. 6). Cells treated with Me2SO showed the expected reduction in CCS protein in response to copper (Fig. 6, A and B). CCS protein level decreased to 57% by 5 h (Fig. 6B) which is comparable with that observed for untreated cells (Fig. 5B). In contrast, treatment of cells with MG132 blocked the copper-stimulated decrease in CCS expression. More than 92% of CCS protein still remained in the MG132-treated cells after 5 h in copper-rich medium (Fig. 6B). The reduction in copper-stimulated down-regulation of CCS in the presence of MG132 strongly suggested involvement of the 26 S proteosome in controlling CCS expression. To confirm involvement of the proteosome in regulating CCS expression, we tested the ability of the highly specific proteosome inhibitor lactacystin (30Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) to block copper-induced CCS down-regulation in a similar experiment (Fig. 7). H4IIE cells treated with lactacystin were completely resistant to copper-stimulated CCS down-regulation (Fig. 7, A and B). In contrast, CCS protein in cells treated with Me2SO decreased to 44% by 10 h of incubation in copper-rich medium (Fig. 7B). In separate experiments, cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 10 μm CuSO4 and treated with lactacystin or Me2SO. Cells were then incubated with cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. After 1 h of incubation with cycloheximide, CCS expression was analyzed at 0, 2, and 4 h. CCS protein fell to 79% by 2 h and 44% by 4 h for Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 7C). In contrast, lactacystin completely blocked CCS degradation and showed a slight increase in CCS expression at 2 and 4 h (Fig. 7C). The time-dependent increase in CCS expression for lactacystin-treated cells likely reflects a decrease in total cellular protein upon blocking protein synthesis, resulting from degradation of proteins by proteosome-independent pathways. Because the amount of CCS was measured in a fixed amount of total protein (25 μg), a decrease in total protein in the absence of CCS degradation would be reflected by an increase in CCS content. The block in CCS down-regulation with lactacystin treatment after inhibiting protein synthesis shows that the proteosome directly or indirectly regulates CCS expression by promoting CCS degradation. To examine whether other protein degradation pathways participate in CCS turnover, we tested if the general acidification inhibitors of the lysosomal degradation pathway NH4Cl and chloroquine and the cysteine protease inhibitor calpain inhibitor II (N-acetyl-leucinyl-leucinyl-methional-H) affect CCS degradation in response to copper (Fig. 8). H4IIE cells treated with 2,3,2-tetraamine were incubated with calpain inhibitor II, NH4Cl, or chloroquine for 1 h prior to adding CuSO4. CCS expression was determined at 0, 2, and 6 h after addition of copper. Treatment with calpain inhibitor II, NH4Cl, or chloroquine had no effect on the rate of copper-induced CCS down-regulation compared with untreated cells (Fig. 8B). To ensure that chloroquine and ammonium chloride increased lysosomal pH in our cells under our conditions, we compared fluorescence intensity of the pH-sensitive probes LysoSensor Green and LysoS"
https://openalex.org/W1700565657,"The Sec1p-like/Munc18 (SM) protein Munc18a binds to the neuronal t-SNARE Syntaxin1A and inhibits SNARE complex assembly. Tomosyn, a cytosolic Syntaxin1A-binding protein, is thought to regulate the interaction between Syntaxin1A and Munc18a, thus acting as a positive regulator of SNARE assembly. In the present study we have investigated the interaction between b-Tomosyn and the adipocyte SNARE complex involving Syntaxin4/SNAP23/VAMP-2 and the SM protein Munc18c, in vitro, and the potential involvement of Tomosyn in regulating the translocation of GLUT4 containing vesicles, in vivo. Tomosyn formed a high affinity ternary complex with Syntaxin4 and SNAP23 that was competitively inhibited by VAMP-2. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay we demonstrate that the VAMP-2-like domain in Tomosyn facilitates the interaction with Syntaxin4. Overexpression of Tomosyn in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibited the translocation of green fluorescent protein-GLUT4 to the plasma membrane. The SM protein Munc18c was shown to interact with the Syntaxin4 monomer, Syntaxin4 containing SNARE complexes, and the Syntaxin4/Tomosyn complex. These data suggest that Tomosyn and Munc18c operate at a similar stage of the Syntaxin4 SNARE assembly cycle, which likely primes Syntaxin4 for entry into the ternary SNARE complex.

Transport vesicles contain membrane proteins, known as v-SNAREs, that bind in a highly specific manner to cognate membrane proteins, t-SNAREs, present in the appropriate target membrane. Different sets of v-/t-SNAREs control discrete membrane transport steps. For example, synaptic vesicle exocytosis is facilitated by the t-SNAREs Syntaxin1A and SNAP25 that localize to the presynaptic plasma membrane and bind with high affinity to the v-SNARE, VAMP-2, present on synaptic vesicles (1Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). A defining feature of v- and t-SNAREs is the presence of a conserved α-helical domain in the juxtamembrane region of their cytosolic tail. During SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, four of these SNARE domains contribute to a parallel four-helical bundle arrangement (5Poirier M.A. Xiao W. Macosko J.C. Chan C. Shin Y.K. Bennett M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 6Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The assembly of functional SNARE complexes in eukaryotic cells occurs in several discrete stages, each of which represents a potential site of regulation. For example, there is the priming step where cis-SNARE complexes, found in both donor and target membranes, are disassembled by the ATPase NSF and α-SNAP (7Ungermann C. Nichols B.J. Pelham H.R. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 8Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Once primed, tethering machinery may guide the SNAREs in each membrane into close proximity, and a proof-reading machinery likely ensures fidelity of the aligned v-/t-SNARE pairs (9Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2710) Google Scholar). Following this, formation of the high affinity trans-SNARE complex results in the committed step of docking (10Ungermann C. Sato K. Wickner W. Nature. 1998; 396: 543-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Many different molecules play a role in various stages of this SNARE assembly cycle. One family of proteins that regulates SNARE assembly is the Sec1p/Munc18 (SM) family. However, the role of SM proteins in SNARE assembly is complex and somewhat controversial (11Jahn R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 201-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The neuronal SM protein Munc18a binds with high affinity (Kd = 80 nm) to Syntaxin1A, reducing the affinity of Syntaxin1A for VAMP-2 (12Pevsner J. Hsu S.C. Braun J.E. Calakos N. Ting A.E. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Consistent with the conclusion that Munc18a plays a negative role in SNARE complex formation is the observation that Munc18a does not bind to the Syntaxin1A/SNAP25/VAMP-2 ternary fusion complex (13Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 14Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H.

A. 1994; 91: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The Syntaxin1A monomer has been shown to adopt a closed conformation because of interactions between the amino-terminal Habc helical domain and the SNARE-forming H3 helix at the carboxyl terminus (16Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). In the ternary complex Syntaxin1A undertakes a more open conformation, thus facilitating interactions between the H3 domain and the SNARE motifs present in SNAP25 and VAMP-2 (16Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 17Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Because Munc18a binds to, and possibly stabilizes, Syntaxin1A in its closed conformation a major objective has been to identify factors that could disrupt the Munc18a/Syntaxin1A heterodimer, thus enhancing SNARE complex formation. Tomosyn was identified as a molecule with properties consistent with such a role. Tomosyn was found to interact specifically with Syntaxin1A and in so doing displace Munc18a (18Fujita Y. Shirataki H. Sakisaka T. Asakura T. Ohya T. Kotani H. Yokoyama S. Nishioka H. Matsuura Y. Mizoguchi A. Scheller R.H. Takai Y.

Tomosyn contains a series of conserved amino-terminal WD-40 repeats and a carboxyl-terminal VAMP-2-like domain that is necessary for binding to Syntaxin1A and participation in a 10 S complex with SNAP25 and the synaptic membrane protein Synaptotagmin (18Fujita Y.

Despite the fact that Tomosyn was shown to interact only with the neuronal t-SNARE Syntaxin1A its ubiquitous tissue distribution raised the possibility that it may participate in vesicle transport steps controlled by other syntaxin isoforms (18Fujita Y.

Intriguingly, the v-SNARE VAMP-2, in addition to binding to Syntaxin1A, also binds to the ubiquitously expressed t-SNARE Syntaxin4 (14Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H.

Further, Syntaxin4 has been shown to form an SDS-resistant SNARE complex with SNAP23 and VAMP-2 (22Rea S. Martin L.B. McIntosh S. Macaulay S.L. Ramsdale T. Baldini G. James D.E. J. Biol.

We have investigated the role of b-Tomosyn in exocytosis of GLUT4 vesicles and in the assembly of Syntaxin4/SNAP23/VAMP-2 ternary complexes. The present study shows that b-Tomosyn binds with high affinity to Syntaxin4 via its VAMP-2 like domain and that overexpression of Tomosyn in 3T3-L1 adipocytes inhibits the insulin-dependent translocation of GLUT4-eGFP to the cell surface. In contrast to the situation in neurons, we found that the SM protein Munc18c associated with both the Syntaxin4/b-Tomosyn binary complex and with the Syntaxin4 SNARE complexes. Taken together, our data suggest a novel role for b-Tomosyn in SNARE complex formation and vesicle transport and support the hypothesis that Munc18c plays a fundamental role in the assembly of SNARE core complexes. Cloning of 3T3-L1 Adipocyte Tomosyn—Total RNA was prepared from differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes by a single step guanidine isothiocyanate method (28Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J.

Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR was performed using a standard protocol with oligo(dT) primer (0.5 μg) and total RNA (1 μg).

The PCR product of 1050 bp was cloned into a pGEMt easy vector kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced using an automated sequencer. The above PCR was carried out on two successive occasions, and the products were sequenced independently. Radiolabeled PCR product (rediprime™; Amersham Biosciences) was used to screen a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library constructed in λ ZAP, kindly provided by Dr. F. Fiedorek (University of North Carolina). Approximately 100,000 plaques were mutually screened, and one well isolated plaque was excised using Ex-Assist™ (interference-resistant helper phage with SOLR™ strain) according to the manufacture's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA clone was fully sequenced on both strands, and the data were analyzed using Sequencher™ 3.1.1s. 3T3-L1 adipocyte Tomosyn was 98% identical to the neuronal b-Tomosyn splice variant (GenBank™ accession number AF118889). Our sequencing data derived from the RT-PCR analysis of 3T3-L1 adipocyte Tomosyn differed from the cDNA-derived clone of Tomosyn at four amino acids, D238G, H247Y, A271T, and L301F. These changes do not appear to be random as the changes are either conserved between our cDNA clone and the published rat brain b-Tomosyn sequence (amino acids 238 and 247) or the RT-PCR product and the respective b-Tomosyn sequence (amino acids 271 and 301). Plasmid Construction—cDNAs encoding rat Syntaxins-1A, -2, -3, and -4 and VAMP-2 were generously provided by Dr. R. Scheller (Stanford University). Syntaxin-6- and -7-encoding cDNAs have been described (29Mullock B.M. Smith C.W. Ihrke G. Bright N.A. Lindsay M. Parkinson E.J. Brooks D.A. Parton R.G. James D.E. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol.

Primers 5–8 were annealed and digested with EcoRV before being subcloned as a double stranded fragment into pMEXneo using SalI and BamHI. Truncated Tomosyn cDNAs encoding bp 1–1050, 1–3225, 1050–3225, and 3199–3459 were obtained by PCR using primers 9, 5′cccgaattcaggaaattcaacatc3′; 10, 5′cccctcgagtcatgtgagaaagtcaac3′; 11, 5′cccctcgagtcaggaggcctttcccga3′; 12, 5′cccgaattcacactctgtgaaacg3′; 13, 5′cccgaattcggagagtcgtcctcg3′; and 14, 5′cccctcgagtcagaactggtaccactt3′. The Tomosyn cDNAs were cloned into pBTM116 using EcoRI and SalI. pBTM116-Munc18c and pAct-Syntaxin4 cDNAs were kind gifts from Dr. Y. Le Marchand-Brustel (Nice, France). eGFP-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4-GFP-pcDNA3) was received from Dr. J. Pessin (University of Iowa). All cDNAs obtained by PCR were confirmed by sequencing. Generation of Antibodies—Rabbit antiserum that specifically recognizes Munc18c was raised against a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein comprising a tandem repeat of the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of mouse Munc18c (MLNKSKDKVSFKDE). Following purification on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) the immunogen was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used to immunize rabbits. Munc18c-specific antibodies were purified using a monomeric form of the peptide, immobilized on a Sulfolink gel (Pierce), and dialyzed against PBS. A polyclonal anti-Syntaxin4 antibody was used as described (21Tellam J.T. Macaulay S.L. McIntosh S. Hewish D.R. Ward C.W. James D.E. J. Biol.

A monoclonal Caveolin1 antibody was donated by Dr. Rob Parton (Institute of Molecular Bioscience, Brisbane, Australia). The following antibodies were purchased: anti-IRS-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-GFP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and anti-LexA (Invitrogen). Tomosyn Tissue Distribution—Mouse brain and 3T3-L1 adipocyte samples were prepared in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA), supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm ammonium molbydate, and 10 mm sodium fluoride), using a glass homogenizer or by passing through a 22- and 27-gauge needle, respectively. The homogenates were subject to centrifugation at 100,000 × g av for 1 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA-100.3 rotor. The supernatant from this spin was used as the cytosol fraction. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad Bradford assay (Hercules, CA). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and subject to immunoblot analysis (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). Signal was visualized using SuperSignal® West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant fusion proteins encoding GST or GST fused in-frame to the cytosolic domains of the Syntaxin isoforms-1A, -2, -3, -4, -6, -7, -13, -VAMP-2, -SNAP23, or full-length -Rab4 were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to standard procedures. Histidine (His6)-tagged Munc18c and Syntaxin4 were made in Sf9 and BL21 (DE3) cells, respectively, and purified using TALON™ Cobalt metal affinity resin according to the supplier's protocol (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The recombinant proteins were dialyzed against PBS, except His6-Munc18c, which was dialyzed against PBS containing 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and concentrated using Aquacide (Calbiochem). The protein concentration and purity of all recombinant fusion proteins were determined by Bio-Rad Bradford protein assays and SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. GST-VAMP-2 was cleaved with thrombin (25 units/ml) (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.1%, 2-mercaptoethanol. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (25 μg/ml) was added to the reaction, and the thrombin-cleaved protein was dialyzed against PBS. Recombinant Fusion Proteins—Recombinant GST fusion proteins (5–15 μg) were attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads (15–25 μl) in a total volume of 300–350 μl of PBS for 1 h at 20 °C and recovered by brief centrifugation. His6-tagged fusion proteins were incubated with TALON™ resin (25–50 μl) in the same way. Binary (Syntaxin4/SNAP23; Syntaxin4/VAMP-2; SNAP23/VAMP-2; Syntaxin4/Munc18c) or ternary (Syntaxin4/SNAP23/VAMP-2) complexes were formed by mixing approximately equimolar amounts of recombinant proteins and incubated either for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C in PBS or PBS containing 0.1–0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The complexes were further incubated with resin as described above. In Vitro Binding Assay—Recombinant GST or His6-tagged proteins, attached to glutathione-Sepharose or metal affinity resin, were incubated with 0.8–1.0 ml of purified 3T3-L1 adipocyte cytosol (1–3 mg/ml) or mouse brain cytosol, containing 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% BSA, and 1% Triton X-100, for 2 h at 4 °C. Alternatively, recombinant SNARE proteins were incubated with 20 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled Munc18-b or -c (TNT® Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System; Promega) in 0.5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.1% BSA) as described above. After washing the samples three to four times with PBS or binding buffer (lacking BSA), the proteins attached to the affinity beads were solubilized in 20 μl of 2 × SDS-sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. Data were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Autoradiography (Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MR film; Rochester, NY) or immunoblotted using specific antibodies and stained with 0.5% Ponceau S in 0.5% trichloroacetic acid or Coomassie Blue stain. Yeast Two-hybrid Methods—A standard lithium acetate/single-stranded carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method for transformation into yeast strain L40 was used, and expression of proteins fused to LexA was checked by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. Transcriptional activation of LacZ was determined using the X-Gal filter lift assay and a quantitative liquid assay, using the substrate nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (32Montano M.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 177: 99-106PubMed Google Scholar, 33Byrd A. St-Arnaud R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 177: 107-119PubMed Google Scholar). For the filter lift assay color development within 0–3 h was scored (+++) and development within 3–6 h was scored (++); no color after 16 h was scored negative. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured as described (34Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using adipocytes between 7 and 17 days post-differentiation. Before experimental use the cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking fetal calf serum over night at 37 °C with 5% CO2 (v/v) and either used in a basal condition or stimulated with insulin (4 μg/ml) for 15 min. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) treatment was carried out using 1 mm NEM in Me2SO for 15 min at 37 °C before subcellular fractionation. Electroporation was performed essentially as described by Pessin and co-workers (26Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), using 100 μg of cesium chloride-purified GLUT4-eGFP-pcDNA3 and 400 μg of pMEXneo, pMEXneo-Munc18c, or pMEXneo-FLAG-Tomosyn. The electroporated cells were seeded on 1% gelatin-coated coverslips or 10-cm tissue culture dishes and either fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde or subjected to subcellular fractionation (35Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fixed cells were quenched using 50 mm ammonium chloride and blocked/permeabilized in BB (2% BSA and 0.1% saponin in PBS) before GLUT4-eGFP was visualized using a primary GFP antibody (1:300) and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:150) in BB. Immunofluorescence images were obtained using a Zeiss Axioskop 40 fluorescence microscope (×63 objective) and analyzed using Zeiss Axio Vision software. Subcellular Fractionation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—Subcellular fractionation was carried out according to an established protocol to generate membrane fractions that are enriched in markers of the plasma membrane (PM), endoplasmic reticulum and endosomes (high density microsomes, HDM), Golgi membranes, recycling endosomes, and the majority of the intracellular GLUT4 responsive compartment (low density microsomes, LDM), mitochondria/nuclei, and cytosol (35Piper R.C.

Statistical significance was established using a Student's t test. Tomosyn has been shown to disrupt the neuronal Munc18a/Syntaxin1A complex by binding to Syntaxin1A and has thus been proposed to be a positive modulator of SNARE complex formation, overcoming the negative regulatory role of Munc18a (18Fujita Y.

This complex regulates a variety of exocytic transport events including the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane of adipocytes and the translocation of water channels to the cell surface of kidney cells (23Kawanishi M.

Tomosyn binds to Syntaxin1A via a helical domain that is homologous to the VAMP-2 SNARE motif, and a recently described molecule, Amisyn, contains a Tomosyn-like SNARE motif and has further been shown to interact with both Syntaxin1A and Syntaxin4 from rat brain (18Fujita Y.

Activity of c-JUN is controlled by NH2-terminal phosphorylation (JNP) of its transactivation domain by a family of JUN-NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNK). JNK form a stable complex with c-JUN in vitro and in vivo. We have targeted this interaction by means of a cell-permeable peptide containing the JNK-binding (δ) domain of human c-JUN. This peptide strongly and specifically induced apoptosis in HeLa tumor cells, which was paralleled by inhibition of serum-induced c-JUN phosphorylation and up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21cip/waf. Application of the c-JUN peptide to interleukin (IL)-1-stimulated human primary fibroblasts resulted in up-regulation of four genes, namely COX-2, MnSOD, IκBα, and MAIL and down-regulation of 10 genes, namely CCL8, mPGES, SAA1, hIAP-1, hIAP-2, pent(r)axin-3, CXCL10, IL-1β, ICAM-1, and CCL2. Only a small group of genes, namely pent(r)axin-3, CXCL10, ICAM-1, and IL-1β, was inhibited by both the c-JUN peptide and the JNK inhibitor SP600125. Thereby, and by additional experiments using small interfering RNA to suppress endogenous c-JUN we identify for the first time three distinct groups of inflammatory genes whose IL-1-induced expression depends on c-JUN, on JNK, or on both. These results shed further light on the complexity of c-JUN-JNK-mediated gene regulation and also highlight the potential use of dissecting signaling downstream from JNK to specifically target proliferative diseases or the inflammatory response.

AP-1 is involved in cellular proliferation, transformation, survival, cell death, and the immune response (1Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat.

AP-1 converts extracellular signals into changes of the expression of target genes, and AP-1 binding sites are found in a large number of genes. AP-1 is not a single protein, but a homo- or heterodimer composed of members of the JUN, FOS, ATF, and other protein families (1Shaulian E. Karin M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E131-E136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar, 2Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). With the exception of cell cycle regulatory genes, because of the structural and regulatory complexity of AP-1, the knowledge of AP-1 target genes mediating AP-1 functions is far from complete (1Shaulian E.

The phosphorylation sites required for inducible c-JUN activation have been mapped to serines 63 and 67. A family of 10 highly homologous serine/threonine protein kinases derived from three genes by alternative splicing has been identified that specifically phosphorylate these residues in c-JUN and has therefore been named c-JUN NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNK) 1-3 (7Derijard B.

Cell. 1996; 87: 929-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Further studies of the complex in intact cells showed that it does not require the JNK catalytic activity or the presence of the phospho-acceptor sites in c-JUN (11May G.H. Allen K.E. Clark W. Funk M. Gillespie D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33429-33435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Presumably, the c-JUN-JNK interaction serves two purposes, first it provides the specificity of JNK for c-JUN, and second it helps to increase the local concentration of JNK at gene promoters that bind c-JUN, thereby enhancing c-JUN-mediated transcription (4Dunn C. Wiltshire C. MacLaren A. Gillespie D.A. Cell Signalling. 2002; 14: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Like the c-JUN protein, JNK have been implicated in numerous biological roles in response to growth factors, stress, and inflammatory cytokines, implying that JNK may mediate their gene regulatory effects mainly through c-JUN (12Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3609) Google Scholar, 13Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4353) Google Scholar, 14Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). However, for several reasons this is unlikely. First, JNK phosphorylate other transcription factor substrates, such as ATF-2 (15Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar) and ELK-1 (16Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar); second, individual JNK isoforms display different affinities for c-JUN in vitro (8Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar, 9Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar); and third, the phenotypes of c-JUN and JNK knockout mice show no obvious overlapping phenotype (13Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4353) Google Scholar, 17Hilberg F. Aguzzi A. Howells N. Wagner E.F.

Dev. 1999; 89: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, one of the most intriguing questions regarding the c-JUN-JNK interaction is which of the many biological processes ascribed to both proteins critically requires a c-JUN-JNK complex. We have addressed this question by designing a cell-permeable peptide containing the JNK-binding site of human c-JUN. We report here that this peptide specifically disrupts the c-JUN-JNK complex in vitro and in vivo. Thereby we identify a number of hitherto unrecognized genes whose expression depends on the c-JUN-JNK complex. Cells and Materials—HeLa cells stably expressing the tet transactivator protein, kindly provided by H. Bujard, and primary human fibroblasts derived from gingiva were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 10% fetal calf serum. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from Hartmann Analytics. Rabbit antibodies against phospho(Ser63) c-JUN, c-JUN, phospho(Thr183/Tyr185) JNK, and JNK were from Cell Signaling Technology (kits 9250 and 9260). Other rabbit antibodies against c-JUN (H-79) or ERK (C-14) were from Santa Cruz. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies against rabbit IgG were from Sigma. Glutathione-Sepharose was from Amersham Biosciences. Human recombinant IL-1α and GST-JUN were produced as described (19Krause A. Holtmann H. Eickemeier S. Winzen R. Szamel M. Resch K. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23681-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SP600125 was from Tocris. SMARTpool small interfering (si) RNA oligonucleotides against c-JUN were from Dharmacon. Fmoc derivatives were from Merck Biosciences or Bachem. N-[(Dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo [4,5-b]pyridin-1-yl-methylene]-N-methylmethanaminium hexafluorophosphate N-oxide and 7-aza-1-hydroxybenzotriazole were from Applied Biosystems. TentaGel R RAM resin was from Rapp Polymere GmbH. Other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher and were of analytical grade or better. Plasmids and Transfections—Plasmids pFR-Luc encoding five GAL4-binding sites upstream of a luciferase gene, pFC-MEKK1 encoding the catalytic domain of MEKK1, pFC2-dbd encoding the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (amino acids 1-147), and pFA2 encoding the transactivation domain of c-JUN (amino acids 1-223) fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 were obtained from Stratagene. Transient transfections by the calcium phosphate method were performed as described (20Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For determination of promoter activity, cells (seeded at 1 × 105 per well of 24-well plates) were transfected with 1 μg of pFR-Luc, 100 ng of pFA2-cJUN, 100 ng of pFC2-dbd, or 50 ng of pFC-MEKK1. Equal amounts of plasmid DNA within each experiment were obtained by adding empty pCS3MT vector to a total amount of 2.2 μg of DNA per well. Where indicated 100 μm c-JUN peptide was added directly after transfection. 16-20 h later cells from two wells transfected independently were pooled, lysed, and luciferase reporter gene activity was determined as described (20Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). For transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides OligofectAMINE™ (Invitrogen) or TransitIT-TKO™ (Mirus) were used, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides (0.1 mmol) were synthesized as COOH-terminal amides on TentaGel R RAM resin in an Applied Biosystems Pioneer instrument, using standard Fmoc protocols (21Chan W.C. White P.D. Chan W.C. White P.D. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 47-76Google Scholar). Briefly, Fmoc derivatives (0.4 mmol) were activated with N-[(dimethylamino)-1H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-b]pyridin-1-yl-methylene]-N-methylmethanaminium-hexafluorophosphate N-oxide (0.4 mmol) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (0.8 mmol). Fmoc group removal was with a mixture of 2% (v/v) piperidine and 2% (v/v) 1,8-diazabicyclo(5,4,0)undec-7-ene in dimethylformamide. To minimize aspartimide formation, Asp in the scrambled sequence was coupled as the Asp-Ser pseudo-proline (22Wöhr T. Wahl F. Nefzi A. Rohwedder B. Sato T. Sun X. Mutter M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 9218-9227Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). When the sequence was complete, the resin was washed with methanol and peroxide-free ether, and dried under nitrogen before the addition of dichloromethane (4 ml) and dimethylpropylene urea (0.5 ml). 5(6)-Carboxyfluorescein (0.5 mmol), 7-hydroxy-1-azabenzotriazole (0.5 mmol), and diisopropylcarbodiimide (0.6 mmol) were added and the mixture was shaken gently for 16 h. A ninhydrin test (21Chan W.C. White P.D. Chan W.C. White P.D. Fmoc Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 47-76Google Scholar) showed that the reaction was complete. Piperidine (0.1 ml) was added and the resin was washed with dimethylformamide, methanol, and diethyl ether before drying for 16 h in vacuo over P2O5. Peptides were released from the resin by treatment for 3-4 h at room temperature with a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (9 ml), thioanisole (0.5 ml), dithiothreitol (0.25 g), and triisopropylsilane (0.25 ml) containing 0.15 g of ammonium iodide to prevent oxidation of methionine (23Huang H. Rabenstein D.L. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 53: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The spent resin was removed by filtration and washed with a little trifluoroacetic acid. The pooled filtrate was evaporated in vacuo to an oil, which was added dropwise to 45 ml of peroxide-free ether at 0 °C. The precipitated peptide was recovered by centrifugation at 720 × g for 3 min and washed three times with 45 ml of ether by resuspension and centrifugation, before drying under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas. Crude peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a column (22 × 250 mm) of Vydac octadecyl-silica (15-20 μm particle size) using a linear gradient of acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing homogeneous product were identified by analytical high performance liquid chromatography on a column (4.6 × 250 mm) of Vydac octadecyl-silica (5 μm diameter). These fractions were pooled and the acetonitrile was removed by rotary evaporation in vacuo. The residue was diluted with 10% (v/v) acetic acid and freeze-dried. The identity of the purified peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry: TAT-c-JUN peptide, expected mass 4729.6 Da, found 4730.4 ± 0.3 (S.D., 6); TAT-scrambled (scr.) peptide, expected mass 4729.6 Da, found 4729.8 ± 0.2 Da (S.D., 6). The sequence of the TAT peptide control is FlCO-YGRKKRRQRRR-4Abu-NH2 (M r 2002.3). FlCO is fluoresceinyl made with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and 4-Abu is a residue of 4-aminobutyric acid. NH2 is the COOH-terminal amide. Protein Kinase Assays—Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for 15 min in ice-cold swelling buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Then cells were lysed in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm fresh phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell extract proteins (0.5 mg) were incubated with 2.5 μg of GST-JUN previously immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads to adsorb JNK protein kinases. Where indicated, 100 μm c-JUN peptide was added to the binding reaction. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, beads were pelleted, extensively washed in cell lysis buffer, and resuspended in 10 μl of the same buffer. Then 10 μlofH2O and 10 μl of kinase buffer (150 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 30 mm MgCl2, 60 μm ATP, 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) were added. After 30 min at room temperature SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Western Blotting—Cell extract proteins were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was performed as described (19Krause A. Holtmann H. Eickemeier S. Winzen R. Szamel M. Resch K. Saklatvala J. Kracht M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23681-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Holtmann H. Winzen R. Holland P. Eickemeier S. Hoffmann E. Wallach D. Malinin N.L. Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Blots were stripped prior to reprobing with c-JUN, JNK, or ERK antibodies. Proteins were detected by using the Amersham enhanced chemiluminescence system. Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—IL-8 protein concentrations in the cell culture medium were determined using the human IL-8 duo set kit (R&D Systems) exactly following the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence Microscopy—Subcellular distribution of fluorescein-labeled c-JUN and scrambled peptides was examined by phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy at ×40 magnification using a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% para-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclei of cells were stained with Hoechst 33342. Phase-contrast and fluorescence images of the same cells were collected in separate channels and images were saved as TIF files and processed electronically using Micrografix Picture Publisher Software 8.0. Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA was extracted with the Qiagen RNeasy kit and reverse transcribed using random hexamer primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). cDNAs were amplified with the following primer pairs (sense, antisense): interleukin-8: 5′-AAGGAACCATTCTCACTG-3′, 5′-GATTCTTGGATACCACAGAG-3′; MCP-1: 5′-AATCAATGCCCCAGTCACCTGC-3′, 5′-GCAAAGACCCTCAAAACATCC C-3′; tubulin: 5′-TTCCCTGGCCAGCT(GC)AA(AGCT)GC(AGCT)GACCT(AGCT)CGCAAG-3′, 5′-CATGCCCTCGCC(AGCT)GTGTACCAGTG(AGCT)A(AGCT)GAAGGC-3′; p21cip/waf: 5′-ACTGTGATGCGCTAATGG-3′, 5′-AGAAATCTGTCATGCTGG-3′. PCR was performed with the following cycles: 1 min 95 °C, 1 min 50-55 °C, 2 min 72 °C, 7 min final extension at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Determination of Cell Number and DNA Synthesis—Cells were seeded in six-well plates and counted after the indicated treatments in a Neubauer chamber. For determination of DNA synthesis rates, 104 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with 0.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine (Hartmann Analytics) for the final 4 h of treatment. Radioactivity incorporated into cellular DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. DNA Microarray Experiments—The microarray used in this study contains amino-modified oligonucleotides of 50 bp in length immobilized on panepoxy-coated glass slides (MWG Biotech). The oligonucleotide probes are complementary to several housekeeping genes and to 110 human genes that are strongly regulated during inflammation, which were selected by an extensive literature search using published resources. 2M. Kracht and O. Dittrich, unpublished results. With a few exceptions, three specific oligonucleotide probes per gene were designed by identifying unique sequences in these genes by a computer-based algorithm developed at MWG Biotech. The specificity of the probes for their respective target genes was then verified in a large number of biological experiments using different cell lines and inflammatory stimuli. 2M. Kracht and O. Dittrich, unpublished results. Fluorescent cRNA copies of mRNAs of cells treated as indicated in the legend of Table I were prepared by reverse transcription of 5 μg of total RNA purified with a Qiagen RNeasy kit. RNA was treated with DNase and used for synthesis of double-stranded cDNA synthesis followed by fluorophore-cRNA synthesis. To be specific, the cDNA synthesis system from Roche and the MEGAscript T7 kit from Ambion were used as directed by the manufacturers, with 100 ng of double-stranded cDNA and 1.25 mm Cy3-UTP or 1.25 mm Cy5-UTP in each cRNA labeling reaction. Labeled cRNAs were hybridized individually to microarrays in pre-prepared hybridization solution (MWG Biotech) at 42 °C overnight and then washed sequentially in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1× SSC, and 0.5× SSC.Table IComparison of the effects of the c-JUN peptide and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 on IL-1-inducible inflammatory gene expression123456accession numbergenemean ratio +/− S.E.MIL-1/0IL-1 + c-JUN peptide / 0IL-1 + scrambled peptide / 0IL-1 + SP600125 / 0af385628CXCL899,02 +/− 19,32120,06 +/− 34,97128,13 +/− 17,3167,11 +/− 18,09m14584IL-678,35 +/− 30,35100,39 +/− 11,0595,78 +/− 12,5257,94 +/− 16,84nm000963COX-248,78 +/− 16,45205,35 +/− 178,5383,50 +/− 44,6120,09 +/− 13,73nm002428MMP-1540,13 +/− 24,3222,47 +/− 3,1426,17 +/− 13,0739,01 +/− 29,14m28225CCL-238,09 +/− 11,103,14 +/− 1,8425,11 +/− 0,3131,90 +/− 16,53xm040712hIAP-135,35 +/− 11,9615,42 +/− 3,2728,62 +/− 2,0736,46 +/− 8,75m36821CXCL322,73 +/− 4,8025,55 +/− 7,8921,49 +/− 1,6237,03 +/− 17,20nm001565CXCL1013,77 +/− 9,011,76 +/− 0,893,27 +/− 0,293,43 +/− 2,02ab037925MAIL11,57 +/− 1,0518,28 +/− 5,8012,48 +/− 1,659,64 +/− 1,48j03603PAI-211,04 +/− 2,1010,18 +/− 0,5113,37 +/− 4,644,87 +/− 0,36xm018501pent(r)axin-310,59 +/− 2,067,90 +/− 2,5313,86 +/− 7,656,47 +/− 0,84xm033941MnSOD10,36 +/− 2,6719,11 +/− 9,208,53 +/− 3,666,82 +/− 3,61xm049516ICAM-18,98 +/− 1,744,80 +/− 2,3011,78 +/− 8,286,43 +/− 1,02d10925CCR18,31 +/− 3,0910,01 +/− 1,7111,09 +/− 4,177,01 +/− 2,00ac004511GM-CSF7,98 +/− 1,9511,75 +/− 0,179,52 +/− 3,127,03 +/− 0,80ac007165IL-1R II7,46 +/− 2,978,13 +/− 0,488,39 +/− 2,955,85 +/− 2,60bc009483IRF-17,23 +/− 1,9511,53 +/− 4,1911,25 +/− 4,996,50 +/− 1,53bc004983IkB-α6,54 +/− 0,5712,53 +/− 3,387,75 +/− 0,035,02 +/− 1,39nm000161GTP cyclohydrolase I6,46 +/− 2,314,49 +/− 0,375,59 +/− 0,653,24 +/− 0,94xm053443uPA4,89 +/− 0,615,87 +/− 0,956,95 +/− 1,304,77 +/− 0,33bc009874c-Jun3,96 +/− 1,174,73 +/− 0,603,88 +/− 1,686,03 +/− 3,62af186094IL-1 δ3,91 +/− 1,544,18 +/− 0,854,21 +/− 2,003,66 +/− 1,63xm038956CCL83,66 +/− 1,881,28 +/− 0,651,97 +/− 0,315,55 +/− 4,51xm006270MMP-13,45 +/− 0,983,10 +/− 1,442,98 +/− 0,031,56 +/− 0,57nm002422MMP-32,75 +/− 0,783,52 +/− 2,862,86 +/− 1,911,06 +/− 0,02x02532IL-1 β2,62 +/− 0,690,86 +/− 0,752,28 +/− 0,531,10 +/− 0,44bc007022serum amyloid A 12,60 +/− 0,950,68 +/− 0,361,12 +/− 0,724,43 +/− 2,39af027740microsomal prostaglandin E synthase2,59 +/− 0,771,57 +/− 0,112,54 +/− 0,842,95 +/− 1,26m15329IL-1 α2,56 +/− 0,811,39 +/− 0,391,73 +/− 0,261,16 +/− 0,19j04513bFGF2,46 +/− 0,513,19 +/− 2,172,90 +/− 1,951,43 +/− 0,18I49431hIAP-22,32 +/− 0,291,72 +/− 0,052,97 +/− 0,523,92 +/− 0,13ac006953uPA-R1,87 +/− 0,242,38 +/− 0,481,37 +/− 0,121,04 +/− 0,25nm020995haptoglobin1,73 +/− 0,441,82 +/− 0,801,93 +/− 0,701,68 +/− 0,63nm002427MMP-131,70 +/− 0,601,40 +/− 0,211,13 +/− 0,061,44 +/− 0,42x04429PAI-11,64 +/− 0,321,62 +/− 0,331,63 +/− 0,641,32 +/− 0,79af237762Ex331,58 +/− 0,571,37 +/− 0,782,00 +/− 0,890,82 +/− 0,11nm000222c-kit1,56 +/− 0,362,10 +/− 0,771,98 +/− 0,841,27 +/− 0,15m10988TNF α1,52 +/− 0,511,59 +/− 0,911,76 +/− 0,790,85 +/− 0,17xm009010C31,51 +/− 0,260,97 +/− 0,431,27 +/− 0,341,14 +/− 0,38xm044653EGF-R1,33 +/− 0,380,83 +/− 0,060,77 +/− 0,021,29 +/− 0,49nm002133heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1)1,30 +/− 0,312,98 +/− 1,571,36 +/− 1,051,37 +/− 0,29aj224869CXCR41,24 +/− 0,361,66 +/− 0,291,50 +/− 0,170,82 +/− 0,11j04130CCL41,19 +/− 0,301,13 +/− 0,320,94 +/− 0,371,04 +/− 0,05aI009183ILA1,19 +/− 0,191,51 +/− 0,081,51 +/− 0,450,93 +/− 0,19xm035775V-CAM-11,11 +/− 0,361,49 +/− 0,851,27 +/− 0,741,00 +/− 0,17xm003304TLR 21,06 +/− 0,440,99 +/− 0,300,98 +/− 0,040,82 +/− 0,19ab000676SOCS-11,05 +/− 0,200,82 +/− 0,401,03 +/− 0,131,00 +/− 0,03af088851ferritin heavy chain1,04 +/− 0,070,89 +/− 0,060,76 +/− 0,050,75 +/− 0,24ac002428IL-91,03 +/− 0,181,35 +/− 0,531,50 +/− 0,300,75 +/− 0,12nm000565IL-6R1,01 +/− 0,301,07 +/− 0,461,02 +/− 0,600,82 +/− 0,17ab010445CCL271,00 +/− 0,301,35 +/− 0,851,24 +/− 0,520,80 +/− 0,02aI162458MMP-90,95 +/− 0,140,85 +/− 0,851,31 +/− 0,430,92 +/− 0,06bc007007IL-180,92 +/− 0,291,75 +/− 0,601,31 +/− 0,671,47 +/− 0,19xm008912TGF-beta 10,91 +/− 0,080,96 +/− 0,050,97 +/− 0,080,88 +/− 0,00d63785CCL-30,90 +/− 0,211,06 +/− 0,190,90 +/− 0,250,65 +/− 0,17u16306versican0,84 +/− 0,280,67 +/− 0,140,67 +/− 0,080,82 +/− 0,39aI021940E-selectin0,83 +/− 0,131,27 +/− 0,211,07 +/− 0,160,77 +/− 0,06nm004513IL-160,66 +/− 0,080,69 +/− 0,040,54 +/− 0,020,47 +/− 0,06x62468IFNγ0,64 +/− 0,141,11 +/− 0,000,98 +/− 0,060,64 +/− 0,08aI354866CTGF0,61 +/− 0,181,77 +/− 0,441,48 +/− 0,500,62 +/− 0,38af060152ADAMTS-10,51 +/− 0,101,18 +/− 0,360,55 +/− 0,170,48 +/− 0,12 Open table in a new tab Hybridized arrays were scanned at maximal resolution on an Affymetrix 428 scanner at variable PMT voltage settings to obtain maximal signal intensities without probe saturation.

https://openalex.org/W2081424484,"L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, the immediate precursor of dopamine, can be formed by two enzymes: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in catecholamine-producing neurons and chromaffin cells and tyrosinase in melanocytes. In this study we examined whether tyrosinase contributes to production of dopamine. Deficiency of TH caused marked reductions in norepinephrine in albino and pigmented 15-day-old mice. In contrast, peripheral levels of dopamine were reduced only in albino TH-deficient mice and were higher in pigmented than in albino mice, regardless of the presence or absence of TH. We next examined age-related changes in dopamine and cutaneous expression of tyrosinase and melanin in albino and pigmented TH wild-type mice. We found that the differences in peripheral dopamine between pigmented and albino mice disappeared with advancing age following changes in expression and function of tyrosinase. In young animals, tyrosinase was present in epidermis but did not produce detectable melanin. With advancing age, tyrosinase was localized only around hair follicles, melanin synthesis became more pronounced, and dopamine synthesis decreased. The data reveal a previously unrecognized TH-independent major pathway of peripheral dopamine synthesis in young, but not adult, mice. The transient nature of this source of dopamine reflects a developmental switch in tyrosinase-dependent production of dopamine to production of melanin."
https://openalex.org/W1997978268,"Gelonin is a type I plant toxin that has potential as an effective anti-tumor agent by virtue of its enzymatic capacity to inactivate ribosomes and arrest protein synthesis, thereby effectively limiting the growth of cancer cells. Being a hydrophilic macromolecule, however, gelonin has limited access to its target subcellular compartment, the cytosol; it is effectively plasma membrane-impermeant and subject to rapid degradation within endosomes and lysosomes upon cellular uptake as it lacks the membrane-translocating capability that is typically provided by a disulfide-linked B polypeptide found in the type II toxins (e.g. ricin). These inherent characteristics generate the need for the development of a specialized cytosolic delivery strategy for gelonin as an effective anti-tumor therapeutic agent. Here we describe an efficient means of delivering gelonin to the cytosol of B16 melanoma cells. Gelonin was co-encapsulated inside pH-sensitive liposomes with listeriolysin O, the pore-forming protein that mediates escape of the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes from the endosome into the cytosol. In in vitro experiments, co-encapsulated listeriolysin O enabled liposomal gelonin-mediated B16 cell killing with a gelonin IC50 of approximately 0.1 nM with an extreme efficiency requiring an incubation time of only 1 h. By contrast, cells treated with equivalent concentrations of unencapsulated gelonin or gelonin encapsulated alone in pH-sensitive liposomes exhibited no detectable cytotoxicity. Moreover, treatment by direct intratumor injection into subcutaneous solid tumors of B16 melanoma in a mouse model showed that pH-sensitive liposomes containing both listeriolysin O and gelonin were more effective than control formulations in curtailing tumor growth rates."
https://openalex.org/W2042659329,"Platelet adhesion to fibrinogen is important for platelet aggregation and thrombus growth. In this study we have examined the mechanisms regulating platelet adhesion on immobilized fibrinogen under static and shear conditions. We demonstrate that integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub> engagement of immobilized fibrinogen is sufficient to induce an oscillatory calcium response, necessary for lamellipodial formation and platelet spreading. Released ADP increases the proportion of platelets exhibiting a cytosolic calcium response but is not essential for calcium signaling or lamellipodial extension. Pretreating platelets with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (APB-2), or the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 abolished calcium signaling and platelet spreading, suggesting a major role for Src kinase-regulated PLC isoforms in these processes. Analysis of PLCγ2<sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mouse platelets revealed a major role for this isoform in regulating cytosolic calcium flux and platelet spreading on fibrinogen. Under flow conditions, platelets derived from PLCγ2<sup>–</sup><sup>/</sup><sup>–</sup> mice formed less stable adhesive interactions with fibrinogen, particularly in the presence of ADP antagonists. Our studies define an important role for PLCγ2 in integrin α<sub>IIb</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-dependent calcium flux, necessary for stable platelet adhesion and spreading on fibrinogen. Furthermore, they establish an important cooperative signaling role for PLCγ2 and ADP in regulating platelet adhesion efficiency on fibrinogen."
https://openalex.org/W2073537359,"Human type 1 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3β-HSD/isomerase) catalyzes the two sequential enzyme reactions on a single protein that converts dehydroepiandrosterone or pregnenolone to androstenedione or progesterone, respectively, in placenta, mammary gland, breast tumors, prostate, prostate tumors, and other peripheral tissues. Our earlier studies show that the two enzyme reactions are linked by the coenzyme product, NADH, of the 3β-HSD activity. NADH activates the isomerase activity by inducing a time-dependent conformational change in the enzyme protein. The current study tested the hypothesis that the 3β-HSD and isomerase activities shared a common coenzyme domain, and it characterized key amino acids that participated in coenzyme binding and the isomerase reaction. Homology modeling with UDP-galactose-4-epimerase predicts that Asp36 is responsible for the NAD(H) specificity of human 3β-HSD/isomerase and identifies the Rossmann-fold coenzyme domain at the amino terminus. The D36A/K37R mutant in the potential coenzyme domain and the D241N, D257L, D258L, and D265N mutants in the potential isomerase domain (previously identified by affinity labeling) were created, expressed, and purified. The D36A/K37R mutant shifts the cofactor preference of both 3β-HSD and isomerase from NAD(H) to NADP(H), which shows that the two activities utilize a common coenzyme domain. The D257L and D258L mutations eliminate isomerase activity, whereas the D241N and D265N mutants have nearly full isomerase activity. Kinetic analyses and pH dependence studies showed that either Asp257 or Asp258 plays a catalytic role in the isomerization reaction. These observations further characterize the structure/function relationships of human 3β-HSD/isomerase and bring us closer to the goal of selectively inhibiting the type 1 enzyme in placenta (to control the timing of labor) or in hormone-sensitive breast tumors (to slow their growth).

The type 1 (placenta, skin, mammary gland, prostate, endometrium) and type 2 (gonads, adrenals) isoforms of 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-steroid dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.145)/3-oxosteroid Δ5-Δ4-isomerase (EC 5.3.3.1) (3β-HSD 1The abbreviations used are: HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone./isomerase) are encoded by two distinct genes, which are expressed in a tissue-specific pattern in humans (1Rheaume E.

In human placenta, type 1 3β-HSD/isomerase catalyzes the conversion of 3β-hydroxy-5-ene steroids (dehydroepiandrosterone, pregnenolone) to 3-oxo-4-ene steroids (androstenedione, progesterone) on a single, dimeric protein containing both enzyme activities (2Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Androstenedione is converted by placental aromatase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) to estradiol, which participates in the cascade of events that initiates labor in humans (3Rainey W.E.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4573-4584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it catalyzes the first step in the conversion of circulating dehydroepiandrosterone to estradiol or testosterone to promote tumor growth. In human adrenals, type 2 3β-HSD/isomerase is a key enzyme required for the production of cortisol and aldosterone (3Rainey W.E. Carr B.R. Sasano H. Suzuki T. Mason J.I. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 234-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Determination of the structure/function relationships of the type 1 enzyme may lead to the development of specific inhibitors of type 1 3β-HSD/isomerase that can help control the timing of labor and slow the growth of hormone-sensitive tumors without compromising the essential functions of the adrenal enzyme. The two-step reaction of 3β-HSD/isomerase using dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as substrate is shown in Fig. 1. This reaction scheme shows the reduction of NAD+ to NADH by the rate-limiting 3β-HSD activity and the requirement of this NADH for the activation of isomerase on the same enzyme protein (2Thomas J.L.

According to our stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy study, NADH induces a time-dependent conformational change in the enzyme structure as the isomerase activity reaches a maximum over 1 min after the addition of the coenzyme (9Thomas J.L. Frieden C. Nash W.E. Strickler R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21003-21008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The intermediate steroid, 5-androstene-3,17-dione, remains bound during the reaction sequence (2Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J.

This model suggests that the 3β-HSD and isomerase domains of the enzyme are linked by a shared coenzyme domain that functions both as the binding site for NAD+ during the 3β-HSD reaction and as the coenzyme domain for the allosteric activation of isomerase. Human type 1 (placental) 3β-HSD/isomerase has a strict preference for NAD+ as the 3β-HSD cofactor and for NADH as the activator of isomerase. Substitution of NADP(H) for NAD(H) abolishes both enzyme activities in the native placental enzyme (2Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J.

The targeting of Asp residues for our current study is based on our homology modeling of human 3β-HSD/isomerase with other members of the short chain oxidoreductase family of proteins as well as on our previous affinity radiolabeled peptide and mutagenesis studies that identified critical amino acids in the putative isomerase domain of the enzyme (13Thomas J.L.

Characterization of the mutant enzymes with the D36A/K37R substitutions in the coenzyme domain and with the D241N, D257L, D258L, or D241N mutations in the isomerase region has been correlated with our homology data to produce the first three-dimensional model of human 3β-HSD/isomerase that elucidates key structure/function relationships. It has been shown that if the sequence of a protein of uncertain three-dimensional structure has 30% identity with the sequence of a protein for which the three-dimensional structure has been determined by x-ray crystallographic analysis, the unknown protein will have a similar fold. The fold will be similar enough that energy minimization of a model of the unknown protein based upon the crystallographically determined protein will produce a three-dimensional model useful for interpreting biochemical data, proposing and testing mechanisms of action, and designing enzyme inhibitors (15Borman S.

Materials—Dehydroepiandrosterone and pyridine nucleotides were purchased from Sigma and 5-androstene-3,17-dione from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). Reagent grade salts, chemicals, and analytical grade solvents are from Fisher. Glass-distilled deionized water was used for all aqueous solutions. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit (BD Biosciences) and pGEM-3βHSD1 as a template (14Thomas J.L. Evans B.W. Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Mason J.I. Adler S. Nash W.E. Isenberg K.E. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol.

The presence of the mutated codon and integrity of the entire mutant 3β-HSD cDNA were verified by automated dideoxynucleotide DNA sequencing using the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Chou-Fasman and Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson analysis of each mutant enzyme was used to choose amino acid substitutions that produced no apparent changes in the secondary structure of the protein (Protylze program, Scientific and Educational Software, State Line, PA). The adjacent Asp257 and Asp258 residues required substitution by Leu to avoid predicted changes in secondary structure, whereas the standard Asn substitution (12Xue L. Kuliopulos A. Mildvan A.S.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of the Mutant and Wild-type Enzymes— The mutant 3β-HSD cDNA was introduced into baculovirus as described previously (14Thomas J.L. Evans B.W.

Recombinant baculovirus was added to 1.5 × 109 Sf9 cells (1 liter) at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for expression of each mutant enzyme. The expressed mutant and wild-type enzymes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis, probed with our anti-3β-HSD polyclonal antibody, and detected using the ECL Western blotting system with antirabbit, a peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Each expressed enzyme was purified from the 100,000 × g pellet of the Sf9 cells (2 liters) by our published method (2Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Thomas J.L. Berko E.A. Faustino A. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using Igepal CO 720 (Rhodia, Inc., Cranbury, NJ) instead of the discontinued Emulgen 913 detergent (Kao Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Each expressed purified mutant and wild-type enzyme produced a single major protein band (42 kDa) on SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis that co-migrated with the human wild-type 1 control enzyme. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Kinetic Studies—Michaelis-Menten kinetic constants for the 3β-HSD substrate were determined for the purified mutant and wild-type enzymes in incubations containing dehydroepiandrosterone (2–100 μm) plus NAD+ or NADP+ (0.1 mm) and purified enzyme (0.03 mg) at 27 °C in 0.02 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The slope of the initial linear increase in absorbance at 340 nm/min (due to NADH production) was used to determine 3β-HSD activity. Kinetic constants for the isomerase substrate were determined at 27 °C in incubations of 5-androstene-3,17-dione (17–150 μm), NADH or NADPH (0.05 mm), and purified enzyme (0.01 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Isomerase activity was measured by the initial absorbance increase at 241 nm (due to androstenedione formation) as a function of time. Blank assays (zero-enzyme, zero-substrate) ensured that specific isomerase activity was measured as opposed to nonenzymatic “spontaneous” isomerization (8Thomas J.L. Berko E.A. Faustino A. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 31: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In addition, isomerase incubations without added coenzyme (NADH, NADPH) were used to measure any basal (zero-coenzyme) isomerase activity in the mutants, and this basal activity was subtracted as a blank and reported in the kinetic table legends. Changes in absorbance were measured with a Varian (Sugar Land, TX) Cary 219 recording spectrophotometer. The Michaelis-Menten constants (Km, V max) were calculated from Lineweaver-Burke (1/S versus 1/V) plots and verified by Hanes-Woolf (S versus S/V) plots (20Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley and Sons, New York1975: 109-111Google Scholar). K cat values (min–1) were calculated from the V max values (nmol/min/mg) and represent the maximal turnover rate (nmol of product formed/min/nmol of enzyme dimer). Kinetic constants for the 3β-HSD cofactor were determined for the purified mutant and wild-type enzymes in incubations containing NAD+ or NADP+ (20–100 μm), dehydroepiandrosterone (100 μm), and purified enzyme (0.03 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 27 °C using the spectrophotometric assay at 340 nm. Kinetic constants for the isomerase cofactor were determined in incubations of NADH or NADPH (2–50 μm), 5-androstene-3,17-dione (100 μm), and purified enzyme (0.01 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 27 °C using the spectrophotometric assay at 241 nm. Zero-coenzyme blanks were used as described above for the substrate kinetics. pH Dependence Studies—The pH profiles of the isomerase activities of the wild-type control, D241N, D257L, D258L, and D265N mutant enzymes were measured by the isomerase assay in incubations containing 5-androstene-3,17-dione (50 μm), NADH (50 μm), and purified enzyme (0.03 mg) in 0.05 m sodium phosphate pyrophosphate buffer, pH 6.5–8.0, at 27 °C. Modeling and Sequence Alignment—Amino acid and nucleotide sequences were retrieved from the Swiss Protein Database (21Bairoch A. Apweiler R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar). Crystallographic coordinates were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (22Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27555) Google Scholar). ClustalX was used for sequence alignments (23Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 24: 4876-4882Crossref Scopus (35497) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of human type 1 3β-HSD/isomerase was modeled using the crystal structure (24Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) of UDP-galactose 4-epimerase from Escherichia coli (Protein Data Bank accession code 1A9Z) as a template using the default settings of the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis web server (25Lund O. Frimand K. Gorodkin J. Bohr H. Bohr J. Hansen J. Brunak S. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The modeled images were produced using the Ribbons 2.0 program (26Carson M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 493-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Homology Modeling Targets the Coenzyme Domain—Homology analysis has revealed that many members of the short-chain oxidoreductase family of enzymes that utilize NAD+ as the preferred cofactor have an Asp36-Xaa37 sequence in the first β-α turn of the Rossmann-fold (β-α-β-α-β-α-β), and many members that utilize NADP+ have an Xaa36-Arg37 sequence in those positions (10Huang Y.W. Pineau I. Chang H.J. Azzi A. Bellemare V. Laberge S. Lin S.X. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2010-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 27Duax, W. L., Pletnev, V., Addlagatta, A., Bruenn, J., and Weeks, C. M. (2003) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet., in pressGoogle Scholar). Based upon analysis of the alignments, a fingerprint of 35 amino acid residues that are conserved at 70% or better in the entire family have been identified. This fingerprint has been used to predict fold, cofactor preference, aggregation properties, and substrate specificity of subsets of the unknown members of the short-chain oxidoreductase family (27Duax, W. L., Pletnev, V., Addlagatta, A., Bruenn, J., and Weeks, C. M. (2003) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet., in pressGoogle Scholar). Human type 1 3β-HSD/isomerase is a member of the short-chain oxidoreductase family. As shown in Table II, it has 30% overall sequence identity and 40% of the fingerprint residues that are conserved with E. coli UDP-galactose-4-epimerase), a short-chain oxidoreductase family member for which the x-ray crystal structure determination has been reported (24Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although homology modeling of 3β-HSD/isomerase using an enzyme such as UDP-galactose-4-epimerase may seem surprising, the smaller size of other hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (e.g. 17β-HSD1, monomeric molecular mass 34 kDa (10Huang Y.W. Pineau I. Chang H.J. Azzi A. Bellemare V. Laberge S. Lin S.X. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 2010-2020PubMed Google Scholar)) was a factor in the homology analysis. Both 3β-HSD/isomerase (42-kDa monomer) and UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (39-kDa monomer) are homodimers that have strict NAD+ cofactor specificity (2Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Nayar S. Bhattacharyya D. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 38: 353-360PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the 3β-HSD and epimerase catalytic events are closely related in that both use a YXXXK motif at the same position in the primary structure for the oxidation of a hydroxyl group (29Gerratana B. Cleland W.W. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9187-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, 3β-HSD/isomerase shares amino acid identity with 10 of the 24 residues in the Rossmann-fold cofactor-binding domain of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase. Analysis of the conserved residues of the fingerprint of UDP-galactose-4-epimerase identifies the Asp36 residue in 3β-HSD/isomerase that may be critical to cofactor specificity and, to test the model, targets the D36A/K37R mutant of 3β-HSD/isomerase.Table IIComparison of the fingerprint residues in UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (1A9Z) and human 3β-HSD1 Site-directed Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of the Mutant Enzymes—The cDNA encoding the D36A/K37R mutant of wild-type 1 3β-HSD/isomerase and the cDNA encoding the D241N, D257L, D258L, and D265N mutants (targeted by affinity radioalkylation (13Thomas J.L.

The locations of these targeted residues plus other key amino acids are indicated in the primary 3β-HSD/isomerase sequence (Fig. 2). As shown by the immunoblots in Fig. 3, the baculovirus system successfully expressed the mutant enzyme proteins in Sf9 cells. Each expressed enzyme was highly purified according to SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4) using our published method (2Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J.

The Sf9 cell homogenate (1.5 μg) containing the D241N, D257L, D258L, D265N, or D36A/K37R plus the purified control wild-type 1 3β-HSD (0.05 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (12%) gel electrophoresis.

In agreement with our previous results obtained for purified human type 1 placental 3β-HSD/isomerase (2Thomas J.L. Myers R.P. Strickler R.C. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 33: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the wild-type 1 enzyme exhibits 3β-HSD activity with NAD+ but not with NADP+ as the cofactor, and the wild-type 1 isomerase is activated only by NADH with NADPH producing no isomerase activity. In sharp contrast, the D36A/K37R mutant of the wild-type 1 enzyme has no measurable 3β-HSD activity with NAD+ as the cofactor and now utilizes NADP+ as the cofactor. In fact, D36A/K37R has a lower Km value for NADP+ than that measured for utilization of NAD+ by the wild-type 1 enzyme. Similarly, NADPH activates the D36A/K37R mutant, and NADH specificity of the wild-type 1 isomerase is completely lost.Table IIIComparison of NAD(H) and NADP(H) cofactor kinetics for the 3β-HSD and isomerase activities of the purified D36A/K37R and wild-type enzymesCofactorActivityWild-type 1D36A/K37RKmKcatKmKcatμmmin-1μmmin-1NAD+3β-HSDaKinetic constants for the 3β-HSD cofactor were determined in incubations containing NAD+ (20-100 μm), dehydroepiandrosterone (100 μm), and purified enzyme (0.03 mg) in 0.02 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 27 °C.

The D36A/K37R mutant exhibits the same 3-fold lower turnover rate (K cat) compared with the wild-type enzyme for the utilization of both substrate and coenzymes by both the 3β-HSD and isomerase activities.

L., Kung, H. J., Chen, H., Shimizu, Y., and Qiu, Y. (2001) Nat Cell Biol. 3, 439–444). The molecular mechanisms of Bmx-induced cell motility have so far remained unknown. Previous studies by us and others have demonstrated that a complex formation between the docking protein p130Cas (Cas) and the adapter protein Crk is instrumental in connecting several stimuli to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. We demonstrate here that expression of Bmx leads to an interaction between Bmx and Cas at membrane ruffles, which are sites of active actin remodeling in motile cells. Expression of Bmx also enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and Cas·Crk complex formation, and coexpression of Bmx with Cas results in an enhanced membrane ruffling and haptotactic cell migration. Importantly, a mutant form of Bmx that fails to interact with Cas also fails to induce cell migration. Furthermore, expression of a dominant-negative form of Cas that is incapable of interacting with Crk inhibits Bmx-induced membrane ruffling and cell migration. These studies suggest that Bmx-Cas interaction, phosphorylation of Cas by Bmx, and subsequent Cas·Crk complex formation functionally couple Bmx to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility.

Cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration are critical aspects of normal development, wound healing, and inflammatory response. Integrins, which are the major cell surface receptors that interact with extracellular matrix components, generate signals that regulate reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility in coordination with signaling events stimulated by receptors for soluble growth factors (1Lauffenburger D.A.

Ligand binding of integrins results in catalytic activation of FAK and in its autophosphorylation at Tyr-397, which serves as a binding site for several Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins including Src kinases. The binding of Src kinases to FAK leads to further phosphorylation of FAK and also to phosphorylation and activation of a number of cytoskeleton-linked proteins, which transduce integrin-generated signals to downstream signaling pathways (reviewed in Refs. 3Schlaepfer D.D.

Exogenous expression of FAK in turn is known to enhance cell motility of various cell types, and a number of groups have reported that FAK protein levels and/or its activity are up-regulated in invasive cancer cells (see Ref. 12Jones R.J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. Eur. J. Cancer. 2000; 36: 1595-1606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and references therein). FAK is thought to mediate cell migration by recruitment and phosphorylation of the docking protein p130Cas (Cas). Thus, a dominant-negative form of Cas has been shown to inhibit FAK-mediated haptotactic cell migration (13Cary L.A. Han D.C. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Guan J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Cas contains multiple protein-protein interaction domains, including an SH3 domain at the N terminus, a Src-binding (SB) domain toward the C terminus, and an interior substrate domain (SD) (see Fig. 3A) (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of Cas is thought to regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Cas because it interacts with tyrosine kinases, such as FAK (15Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The SD domain of Cas is the major region of tyrosine phosphorylation and consists of 15 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (YXXP). When phosphorylated, the YXXP motif conforms to the binding consensus for the Crk SH2 domain (29Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. et al.Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar) and integrin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is known to lead to recruitment of the adapter protein c-CrkII (22Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Cas·Crk complex has been shown to serve as a “molecular switch” for induction of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. Thus, overexpression of wild-type Cas alone or in combination with Crk leads to an enhancement of membrane ruffling and haptotactic cell migration on extracellular matrix, whereas dominant-negative forms of Cas and Crk that are unable to interact with each other block stimuli-induced cell motility (30Klemke R.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The most direct role for Cas in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics comes from studies done with fibroblasts derived from Cas–/– embryos. These fibroblasts contain disorganized actin filaments, deficiency in cell spreading, and decreased haptotaxis toward the integrin ligand fibronectin (FN), very similar to FAK and Src-deficient fibroblasts (7Ilic D.

It was shown recently that integrins regulate the activity of another tyrosine kinase, ETK/Bmx, which is a member of the Tec/Btk family of tyrosine kinases (37Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition to the SH2, SH3, and kinase domains, the Tec family of tyrosine kinases also contain an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain (38Tamagnone L. Lahtinen I. Mustonen T. Virtaneva K.

Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) reported that adhesion of endothelial cells on FN induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Bmx, which correlated with its interaction with FAK. The interaction between Bmx and FAK was found to occur via the pleckstrin homology and FERM domains, respectively. Bmx mutants that failed to interact with FAK were found to inhibit FAK- and FN-induced cell migration, indicating that integrin-dependent Bmx-FAK interaction is required for haptotactic cell motility by an unknown mechanism. In this report, we have investigated the possibility that Cas would function as a downstream target for Bmx and mediate Bmx-induced cell motility. We found that expression of Bmx leads to a complex formation between Bmx and Cas at membrane ruffles, which are sites of active actin remodeling in motile cells. Our data also indicate that Bmx enhances tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and its interaction with Crk. Furthermore, Bmx and Cas were found to enhance membrane ruffling and haptotactic cell migration and Bmx-induced membrane ruffling and cell migration were found to take place in a Cas-dependent manner. These studies suggest that phosphorylation of Cas by Bmx functionally couples Bmx to the regulation of actin cytoskeleton and cell motility. Constructs and Reagents—The pCIneo expression vectors for HA-tagged forms of wild-type and kinase-dead Bmx have been described previously (40Saharinen P. Ekman N. Sarvas K. Parker P. Alitalo K. Silvennoinen O. Blood. 1997; 90: 4341-4353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ekman N. Arighi E. Rajantie I. Saharinen P. Ristimaki A. Silvennoinen O. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4151-4158Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged Bmx SH2 mutant (R322V) in pCIneo was generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild-type Cas and its ΔSD and ΔSB mutant forms in the pEBG mammalian expression vector have been described previously (30Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 42Mayer B.J. Hirai H. Sakai R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 296-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The pEBG-Cas SH3 mutant (W137A) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described above. Expressed proteins in the pEBG-vector contain an N-terminal GST tag. The GST-CasSD, GST-CasSB, and GST-CasSH3 constructs in the pGEX-3X bacterial expression vector coding for the GST fusion proteins of the SD, SB, and SH3 domains of Cas, respectively (14Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), were obtained from Dr. Hisamaru Hirai. The anti-Cas, anti-Bmx, and anti-Crk monoclonal antibodies and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY-20 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-Cas polyclonal (C-20 and N-17) and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The anti-Src monoclonal antibody 327 and the anti-GST polyclonal antibody were generous gifts from Drs. Joan Brugge (Harvard Medical School) and Elena Pasquale (The Burnham Institute), respectively. Rhodamine-phalloidin as well as Alexa 458- and Alexa 546-labeled secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium (Irvine Scientific) containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were maintained in Ham's F12 growth medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. COS-7 and 293T cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Kinase Assays—COS-7 and 293T cells transfected with the various expression plasmids were washed in PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-GST antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were captured with protein A-Sepharose, washed, and eluted with 2× sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were loaded on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. For coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, PAE cells were serum-starved for 16 h, detached, held in suspension for 2 h, and replated on FN-coated (10 μg/ml) or poly-l-lysine (PLL)-coated (20 μg/ml) plastic dishes for 30 min. The cells were washed in PBS and lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described in Chen et al. (37Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and immunoprecipitated with anti-Bmx antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cas antibodies. In vitro immunocomplex kinase assays were carried out by immunoprecipitating HA-tagged Bmx or c-Src from COS-7 cell lysates as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2). The immunoprecipitates were equally divided and resuspended in 18 μl of kinase buffer with or without 1 μm Src inhibitor SU6656 in the presence of either 2 μg of GST or 2 μg of GST-CasSD as a putative substrate. After a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were initiated by the addition of 10 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (final concentrations) and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for an additional 20 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 2× sample buffer, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and fractionated on an SDS-PAGE. The gel was washed, stained, destained, dried, and subjected to autoradiography for 12 h. GST Fusion Protein Expression—DH5α cells harboring the various GST-Cas constructs (see above) were grown overnight, diluted 5-fold with fresh LB medium for 2 h, and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for an additional 2 h. The fusion proteins were purified as described previously (43Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar). To obtain tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-CasSD and GST-CasSB fusion proteins, the pGEX-CasSD and the pGEX-CasSB plasmids were transformed into Epicurean Coli TKX1-competent cells (Stratagene), which harbor a plasmid-encoded, inducible tyrosine kinase gene. The cells were grown, induced, and lysed according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cell Migration Assay—Haptotactic cell migration assays in COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (44Abassi Y.A. Vuori K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4571-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The underside of the Transwell membranes was coated with 10 μg/ml FN for 2 h at 37 °C. 8.0 × 105 COS-7 cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 0.5 μg of the indicated plasmids along with 0.5 μg of pEGFP plasmid as a marker for the transfected cells. The cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA, washed in serum-free medium, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and counted and adjusted to 106 cells/ml. 100 μl of the cell suspension were placed in the Transwell membranes and allowed to migrate to the underside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells on the top chamber were removed with a cotton swab, and the cells migrating to the underside of the filter were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The filters were cut and mounted on a coverslip, and the green fluorescent protein-positive cells were visualized and photographed using a Nikon immunofluorescence microscope. As a control for transfection efficiency and cell spreading, 5.0 × 105 cells were allowed to spread on FN-coated chamber slides for 30 min and then fixed and visualized under the microscope. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PAE or COS-7 cells that had been transfected with the indicated constructs were serum-starved for 16 h, detached, and resuspended in serum-free medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. The cells were kept in suspension for 2 h and then seeded on PLL- or FN-coated coverslips for 30 min. The cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum in PBS followed by incubation with the indicated antibodies and rhodamine-phalloidin. The cells were visualized and photographed as described previously (44Abassi Y.A. Vuori K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4571-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Bmx Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Cas and Cas-Crk Interaction—The tyrosine kinase Bmx is activated in response to cell adhesion on FN and is required for cell migration on FN (37Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The docking protein Cas becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in an adhesion-dependent manner on FN and other extracellular matrix components and is involved in maintaining the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton and regulating cell migration by recruiting the adapter protein Crk (22Vuori K.

A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To investigate the putative role of Cas in Bmx-induced cell motility, we first sought to determine whether Bmx can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and a subsequent interaction between Cas and Crk. COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors coding for GST-tagged wild-type Cas alone or together with HA-tagged wild-type Bmx (HA-Bmx WT) or with HA-tagged kinase-dead Bmx (HA-Bmx KD). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-GST antibodies, and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. When expressed alone, GST-Cas was only weakly tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 1A). Coexpression of HA-Bmx WT in turn led to a significant increase in Cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of HA-Bmx KD had no effect on Cas phosphorylation, indicating that the observed increase in Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was dependent on a functional kinase domain in Bmx. To examine the possibility that Cas and Bmx interact in cells, the anti-GST immunoprecipitates were probed with anti-HA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1A, HA-Bmx WT but not HA-Bmx KD coimmunoprecipitated with GST-Cas, suggesting that Bmx forms a complex with Cas in a manner that depends on the kinase activity of Bmx and/or on the tyrosine phosphorylation status of Cas. The amount of Bmx interacting with Cas was approximately 5–20% of the total amount of Bmx, slightly varying from one experiment to another. To determine whether Bmx modulates the interaction between Cas and Crk, the cellular lysates described above were immunoprecipitated with anti-Crk antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-Cas antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, coexpression of Cas with HA-Bmx WT but not with HA-Bmx KD induced an interaction between Crk and Cas. Taken together, expression of Bmx leads to an interaction between Bmx and Cas and to an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas and Cas·Crk complex formation. Integrin-dependent Localization and Interaction of Endogenous Bmx and Cas Proteins in Endothelial Cells—Integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading lead to an increase in Cas phosphorylation and localization of Cas to the cell periphery in COS-7 cells (30Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Bmx in turn has been shown to localize to the perimeter of FN-plated endothelial cells (37Chen R. Kim O. Li M. Xiong X. Guan J.L. Kung H.J. Chen H. Shimizu Y. Qiu Y. Nat Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the subcellular localization of endogenous Cas and Bmx proteins in endothelial cells upon integrin ligand binding and the capability of integrin ligation to modulate Cas-Bmx interaction. To this end, serum-starved PAE cells were detached and replated on FN-coated coverslips for 30 min. As a control, the cells were also plated on PLL to which they adhered in an integrin-independent manner. The cells were fixed and stained with monoclonal anti-Cas and anti-Bmx antibodies as well as with rhodamine-phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. As shown in Fig. 2A, PAE cells failed to spread on PLL-coated surfaces and exhibited a diffuse Cas and Bmx staining on PLL. In contrast, Bmx and Cas localized to the perimeter of the spreading cells on FN and this localization was coincident with the staining of cortical actin by rhodamine-phalloidin. This staining pattern was suggestive of colocalization of Bmx and Cas in the cell periphery upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Unfortunately, our efforts to study this further by coimmunostaining with anti-Cas and anti-Bmx antibodies were hampered by the low sensitivity of polyclonal anti-Cas antibodies in immunofluorescence and by unspecific reactivity of the monoclonal anti-Bmx antibodies with secondary rabbit antibodies (data not shown). Biochemical means were therefore used to examine whether endogenous Cas and Bmx proteins physically interact in endothelial cells and whether the interaction is modulated by integrin ligation. To this end, serum-starved PAE cells were detached and plated on PLL- or on FN-coated plates for 30 min. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Cas and anti-Bmx antibodies. Immunoblot of Cas immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies indicated that Cas tyrosine phosphorylation was significantly augmented, as expected, upon cell adhesion on FN but not on PLL. Importantly, the enhanced phosphorylation of Cas correlated with the interaction of Cas with Bmx (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that integrin-mediated cell adhesion leads to the localization of endogenous Cas and Bmx proteins at the cell periphery and to an enhanced interaction between the two proteins as assessed by coimmunoprecipitation studies. Bmx Induces Tyrosine Phosphorylation of the Cas SD in Vivo and in Vitro—To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of Bmx-Cas interaction, HA-Bmx WT was coexpressed with various mutant forms of GST-tagged Cas in COS-7 cells and the tyrosine phosphorylation status of the expressed Cas proteins and their interaction with Bmx were analyzed. When expressed alone, wild-type GST-Cas and the various mutant forms of Cas exhibited little tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Upon coexpression with Bmx, wild-type Cas and a form of Cas that lacked a functional SH3 domain became robustly tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3B). These two forms of Cas also readily interacted with Bmx (Fig. 3C). The Cas-SH3 mutant protein is incapable of interacting with FAK (data not shown) (16Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R.

https://openalex.org/W1975953683,"Oxidative stress is increasingly recognized as a key mechanism in the biotransformation and/or toxicity of many xenobiotics. Human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1) is a polymorphic ubiquitous phase II xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransformation of primary aromatic amine or hydrazine drugs and carcinogens. Functional and structural studies have shown that NAT1 catalytic activity is based on a cysteine protease-like catalytic triad, containing a reactive cysteine residue. Reactive protein cysteine residues are highly susceptible to oxidation by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generated within the cell. We, therefore, investigated whether human NAT1 activity was regulated by this cellular oxidant. Using purified recombinant NAT1, we show here that NAT1 is rapidly (k inact = 420 m–1·min–1) inactivated by physiological concentrations of H2O2. Reducing agents, such as reduced glutathione (GSH), reverse the H2O2-dependent inactivation of NAT1. Kinetic analysis and protection experiments with acetyl-CoA, the physiological acetyl-donor substrate of the enzyme, suggested that the H2O2-dependent inactivation reaction targets the active-site cysteine residue. Finally, we show that the reversible inactivation of NAT1 by H2O2 is due to the formation of a stable sulfenic acid group at the active-site cysteine. Our results suggest that, in addition to known genetically controlled interindividual variations in NAT1 activity, oxidative stress and cellular redox status may also regulate NAT1 activity. This may have important consequences with regard to drug biotransformation and cancer risk.

All organisms respond to harmful stressors, whether of endogenous or environmental origin (e.g. cellular by-products or chemical xenobiotics), by producing stress-related proteins including heat-shock proteins, antioxidant proteins and xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes (XME) 1The abbreviations used are: XME, xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme; NAT1, human arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1; PAS, p-aminosalicylic acid; PNPA, p-nitrophenylacetate; AcCoA, acetyl-coenzyme A; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase.

The acetyl-CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NATs; EC 2.3.1.5) are phase II XME that catalyze the transfer of an acetyl moiety from acetyl-CoA to the nitrogen or oxygen atom of primary arylamines, hydrazines, and their N-hydroxylated metabolites (2Pompeo F. Brooke E. Akane K. Mushtaq A. Sim E. Pharmacogenomics. 2002; 3: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NATs, therefore, play an important role in the detoxification and/or activation of substrates, including arylamine drugs and carcinogens (3Hein D.W. Toxicol. Lett. 2000; 112–113: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 4Hein D.W. Mutat. Res. 2002; 65: 506-507Google Scholar). NAT enzymes have been identified in several species (5Upton A.

Pharmacogenomics J. 2002; 2: 152-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In humans, two functional isoforms of NATs (NAT1 and NAT2) have been described (9Matas N. Thygesen P. Stacey M. Risch A. Sim E. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 77: 290-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interindividual genetic variations in their genes have been shown to cause differences in NAT1 and NAT2 protein levels and activity. These variations are a potential source of pharmacological and/or pathological susceptibility (4Hein D.W. Mutat. Res. 2002; 65: 506-507Google Scholar, 10Butcher N. Boukouvala S. Sim E. Minchin R.F.

Although the human NAT1 and NAT2 protein sequences are 81% identical (12Blum M. Grant D.M. McBride W. Heim M. Meyer U.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), their kinetic selectivity for amine-containing acceptor substrates differs markedly (13Grant D.M. Blum M. Beer M. Meyer U.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 39: 184-191PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue distributions of these two enzymes also differ, with NAT2 present principally in the liver and intestinal epithelium and NAT1 being ubiquitous (2Pompeo F. Brooke E. Akane K. Mushtaq A. Sim E. Pharmacogenomics. 2002; 3: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 11Meisel P. Pharmacogenomics. 2002; 3: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the crystal structures of NATs from Salmonella typhimurium and Mycobacterium smegmatis and homology models of the two human NATs have revealed structural similarity to cysteine proteases and the existence of a conserved cysteine protease-like catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp) in the catalytic core of NATs (14Sinclair J.C. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 15Rodrigues-Lima F. Deloménie C. Goodfellow G.H. Grant D.M. Dupret J.M. Biochem.

Biol. 2002; 318: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These structural data show that vertebrate and eubacterial NATs have adapted a catalytic mechanism commonly found in cysteine proteases for use in acetyl-transfer reactions (2Pompeo F. Brooke E. Akane K. Mushtaq A. Sim E. Pharmacogenomics. 2002; 3: 19-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14Sinclair J.C. Sandy J. Delgoda R. Sim E. Noble M.E. Nat. Struct.

Redox-dependent regulation of catalytic activities by reversible oxidation of an active-site cysteine residue has been reported for several enzymes, including protein phosphatases (18Caselli A.

Stamenkovic I. Winterbourn C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). H2O2 is one of the oxidants that has been shown to regulate cell function, by oxidizing active cysteine residues in proteins to cysteine sulfenic acid or to disulfide (20Lee S. Yang K. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 25Wu Y. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). In vivo, H2O2 formation is mainly due to enzymatic reactions such as the superoxide dismutase-dependent dismutation of superoxide (26Halliwell B. Clement M. Long L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 10-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 28Morel Y. Barouki R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 29Culotta V. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 2000; 36: 117-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although superoxide can oxidize proteins (30Hausladen A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29405-29408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), H2O2, its main product, has appeared as a critical element involved in many cellular functions, including cell signaling (20Lee S.

J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Google Scholar). In addition, substantial increases in the intracellular concentration of H2O2 are generally associated with deleterious conditions such as apoptosis, necrosis, inflammation, and cancer (20Lee S. Yang K. Kwon J. Lee C. Jeong W. Rhee S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20336-20342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 26Halliwell B. Clement M. Long L.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L1005-L1028Google Scholar). The induction of H2O2 production by xenobiotics has also been described, with potential effects on cysteine-containing proteins (32Penning T. Ohnishi S. Ohnishi T. Harvey R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 33Feinendegen L. Hum. Exp.

Mechanistic Toxicology. The Molecular Basis of How Chemicals Disrupt Biological Targets. Taylor and Francis Group, London2003Google Scholar). Redox-dependent detoxification and/or activation of xenobiotics also suggests that cellular redox conditions may affect XME-dependent biotransformations (35Boelsterli U. Mechanistic Toxicology.

We investigated here whether the catalytic activity of human NAT1 was regulated by H2O2. We found that NAT1 activity was reversibly inhibited by physiologically relevant concentrations of H2O2. We demonstrate that H2O2 oxidized rapidly NAT1, leading to oxidative inactivation of the enzyme. This H2O2-dependent inactivation of NAT1 probably results from oxidative modification of the essential catalytic cysteine residue to a stabilized cysteine sulfenic acid, as shown for other enzymes (39Clairbone A. Yeh J. Conn Mallett T. Luba J. Crane III, E. Charrier V. Parsonage D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15407-15416Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 40Clairbone A. Mallet T. Yeh J. Luba J.

Cell. 2002; 111: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The inactivated NAT1 was reactivated by physiological thiols, such as reduced glutathione. Our results suggest that in addition to the polymorphic-dependent variation of NAT1 activity, H2O2 and, more broadly, cellular redox status, could also regulate NAT1 activity, which may have important consequences with regard to drug toxicity and cancer risk. Materials—p-Aminosalicylic acid (PAS, a NAT1-selective arylamine acceptor substrate), p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA, acetyl donor), acetylcoenzyme A (AcCoA, acetyl donor), coenzyme A (CoA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (dimedone), 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), reduced glutathione (GSH), imidazole, lysozyme and glutathione-agarose, bovine catalase (5200 units/mg), glucose oxidase (type II from Aspergillus niger, 15,500 units/g), and β-d-glucose were purchased from Sigma. PGEX-2T vector and Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were supplied by Amersham Biosciences. The pET28 vector was obtained from Novagen. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow resin was purchased from Qiagen. Anti-fluorescein Fab′ fragments conjugated to peroxidase, fluorescein-conjugated iodoacetamide, and complete protease inhibitor tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma or Eurobio (Les Ulis, France). The Bradford protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human NAT1—The human NAT1 cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. D. Grant (Toronto, Canada), was subcloned into pGEX-2T and pET28 vectors. The resulting constructs encoded the enzyme as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (GST-NAT1) and as a polyhistidine-tagged fusion protein (His-NAT1), respectively. We transformed BL21(DE3) bacteria with these constructs, induced expression of the transgene with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cultured the cells for 4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 30 min), washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested by centrifugation (6,000 × g, 30 min). Pellets were stored at –80 °C until required. For the purification of recombinant proteins, pellets (from 1-liter cultures) were resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl (lysis buffer) containing lysozyme (1 mg/ml final concentration) and protease inhibitors. Following incubation (1 h at 4 °C), protease inhibitors, DNase I (20 μg/ml final concentration), and 0.2% Triton X-100 (final concentration) were added, and the suspension was incubated for an additional hour at 4 °C. Lysates were then subjected to sonication on ice (five pulses of 10 s each), centrifuged (12,000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant collected. For the purification of GST-NAT1, this supernatant was added to glutathione-agarose beads (40 mg/liter of original culture) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were then poured into a column and washed successively with 5 volumes of lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 followed by 5 volumes of lysis buffer alone. GST-NAT1 was then eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione (final) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA. The purified enzyme was reduced by incubation with 10 mm DTT (final concentration) for 10 min at 4 °C and was then dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. The His-NAT1 protein was prepared in a similar manner to GST-NAT1. Briefly, supernatants from bacterial lysates were incubated with 1.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin in the presence of 20 mm imidazole (final concentration) for2hat4 °C. The resin was then poured into a column and washed successively with lysis buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole (final concentration). His-NAT1 was eluted with 300 mm imidazole (final concentration) in lysis buffer. Purified His-NAT1 was reduced by incubation with 10 mm DTT (final concentration) for 10 min at 4 °C and was then dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out at each stage of purification, and protein concentrations were determined using a standard Bradford assay. Recombinant-tagged NAT1 enzyme was used in a previous study for functional characterization of the NAT1 enzyme (42Sinclair J. Sim E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we used both GST-NAT1 and His-NAT1 as sources of purified recombinant NAT1 enzyme, and similar results were obtained with both proteins in all experiments. Enzyme Assays—NAT1 enzyme activity was determined spectrophotometrically (410 nm), using PNPA as the acetyl donor and PAS as the NAT1-specific arylamine substrate, as described by Mushtaq et al. (43Mushtaq A. Payton M. Sim E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated or non-treated samples (10–20 μl) containing NAT1 enzyme were assayed in a reaction mixture containing 500 μm PAS (final concentration) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. Reactions were started by adding 125 μm PNPA (final concentration). In all reaction mixtures (total volume of 1 ml), the final concentration of NAT1 was 15 nm. The reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min incubation at 37 °C, and the reaction was then quenched by adding SDS (1% final concentration). p-Nitrophenol, generated by the NAT1-mediated hydrolysis of PNPA in the presence of PAS, was quantified by measuring absorbance at 410 nm with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate analyzer (Metertech). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme giving an A 410 value of 0.5 per 10 min per ml. For the controls, we omitted the enzyme, PNPA, or PAS. All enzyme reactions were performed in quadruplicate, in conditions in which the initial rates were linear. Enzyme activities are shown as percentages of control NAT1 activity. Reaction of NAT1 with H2O2 in the Presence or Absence of Other Compounds—Concentrations of stock H2O2 solutions were determined by measuring absorbance at 240 nm (ϵ240 = 44 M–1·cm–1). In all subsequent experiments, the final concentration of enzyme during the oxidation step with H2O2 was 1.5 μm, giving a final concentration in the enzyme assay of 15 nm. The total volume of the enzyme assay (1 ml) provided a great enough dilution (1:50 or 1:100) of the various compounds used to prevent these compounds from interfering with NAT1 enzyme activity measurements. NAT1 activity in the absence of H2O2 was taken as 100% activity (control). We assessed the effect of bolus addition of H2O2 on NAT1 enzyme activity by incubating purified NAT1 samples (1.5 μm final concentration) with various concentrations of H2O2 in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (total volume of 10 μl) for 10 min at 37 °C. Mixtures were then assayed for NAT1 activity, as described above. In reactivation experiments, NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was first oxidized by H2O2 (200 μm final concentration), as described above, and incubated with catalase (300 unit/ml) for 1 min at 37 °C. The mixture was then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of DTT or GSH in a total volume of 20 μl. A NAT1 enzyme assay was then carried out. Assays performed in this conditions (with catalase) but without H2O2 gave 100% NAT1 activity. In substrate protection experiments, NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was first incubated with various concentrations of AcCoA or CoA (final concentrations of 0.4–4 mm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (total volume of 10 μl) for 5 min at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated with H2O2 (200 μm final concentration) in a total volume of 20 μl, as described above, and assayed. Assays performed in these conditions with AcCoA or CoA alone gave 100% NAT1 activity. In dimedone assays, NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was first incubated with H2O2 (200 μm final concentration) in the presence of 10 mm dimedone (a specific reagent of sulfenic acid) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (10 μl total volume) for 10 min at 37 °C. It was then incubated with DTT (5 mm final concentration, 20 μl total volume) for 10 min at 37 °C. Residual NAT1 activity was assayed as described above. Assays performed in these conditions, with dimedone alone (10 mm final concentration) gave 100% NAT1 activity. For the kinetic analysis of H2O2-dependent NAT1 inactivation, NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was incubated with H2O2 (final concentration of 100–400 μm)at37 °Cin25mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA. At various time intervals, aliquots were removed and assayed for residual activity. The equation for the rate of inactivation of recombinant NAT1 by H2O2 can be represented as: –d[NAT1]/dt = k inact[NAT1] [H2O2], where [NAT1] is the concentration of active enzyme, and k inact is the second-order rate constant. Provided that H2O2 is present in substantial excess, the apparent first-order inactivation rate constants (k obs = k inact[H2O2]) can be calculated for each H2O2 concentration from the slope of the natural log (ln) of percent residual activity plotted against time. The second-order rate constant was determined from the slope of k obs plotted against H2O2 concentrations. Reaction of NAT1 with H2O2 Generated by Glucose Oxidase—The effect of continuous generation of H2O2 by glucose oxidase on NAT1 was carried out as described previously (44Barbouti A.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Quantification of H2O2 generated by 0.15 unit/ml of glucose oxidase was determined by measuring the absorbance at 240 nm, and the peroxidase/o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride assay as described elsewhere (44Barbouti A. Paschalis-Thomas D. Lambros N. Tenopoulou M. Galaris D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 691-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 46Panayiotidis M. Tsolas O. Galaris D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We assessed the effect of continuous generation of H2O2 by glucose oxidase by incubating purified NAT1 (1.5 μm) with glucose oxidase (0.15 unit/ml) and glucose (5 mm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA (total volume of 15 μl) at 37 °C. At various time intervals, catalase (300 units/ml) was added prior to NAT1 residual activity measurements. Controls where catalase was added to the glucose/glucose oxidase system were carried out. In addition, controls without glucose oxidase, without glucose, and without catalase were also done. Assays were all done in quaduplicate. H2O2 constant production rate in these experiments was determined to be ≈6 μm H2O2/min. Fluorescein-conjugated Iodoacetamide Labeling of Proteins—Purified NAT1 (1.5 μm final concentration) was preincubated with or without (control) various concentrations of H2O2 (final concentration from 50 to 400 μm) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated iodoacetamide (20 μm final concentration) for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Western blotting, using anti-fluorescein Fab′ fragments conjugated to peroxidase. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in quadruplicate, unless otherwise stated. We used Student's t test, as appropriate, with levels of significance set at p < 0.05 (*) or p < 0.01 (**). Protein Determination, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were combined with reducing 4 × SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western blotting, following separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBS) containing 5% nonfat milk powder for 1 h. Anti-fluorescein Fab′ fragments conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:100,000) was added and the membrane incubated for 1 h in TBS. The membrane was washed and incubated with Supersignal reagent (Pierce) for detection. In Vitro Inactivation of NAT1 by Bolus Addition of H2O2 and by Continuous Generation of H2O2 by the Glucose/Glucose Oxidase System—Several enzymes with catalytic cysteine residues have been shown to be reversibly inactivated by H2O2, a major physiological oxidant (18Caselli A.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Given the reactive nature of the active site cysteine residue of NAT enzymes (47Andres H.H. Klem A.J. Schopfer L.M.

Acta. 2003; 1620: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we reasoned that human NAT1 could be a potential target for reversible inactivation by H2O2. We, therefore, produced the human NAT1 enzyme in E. coli and purified it as a fully active GST- or His-tagged protein. Recombinant NAT1 was then used to investigate the effect of physiologically relevant concentrations of H2O2 (26Halliwell B. Clement M. Long L.

First, reduced NAT1 enzyme (1.5 μm final concentration) was incubated with various concentrations of H2O2 (5–200 μm final concentration) and residual NAT1 activity was measured. NAT1 activity was significantly inhibited by H2O2, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). At a concentration of 200 μm, H2O2 inhibited the enzyme by over 90%. An IC50 of 45 μm was obtained for an enzyme concentration of 1.5 μm. To make a more realistic and physiologic assessment of the effect of H2O2 on NAT1 activity, we used another source of H2O2, the steady conversion of β-d-glucose to d-gluconolactone and H2O2, which is catalyzed by glucose oxidase (45Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B (filled circles), NAT1 (1.5 μm final) was also inactivated by the constant production of H2O2 through the glucose/glucose oxidase system. In the conditions used, the constant production rate of H2O2 was estimated to be ≈6 μm H2O2/min, which is physiologically relevant (45Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway III, K. Goldkorn T. J. Biol.

Accordingly, DAGKα is activated by phospholipase C-coupled receptors in a calcium-dependent manner. One of the first functions attributed to DAGKα in lymphocytes was that of regulating interleukin 2-induced cell cycle entry. Interleukin-2 nonetheless exerts its action in the absence of cytosolic calcium increase. We have studied alternative receptor-derived signals to explain calcium-independent DAGKα activation, and show that DAGKα is stimulated by Src-like kinase-dependent phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) activation in lymphocytes. Our results demonstrate that, in vivo, the increase in cellular levels of PI3K products is sufficient to induce DAGKα activation, allowing DAGKα relocation to the intact lymphocyte plasma membrane. This activation is isoform-specific, because other type I DAGKs are not subject to this type of regulation. These studies are the first to describe a pathway in which, in the absence of receptor-regulated calcium increase, DAGKα activation and membrane localization is a direct consequence of PI3K activation.

Diacylglycerol kinases (DAGK) 1The abbreviations used are: DAGK, diacylglycerol kinase; DAG, diacylglycerol; PA, phosphatidic acid; PI, phosphoinositides; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; IL, interleukin; PH, pleckstrin homology; RFP, red fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI-3,4-P2, phosphoinositide 3,4-bisphosphate; PI-3,4,5-P3, phosphoinosite 3,4,5-triphosphate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PDK-1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1. are a family of enzymes that phosphorylate diacylglycerol (DAG) to generate phosphatidic acid (PA). Activation of these enzymes can modify the balance between the two lipids, both of which have important second messenger functions. Nine DAGK isoforms have been characterized in mammalian cells; all have a conserved catalytic domain and at least two cysteine-rich, C1-like domains of unknown function. DAGK family members are grouped into five subtypes based on the presence of additional regulatory domains in their primary sequences (1Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The existence of different regulatory motifs in DAGK primary sequences suggests that these enzymes are regulated by distinct mechanisms. DAGKα, a type I DAGK, is expressed mainly in neuronal tissues and leukocytes of the lymphoid lineage. The type I enzymes are the only DAGKs that possess a pair of Ca2+-binding EF-hands (2Sakane F. Yamada K. Kanoh H. Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Nature. 1990; 344: 345-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) as well as a recoverin homology domain (3Jiang Y. Qian W. Hawes J.W. Walsh J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34092-34099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) at the N-terminal region as a characteristic regulatory domain. Accordingly, DAGKα is stimulated in vitro by Ca2+, as predictably will be the other two isoforms of this class (4Sakane F. Masahiro K. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The recoverin homology domain and the EF-hands appear to act as a single domain with inhibitory properties, as deletion of the Ca2+-regulated DAGKα N-terminal domain generates a constitutively active enzyme (3Jiang Y. Qian W. Hawes J.W. Walsh J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34092-34099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Sakane F. Masahiro K. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that localizes to the plasma membrane in the absence of stimulus (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This suggests that the receptor-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration provokes a conformational change in DAGKα that releases the inhibitory effect of this region and enables enzyme interaction with cell membranes. Data from several laboratories indicate that DAGKα is a cytosolic protein that translocates to the plasma membrane following stimulation of certain receptors known to activate phospholipase C (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 6Schirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). At the membrane, the protein acts by down-modulating phospholipase C-generated DAG levels. In lymphoid cells, for instance, DAGKα acts down-stream of the T cell receptor as a negative regulator of the DAG generated during T cell activation (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Ca2+ elevation is not the only mechanism by which DAGKα is activated in response to receptor triggering. DAGKα activity increases shortly after IL-2 binding (7Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and DAGKα-mediated PA generation is essential for IL-2-regulated cell cycle entry (8Flores I. Jones D.R. Cipres A. Diaz-Flores E. Sanjuan M.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 708-714PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2 nonetheless exerts its functions in the absence of phospholipase C-mediated Ca2+ increases (9Mills G.B. Cheung R.K. Grinstein S. Gelfand E.W. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 2431-2435PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting alternative DAGKα activation mechanisms. The IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) is composed of three subunits, two of which (β and γc) belong to the cytokine receptor superfamily. Although lacking intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, IL-2 binding to its high affinity receptor activates cytosolic Src and Jak tyrosine kinases (10Taniguchi T. Miyazaki T. Minami Y. Kawahara A Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Hatakeyama M. Liu Z.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the β and γc subunits, as well as other cytosolic proteins including p85, the regulatory subunit of PI3K type I (11Merida I. Williamson P. Kuziel W.A. Greene W.C. Gaulton G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6765-6770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2-mediated PI3K activation is essential for cell cycle entry as well as for induction of anti-apoptotic signals (12Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chang O.T. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). In addition, IL-2-mediated PI3K induction up-regulates p70S6 kinase activity, which phosphorylates the 40 S ribosomal subunit S6 and thereby controls translation of certain mRNAs crucial for cell division (13Reif K. Burgering B.M.T. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14426-14438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Studies in non-lymphoid cells suggest that Src family tyrosine kinases can provide regulatory signals important for DAGKα activation. PA synthesis was reported in v-Src-transformed fibroblasts, and DAGK activity was found to co-purify with v-Src (14Sugimoto Y. Whitman M. Cantley L.C. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2117-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). More recent studies in epithelial and endothelial cells showed that Src tyrosine kinase activity is required for DAGKα activation in response to hepatocyte growth factor (15Cutrupi S. Baldanzi G. Gramaglia D. Maffe A. Schaap D. Giraudo E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Bussolino F. Comoglio P.M. Graziani A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4614-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of DAGKα and PI3K in the regulation of IL-2-mediated cell proliferation, together with the suggestion of Src kinase-mediated DAGKα activation, prompted us to study in greater detail the possibility of DAGKα regulation by a PI3K-dependent mechanism. Cell Culture—CTLL-2 cells were obtained from the ATCC. ProB BaF/3 lymphoid cells engineered to express human IL-2Rβ (BaF/3β) were described previously (11Merida I. Williamson P. Kuziel W.A. Greene W.C. Gaulton G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6765-6770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells lines were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 5 × 10–5m 2-mercaptoethanol, and either 20 units/ml recombinant IL-2 (generously provided by Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ) or 5% WEHI-3B cell supernatant as an IL-3 source. Before IL-2 stimulation, cells were washed and resuspended in serum- and cytokine-free medium for 5–6 h. Human leukemic Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented 2 mm l-glutamine. COS-7 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker). All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Plasmids and Transfection—Murine DAGKα cDNA fused to a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA-DAGKα) was subcloned into the pEF vector. The construct encoding an EF-hand deletion mutant of DAGKα fused to green fluorescent protein (EGFP-ΔEFDAGKα) has been described (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding p56Lck bearing a mutation of Tyr505 to Phe was a kind gift of Dr. A. Carrera. The plasmid encoding the catalytic subunit of PI3K type I fused to the CAAX domain has been described (16Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift of Dr. J. Downward. The plasmid encoding DAGKβ fused to a FLAG tag was a gift of Dr. H. Kondo. The PH domain of Akt (a gift of Dr. P. Coffer) was subcloned 5′ into the vector encoding the red fluorescent protein (RFP-PH). A plasmid encoding PTEN was a gift of Dr. R. Pulido. For transfection, lymphocytes in logarithmic growth were transfected with 25 μg of plasmid DNA by electroporation at 304 V/975 microfarads. COS cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's recommendation. Stable HA-DAGKα BaF/3 cells were cultured in complete medium plus Zeocin (100 μg/ml). All experiments were performed 24 h after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and DAGK Assay—Cells in exponential growth were washed and serum- and IL-2-starved for 5 h at a concentration of 15 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were stimulated with buffer or with 50 units/ml recombinant IL-2. Where indicated, cells were incubated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem) or the Src tyrosine kinase family inhibitor PP2 (Calbiochem) for the last hour of starvation time. Following IL-2 stimulation, cells were collected at the times indicated in the figure legends, and lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 ng/μl aprotinin, 10 ng/μl leupeptin). Endogenous DAGKα was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant mouse DAGKα (GST-DAGKα; residues 130–468). HA-tagged enzyme was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (Covance). Immunoprecipitation was carried out for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by Gamma-bind Sepharose (1 h, 4 °C). DAGK activity was determined in the immunopellets by measuring radioactive phosphate incorporation into PA as described (7Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). C8-DAG was used as a substrate. Reactions were performed at room temperature (10 min) before lipid extraction using CHCl3, MeOH, 2 n HCl (20:10:5, v/v/v). Dried radiolabeled lipid products were dissolved in 40 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v) and applied to silica gel thin layer chromatography plates, with unlabeled C8-PA as a migration standard. Plates were developed in a CHCl3, MeOH, 4 m ammonia solvent system (9:7:2, v/v/v) and autoradiographed. A tenth of the immunoprecipitated protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-HA antibody. Western Blot—Immunoprecipitated proteins or total cell lysates were resolved in SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis. Proteins were visualized with anti-HA antibody, anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or anti-Akt (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Lipid Effect on DAGK Activity—HA-DAGKα-expressing BaF/3 cells were serum-starved (5 h), lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer, and HA-DAGKα was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody. Pellets were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with 0.5 m LiCl, and three times with 10 mm Hepes. The indicated lipids were added as a 10-fold concentrate (1 mm in 5 μl) prepared by sonication in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 min before C8-DAG addition. The phosphorylation reaction was carried out as described (7Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were harvested 24 h after electroporation with plasmids, washed, and allowed to attach to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (1 h, room temperature). Samples were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (4 °C, 20 min), permeabilized in PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (2 h). All subsequent incubations and washes used 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS buffer; antibodies were incubated (37 °C, 1 h) in a humidified chamber. Nuclei were labeled with Topro-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence was analyzed on a Leica confocal microscope (TCS-NT) with associated software. Lck-dependent DAGKα Activation Is Mediated by a PI3K-dependent Mechanism—Studies in non-lymphoid cells have suggested that Src kinase activation is required for hepatocyte growth factor induction of DAGKα (15Cutrupi S. Baldanzi G. Gramaglia D. Maffe A. Schaap D. Giraudo E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Bussolino F. Comoglio P.M. Graziani A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4614-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p56Lck is a Src-like tyrosine kinase known to mediate IL-2 receptor signals. We used a plasmid encoding murine DAGKα fused to a hemagglutinin epitope tag (HA-DAGKα) to monitor Lck-dependent DAGKα activation. Transfection of a constitutive active form of p56Lck (p56Lck505) in the BaF/3 proB cell line greatly increased the enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated DAGKα (Fig. 1A). In lymphocytes, activation of cytosolic Src-like tyrosine kinases (p56Lck and p59Fyn) is a rapid result of IL-2 binding to its high affinity receptor (16Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that activation of this family of tyrosine kinases is, in turn, closely related to IL-2-induced activation of type I PI3K (11Merida I. Williamson P. Kuziel W.A. Greene W.C. Gaulton G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6765-6770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that p56Lck-mediated DAGKα activation was markedly reduced by treatment of the cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, (Fig. 1A) suggesting that the p56Lck-induced DAGKα activation was in some way mediated by a PI3K-dependent mechanism. A direct effect of PI3K on DAGKα activity was next determined by measuring enzyme activity in cells transiently transfected with a constitutively active, membrane-targeted PI3K mutant (p110 CAAX) (17Khwaja A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Wennstrom S. Warne P.H. Downward J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). The increase in DAGKα activity under these conditions confirmed DAGKα activation by a PI3K-dependent mechanism (Fig. 1B). As is the case for other lipid kinases, DAGKα is found in the cytosol of lymphocytes and must relocalize to membranes to exert its functions (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We analyzed the correlation between DAGKα activation by constitutively active forms of p56Lck and PI3K and the subcellular localization of the protein in intact cells (Fig. 1C). As previously reported for Jurkat T lymphocytes (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), DAGKα was found in the cytosol of BaF/3 cells in the absence of additional signals. Co-transfection of constitutively active p56Lck and PI3K forms induced enzyme relocalization to the plasma membrane. DAGKα Is Activated by PI3K Lipid Products—The previous experiments suggested a mechanism that regulates DAGKα in response to PI3K activation. In vivo, PI3K activation following receptor triggering catalyzes PI-4,5-P2 phosphorylation, generating the intracellular messenger PI-3,4,5-P3, which is rapidly converted to PI-3,4-P2 by the SH2-containing inositol phosphatase lipid phosphatases. Generation of these two lipids, phosphorylated at the 3′ position of the inositol ring, induces membrane relocalization and activation of several signaling proteins that bear specific lipid-binding domains (18Rameh L. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). By dephosphorylating at the D3 position, the phosphatase PTEN terminates PI3K-dependent signals. PI3K-dependent regulation of DAGKα may thus be a direct consequence of the increase in 3′-phosphorylated lipid products or may be mediated by a PI3K-regulated protein. We analyzed the effect of 3′-phosphorylated lipid addition on DAGKα activity. When immunoprecipitated, HA-DAGKα produced a single band in silver-stained SDS-PAGE gels (not shown). The immunoprecipitated protein was thus used as a source of purified protein to determine enzyme activity after addition of lipid vesicles. Addition of purified PI-4,5-P2 caused no apparent effect on enzyme activity, whereas vesicles containing PI-3,4,5-P3 or PI-3,4-P2 induced a marked increase in DAGKα activity (Fig. 2A). The results indicate direct DAGKα regulation by the lipid products of PI3K, excluding nonspecific regulation by negatively charged lipids. PI-3,4,5-P3 and PI-3,4-P2 are synthesized by class I PI3K in response to receptor stimulation. In addition to type I PI3K lipid products, generation of other phosphoinositides is less finely regulated and appears to be implicated in secretion and vesicular trafficking (19Czech M.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). PI-3-P can be generated by PI phosphorylation by class III PI3K or by sequential hydrolysis of PI-3,4,5-P3 by 4- and 5-phosphatases. Fab1-like kinases in turn phosphorylate PI-3-P to PI-3,5-P2, which increases in an IL-2-dependent manner in hematopoietic cells (20Jones D. González-García A. Díez E. Martinez-A C. Carrera A.C. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18407-18413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Addition of purified PI-3-P and PI-3,5-P2 did not affect DAGKα activity (Fig. 2B), suggesting specific regulation of DAGKα by class I PI3K lipid products. DAGKα N-terminal Domain Is a Negative Modulator of Enzyme Interaction with PI3K Products in Intact Cells—The DAGKα N-terminal domain contains two Ca2+ regulatory elements that act as negative regulatory domains (4Sakane F. Masahiro K. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Deletion of the Ca2+ regulatory elements in the DAGKα N-terminal domain induces an active enzyme form (ΔEFDAGKα) that is constitutively located at the plasma membrane in the Jurkat leukemic T cell line (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells are characterized by defective PTEN expression, which results in constitutive membrane localization of the tyrosine kinase Itk via interaction through its PH domain (21Shan X. Czar M.J. Bunnell S.C. Liu P. Liu Y. Schwartzberg P.L. Wange R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6945-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Because the previous experiments suggested direct DAGKα interaction with type I PI3K lipid products, we examined whether constitutive ΔEFDAGKα localization to the plasma membrane was a direct result of the elevated PI-3,4,5-P3 and PI-3,4-P2 levels in Jurkat cells. As a control for endogenous 3′-phosphorylated lipid levels in these cells, we examined the subcellular localization of a construct expressing the Akt PH domain fused to RFP (RFP-AktPH). As shown for Itk (21Shan X. Czar M.J. Bunnell S.C. Liu P. Liu Y. Schwartzberg P.L. Wange R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6945-6957Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), the RFP-AktPH construct was found constitutively associated to the plasma membrane of Jurkat cells in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 3). As we have described (25Migone T. Rodig S. Cacalano N.A. Berg M. Schreiber R.D. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6416-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), ΔEFDAGKα also exhibits plasma membrane localization in these cells. Expression of wild type PTEN caused rapid RFP-AktPH redistribution from the plasma membrane to cytosol; the same was observed for GFP-ΔEFDAGKα (Fig. 3). Two important conclusions can be derived from these studies. The first is that DAGKα interaction with 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides takes place in intact cells; the second, that the N-terminal regulatory motif, which governs DAGKα membrane translocation in response to Ca2+ elevation, prevents DAGKα binding to 3′-phosphorylated lipids in the absence of stimulus. Regulation by PI3K Lipid Products Is DAGKα Isoform-specific—Membrane translocation seems a general mechanism for regulation of the three subtype I DAGKs (6Schirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DAGKα and -γ translocate from cytosol to the membrane in response to purinergic receptor stimulation, although the kinetics of the former are more rapid than those of the latter. DAGKγ translocation, which has a classical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate/DAG-binding C1a domain, is induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment of cells. DAGKα, in which the C1a domain is atypical, does not respond to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Regulation of DAGKβ translocation appears more complex because, in COS cells, this isoform is found at the plasma membrane in the absence of stimulus and relocates to the cytosol only after serum starvation (22Caricasole A. Bettini E. Sala C. Roncarati R. Kobayashi N. Caldara F. Goto K. Terstappen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4790-4796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We examined whether PI3K-dependent regulation can also be extended to other type I subtype isoforms. Because DAGKγ membrane localization appears to be exclusively DAG-dependent (6Schirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we studied DAGKβ subcellular redistribution in lymphoid cells. As described for COS cells (22Caricasole A. Bettini E. Sala C. Roncarati R. Kobayashi N. Caldara F. Goto K. Terstappen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4790-4796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), DAGKβ is found at the BaF/3 cell plasma membrane in the absence of additional stimuli (Fig. 4A). At difference from the case of COS cells, the enzyme remained membrane-bound after an extended starvation period (data not shown). The distinct subcellular localization of DAGKα and -β in unstimulated cells suggests isoform-specific regulation for membrane targeting. We next analyzed DAGKβ activation by phosphorylated PI derivatives. 3′-Phosphorylated lipid addition to immunoprecipitated DAGKβ did not affect enzyme activity; whereas the protein was activated following PI-4,5-P2 addition (Fig. 4B). This indicates that DAGKα regulation by 3′-phosphorylated PI is specific to this isoform, and suggests isotype-specific regulation of type I DAGKs by different phosphorylated PI forms. IL-2-dependent DAGKα Activation Requires Functional PI3K—Our experiments define a DAGKα regulation mechanism based on PI3K activation. To confirm that this signaling pathway is engaged following agonist stimulation of cells, we examined IL-2-dependent activation of endogenous DAGKα. We generated a polyclonal antibody that immunoprecipitates murine DAGKα (Fig. 5A) and used this antibody to examine IL-2-dependent activation of endogenous DAGKα in BaF/3 cells engineered to express the human IL-2Rβ (BaF/3β). These cells proliferate in response to IL-2 and have been used extensively to study IL-2-dependent signals (10Taniguchi T. Miyazaki T. Minami Y. Kawahara A Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Hatakeyama M. Liu Z.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). IL-2 addition to BaF/3β cells increased enzyme activity measured in DAGKα immunopellets (Fig. 5B). In these experiments, immunoprecipitated protein could not be quantified accurately because of limitations of the antibody for Western blot analysis. We thus used the HA-DAGKα construct to monitor DAGKα activation after IL-2 stimulation. As for the endogenous enzyme, IL-2 addition to transfected BaF/3β cells induced a rapid increase in HA-DAGKα activity confirming IL-2-dependent regulation (Fig. 5C). IL-2-dependent DAGKα activation was abolished by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 5D) suggesting that a functional PI3K is required for enzyme activation. We next examined DAGKα activation in CTLL-2, a murine T cell line that expresses high levels of endogenous IL-2 receptor. As previously shown using total lysates in this cell line (8Flores I. Jones D.R. Cipres A. Diaz-Flores E. Sanjuan M.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 708-714PubMed Google Scholar), IL-2 addition to CTLL-2 cells increased DAGKα activity measured in immunopellets. IL-2-dependent DAGKα activation was completely abolished when cells were pretreated with LY294002 at the same concentrations that prevented Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 5E). As previously shown for hepatocyte growth factor induction of DAGKα in non-lymphoid cells (15Cutrupi S. Baldanzi G. Gramaglia D. Maffe A. Schaap D. Giraudo E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Bussolino F. Comoglio P.M. Graziani A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4614-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), IL-2-dependent DAGKα activation in CTLL2 cells was greatly diminished following PP2 treatment of the cells (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of Src-like kinases also prevented IL-2-induced activation of exogenous DAGKα in BaF/3β cells (Fig. 6B). The PP2 doses shown to prevent DAGKα activation also inhibited IL-2-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6C). In summary, these results confirm the existence of a signaling pathway in which Src-like kinases regulate DAGKα activation via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. Class I PI3K activation by receptor and cytosolic tyrosine kinases is essential for regulation of cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, cytoskeletal reorganization, and membrane trafficking (18Rameh L. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This lipid kinase can participate in such a large array of cellular functions by activating multiple target molecules, which bear 3′-phosphoinositide-binding domains. Here we describe a novel pathway in which Src kinase-dependent PI3K activation induces DAGKα membrane localization and activation, highlighting the role of this enzyme as another direct effector of PI3K action. PI3K is activated rapidly following growth factor stimulation, and recent studies have demonstrated direct PI3K regulation by growth factor-induced activation of Src tyrosine kinase (23Chan T.O. Rodeck U. Chan A.M. Kimmelman A.C. Rittenhouse S.E. Panayatou G. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. 2002; 1: 181-191Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, activation of cytosolic Src-like tyrosine kinases (p56Lck and p59Fyn) is a rapid result of IL-2 binding to its high affinity receptor (16Taniguchi T. Science. 1995; 268: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Src tyrosine kinase activation is, in turn, closely related to IL-2-induced activation of type I PI3K. Studies in resting T cells have shown that, in the absence of Jak3 expression, IL-2 activates PI3K through a p56Lck-mediated mechanism (24Gonzalez-García A. Mérida I. Martinez-A C. Carrera A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10220-10226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In activated T cells, full PI3K activation by IL-2 also requires p56Lck (11Merida I. Williamson P. Kuziel W.A. Greene W.C. Gaulton G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6765-6770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Migone T. Rodig S. Cacalano N.A. Berg M. Schreiber R.D. Leonard W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6416-6422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The studies presented here confirm, using several approaches, that PI3K lies upstream of DAGK activation and that Src kinase-dependent DAGKα activation is mediated by generation of PI3K lipid products. Although several studies linked tyrosine kinases to receptor-induced DAGKα activation (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Cutrupi S. Baldanzi G. Gramaglia D. Maffe A. Schaap D. Giraudo E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Bussolino F. Comoglio P.M. Graziani A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4614-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), none reported receptor-induced DAGKα phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Concurring with these results, we do not detect IL-2-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous or ectopically expressed DAGKα. Nonetheless, the existence of such a mechanism cannot be disregarded. Additional experiments are currently under way to analyze the existence of rapid, transient DAGKα phosphorylation on tyrosine residues as a consequence of receptor-regulated tyrosine kinase activation. Notwithstanding, and in accordance with the results presented here, it would be of interest to examine the role of PI3K-dependent signaling in DAGKα regulation after triggering of other receptors. Addition of 3′-phosphorylated lipids activates immunoprecipitated DAGKα, suggesting a direct role for lipid PI3K products in regulating enzyme activity. In vivo elevation of 3′-phosphorylated lipids translocates the protein to the membrane in intact cells, suggesting a correlation between DAGKα activation and membrane localization. In agreement with previous studies (7Flores I. Casaseca T. Martinez-A C. Kanoh H. Merida I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10334-10340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Cutrupi S. Baldanzi G. Gramaglia D. Maffe A. Schaap D. Giraudo E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Bussolino F. Comoglio P.M. Graziani A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4614-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we show that DAGKα activation can be measured in immunoprecipitates following cell stimulation with IL-2 or co-transfection with active forms of p56Lck or PI3K. Assays in immunoprecipitates are performed in the absence of PI-3,4,5-P3 or PI-3,4-P2, suggesting that, once activated, DAGKα is locked into an active conformation that is maintained throughout the immunoprecipitation process. This is reminiscent of the model proposed for Akt and other AGC kinases, in which both lipid binding and phosphorylation by the phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK-1) are required for full activation (26Stokoe D. Stephens L.R. Copeland T. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. McCormick G. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1997; 277: 567-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). PDK-1 is a key regulator of PI3K-dependent activation of several substrates which, in some cases, phosphorylates its substrates after direct interaction through the so called hydrophobic motif (27Biondi R.M. Cheung P.C. Casamayor A. Deak M. Currie R.A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). DAGKα has a partial hydrophobic motif (Phe-X-X-Phe) at the C terminus, suggestive of PDK-1 interaction. Nonetheless, we did not detect interaction between DAGKα and PDK-1, even after co-transfection with active PI3K (not shown), excluding direct DAGKα-PDK1 interaction. DAGKα phosphorylation was not observed following IL-2 stimulation after in vivo (32Pi) labeling of the cells (not shown) apparently excluding any PI3K-dependent phosphorylation. PI3K-dependent DAGKα activation thus appears to differ from that described for PDK-1-regulated PI3K effectors. The primary DAGKα sequence contains distinct conserved domains, none of which corresponds to any of the 3′-phosphorylated binding domains found in PI3K-regulated proteins. This renders it difficult to assign the PI3K-dependent regulation described here to a specific protein domain. The DAGKα N-terminal region contains both a recoverin homology domain and a pair of Ca2+-binding EF-hands shown to act jointly as an autoinhibitory region (3Jiang Y. Qian W. Hawes J.W. Walsh J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34092-34099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Sakane F. Masahiro K. Wada I. Imai S. Kanoh H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that the constitutive association of the ΔEFDAGKα mutant is reverted by PTEN overexpression, suggesting that membrane association of this truncated mutant is due, at least in part, to the high constitutive levels of 3′-phosphorylated lipids in this cell line. These experiments rule out the N-terminal region as the domain responsible for lipid interaction, and extend the previously reported role of this region as a negative modulator of enzyme activity to that of membrane binding. Like all DAGKs, DAGKα also contains a pair of C1-like domains of unknown function. Based on their primary sequence, the two DAGKα C1 domains can be classified as atypical, similar to those found in proteins such as atypical protein kinase C isoforms, the proto-oncogenes raf-1 and Vav, and in proteins implicated in small G-protein-dependent signaling, including ROCK, Citron, and Lfk (28Hurley J.H. Newton A.C. Parker P.J. Blumberg P.M. Nishizuka Y. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 477-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). There is no clear function assigned to this type of domain, although they are suggested to participate in membrane binding through protein-protein and/or protein-lipid interactions. In the case of DAGKα, the disruption of either of the two C1 domains abolishes protein membrane association. 2M. A. Sanjuán, D. R. Jones, S. Carrasco, and I. Mérida, manuscript submitted for publication. Similar results are obtained with other isoforms such as DAGKζ (29Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggesting that these domains are critical in protein-membrane interaction. We tried to investigate the translocation of GFP-tagged DAGKα C1 domains to the membrane in response to PI3K elevation, but this construct is not correctly expressed in mammalian cells. This suggests that, as shown for the atypical C1 domains in Raf-1 or Vav, this conserved region does not act as a membrane targeting module on its own. Studies in other type I DAGK isoforms have shown that the C1 domains, albeit necessary, are not exclusively responsible for membrane localization of DAGK family members. The other two type I DAGK isoforms, β and γ, each contain at least one classical phorbol ester-binding C1 domain, and phorbol ester-dependent membrane translocation has been demonstrated for these two isoforms (6Schirai Y.

The characterization of alternative splicing forms of DAGKβ, however, indicates that sequences located at the C-terminal domain are also responsible for membrane localization. Accordingly, the deletion of the 35 last residues in the DAGKβ sequence abolishes its ability to relocate to the membrane after phorbol ester treatment of serum-starved COS cells (22Caricasole A. Bettini E. Sala C. Roncarati R. Kobayashi N. Caldara F. Goto K. Terstappen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4790-4796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that DAGKβ, which is constitutively associated to the plasma membrane in lymphoid cells, is positively regulated by PI-4,5-P2. This indicates lipid-based regulation for this isoform in addition to DAG/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-dependent regulation. Further studies should address the potential role of both the C1 domains and the C-terminal sequences in lipid-based regulation of DAGK isoforms. Membrane translocation is an effective process for regulating DAGK activity and subtype-specific functions. Experiments using GFP-fused chimeric proteins have shown subtype-specific translocation of the three type I DAGKs (α, β, and γ) (6Schirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and also DAGKζ (29Santos T. Carrasco S. Jones D.R. Merida I. Eguinoa A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30300-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our experiments here demonstrate that the same isoform is regulated by distinct mechanisms in response to stimulation of different receptors. The existence of more than one mechanism for DAGKα activation would thus define distinct functional roles for this enzyme in receptor-regulated responses. In response to the phospholipase C-derived Ca2+ elevation that follows TCR triggering, DAGKα acts as a negative regulator in DAG-mediated responses (5Sanjuan M.A. Jones D.R. Izquierdo M. Merida I. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). As a result of IL-2-dependent PI3K activation, DAGKα participates as a positive modulator of PA-regulated signals (8Flores I. Jones D.R. Cipres A. Diaz-Flores E. Sanjuan M.A. Merida I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 708-714PubMed Google Scholar). The precise role of PA in IL-2-dependent cell proliferation has not been fully elucidated, although recent studies linked PA to the regulation of several molecules known to regulate cell proliferation including c-Raf (30Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), phosphatases (31Frank C. Keilhack H. Opitz F. Zschornig O. Bohmer F.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11993-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and mTOR (32Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A. Chen J. Science. 2001; 294: 1942-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). IL-2-mediated activation of PI3K is required for induction of IL-2-dependent cell cycle entry (33Brennan P. Babbage J.W. Burgering B.M.T. Groner B. Reif K. Cantrell D. Immunity. 1997; 7: 679-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), and is known to mediate mRNA translation through regulation of p70S6 kinase (13Reif K. Burgering B.M.T. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14426-14438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, PI3K and DAGKα thus emerge as two lipid kinases essential for IL-2-regulated cell proliferation. This is the first report of a functional link between these two enzymes, and future studies should help to characterize the role of DAGKα-mediated PA production in the regulation of PI3K-dependent events such as transductional regulation, cell cycling, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Moreover, the activation of this SrcK/PI3K/DAGKα pathway in response to other agonists known to act in the absence of phospholipase C activation remains to be examined. We thank Drs. T. Taniguchi, W.

In these cells, expression was not restored by heat shock, but rather by the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Aza-C). Forced H11 expression by Aza-C treatment, transient transfection with H11 expression vectors, or retrovirus-mediated delivery of H11 under the control of a tetracycline-sensitive promoter triggered apoptosis.

This is the first report of a heat shock protein with proapoptotic activity. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated irreversible process that results in cell death in the absence of inflammation and is considered a promising alternative to cancer chemotherapy (1Lebedeva I.V. Su Z.Z. Chang Y. Kitada S. Reed J.C. Fisher P.B. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 708-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Morphologic changes associated with apoptosis include nuclear and cytoplasmic condensation, intranucleosomal DNA cleavage, and blebbing into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis is primarily mediated by caspases, which are cysteine proteases with aspartate specificity that are activated by the cleavage of inactive zymogens (procaspases) in a sequential cascade or by autocatalysis. Caspase-3, one of the main effectors of apoptosis, is activated by cleavage of the inactive procaspase-3 into 17–20- and 11-kDa fragments. It is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of many key proteins, such as the nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is involved in DNA repair (2Porter A.G. Janicke R.U. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Environmental stress stimuli and the oligomerization of death receptors recruit apoptosis-regulating kinase 1 and trigger activation of the proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) 1The abbreviations used are: JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Hsp, heat shock protein(s); FBS, fetal bovine serum; STS, staurosporine; z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; Aza-C, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; aODN, antisense ODN; sODN, sense ODN; RT, reverse transcriptase; ANOVA, analysis of variance; WT, wild type; PK, protein kinase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. and p38MAPK protein cascades (3Kyriakis J.M.

Survival stimuli activate various effector pathways, one of which involves c-Raf-1 or B-Raf kinases and the activation of MAPK kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK, also known as MAPK) through phosphorylation. ERK targets include genes required for cell cycle progression and the altered balance between pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl2 family of apoptosis regulatory proteins (6Lewis T.S.

Cells—Human melanoma cells SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 and human embryonic kidney cells HEK293 were grown in Eagle's modified minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. For SK-MEL-28, the medium was additionally supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1500 mg/ml sodium bicarbonate, and 4 mm glutamine. Human melanoma cells A375 were grown in similarly supplemented Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium. Human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA468 were grown, respectively, in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium and Eagle's modified minimal essential medium with 10% FBS, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 2 mm glutamine. Human breast cancer cells MDA231 and prostate cancer cells DU145 were grown in Eagle's modified minimal essential medium with 10% FBS and 2 mm glutamine.

Doxycycline (Dox) and the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Aza-C) were purchased from Sigma. G418 was purchased from Invitrogen. Expression Vectors and Transfection—Wild type (WT) H11 was cloned from human heart cDNA by PCR amplification with primers that flank the open reading frame (5′-GGATTCTATGGCTGACGGTCAGAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCGACAATCTCAGGTACAGGTGA-3′ (antisense)) and ligated into the pCI vector (Promega) at the EcoRI/XbaI sites (pCI-H11). Its sequence was identical to that in the human genome data base. H11 similarly cloned from SK-MEL-2, A375, SK-MEL-28, PC-3, and HEK293 cells had the WT sequence. To construct the WT H11 expression vector pFLAG-H11, the EcoRI/XbaI fragment from pCI-H11 was subcloned into the expression vector p3×FLAG-CMV-10 (pFLAG; Sigma) downstream of the CMV promoter and the N-terminal 3×FLAG peptide sequence. The original H11 clone (18Smith C.C. Yu Y.X. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25690-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) has a G to C transition in codon 51 (exon 1), which leads to the exchange of tryptophan for cysteine. This mutation (henceforth designated H11-W51C) results in seven additional β-turns in the secondary protein structure predicted by the Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson model (Genetics Computer Group Program (Madison, WI), PeptideStructure (26Jameson B.A. Wolf H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Transient transfection was with 2 or 4 μg of DNA and FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA concentrations in single vector controls for co-transfection experiments were equilibrated with pCI DNA. Construction of the H11 Rev-Tet Vector and Cell Infection—The tetracycline-regulated RevTet-On expression system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used for inducible H11 expression according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the PT67 packaging cell line was transfected with the pTet-On vector (contains a neomycin resistance cassette) by the calcium phosphate method, and a stable cell line (Tet-On) was selected with G418 (500 μg/ml). A 0.6-kb DNA fragment representing the H11 open reading frame was isolated by EcoRI/SalI digestion of the H11 plasmid (pAS2–1/H11), blunt-ended with Klenow fragment, and ligated into the SalI blunt-ended pRev-TRE retrovirus vector in which the murine mammary tumor virus promoter drives a hygromycin resistance gene and the Tet-sensitive promoter (Tet response element upstream of the minimal CMV IE promoter) regulates the inserted H11. The vector was transfected into Tet-On cells, and clones resistant to hygromycin (300 μg/ml) were selected and expanded to generate stable virus-producing cell lines. Virus titers in the culture supernatants were assayed as described by the manufacturer and used to infect TC32 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 50. H11 expression was induced with 0.5 μg/ml Dox, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—The in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science) was used as previously described (9Perkins D. Pereira E.F.R. Aurelian L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1292-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 28Perkins D. Pereira E.F.R. Gober M. Yarowsky P.J. Aurelian L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1435-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in 0.1% sodium citrate), and DNA breaks were labeled by incubation (60 min; 37 °C) with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and nucleotide mixture containing FITC-conjugated dUTP. After examination by fluorescence microscopy, the cells were incubated (30 min; 37 °C) with an anti-FITC antibody conjugated with AP, and the chromogenic reaction was carried out with the AP substrate 0.4 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 0.2 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, toluidine salt (Roche Applied Science). Apoptotic cells (characterized by a dark nuclear precipitate) and nonapoptotic cells (unstained or displaying a diffuse, light, and uneven cytoplasmic staining) were counted in five randomly chosen microscopic fields (at least 250 cells), and results are expressed as percentage of apoptotic cells ± S.E. DNA Fragmentation—The assay was as previously described and used 1.5% agarose gels with 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide (28Perkins D. Pereira E.F.R. Gober M. Yarowsky P.J. Aurelian L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1435-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Effect of Antisense Oligonucleotides—The sequence and specificity of phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) complementary to the H11 translation initiation site (antisense ODN (aODN); 5′-GTCAGCCATGGT-3′) or sense ODN (sODN; 5′-ACCATGGCTGAC-3′) were previously described (18Smith C.C. Yu Y.X. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25690-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells in triplicate were cultured (4 days, 37 °C) in the presence or absence of the ODNs (10–30 μm) in medium with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (30 min at 65 °C to destroy nuclease activity) (18Smith C.C.

Hybridization of Multiple Tissue Arrays—The multiple tissue expression and matched tumor/normal expression arrays were obtained from Clontech. They consist of a positively charged nylon membrane to which poly(A)+ mRNAs from different human tissues are immobilized in separate dots. They are normalized to the mRNA levels of eight housekeeping genes. Hybridization was with H11 cDNA (29Yu Y.X. Heller A. Liehr T. Smith C.C. Aurelian L. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 18: 905-911PubMed Google Scholar) and the control ubiquitin cDNA probe provided by the manufacturer, and the results were visualized by autoradiography (exposure to the x-ray film was at–80 °C for 21 h). Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Total cellular RNA prepared as previously described (30Aurelian L. Smith C.C. Winchurch R. Kulka M. Gyotoku T. Zaccaro L. Chrest F.J. Burnett J.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 286-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was used to generate cDNA with the Advantage™ RT-PCR kit (Clontech) and 10 pmol (0.5 μm) of the antisense H11 or β-actin primers according to the manufacturer's instructions. Normal and tumor prostate, colon, and breast cDNAs and skeletal muscle cDNA (human MTC panels) were purchased from Clontech. PCR was done with cDNA and 10 pmol of H11 primers (5′-CCATGGCTGACGGTCAGATGCCCTTCTCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCATGCCAAAGCCATCATCCAGCAG-3′ (antisense)) and β-actin primers (5′-GTGGGGCGCCCCAGGCACCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′ (antisense)) using the Advan-Taq Plus kit (Clontech). The PCR program was 1 min at 94 °C for 1 cycle followed by 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 2 min for 26 cycles and a final extension of 5 min at 68 °C on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler (model 9700). Products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels and stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry—For double immunofluorescence, cells were incubated with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and the nucleotide mixture (containing FITC-dUTP) for 1 h at 37 °C and stained (1 h, room temperature) with H11 antibody followed by rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (30 min, room temperature). They were visualized with an epifluorescent confocal microscope fitted with an argon ion laser (Zeiss LSM 410) (9Perkins D. Pereira E.F.R. Aurelian L. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1292-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For immunoperoxidase staining, cells were exposed overnight (4 °C) to primary antibodies, and the immunolabeled cells were detected by the streptavidinbiotin method using the DAKO LSAB 2 kit and horseradish peroxidase (DAKO Corp., Carpinteria, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were counted in five randomly chosen microscopic fields (at least 250 cells), and the results were expressed as percentage of positive cells ± S.E. Immunoblotting and Immunocomplex PK Assays—Cells were treated with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures (Sigma) and sonicated for 60 s at 25% output power using the Sonicator/Ultrasonic Processor (Misonix, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). Total protein was determined by the bicinchoninic assay (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoblotting with antibodies to P-p38MAPK and P-ERK 1/2, blots were blocked (1 h; room temperature) with blocking buffer (TN-T buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) and incubated with antibody for 12 h at 4 °C. Immunoblotting with all other antibodies was with blocking buffer containing 5% nonfat milk (w/v) and a 1-h incubation at room temperature. After three washes, blots were incubated with Protein A-peroxidase diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature followed by four additional washes. Detection was with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences), followed by exposure to high performance chemiluminescence film (Hyperfilm ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Quantitation was by densitometry using the Bio-Rad GS-700 imaging densitometer (9Perkins D. Pereira E.F.R. Aurelian L. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25690-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). H11 Expression Is Altered in Tumor Cells/Tissues—Since Hsp are overexpressed in tumor cells (10Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar) and H11 has properties distinct from those of canonical Hsp (18Smith C.C. Yu Y.X. Kulka M. Aurelian L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25690-25699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Depre C. Hase M. Gaussin V. Zajac A. Wang L. Hittinger L. Ghaleh B. Yu X. Kudej R.K. Wagner T. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1007-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether H11 is also overexpressed in tumor cells. Analysis of multiple tissue expression arrays confirmed previous findings (20Kappe G. Verschure P. Philipsen R.L.A. Staalduinen A.A. Van de Boogaart P. Boelens W.C. De Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1520: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Depre C. Hase M. Gaussin V. Zajac A. Wang L. Hittinger L. Ghaleh B. Yu X. Kudej R.K. Wagner T. Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Circ.

Oncol. 2001; 18: 905-911PubMed Google Scholar) that H11 mRNA levels (expressed as -fold abundance relative to PBL) were particularly abundant in skeletal muscle, placenta, and heart (Fig. 1A). However, H11 expression was altered in some tumor tissues relative to their matched normal counterparts, with mRNA levels reduced in most colon tumors, increased in many stomach tumors, and individually altered (decreased or increased) in tumors of other sites (Fig. 1B). Focus on some cancer tissues/cell lines and their normal cells counterparts, using the more specific and sensitive RT-PCR assay, indicated that H11 RNA levels were decreased in prostate, colon, and breast cancer cells and a melanoma and a sarcoma cell line (Fig. 1C). We interpret the data to indicate that H11 expression can be altered in human tumors and is significantly decreased in some cancers. H11 Expression Can Be Increased by Aza-C but Not Heat Shock—Stressful conditions, such as heat shock, increase Hsp expression over basal level (12Garrido C. Gurbuxani S. Ravagnan L. Kroemer G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). To determine whether H11 expression is also regulated by heat shock, we focused on HEK293 (kidney), SK-MEL-2 (melanoma), and PC-3 (prostate cancer) cells, all of which have low levels of H11 expression. Cells were heat-shocked by incubation for 1 h at 42.5 °C, and extracts were obtained immediately thereafter (0 h) or at 4, 8, and 12 h after reincubation at 37 °C (to allow for protein synthesis) and were immunoblotted with H11 antibody. Heat shock caused a time-dependent increase in the levels of H11 protein in HEK293 cells, with maximum expression seen at 8 (Fig. 2A, lane 4) and 12 (Fig. 2A, lane 5) h after treatment. It did not alter the expression of H11 in SK-MEL-2 (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10) or PC-3 (data not shown) cells. By contrast, the levels of H11 protein in SK-MEL-2, A375, SK-MEL28, and PC-3 cells were significantly increased by treatment with the demethylating agent Aza-C (4 days; 2 μm) (Fig. 2B, lanes 6, 8, 10, and 12). Aza-C had no effect on H11 expression in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4) or normal melanocytes (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2), and actin levels were virtually identical in all samples (Fig. 2B). Preimmune serum was negative (data not shown). The data indicate that (i) heat shock-mediated regulation of H11 expression is cell type-specific, and (ii) loss/diminution of heat shock responsiveness can be due to promoter methylation, a finding not previously reported for human Hsp. Forced H11 Expression Triggers Apoptosis—Having seen that H11 expression is reduced/inhibited in some cells, we wanted to know whether its forced expression in these cells triggers apoptosis. We focused on SK-MEL-2, PC-3, and HEK293 because H11 expression is similarly increased in these cells, whether by Aza-C (SK-MEL-2 and PC-3) or heat shock (HEK293). As shown in Fig. 3A for SK-MEL-2, the percentage of TUNEL+ cells was significantly (p < 0.001 by ANOVA) increased in SK-MEL-2 and PC-3 cultures when H11 was expressed (Fig. 3B). HEK293 cells did not exhibit increased apoptosis when given a heat shock to induce H11 expression. To determine whether H11 is involved in apoptosis, duplicate cultures were similarly treated with Aza-C or heat shock but in the presence of increasing concentrations (0–30 μm) of H11-specific aODN (or sODN control). As shown in Fig. 4 for SK-MEL-2 cells, apoptosis was not inhibited by sODN, but there was a dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of TUNEL+ cells in cultures treated with Aza-C in the presence of aODN (Fig. 4A). We conclude that the aODN effect is specific, because H11 expression was inhibited in duplicate cultures treated with aODN (Fig. 4B, lane 4) but not sODN (Fig. 4B, lane 3), and actin levels were similar in all cultures. Indeed, double immunofluorescent staining with FITC-dUTP (TUNEL) and rhodamine-labeled H11 antibody indicated that virtually all of the TUNEL+ cells (43–48% of Aza-C-treated cultures) overexpressed H11 (Fig. 5C). Cells with low intensity rhodamine staining (low H11 levels) (Fig. 5B) were TUNEL– (Fig. 5, A and C), also in untreated (Fig. 5E) and Aza-C + aODN-treated (Fig. 5D) cultures. In cultures treated with Aza-C + sODN, ∼39–45% of the cells were positive for both H11 overexpression and TUNEL (Fig. 5F). Similar results were obtained for PC-3 cells (data not shown).Fig. 5Apoptosis co-localizes with H11 overexpression and is associated with caspase-3 activation. Aza-C treated SK-MEL-2 cultures (4 days; 2 μm) were stained with FITC-dUTP (TUNEL) (A) and rhodamine-conjugated H11 antibody (B). FITC and high intensity rhodamine signals co-localize in cultures treated"
https://openalex.org/W2032346440,"FcγRIIa is a low affinity IgG receptor uniquely expressed in human cells that promotes phagocytosis of immune complexes and induces inflammatory cytokine gene transcription. Recent studies have revealed that phagocytosis initiated by FcγRIIa is tightly controlled by the inositol phosphatase SHIP-1, and the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. Whereas the molecular nature of SHIP-1 involvement with FcγRIIa has been well studied, it is not clear how SHP-1 is activated by FcγRIIa to mediate its regulatory effect. Here we report that FcγRIIa clustering induces SHP-1 phosphatase activity in THP-1 cells. Using synthetic phosphopeptides, and stable transfectants expressing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) tyrosine mutants of FcγRIIa, we demonstrate that SHP-1 associates with the phosphorylated amino-terminal ITAM tyrosine of FcγRIIa, whereas the tyrosine kinase Syk associates with the carboxyl-terminal ITAM tyrosine. Association of SHP-1 with FcγRIIa ITAM appears to suppress total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, FcγRIIa clustering results in the association of SHP-1 with key signaling molecules such as Syk, p85 subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase, and p62dok, suggesting that these molecules may be substrates of SHP-1 in this system. Finally, overexpression of wild-type SHP-1 but not catalytically deficient SHP-1 led to a down-regulation of NFκB-dependent gene transcription in THP-1 cells activated by clustering FcγRIIa.

IgG receptors (FcγR) on monocytes and macrophages mediate immune complex clearance by a process termed phagocytosis (1Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 593-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). At least four classes of FcγR are expressed on monocytes and macrophages (2Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar); FcγRI, FcγRIIa, and FcγRIIIa are all activating receptors that are associated with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). 1The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; SH2, Src homology domain 2.1The abbreviations used are: ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; ITIM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif; PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; SH2, Src homology domain 2. In contrast, FcγRIIb is an inhibitory receptor that is associated with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM). Of these receptors FcγRIIa is uniquely expressed in human cells and is the only ITAM-associated receptor that bears the ITAM within its cytoplasmic tail (3Van Den Herik-Oudijk I.E. Westerdaal N.A.C.

Blood. 1995; 85: 2202-2211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Of the ITAMs identified to date, the ITAM of FcγRIIa has the longest spacer region between the two YXXL motifs that together make the ITAM. The functional significance of this extended spacer is not fully understood. In addition, FcγRIIa is the most widely expressed FcγR in the human hematopoetic system. Clustering of FcγR by immune complexes initiates a cascade of signaling events, the first of which is the activation of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate the ITAMs of FcγR (5Ghazizadeh S.

The phosphorylated ITAMs serve as docking sites for SH2 domain-containing cytosolic enzymes and enzyme-adapter complexes including the tyrosine kinase Syk and the p85 adapter subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase (7Chacko G.W. Brandt J.T. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Bio. Chem. 1996; 271: 10775-10781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Association of Syk with the phosphorylated ITAM activates the enzyme resulting in autophosphorylation of Syk and tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cytosolic proteins (8Ghazizadeh S. Bolen J.B.

Likewise, association of p85 with the ITAM delivers PtdIns 3-kinase to the proximity of its lipid substrates in the membrane, resulting in the generation of 3′-phosphorylated inositol lipids that activate PH domain-containing enzymes to promote cytoskeletal changes required for the phagocytic process (10Krugmann S. Welch H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of either Syk or PtdIns 3-kinase has been shown to completely abrogate FcγR-mediated phagocytosis (11Crowley M.T. Costello P.S. Fitzer-Attas C.J. Turner M. Meng F. Lowell C.

Phagocytosis is a complex process that is accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen radicals and the production of inflammatory cytokines, which results in tissue damage. Therefore the phagocytic process is subject to a tight regulation. In this regard, several mechanisms have been proposed including the expression and function of the inhibitory receptor FcγRIIb (15Clynes R. Maizes J.S. Guinamard R. Ono M. Takai T. Ravetch J.V. J.

Recent studies have revealed that the inositol phosphatases SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 not only work through the ITIM of FcγRIIb, but are also capable of associating with the ITAMs of FcγR to modulate activation events, thus providing an additional level of complexity to the regulation of phagocytosis (19Tridandapani S.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 2016-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Whereas the molecular details of ITAM-mediated activation of the SHIP proteins is well studied, it is not known how SHP-1 is activated by ITAM-bearing receptors. SHP-1 is a cytosolic tyrosine phosphatase that negatively regulates immune receptor signaling and growth factor signaling (24Zhang J. Somani A.K. Siminovitch K.A. Immunology. 2000; 12: 361-378Google Scholar, 25Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). SHP-1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoetic cells and contains two NH2-terminal located SH2 domains, a central phosphatase domain and two tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the COOH-terminal region. The enzyme is regulated by intramolecular interactions such that the NH2-terminal SH2 domain folds over the catalytic domain to inactivate the enzyme (26Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 27Pei D. Wang J. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15483-15493Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Deletion of the NH2-terminal SH2 domain, or engagement of the SH2 domains with cognate phosphopeptides has been shown to activate the phosphatase. Enzyme activity of SHP-1 is further enhanced by phosphorylation of tyrosines (Tyr536 and Tyr564) in the COOH-terminal region (29Zhang Z. Shen k. Lu W. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The significance of the regulatory role of SHP-1 in the hematopoetic system is best exemplified in mice homozygous for motheaten (me/me) or motheaten viable (mev/mev) mutations (30Shultz L.D. Schweitzer P.A. Rajan T.V. Yi T. Ihle J.N. Matthews R.J. Thomas M.L. Beier D.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 1445-1454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar, 31Shultz L.D. Green M.C. J.

The me/me mice do not express any SHP-1 protein, whereas the mev/mev mice express inactive splice variants of SHP-1. Both of these mutations result in multiple hematopoetic defects including elevated levels of autoantibodies and chronic inflammation resulting in early mortality. In a recent study, Durden and colleagues (22Kant A.M. De P. Peng X. Yi T. Rawlings D.J. Kim J.S. Durden D.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have demonstrated that SHP-1 down-regulates FcγR-mediated phagocytosis in the J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell line. In this study we have analyzed the molecular details of SHP-1 activation by the human FcγRIIa and the functional consequence of this activation. We report that SHP-1 phosphatase activity is induced upon FcγRIIa clustering in THP-1 human monocytic cells. FcγRIIa clustering results in membrane translocation of SHP-1 and association of SHP-1 with the phosphorylated ITAM of FcγRIIa. Co-precipitation experiments in cells transfected with ITAM tyrosine mutants of FcγRIIa revealed that SHP-1 associates with the NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine, whereas Syk associates with the COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosine. Previous studies using substrate-trapping mutants of SHP-1 have demonstrated that SHP-1 associates with and dephosphorylates Syk, p85, and p62dok in other cell systems (33Dustin L.B. Plas D.R. Wong J. Hu Y.T. Soto C. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2717-2724PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cuevas B. Lu Y. Watt S. Kumar R. Zhang J. Siminovitch K.A. Mills G.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35855-35865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Likewise, our current studies demonstrate association of SHP-1 with the above molecules upon FcγRIIa clustering suggesting that SHP-1 may dephosphorylate these molecules to down-regulate related signaling pathways. Consistent with this notion, analysis of functional consequence of SHP-1 phosphatase activity during FcγRIIa signaling demonstrated that overexpression of wild-type SHP-1 but not catalytically deficient SHP-1 down-regulates NFκB-dependent gene transcription following FcγRIIa signaling. Taken together these results suggest that signaling events initiated by the ITAM of FcγRIIa are a composite of both positive and negative regulatory enzyme activation. Cells, Antibodies, and Reagents—THP-1 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. P388D1 transfectants expressing human FcγRIIa were a generous gift from Dr. J. C. Edberg (University of Alabama) (36Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Anti-FcγRIIa antibody IV.3 was obtained from Medarex (Annandale, NJ). Rabbit polyclonal SHP-1, p85, Syk antibodies, and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and phosphatase assay kits were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—THP-1 cells and transfected P388D1 cells were activated by clustering FcγRIIa with F(ab′)2 fragments of monoclonal antibody IV.3 and goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody. Resting and activated cells were lysed in TN1 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin), and postnuclear lysates were incubated overnight with the antibody of interest and protein G-agarose beads (Invitrogen) or goat anti-mouse Ig covalently linked to Sepharose, depending on the antibody. Immunoprecipitations with control antibodies were performed in lysates of cells stimulated for 3 min. Immune complexes bound to beads were washed in TN1 and boiled in SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8. 2.3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with the antibody of interest, and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Analysis of FcγRIIa Expression by Flow Cytometry—P388D1 transfectants were tested for expression of FcγRIIa by incubating with Fab fragments of anti-FcγRIIa monoclonal antibody IV.3, at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat F(ab′)2 anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were subsequently washed, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by flow cytometry on an Elite EPICS fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Data from 10,000 cells per condition were recorded to yield the percentage of cells expressing receptors. Phosphatase Assays—Phosphatase assays were performed as described previously (37Kon-Kozlowski M. Pani G. Pawson T. Siminovitch K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3856-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. To measure phosphatase activity associated with SHP-1, FcγRIIa, Syk, p85, p62dok, and Erk, these proteins were immunoprecipitated from resting and activated (FcγRIIa clustering) THP-1 cells. Immunoprecipitations with control antibodies were done in lysates of cells stimulated for 7 min. The immunoprecipitates were washed six times in wash buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and subsequently incubated with tyrosine phosphopeptide substrate (RRLIEDAEpYAARG) (Upstate Biotechnology) in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 30 min. Reaction was stopped with 100 μl of malachite green solution, incubated for a further 15 min, and the absorbance was measured at 630 nm. All assays were performed at least three times and the values obtained were plotted as mean ± S.D. Transfection of THP-1 Cells and Luciferase Assays—For analysis of SHP-1 influence on NFκB transcriptional activity, THP-1 cells were transfected by electroporation (310 V, 950 μF; Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II) with 5 μg of wild-type SHP-1 or catalytically deficient (D419A) SHP-1 (a kind gift from Dr. R. Siraganian) (38Xie Z.H. Zhang J. Siraganian R.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1521-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), 1 μg of NFκB-luc plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pEGFP to normalize for transfection efficiency. Transfectants were harvested 24 h later, activated by clustering FcγRIIa by methods described above for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in 100 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega luciferase assay reagent. Data are represented as graphs indicating the % increase in NFκB activity in cells activated by clustering FcγRIIa over those that were not activated. Data points are expressed as mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. Transfection of COS-7 Cells—COS-7 cells were transfected as previously described (39Tridandapani S. Lyden T.W. Smith J.L. Carter J.E. Coggeshall K.M. Anderson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20480-20487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on culture dishes until they were 60–70% confluent. Plasmids encoding wild-type SHP-1 and D419A SHP-1 were mixed with LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The DNA mixture was added to cells in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The media was then replaced by Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were harvested 24 h later and analyzed for expression of the transfected cDNAs by Western blotting whole cell lysates and SHP-1 immunoprecipitates from the transfectants were assessed for phosphatase activity as described above. GFP-SHP-1 Construct—Wild-type SHP-1 cDNA in pSVL vector was obtained from Dr. R. Siraganian, and subcloned into pEGFP vector (Clontech) using the Xho and XbaI sites. Expression of GFP-SHP-1 was first confirmed by transfecting COS-7 fibroblasts with either empty EGFP vector or GFP-SHP-1 constructs, and subsequent Western blotting with anti-SHP-1 antibody. Transfection of P388D1 Cells and Confocal Microscopy—P388D1 cells stably expressing human FcγRIIa were transfected with GFP-SHP-1 plasmids using LipofectAMINE, as described above for COS-7 cells. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, serum starved, and stimulated by clustering FcγRIIa for 5 min. Resting and activated cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, cytospun onto glass slides, and stained with Hoechst nuclear stain. Slides were then mounted using mounting media (Molecular Probes) and analyzed by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM510 multiphoton confocal microscope. SHP-1 Is Activated by FcγRIIa Clustering—To assess whether SHP-1 is activated by FcγRIIa, THP-1 cells were stimulated by clustering FcγRIIa with Fab fragments of the receptor-specific monoclonal antibody IV.3, followed by secondary cross-linking with goat F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-mouse Ig antibody. SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cells and analyzed first, for phosphatase activity (Fig. 1A) and second, for tyrosine phosphorylation by Western blotting (Fig. 1B). The use of Fab/F(ab′)2 fragments of the clustering antibodies precludes the engagement of other FcγR present on the THP-1 cells by IgG ligand interaction ensuring that the resultant signals are emanating from FcγRIIa alone. In Fig. 1A, SHP-1 phosphatase activity was measured in THP-1 cells activated for the various time points indicated in the figure. Results indicate that SHP-1 phosphatase activity is induced by FcγRIIa clustering and the activity peaks around 7 min post-stimulation. Previous studies have indicated that the enzyme activity of SHP-1 is enhanced upon tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 (29Zhang Z. Shen k. Lu W. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 1B demonstrate that SHP-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FcγRIIa clustering. A reprobe of the same membrane with anti-SHP-1 antibody in the lower panel indicates equal loading of SHP-1 in all lanes. The last lane marked “C” is a control immunoprecipitate with normal rabbit IgG. To further confirm that the clustering antibodies used do not engage other FcγR expressed on THP-1 cells, specifically FcγRIIb, which bears a high level homology with FcγRIIa in the extracellular domain, binding of Fab fragments of monoclonal antibody IV.3 to FcγRIIb was analyzed. For this THP-1 cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with Fab fragments of IV.3, intact IV.3 IgG, and two pan-FcγRII antibodies KB61 and AT10. The immunoprecipitates were probed with rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for either FcγRIIb (Fig. 1C, upper panel) or FcγRIIa (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Results indicate that whereas all four antibodies used are able to immunoprecipitate FcγRIIa, Fab fragments of IV.3 are unable to bind FcγRIIb. The pan-FcγRII antibodies KB61 and AT10 bound FcγRIIb as expected. Intact IV.3 IgG was also able to precipitate some FcγRIIb presumably by ligand interaction, as we have previously reported. Taken together these results demonstrate that SHP-1 is activated by the ITAM-bearing FcγRIIa in THP-1 cells, without the involvement of FcγRIIb. SHP-1 Translocates to the Membrane upon FcγRIIa Clustering—To test whether FcγRIIa clustering resulted in membrane translocation of SHP-1, GFP-SHP-1 constructs were generated and transiently transfected into P388D1 mouse macrophage cells stably expressing human FcγRIIa. Cells were stimulated for 5 min by clustering FcγRIIa and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Results indicated that SHP-1 is distributed in the cytoplasm in resting cells and translocates to the membrane in cells activated by clustering FcγRIIa (Fig. 1D). In parallel samples transfected with EGFP alone, no movement of GFP was observed in activated cells compared with resting cells (data not shown). SHP-1 Co-immunoprecipitates with FcγRIIa—We next assessed whether SHP-1 associates with FcγRIIa to become activated. Here, THP-1 cells were activated by clustering FcγRIIa by the methods described above. SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cells, and analyzed for association with FcγRIIa by Western blotting with the FcγRIIa-specific antibody 260. Results indicated that SHP-1 associates with FcγRIIa upon activation (Fig. 2A, upper panel). No association was detectable in resting cells. The same membrane was reprobed with anti-SHP-1 antibody to ensure equivalent loading of SHP-1 in all lanes (lower panel). As a second approach to confirm association of SHP-1 with FcγRIIa, the receptors were immunoprecipitated from resting and activated THP-1 cells and subjected to a phosphatase assay with a phosphopeptide substrate. The amount of free phosphate released was detected by the addition of malachite green. Results are expressed as picomole of phosphate released by immunoprecipitates from activated cells after subtracting the values obtained from immunoprecipitates from resting cells (Fig. 2B). Control immunoprecipitates consistently showed values equal to or lower than resting cell immunoprecipitates. Together these experiments demonstrate that SHP-1 associates with FcγRIIa following receptor clustering. NH2-terminal ITAM Tyrosine of FcγRIIa Is Necessary for Association with SHP-1—To examine which of the two ITAM tyrosines of FcγRIIa were involved in the association with SHP-1, we used two experimental models. First, synthetic biotinylated peptides derived from the ITAM of FcγRIIa, which were either non-phosphorylated (P1), or singly phosphorylated on either the NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine (P2) or the COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosine (P3), were applied to THP-1 lysates and the peptide-bound material was analyzed for the presence of SHP-1 by Western blotting. The results shown in Fig. 3A, upper panel, indicate that the phosphorylated NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine, but not the COOH-terminal tyrosine, efficiently bound SHP-1. SHP-1 did not associate with the non-phosphorylated peptide (lane 1). In contrast, parallel experiments analyzing the binding properties of the peptides demonstrated that the peptide phosphorylated on the COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosine is functional and is able to associate with Syk (Fig. 3A, middle panel) and p85 (Fig. 3A, lower panel). These latter findings are consistent with earlier reports demonstrating that the COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosine of FcγRIIa is sufficient for association with Syk (40Kim M.K. Pan X.Q. Huang Z.Y. Hunter S. Hwang P.H. Indik Z.K. Schreiber A.D. Clin. Immunol. 2001; 98: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and that p85 associates with both NH2- and COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosines of FcγRIIa (6Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 41Gibbins J.M. Briddon S. Shutes A. Van Vugt M.J. De Winkel J.G. Saito T. Watson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34437-34443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Because the above experiments were performed with synthetic peptides, we next asked whether the native FcγRIIa receptor would likewise demonstrate the differential ITAM tyrosine requirement for association with SHP-1 and Syk. For these experiments we used P388D1 mouse macrophage transfectants stably expressing single ITAM tyrosine mutants of human FcγRIIa. The P388D1 transfectants were activated by clustering FcγRIIa, the receptors were immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cells and analyzed by Western blotting for co-precipitating SHP-1 (Fig. 3B, upper panel) or Syk (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Results indicated that SHP-1 failed to associate with FcγRIIa when the NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine was mutated to phenylalanine (Y252F). However, the Y252F receptor displayed efficient binding to Syk. These results are consistent with the above peptide binding experiments. To assess the signaling outcome of the ITAM tyrosine mutations, we compared the ability of these mutated receptors versus the wild-type receptor to induce signaling. For this we first ensured that the transfected receptors were expressed to comparable levels by flow cytometry (Fig. 4A). The transfected cells were stimulated by clustering FcγRIIa. FcγRIIa was immunoprecipitated from resting and activated cells and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation. Results indicated that all three receptors are capable of being tyrosine phosphorylated (Fig. 4B, upper panel). As might be expected the single ITAM tyrosine mutants displayed lower phosphorylation levels than the wild-type receptor. A reprobe of the membrane demonstrated equivalent receptor expression in the transfectants (Fig. 4B, lower panel). The reduced signal seen with anti-FcγRIIa antibody in the activated lane is because of the fact that the anti-FcγRIIa blotting antibody often displays lower efficiency of detection of the phosphorylated FcγRIIa in a reprobe. We, and others, have previously reported this property of the anti-FcγRIIa blotting antibody (19Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42Vely F. Gruel N. Moncuit J. Cochet O. Rouard H. Dare S. Galon J. Sautes C. Fridman W.H. Teillaud J.-L. Hybridoma. 1997; 16: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We next analyzed total cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in the transfectants stimulated by FcγRIIa clustering (Fig. 4C). Results indicated that, clustering of the NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine mutant leads to enhanced overall cellular tyrosine phosphorylation in comparison to clustering of the wild-type receptor (lane 4 versus lane 1). In contrast, mutation of the COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosine completely abrogated overall cellular phosphorylation. These observations are consistent with the notion that SHP-1 associates with the NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine to down-modulate tyrosine phosphorylation events, and that Syk associates with the COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosine to become activated and lead to the phosphorylation of signaling proteins in the cell. SHP-1 Associates with p85, Syk, and p62dok during FcγRIIa Signaling—The activation of SHP-1 during FcγRIIa signaling suggests that SHP-1 causes dephosphorylation of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Numerous previous studies have identified the association of SHP-1 with tyrosine-phosphorylated signaling molecules, the subsequent dephosphorylation of these molecules, and down-regulation of the related signaling pathways (43Veillette A. Latour S. Davidson D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 669-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Drawing from these previous studies, we next analyzed whether SHP-1 associated with the tyrosine kinase Syk, the p85 adapter molecule of PtdIns 3-kinase, and the Ras GAP-binding protein p62dok during FcγRIIa signaling. Thus, THP-1 cells were activated by clustering FcγRIIa for various time points. SHP-1 was immunoprecipitated from resting and activated THP-1 cells and analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of co-precipitating Syk (Fig. 5A), p85 (Fig. 5B), and p62dok (Fig. 5C). As seen in the figure, SHP-1 associated with the above molecules in an activation-dependent manner. The membranes were reprobed with anti-SHP-1 antibody to ensure equal loading in all lanes. To further analyze whether active SHP-1 is associated with Syk, p85, and p62dok, phosphatase assays were performed on the respective immunoprecipitates from resting and activated THP-1 cells. Consistent with association of SHP-1 protein, results indicated that phosphatase activity was present in Syk, p85, and p62dok immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5D). In control experiments, no association of SHP-1 phosphatase activity was observed in Erk immunoprecipitates from activated THP-1 cells (data not shown). Taken together these data suggest that SHP-1 may dephosphorylate the above molecules to down-regulate activation events induced by FcγRIIa clustering. SHP-1 Down-regulates FcγRIIa-mediated Function—In recent reports we, and others, have demonstrated that FcγRIIa clustering results in the activation of NFκB-dependent gene transcription (19Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Pengal R.A. Ganesan L.P. Fang H. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. Tridandapani S. J. Biol.

Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These activation events are subject to regulation by the inositol phosphatases SHIP-1 and SHIP-2, presumably as a result of the consumption of the lipid products of PtdIns 3-kinase and the downstream signaling thereof. Our present studies demonstrate that SHP-1 associates with the p85 subunit of PtdIns 3-kinase, suggesting that SHP-1 may modulate PtdIns 3-kinase activity. Therefore, we next asked whether SHP-1 also played a role in modulating NFκB-dependent gene transcription initiated by FcγRIIa clustering. In these experiments we used wild-type and catalytically inactive (D419A) SHP-1 constructs, which we first expressed in COS-7 fibroblasts by transient transfection and analyzed for SHP-1 protein expression and enzyme activity. The results shown in Fig. 6B demonstrate that both wild-type and D419A SHP-1 are expressed efficiently from these plasmids. COS-7 fibroblasts do not express any endogenous SHP-1 as is seen from the absence of SHP-1 in the mock-transfected cells (lane 1). Shown in Fig. 6B, lower panel, is the phosphatase activity of these two SHP-1 proteins expressed in COS-7 cells. Having ensured that we could achieve appropriate protein expression from these constructs, we then transiently transfected THP-1 cells with plasmids encoding the NFκB binding element coupled to a luciferase gene (NFκB-luc) either alone or with an excess of wild-type SHP-1 or D419A SHP-1. The cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, activated by clustering FcγRIIa, and NFκB-dependent luciferase expression was assessed in a luciferase enzyme assay. Results from three independent experiments are shown in Fig. 6A. Overexpression of wild-type SHP-1 completely abrogated NFκB-dependent luciferase induction. In contrast, overexpression of the catalytically inactive D419A SHP-1 resulted in enhanced luciferase induction. These data demonstrate that SHP-1 negatively regulates FcγRIIa-mediated biological outcomes in human myeloid cells. The human-specific FcγRIIa is a low affinity IgG receptor that has several unique features to it. In addition to being the most widely expressed IgG receptor, it also contains an unusually lengthy ITAM in its cytoplasmic domain. Mutational analyses of the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIa have identified specific amino acid motifs that are important for the phagocytic process. For example, mutation of either of the two tyrosine residues within the ITAM of FcγRIIa have been reported to severely abrogate intracellular calcium mobilization and phagocytosis (36Edberg J.C. Lin C.T. Lau D. Unkeless J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22301-22307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 45Mitchell M.A. Huang M.M. Chien P. Indik Z.K. Pan X.Q. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1994; 84: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An additional tyrosine residue located NH2-terminal to the ITAM also becomes phosphorylated upon receptor clustering and plays a role in FcγRIIa-mediated activation (45Mitchell M.A. Huang M.M. Chien P. Indik Z.K. Pan X.Q. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 1994; 84: 1753-1759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies have identified an LTL motif in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIa that is involved in the formation of phagolysosomes (46Worth R.G. Mayo-Bond L. Kim M.K. van de Winkel J.G. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. Schreiber A.D. Blood. 2001; 98: 3429-3434Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 47Worth R.G. Kim M.K. Kindzelskii A.L. Petty H.R. Schreiber A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4533-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIa is made up of a complex set of signaling motifs that are not yet fully explored. Once FcγRIIa receptors are clustered the Src family of tyrosine kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIa (6Cooney D.S. Phee H. Jacob A. Coggeshall K.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 844-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the ITAM promotes recruitment and activation of Syk, followed by the phosphorylation of multiple cytosolic signaling proteins. Unlike its T cell homolog ZAP-70 that requires both of its tandem SH2 domains to be engaged by phosphorylated ITAMs to be activated, single SH2 domain engagement is sufficient for Syk activation (48Futterer K. Wong J. Grucza R.A. Chan A.C. Waksman G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the results shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that the COOH-terminal ITAM tyrosine of FcγRIIa is necessary and sufficient for Syk association. Interestingly, there was constitutive Syk association with Y252F FcγRIIa, at a time when no tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor was detectable (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that perhaps mutation of tyrosine 252 might lead to a non-SH2-dependent association of Syk with Y252F FcγRIIa. Additional studies are needed to define the nature of this novel interaction. Recent studies have revealed that FcγRIIa clustering not only initiates activating events, but it also induces negative regulatory events such that the resultant biologic outcome is tempered. Thus, FcγRIIa recruits the inositol phosphatases SHIP-1 and SHIP-2 to modulate signaling events (19Tridandapani S. Wang Y. Marsh C.B. Anderson C.L. J. Immunol. 2000; 169: 4370-4378Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Nakamura K. Malykhin A. Coggeshall K.M. Blood. 2002; 100: 3374-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21Pengal R.A.

In a transfected COS-7 fibroblast model the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 has also been shown to regulate FcγRIIa-mediated phagocytosis (22Kant A.M. De P. Peng X. Yi T. Rawlings D.J. Kim J.S. Durden D.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 1852-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our current studies extend these latter findings to demonstrate that in myeloid cells SHP-1 translocates to the membrane, associates with the phosphorylated NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine of FcγRIIa, and regulates FcγRIIa-mediated signaling. Together, these observations suggest that signal transduction from FcγRIIa is internally regulated by both positive and negative signaling enzymes. SHP-1 was initially thought to be the effector molecule of FcγRIIb-mediated inhibition (49D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L. Minskoff S.A. Mellman I. Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Cambier J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, later studies using chimeric FcγRIIb receptors and SHP-1-deficient cells demonstrated that SHP-1 is not required for FcγRIIb function (50Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 51Nadler M.J.S. Chen B. Anderson J.S. Wortis H.H. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20038-20043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), but that SHP-1 works in concert with other ITIM-bearing receptors such as the KIRs, gp49B, PIR-B etc. (52Pani G. Siminovitch K.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1997; 84: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), to mediate its inhibitory function. Our current observations of SHP-1 association with FcγRIIa ITAM are novel, and are consistent with earlier findings that SHP-1 association with immune receptors occurs in the absence of involvement of the ITIM-bearing FcγRIIb (53Phee H. Rodgers W. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8615-8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Activation of SHP-1 enzyme requires the engagement of its NH2-terminal SH2 domain with phosphotyrosines to relieve the intramolecular constraint placed on the phosphatase domain (26Yang J. Liu L. He D. Song X. Liang X. Zhao Z.J. Zhou G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6516-6520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, our results suggest that the engagement of SHP-1 by the NH2-terminal ITAM tyrosine of FcγRIIa leads to the activation of SHP-1. Other studies have reported a secondary mechanism of SHP-1 activation involving phosphorylation of SHP-1 on its COOH-terminal located tyrosine residues (29Zhang Z. Shen k. Lu W. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 4668-4674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In our experiments, although tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-1 was detectable after FcγRIIa clustering (Fig. 1), the level of phosphorylation is weak suggesting that it is likely that the primary mechanism of SHP-1 activation is mediated by its association with FcγRIIa. Additional studies are required to assess whether the low level phosphorylation of SHP-1 contributes to activation of the enzyme. The identification of specific substrates of SHP-1 has been aided by the use of substrate-trapping mutant forms of SHP-1 and the SHP-1-deficient motheaten animals. Consistent with earlier observations in other cell systems, we have observed association of SHP-1 with Syk, p85, and p62dok. These findings suggest that the above molecules may be dephosphorylated by SHP-1 resulting in down-regulation of the related signaling pathways. In accordance with this notion, our data indicate that SHP-1 down-regulates NFκB-dependent gene transcription in myeloid cells stimulated by clustering FcγRIIa. NFκB activation has been shown to be important for FcγR-induced transcription of inflammatory cytokine genes such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-8 (54Sanchez-Mejorada G. Rosales C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27610-27619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus the current study establishes a role for SHP-1 in modulating the production of inflammatory cytokines during immune complex clearance.

A covalent structure linked the active site Trp111 with Tyr238 and Tyr238 with Met264, and the heme was modified, likely by a perhydroxy group added to the vinyl group on ring I. Mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic digests of BpKatG revealed a cluster of ions at m/z 6585, consistent with the fusion of three peptides through Trp111, Tyr238, and Met264, and a cluster at m/z ∼4525, consistent with the fusion of two peptides linked through Trp111 and Tyr238. MS/MS analysis of the major ions at m/z 4524 and 4540 confirmed the expected sequence and suggested that the multiple ions in the cluster were the result of multiple oxidation events and transfer of CH3-S to the tyrosine. Neither cluster of ions at m/z 4525 or 6585 was present in the spectrum of a tryptic digest of the W111F variant of BpKatG. The spectrum of the tryptic digest of native BpKatG also contained a major ion for a peptide in which Met264 had been converted to homoserine, consistent with the covalent bond between Tyr238 and Met264 being susceptible to hydrolysis, including the loss of the CH3-S from the methionine. Analysis of the tryptic digests of hydroperoxidase I (KatG) from Escherichia coli provided direct evidence for the covalent linkage between Trp105 and Tyr226 and indirect evidence for a covalent linkage between Tyr226 and Met252.

The heme-containing catalase-peroxidases are bifunctional enzymes that degrade hydrogen peroxide either as a catalase (2H2O2 → 2H2O + O2) or as a peroxidase (H2O2 + 2AH → 2H2O + 2A•). The catalatic reaction, with a more rapid turnover rate, dominates over the peroxidatic reaction, and the in vivo peroxidatic substrate remains unidentified, suggesting that the main role of the enzyme is the removal of H2O2, preventing the formation of highly reactive and damaging breakdown products of H2O2. However, the enzyme has a close sequence resemblance to plant peroxidases (1Heym B. Alzari P.M. Honoré N. Cole S.T. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 2Welinder K.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and it remains a possibility that the peroxidatic reaction has a metabolic significance outside of degrading H2O2. Indeed, it is clear that the catalatic function evolved as an adaptation of the peroxidatic function because the simple change of a tryptophan to a phenylalanine in the distal heme pocket reduces catalatic activity by 1000-fold (of Escherichia coli HPI) and increases peroxidatic activity by 3-fold (3Hillar A.

Furthermore, the core structures of both the N- and C-terminal domains of the catalase-peroxidases from Haloarcula marismortui and Burkholderia pseudomallei closely resemble the structure of plant peroxidases (6Yamada Y.

Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Finally, the conversion of isoniazid into its active antitubercular form by KatG of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is clearly a result of the peroxidatic reaction using isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) 1The abbreviations used are: INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazide; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HPI, hydroperoxidase I.1The abbreviations used are: INH, isonicotinic acid hydrazide; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HPI, hydroperoxidase I. as a substrate that must mimic the actual in vivo substrate. The structures of the catalase-peroxidases from H. marismortui and B. pseudomallei have been reported (6Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7Carpena X. Lopraesert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and have revealed several features that are, so far, unique to this class of enzyme. Present in both structures is an unusual adduct or covalent linkage among the side chains of a tryptophan, a tyrosine, and a methionine (see Fig. 1). The likely mechanistic significance of the covalent structure is enhanced by the fact that the tryptophan lies in the active site and is essential for catalatic activity. A second feature, evident only in the structure of BpKatG, is a modification to the heme, likely a hydroperoxide group added to ring I of the heme in close proximity to the Trp-Tyr-Met adduct. This paper presents mass spectrometry evidence supportive of the existence of the Trp-Tyr-Met adduct originally deduced from the electron density maps of HmCPx and BpKatG (6Yamada Y. Fujiwara T.

Sequence confirmation of all sequences was by the Sanger method (12Sanger F.S. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequent expression and purification were carried out as described previously (3Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C.

One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2 in 1 min in a 60 mm H2O2 solution at pH 7.0 at 37 °C.

Peroxidase activity was determined by the method of Smith et al. (15Smith A.T. Santana N. Dacey S. Edwards M. Bray R.C. Thorneley R.N. J. Biol.

N-terminal Sequencing—The N-terminal sequence was determined by the Proteomics facility at the Institut de Biotecnologia i Biomedicina. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—For mass spectrometry, protein was dialyzed into 5 mm ammonium acetate. The intact proteins were analyzed by electrospray ionization in an orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometer (16Krutchinsky A.N. Chernushevich I.V. Spicer V.L. Ens W. Standing K.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 569-579Crossref Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 17Verentchikov A.N. Ens W. Standing K.G. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The declustering voltage was varied to assess the stability of the protein-heme complex. Digests of the proteins were prepared using tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin and analyzed on the Manitoba/Sciex prototype MALDI QqTOF instrument (18Loboda A.V. Krutchinsky A.N. Bromirski M. Ens W. Standing K.G. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1047-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Initial analysis was done with equal volumes (0.5 μl) of digested protein and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (160 mg/ml in water: acetonitrile 3:1, 2% formic acid) spotted onto a custom target. Further separation was achieved by microliquid chromatography on the Agilent 1100 Series system. The samples (5 μl) were injected onto a 100-μm I.D. × 150-mm column (Vydac 218 TP C18, 5 μm) and eluted with a linear gradient of 1–80% acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Column effluent (4 μl/min) was collected at 1-min intervals by hand. Under the conditions used, the vast majority of tryptic fragments were eluted in 40 min. These were spotted onto the target as described above. MS Characterization of the Trp-Tyr-Met Adduct in Bp-KatG—The existence of a covalent structure linking the side chains of Trp111, Tyr238, and Met264 in BpKatG (Fig. 1) was originally deduced from the electron density maps derived from crystals of both HmCPx (6Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and BpKatG (7Carpena X. Lopraesert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To confirm the existence of such an unusual structure, the peptide mixture generated by trypsin digestion of BpKatG was analyzed by mass spectrometry. Each of the key residues in the structure is located on a separate tryptic peptide fragment, and the absence of these fragments combined with the presence of larger fragments of appropriate mass would confirm the presence of the adduct (Fig. 2). Some of the peptides identified by MALDI mass spectrometry from both BpKatG and its W111F variant are listed in Table II. Significantly, the expected fragment at m/z 1179 (containing Trp111) is completely absent from the BpKatG spectrum, but the equivalent ion in the spectrum of the W111F variant, shifted to m/z 1140 by the Trp to Phe replacement, is clearly evident. The ions at m/z 2092 (containing Met264) and m/z 3316 (containing Tyr238) are present in the spectra of both BpKatG and its W111F variant, although they are less prominent in the former spectrum. Furthermore, two additional clusters of ions are evident in the BpKatG spectrum that are not present in the W111F spectrum, near m/z 4525 and m/z 6585, very close to the sizes predicted for combined peptides in the Trp-Tyr and Trp-Tyr-Met adducts, respectively (Fig. 3). The large size of the ions of the triple adduct at m/z 6585 precluded further analysis by MS/MS. The cluster of ions corresponding to the double adduct at m/z 4525 (Fig. 3) contains a series of seven peaks separated by increments of ∼16 Da beginning at m/z 4493, with two predominant ions at m/z 4524 and 4540. These ions were analyzed by MS/MS revealing a series of fragments consistent with the proposed structure (Fig. 3C and Table III), albeit with additions of 30–31 and 46–47 Da, respectively, in the ions at m/z 4524 and 4540. At least two explanations for the additional mass are possible. One explanation is that two (32 Da) or three (48 Da) oxygens are added along with the associated loss of 1 or 2 protons, and this is supported in part by the apparent oxidation of the indole ring of Trp111 evident in the electron density maps. The second explanation is that the hydrolysis of the Tyr-Met covalent bond (Fig. 4) results in the CH3-S (46 Da or +47 Da less 1 proton) from the methionine being transferred to the tyrosine, ortho to the HO, in some fraction of the products. In fact, a mixture of overlapping ions containing multiple oxygens and the CH3-S group is necessary to explain the presence of the seven or more ions in the cluster near m/z 4525 and the prevalence of larger ions.Table IIObserved and expected monoisotopic [M + H + ] masses of selected ions from the tryptic digest of BpKatG and its W111F variantExpected ion (m/z)Observed in BpKatGObserved in W111FResiduesSequenceConfirmed by MS/MS1140.53No1140.53109-118MAFHSAGTYRYes1179.54NoNo109-118MAWHSAGTYR1459.651459.651459.6527-40CPFHQAAGNGTSNRYes2062.06NoNo1-18MPGSDAGPRRRGVHEQRR2061.99No264-283XAMNDEETVALIAGGHTFGKYes2091.982091.992091.99264-283MAMNDEETVALIAGGHTFGKYes3316.663316.623316.64224-255QLENPLAAVQMGLIYVNPEGPDGNPDPVAAARYes3332.66224-255Oxidation of 224-255Yes4493.184493aAverage m/z of the cluster is presented.

The expected ion for the Met264-containing peptide at m/z 2092 is present in the spectra of both BpKatG and the W111F variant but is accompanied by an unexpected ion at m/z 2062 only in the BpKatG spectrum (Fig. 5, A and B). MS/MS analysis of the ions at m/z 2062 and 2092 (Fig. 5, C and D, and Table IV) reveals the common sequence XAMNDEETVALIAGGHTFGK, in which X has the correct mass for Met in the ion at m/z 2092 but has a mass 30 Da smaller in the ion at m/z 2062. For the fragmentation of the ion at m/z 2062, all of the b series ions, containing the N-terminal residue, are 30 Da smaller than the expected mass, whereas all of the y series ions, with the exception of y32, are in agreement with the expected m/z values (Table IV). Assigning X as homoserine, which would arise from hydrolysis of the Tyr-Met covalent bond (Fig. 4) and which has a mass 30 Da less than that of Met, explains the mass differential between the ions at m/z 2062 and m/z 2092. In addition, this represents further indirect evidence for the covalent link between Tyr238 and Met264.Table IVComparison of expected and observed mono-isotopic M + H + masses of ions in the MS/MS spectra shown in Fig. 5 (C and D)NExpected ionFig. 5CFig. 5DObservedDifferenceObservedDifferencey ionsy202091.982091.980.002062.01-29.97y191960.941961.010.07y151529.801529.840.041529.79-0.01y141400.751400.74-0.011400.73-0.02y131271.711271.69-0.021271.720.01y121170.661170.660.001170.670.01y111071.601071.58-0.021071.600.00y101000.561000.55-0.011000.560.00y9887.47887.470.00887.500.03y8774.39774.38-0.01774.390.00y7703.35703.350.00703.360.01y6646.33646.330.00646.330.00y5589.31589.310.00589.320.01b ionsb111205.521205.520.001175.54-29.98b121318.601318.57-0.031288.61-29.99b161640.741640.70-0.041610.80-29.94b171741.791741.790.001711.80-29.99b181888.861888.80-0.061858.88-29.98b191945.881945.85-0.031915.91-29.97b202073.972073.990.022044.01-29.96 Open table in a new tab MS Characterization of the Trp-Tyr-Met Adduct in HPI—The presence of the covalent adduct in catalase-peroxidases from two such disparate sources as the archaebacterium H. marismortui and the Gram-negative bacterium B. pseudomallei suggested that it may be a feature common to all catalase-peroxidases. This was explored in an analysis of the tryptic digest of HPI (KatG) from E. coli and its W105F variant (Table V). All three of the fragments containing, respectively, Trp105 (m/z 1149), Met252 (m/z 2532), and Tyr226 (m/z 3206) are present, with their identities confirmed by MS/MS analysis. Although this suggests that the adduct may not be present in HPI, a cluster of ions, also separated by ∼16 Da, is evident near m/z 4350 (Fig. 6A) in the digest of native HPI but not in the digest of the W105F variant (Fig. 6B). Analysis of the predominant ion by MS/MS reveals a fragmentation pattern consistent with the presence of the Trp-Tyr covalent structure (Fig. 6C). The location of the modifications, either from the addition of CH3-S (+47 less one proton for +46) or oxidation (+48 for three oxygen atoms less 2 protons for +46), could be localized to the hybrid fragment bounded by ions y25 and y16 (Fig. 6C and Table VI). Unfortunately, ions at m/z 6885, indicative of the triple adduct, and m/z 2504, indicative of Met252 modified to homoserine, were not identified, making the only evidence for the Tyr-Met portion of the adduct in HPI the possible presence of CH3-S in the ion at m/z 4351.Table VObserved and expected mono-isotopic M + H + masses of ions from the tryptic digest of HP1 and its W105F variantExpected ion (m/z)Observed in BpKatGObserved in W105FPeptideSequenceConfirmed by MS/MS1110.52No1110.51103-112MAFHGAGTYRYes1149.531149.52No103-112MAWHGAGTYRYes2534.202534.202534.20247-271ATFGNMGMNDEETVALIAGGHTLGKYes3204.603204.603204.60215-246ACLGATEMGLIYVNPEGPDHSGEPLSAAAAIRYes3220.603220.58Possible oxidation product of 215-246No4351.114352aAverage mass of the cluster is presented.

Lopraesert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether they were present and disordered or absent as a result of N-terminal processing. The tryptic fragments corresponding to residues 1–9 and 19–26, including possible partial digest fragments, are absent from the spectrum, whereas the fragment corresponding to residues 27–40 is present, and its sequence is corroborated by MS/MS analysis (Table II). From these data, it can be concluded that the N-terminal sequence is truncated between residues 19 and 26, and this was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing to be at 22SNEA. Truncation to Ser22 could have resulted from post-translational proteolysis or from translation initiation at Met21 followed by removal of the terminal formylmethionine. There is a strong Shine-Dalgarno sequence AGGAG upstream of the ATG codon for Met21, and comparison with the much weaker ribosome-binding region upstream of the codon for Met1 suggests that Met21 may be the preferred start site for translation of the BpKatG mRNA in E. coli. Mass spectrometry evidence for the Trp111-Tyr238-Met264 adduct in the tryptic digests of BpKatG corroborates the conclusions drawn from electron density maps. Large ions consistent with three peptides linked by Trp111-Tyr238-Met264 and two peptides linked by Trp111-Tyr238 are evident in the spectrum of BpKatG but not in the spectrum of the W111F variant. The covalent bonds in the adduct are sensitive to breakdown under mass spectrometry conditions with the Tyr-Met bond being more labile, presenting indirect evidence for its existence in the breakdown products, including CH3-S attached to Tyr238 and homoserine. In fact, the existence of ions differing only in having methionine or homoserine suggests that the breakdown of the Tyr-Met link may proceed by more than one pathway. The complete absence of any Trp111-containing peptide indicates that breakdown of the Trp-Tyr bond, although less prevalent, produces a Trp-containing breakdown product that has not been identified. The tryptic digest of HPI presents direct evidence for the Trp-Tyr linkage and indirect evidence for the Tyr-Met linkage. The core structure of the individual N- and C-terminal domains of catalase-peroxidases is very similar to the core structure of plant peroxidases, suggesting that the enzyme is a peroxidase that has adopted an efficient catalatic activity during evolution. A small number of clues for how this adaptation took place are provided by the structure of the active site. The active site Trp111 is clearly not required for the generation of compound I (Enz (Por-FeIII) + H2O2 → Cpd I (Por+•-FeIV = O) + H2O), which is unaffected by removal of the indole ring, but is required for the second stage reduction of compound I (Cpd I (Por+•-FeIV = O) + H2O2 → Enz (Por-Fe) + H2O + O2), which is reduced to 1% of native levels by removal of the indole ring. However, the distal Trp is not the sole determinant, because peroxidases with Trp in the equivalent position, such as cytochrome c peroxidase and ascorbate peroxidase, do not exhibit significant catalatic activity. Furthermore, the two other key active site residues in peroxidases, the arginine and histidine equivalent to Arg108 and His112 of BpKatG, are spatially oriented much the same as in BpKatG. Indeed, the root mean square deviation of the Cα of 133 residues in conserved α-helical segments, including the three active site residues, is just 0.97 Å comparing BpKatG and cytochrome c peroxidase (7Carpena X. Lopraesert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The most significant differences between the catalase-peroxidases and the peroxidases, aside from sheer size, lie in the unusual post-translational modifications in the catalase-peroxidases, the Trp-Tyr-Met adduct, and the modified heme, and it is reasonable to consider how these features might make the catalase reaction possible. The covalently linked residues would form a very rigid structure that would fix the position of the indole nitrogen of the essential Trp relative to the heme iron and imidazole ring of the essential His. Such precise positioning with no possibility of movement may be necessary to generate optimal interaction distances with the H2O2 for the reduction of compound I. Indeed, mutation of Met264, which would prevent formation of at least part and possibly all of the covalent structure, significantly reduces catalatic activity, with little effect on peroxidatic activity (Table I), and mutation of the equivalent of Tyr238 in Synechocystis KatG has a similar effect (20Jakopitsch C. Auer M. Ivancich A. Rüker F. Furtmüller P.G. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20185-20191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The covalent linkages may also affect the electronic environment of the indole, enhancing its ability to bind H2O2 for compound I reduction. In addition the adduct creates an obvious route for delocalization of the radical from the heme of compound I, a process recently demonstrated in M. tuberculosis KatG (21Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). From the standpoint of the peroxidatic reaction, electron tunneling from a peroxidatic substrate on the surface (7Carpena X. Lopraesert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) to the heme for reduction of compound I or compound II may also be facilitated by the adduct. A number of tryptic fragments, in particular those near the catalytic center, were present as clusters of ions differing by ∼16 Da. This is suggestive of multiple oxidations, but the multiplicity of peaks poses a problem for this simple interpretation. The spectrum of the cluster of ions at m/z 4525 contains seven ions, although there are only three obvious sites of oxidation in the fragment, Trp111, Met109, and Met234. Even allowing for up to two oxygens on each Met and one on the Trp, only five ions should be present. Furthermore, the only site of oxidation that was obvious in the electron density maps was the indole ring of Trp111 (7Carpena X. Lopraesert S. Mongkolsuk S. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Fita I. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and any other oxidations must be randomly distributed at an occupancy too low to be clearly evident. This makes it very likely that the additional, more intense ions, 46 Da and larger than the base ion, contain the CH3-S portion of Met264 transferred to Tyr238. Thus, at least two overlapping series of ions are responsible for the cluster at m/z ∼4525. It is tempting to speculate about the reaction mechanism responsible for the Trp-Tyr-Met covalent structure, and both free radical and ionic mechanisms can be presented that may be initiated by oxidation of the most reactive group, Met264. However, structural analysis of variants lacking the three involved residues and other nearby residues are required to determine what residues are necessary and to see whether partial adducts can be formed will provide a much firmer basis for such speculation. The cooperation of Dr. K. G. Standing and W. Ens in arranging use of the mass spectrometers in the TOF Laboratory of the Department of Physics at the University of Manitoba is appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2101191922,"Recent evidence suggests that adult neural stem/progenitor cells (ANSCs) secrete autocrine/paracrine factors and that these intrinsic factors are involved in the maintenance of adult neurogenesis. We identified a novel secretory molecule, stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cell supporting factor (SDNSF), from adult hippocampal neural stem/progenitor cells by using the signal sequence trap method. The expression of SDNSF in adult central nervous system was localized to hippocampus including dentate gyrus, where the neurogenesis persists throughout life. In induced neurogenesis status seen in ischemically treated hippocampus, the expression of SDNSF was up-regulated. As functional aspects, SDNSF protein provided a dose-dependent survival effect for ANSC following basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) withdrawal. ANSCs treated by SDNSF also retain self-renewal potential and multipotency in the absence of FGF-2. However, SDNSF did not have mitogenic activity, nor was it a cofactor that promoted the mitogenic effects of FGF-2. These data suggested an important role of SDNSF as an autocrine/paracrine factor in maintaining stem cell potential and lifelong neurogenesis in adult central nervous system.

Studies carried out in the last few decades have revealed the potential for lifelong neurogenesis in the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS). 1The abbreviations used are: CNS, central nervous system; NSC, neural stem/progenitor cell; ANSC, adult neural stem/progenitor cell; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FGF-2, basic fibroblast growth factor 2; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; SDNSF, stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cell supporting factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; ES, embryonic stem; dpc, days postcoitus; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; BrdU, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DIVn, nth day in vitro; ANOVA, analysis of variance; LSD, least squares difference; En, embryonic day n;Pn, postnatal day n; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein. At present, discrete regions of the adult brain, the subventricular zone of the forebrain and the subgranular layer of hippocampal dentate gyrus, are known to mediate adult neurogenesis (1Altman J.

Primary culture of adult neural stem/progenitor cells (ANSCs) is a potent tool to investigate signals controlling adult neurogenesis. ANSCs can be isolated and expanded by means of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and/or basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2). Cycling cells can maintain the properties of self-renewal and multipotency (5Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar, 6Palmer T.D. Ray J.

The fate of ANSCs is under tight environmental control, and various extrinsic factors to promote lineage commitment have been described (9Palmer T.D. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 8: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 10Takahashi J. Palmer T.D. Gage F.H. J.

ANSCs grafted into the neurogenic or non-neurogenic regions give rise to neurons in a site-specific manner, i.e. only within the neurogenic regions (7Gage F.H. Coates P.W. Palmer T.D. Kuhn H.G.

Therefore, we anticipate that cell fate is tightly regulated by specific signaling molecules within neurogenic region or “stem cell niche.” However, the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype must also be an important attribute of the stem cell niche, and in vitro culture has provided evidence that stem cells themselves may produce autocrine/paracrine factors that facilitate proliferative self-renewal (7Gage F.H. Coates P.W. Palmer T.D. Kuhn H.G. Fisher L.J. Suhonen J.O. Peterson D.A. Suhr S.T. Ray J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11879-11883Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar).

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7194-7202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are two such essential autocrine/paracrine molecules that have been identified as cofactors of FGF-2 and EGF, respectively. To further explore autocrine/paracrine signaling within the stem cell niche, therefore, we used the signal sequence trap method (17Tashiro K. Nakamura T. Honjo T.

Using this cDNA screening method, we have efficiently isolated many secreted molecules with a wide variety of functions (19Tashiro K. Tada H. Heilker R. Shirozu M. Nakano T. Honjo T.

In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel molecule, stem cell-derived neural stem/progenitor cell survival factor (SDNSF), from a cDNA library from rat adult hippocampal NSCs (9Palmer T.D. Takahashi J. Gage F.H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 8: 389-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). SDNSF is secreted via the classical vesicular export pathway and provides trophic support for ANSC in the absence of mitogenic growth factors. In addition, SDNSF maintains the self-renewal potential and multipotency of ANSCs in the absence of FGF-2. SDNSF-treated ANSCs can proliferate in response to FGF-2 and produce neuronal and glial cell population after differentiation treatment. Animals and Transient Forebrain Global Ischemia Model—Fisher 344 rats, Sprague-Dawley rats, and C57BL/6 mice were maintained and used for experimentation according to the guidelines of the Kyoto University Animal Research Committee and Stanford University Animal Facility. The animals were deeply anesthetized, sacrificed with sodium pentobarbital, and then dissected immediately or fixed by intracardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde. For cell cultures, the brains were dissected according to the cell culture protocols as below. For RNA extraction, the tissues are immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For in situ hybridization, 50-μm-thick coronal sections were prepared from adult female Fisher 344 rat brains after paraformaldehyde perfusion. Transient global ischemia was induced on male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion and induced hypotension using the modified two-vessel occlusion method (26Smith M.L. Bendek G. Dahlgren N. Rosen I. Wieloch T. Siesjo B.K. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1984; 69: 385-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In brief, the animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane, 68.5% nitrous oxide, and 30% oxygen and monitored from the femoral artery with PE-50 catheter (427410; Becton Dickinson, San Diego, CA). After exposure of the right jugular vein and both common carotid arteries, 150 IU/kg heparin was intravenously injected, and blood was quickly withdrawn via the jugular vein. When the mean arterial blood pressure became 30 mm Hg, both common carotid arteries were clamped with surgical clips. Mean arterial blood pressure was maintained at 30–35 mm Hg for 5 min. After ischemic treatment, the clips were removed, and the blood was reinfused. Body temperature was monitored with a rectal probe and controlled at 37 °C. Sham-operated animals underwent exposure of vessels without blood withdrawal or clamping of carotid arteries. All animals were treated in accordance with Kyoto University Animal Research Committee guidelines, Stanford University guidelines, and the animal protocol approved by Stanford University's Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care. Cell Culture—ANSCs were isolated from adult rat hippocampi and cultured as described previously (6Palmer T.D. Ray J. Gage F.H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 27Palmer T.D. Markakis E.A. Willhoite A.R. Safar F. Gage F.H. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8487-8497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hippocampi from adult female Fisher 344 rats were enzymatically dissociated with a papain (2.5 units/ml; Worthington, Freehold, NJ), dispase II (1 unit/ml; Roche Applied Science), and DNase I (250 units/ml; Worthington) solution. A whole digested tissue was then suspended in 50% Percoll solution and fractionated by centrifugation for 10 min at 20,000 × g. Fractionated cells were washed free of Percoll and plated onto poly-l-ornithine/laminin-coated dishes in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) containing 10% FCS medium for 24 h, and then the medium was replaced with serum-free growth medium consisting of DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with N2 supplement (Invitrogen) and 20 ng/ml recombinant human FGF-2 (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). To follow the proliferating single NSC, NSCs were infected by replication-deficient GFP-expressing recombinant retrovirus, LZRS-CAMut4GFP (28Okada A. Lansford R. Weimann J.M. Fraser S.E. McConnell S.K. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 394-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To promote differentiation, the growth medium was replaced with DMEM/F-12 containing 0.5% FCS, 0.5 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (differentiation medium), and ANSCs were cultured for 6 days. For primary culture of neurons and astrocytes, Fischer 344 rat E18 hippocampi for neurons and P2–4 hippocampi for astrocytes were dissected and dissociated by treatment with 0.25% trypsin and trituration with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated dishes and cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with N2 supplement for neurons and in DMEM with 10% FCS for astrocytes (29Booher J. Sensenbrenner M. Neurobiology. 1972; 2: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar). The astrocytes were cultured for 3–6 weeks with two to three passages and 5 mm glutamate treatment to eliminate neurons. Rat embryonic NSCs were isolated from E14 striata described previously with slight modification (30Ciccolini F. Svendsen C.N. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7869-7880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissected striata were enzymatically digested similarly to rat adult NSC isolation and triturated with fire-polished Pasteur pipette, and the cells were plated onto noncoated Nunc four-well dishes in the same growth medium as adult NSCs in the presence of FGF-2 at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. COS-7 cells, HEK293T cells, rat glioma C6 cells (31Benda P. Lightbody J. Sato G. Levine L. Sweet W. Science. 1968; 161: 370-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), mouse neuroblastoma N18 cells (32Amano T. Richelson E. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar), and human glioblastoma U251 cells (33de Ridder L.I. Laerum O.D. Mork S.J. Bigner D.D. Acta Neuropathol. 1987; 72: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line, R1, were cultured on a feeder layer of irradiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts with daily changed medium containing knockout DMEM, penicillin-streptomycin, 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 mm nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), 15% FCS (HyClone, Logan, UT), and 1,000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) (34Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar). RNA Analysis and SDNSF cDNA Cloning—To isolate novel secretory or membrane proteins from neural stem cells, cDNA library was constructed from cultured ANSCs. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from ANSCs with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and Oligotex-dT30 Super (Roche Applied Science). The construction of the cDNA library of NSCs and screening by signal sequence trap using yeast was carried out as described previously (18Jacobs K.A. Collins-Racie L.A. Colbert M. Duckett M. Golden-Fleet M. Kelleher K. Kriz R. LaVallie E.R. Merberg D. Spaulding V. Stover J. Williamson M.J. McCoy J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 198: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To obtain full-length SDNSF cDNAs from poly(A)+ RNA of ANSC cells and rat brain, 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods with the Marathon kit (Clontech) were performed. From this sequence data of 5′ and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods, the coding sequence of rat SDNSF was confirmed of RT-PCR using a set of primer pairs: 5′-GCGTCAGGGGGACGCAGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GTCAGCTCCGATTGCACAAATACTTGA-3′. Coding sequences of mouse and human were obtained from adult mouse brain total RNA and human heart total RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) with RT-PCR using two sets of primer pairs based on rat sequence data and on expressed sequence tag data from a data base search: 5′-GTGCGGAGAAAAGCGTCCCAG-3′ and 5′-TCCATTTTATTGTCAGATAGCCAGAGTTCA-3′, 5′-TGGTGAGGCCCGAGGCGTT-3′ and 5′-TCTTGGGTACGTCTTTATCAGCAGCAT-3′. The Northern analysis was performed essentially as described (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.39-7.52Google Scholar). Rat SDNSF and rat GAPDH (459–1001 of GenBank™ accession number M17701) cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming. The filter for Northern analysis was prepared from 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA prepared as above from following cells and tissues: ANSCs, adult rat brain, heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, testis, and skeletal muscle. The filter was hybridized using Quick-Hyb solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blotting was analyzed using an image analyzer (BAS 2000, Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). For in situ hybridization, we used riboprobes for the in situ detection of mRNAs derived from rat SDNSF as described previously (36Houtani T. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Sato K. Sakuma S. Kakimoto S. Ueyama T. Noda T. Sugimoto T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 424: 489-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One-kb cDNA fragments including coding region and 3′-noncoding region of the rat SDNSF were generated and subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense rat SDNSF probes were generated with SP6 and T7 polymerases, respectively, using the digoxigenin RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). For RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent from undifferentiated ANSCs, differentiated ANSCs, embryo NSCs, C6, N18, U251 cells; rat whole embryo at 8.5 days postcoitus (dpc) and 10.5; embryonic and postnatal rat brain from 12.5, 14.5, 16.5, and 18.5 dpc and P2, P4, and P7. Equal amounts of samples were subjected to RT-PCR as previously described (25Kobuke K. Furukawa Y. Sugai M. Tanigaki K. Ohashi N. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. Honjo T. Tashiro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34105-34114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Each reaction was standardized against a GAPDH control to permit comparison between samples in each PCR. cDNA was generated SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) and amplified by the gene-specific primers for rat SDNSF as above and for rat GAPDH: 5′-TGCATCCTGCACCACCAACT-3′ and 5′-CGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTC-3′. For semiquantitative RT-PCR (37Nakayama H. Yokoi H. Fujita J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4939Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), total RNA was extracted from ischemic hippocampi at two time points, postoperative day 1 and 7 with sham operated control (n = 6/time point), and synthesis of cDNA was performed as above using 1 μg of total RNA from each sample. Then cDNA was amplified in 50 μl of PCRs that contained 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP mixture, 2.5 units of Taq DNA in PCR buffer (Invitrogen), and 0.5 μm gene-specific primers using i-Cycler™ (Bio-Rad) between 22 and 40 cycles using SDNSF and GAPDH primers as above. The resultant PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide, the fluorescent bands were scanned, and the volume density of SDNSF was then quantified using NIH Image 1.62. These conditions produced amplicons within the linear exponential phase of the PCR curve. The quantification of SDNSF were normalized with GAPDH by dividing time point band density by that of its matched PCR. Computer Analysis and Data Base Search—Sequencing was performed with an automated sequencer (model 377A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Handling of all the nucleotide and amino acid sequence data and the construction of hydrophobicity profiles were performed with GenetyxMac Version 9.0 (Software Development, Tokyo, Japan). Sequence alignment was executed with ClustalX (38Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35497) Google Scholar). BLAST and FASTA searches were performed at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi and www.fasta.genome.ad.jp/ideas/fasta/fasta_nr-aa.html, respectively. A motif search was done at www.motif.genome.ad.jp/. The nucleotide sequences reported in this paper has been submitted to the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession numbers AF475282 (rat SDNSF), AF475283 (mouse SDNSF), and AF475284 (human SDNSF). Protein Analysis and Immunological Methods—Rat SDNSF was recloned into pEF-6V5-His (Invitrogen) with swapping the original V5 epitope to the FLAG epitope tag at the C terminus (pEF-His-FLAG) to generate FLAG fusion protein, SDNSF-C′ FLAG/His. We also inserted FLAG epitope tag at the predicted signal sequence cleavage site and constructed rat SDNSF-N′ FLAG fusion protein. The primer sequences for rat FLAG-SDNSF construction were 5′-GACTAGTCATGGCATCCCTGCAGCTGCTCAGAGGTCCCTTCCTGTGTGTTCTGCTCTGGGCCTTTTGTGTTCCTGGTGCCAGGGCCGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGCAGG AGCATGGGGCTGGTGTCCACC-3′ and 5′-CTACTGCAGCGACTTGGCAAACTCT-3′. HEK293T cells and COS7 cells were transfected with these expression vectors pEF-SDNSF-C′ FLAG/His, pEF-SDNSF-N′ FLAG, or pEF-His-FLAG in serum-free DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) with N2 supplement using CellPhect (Amersham Biosciences) and were treated with lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The conditioned medium from these transfected HEK293T cells were filtered and concentrated with Centricon YM-10 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). SDNSF proteins were purified from the concentrated conditioned medium using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). According to the manufacturer's protocol with the slight modification of buffer concentrations as below, the concentrated conditioned mediums from pEF-SDNSF-C′ FLAG/His and from pEF-His-FLAG transfected HEK 293T cells cultures were purified under native conditions. We mixed 1 ml of the 50% Ni-NTA slurry to 2 ml concentrated conditioned medium and 2 ml of 2× lysis buffer (40 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl) at 4 °C for 60 min, loaded this mix into a column, washed with 20 mm of imidazole buffer (20 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl) twice, then washed with 40 mm of imidazole buffer (40 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl) twice, and eluted in elution buffer (250 mm imidazole, 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl). After this purification step, the eluted samples and the concentrated conditioned medium were electrophoresed in 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the purity of SDNSF in eluted solution was determined from the densitometric analysis of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and NIH Image 1.62 (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The purified SDNSF protein was dialyzed with Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce) overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were determined with Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). We measured endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide activity by Toxicolor LS-6 (Seikagaku Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), and the concentration of endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide turned out to be under the detection limit. The similarly treated conditioned medium from pEF-His-FLAG transfected HEK293T cells transfected by pEF-His-FLAG was used as a control in the following SDNSF survival and proliferation assays. SDS-PAGE and Western analysis were carried out with these cell lysates and conditioned medium samples following ECL (Amersham Biosciences) Western blot protocols with using mouse 1:5,000 monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and 1:5,000 anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibody (Sigma). The COS7 cells transfected with vectors pEF-SDNSF-C′ FLAG/His or pEF-His-FLAG and the other cells tested were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and examined with immunofluorescence staining or immunoelectron microscopy as described previously (6Palmer T.D. Ray J. Gage F.H. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1995; 6: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 21Nakamura T. Yabe D. Kanazawa N. Tashiro K. Sasayama S. Honjo T.

The transfected COS7 cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody 1:5,000 and anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody 1:500 (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, MA) for immunofluorescence or 1.4-nm gold particles-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, 1:1,000 (Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY) for immunoelectron microscopy. The ANSCs were stained with monoclonal anti-nestin, 1:500 (Pharmingen, Palo Alto, CA); monoclonal anti-type III β-tubulin (Tuj-1), 1:5,000 (Convance, Richmond, CA); rabbit anti-NG2 Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan, 1:500 (Chemicon); and guinea pig anti-GFAP, 1:1000 (Advanced ImmunoChemical, Long Beach CA) and then labeled with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies; anti-mouse IgG, 1:500; anti-rabbit IgG, 1:500; and antiguinea pig IgG, 1:500. For counterstaining of nuclei, 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) was used. The 45Ca2+ binding assay (40Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem.

NSCs Viability Assays and Neurosphere Assay—To test the SDNSF effects on ANSCs and mouse ES R1 cells, purified SDNSF was added into the medium, and cell survival and proliferational activities were assessed. ANSCs were plated onto Nunc 96-well or six-well plates at the density of 1,000 cells/cm2 and cultured for 6 days in the serum-free growth medium minus FGF-2. SDNSF or FGF-2 were added at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, and 500 ng/ml. As a control, the same volume of similarly treated HEK293T cell conditioned medium as purified SDNSF was added in the control group medium. To test the possibility of SDNSF as a cofactor for FGF-2, ANSCs were cultured in FGF-2+ growth medium with 100 ng/ml of SDNSF. Undifferentiated mouse ES cells were placed in Costar ultra low cluster 96-well plates (Corning, Acton, MA) at the density of 1,000 cells/cm2 and cultured in medium with 100 ng/ml of SDNSF or same volume of control solutions and without leukemia inhibitory factor for 6 days. At DIV6 cell survival and/or proliferation effects were estimated by using premix WST-1 kit (Takara, Shiga, Japan), which is added to the growth medium and measures the number of viable cells and cell viability by detecting the cleavage of tetrazolium salts and mitochondrial enzyme activity as A 450 nm. Cell proliferation activity was estimated by BrdU uptake for 3 h at DIV4, which is shown as A 492 nm, using Cell Proliferation ELISA and by BrdU (colorimetric) kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol; also by following clonal expansion of single GFP-labeled ANSC, SDNSF effects on proliferational activity were estimated. To test the self-renewal and differentiation potential of SDNSF-treated ANSCs, after ANSCs were cultured in the SDNSF+/FGF-2– medium (100 ng/ml of SDNSF without FGF-2) for 6 days, those ANSCs were replated on noncoated Nunc 48-well plates at the density of 2,000 cells/cm2 and grown for 6 days in growth medium containing 20 ng/ml of FGF-2, and the number of neurospheres were counted. To assess the differentiation potentials, the newly formed neurospheres were replated onto poly-l-ornithine/laminin-coated Labtek 4-well chamber slides (Nunc) at the density of 10–30 spheres/well and cultured in differentiation medium for further 6 days. Under confocal laser microscope or fluorescent microscope, positively stained cells were quantified at least 20 fields systematically across the coverslips from three to four independent experiments of parallel cultures. Analytical Procedures and Data Analysis—Group changes were assessed using one-way ANOVA. When statistical differences were obtained at the p < 0.01 level between groups, post hoc comparisons were made using the Fisher least squares difference (LSD) test.

The presence of US2 induces the formation of class I MHC heavy chain conjugates of increased molecular weight that are recognized by a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody, W6/32, suggesting that these class I MHC molecules retain their proper tertiary structure. These conjugates are properly folded glycosylated heavy chains modified by attachment of an estimated one, two, and three ubiquitin molecules. The folded ubiquitinated class I MHC heavy chains are not observed in control cells or in cells transfected with US11, suggesting that US2 targets class I MHC heavy chains for dislocation in a manner distinct from that used by US11. This is further supported by the fact that US2 and US11 show different requirements in terms of the conformation of the heavy chain molecule. Although ubiquitin conjugation may occur on the cytosolic tail of the class I MHC molecule, replacement of lysines in the cytosolic tail of heavy chains with arginine does not prevent their degradation by US2. In an in vitro system that recapitulates US2-mediated dislocation, heavy chains that lack these lysines still occur in an ubiquitin-modified form, but in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction. Such ubiquitin conjugation can only occur on the class I MHC lumenal domain and is likely to take place once class I MHC heavy chains have been discharged from the endoplasmic reticulum. We conclude that ubiquitinylation of class I MHC heavy chain is not required during the initial step of the US2-mediated dislocation reaction.

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The ER provides an environment for signal peptide processing, membrane insertion, glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, folding, and multimerization of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Proteins that lack the ability to fold properly or that lack a partner subunit are retained in the ER and eventually transported to the cytosol for destruction by the proteasome (2Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Plemper R.K. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 266-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The recognition, dislocation, and degradation steps that facilitate this disposal pathway are likely to be diverse. Viruses have co-opted this quality control pathway for their own benefit (4Tortorella D. Gewurz B.E. Furman M.H. Schust D.J. Ploegh H.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 861-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The ER is the site of synthesis for the majority of molecules responsible for immune recognition and therefore a target for viral proteins that manipulate such recognition. The human class I MHC heavy chain is a 43-kDa type I transmembrane glycoprotein with a large ER-lumenal/cytosolic domain and a short cytosolic tail. It is inserted into the ER membrane, glycosylated, and assembled with both the soluble class I MHC light chain or β2 microglobulin and the antigenic peptide. This properly folded and fully assembled trimeric complex is then allowed to exit the ER and travel through the secretory pathway to the cell surface. The US2 and US11 gene products of human cytomegalovirus target class I MHC molecules for dislocation from the ER, leading to complete extraction of class I MHC heavy chains from the ER membrane into the cytosol followed by proteasomal destruction (5Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 6Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). US2 and US11 have thus co-opted the degradation pathway of aberrant ER proteins to prevent cell surface expression of class I MHC molecules and hence detection of human cytomegalovirus-infected cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. A more precise definition of the point(s) at which US2 and US11 recognize class I MHC molecules after their insertion into the ER and stimulate their transport back into the cytosol is likely to shed light on the destruction of misfolded proteins more generally. Recent evidence suggests that full unfolding of the class I MHC molecules may not be required to allow dislocation by US2 and US11 molecules (7Tirosh B. Furman M.H. Tortorella D. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6664-6672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Fiebiger E. Story C. Ploegh H.L. Tortorella D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1041-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that US2 and US11 carry out their function differently, not-withstanding presumed structural similarity of these viral glycoproteins. The results suggest that the means by which proteins are extracted from the ER and targeted for degradation can be diverse, even for the same target molecule, in our case class I MHC heavy chains. Misfolded substrates may be recognized by their glycosylation status, continued exposure of hydrophobic regions, and association with chaperones (2Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The Sec61 translocon may be a conduit through which dislocation substrates pass: mutations in Sec61p compromise dislocation in yeast (9Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K.

Sorscher E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29873-29878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin system is involved in this process. Most ER degradation substrates are modified by the attachment of ubiquitin. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes are required for the dislocation of many ER proteins (13Wilhovsky S. Gardner R. Hampton R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Tiwari S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16193-16200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The CDC48-NPL4-UFD1 complex, which recognizes ubiquitinated proteins, is also required for the dislocation of mutant carboxypeptidase Y, murine class I MHC heavy chain, H-2Kb, and OLE1 (Δ-9 fatty acid desaturase) from the yeast ER (15Jarosch E.

The details of recognition, timing, and post-translational modification of dislocation substrates remain to be clarified. The ubiquitin system plays a role in the extraction of class I MHC heavy chains in US11-expressing cells. Polyubiquitinated heavy chains have been detected in US11-expressing cells (18Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and ubiquitination is required for the dislocation of heavy chains in US11 cells (19Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L.

Ploegh, and D. Tortorella, unpublished observations. Here we show that US2 triggers the ubiquitination of apparently folded class I MHC molecules while still in the ER, but in a manner distinct from that required for US11. These modified class I MHC heavy chain intermediates then disappear from the ER. Although ubiquitin can potentially be added to the lysine residues in the cytosolic tail of class I MHC molecules, ubiquitin conjugation within this domain is not required for dislocation and degradation of the class I MHC molecules. DNA Constructs and Cell Lines—Class I MHC heavy chains (HLA-A2) containing an N-terminal influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (HA-A2), and the HA-A2 molecule in which the lysine residues at positions 335, 340, and 364 were replaced with arginine (HA-A2K-R) have been described (18Shamu C.E.

HLA-A2 containing an N-terminal HA tag in which the cysteine residues at positions 227 and 283 within the α3 domain of the HLA-A2 molecule were replaced with serine residues (HA-A2C227S,C283S) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The CD4 construct has been described (22Huppa J.B. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Vpu construct was kindly provided by Klaus Strebel. The cell lines used were wild type (U373 cells), US2 transfectants (US2 cells), or US11 transfectants (US11 cells) of U373-MG human astrocytoma cells and were maintained as described (23Jones T.R. Hanson L.K. Sun L. Slater J.S. Stenberg R.M. Campbell A.E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4830-4841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). U373 cells that do not express US2 or US11 do not support class I MHC degradation and are therefore used and referred to as control cells. HA-A2, HA-A2K-R, and HA-A2C227S,C283S constructs were transduced into U373, US2, and US11 cells using the pLHCX and pLNCX retroviral vectors (Clontech).

US2 and US11 Differ in Their Ability to Target Partially Folded Class I MHC Molecules for Degradation—We had indirect evidence suggesting that US2 and US11 target newly synthesized class I MHC heavy chains for dislocation and proteasomal degradation by distinct strategies. This difference may have its origin either in the initial stages of class I MHC recognition or at later steps during the dislocation and degradation processes. We first addressed whether US2 and US11 target specific conformational states of class I MHC molecules. We therefore examined whether US2 and US11 can target a partially folded class I MHC molecule for destruction. We generated a retroviral vector encoding a partially folded HLA-A2 molecule by eliminating the disulfide bridge within the α3 domain of the class I MHC heavy chain. This disulfide bridge helps maintain the proper fold of class I MHC molecules. Its elimination should therefore yield a class I MHC molecule with a more flexible conformation than that of wild type. We replaced the two cysteine residues at positions 227 and 283 with serine residues (A2C227S,C283S). An N-terminal HA-tagged version of this molecule, HA-A2C227S,C283S, was then transduced using a retroviral vector into control (U373), US2, and US11 cells. The N-terminal HA epitope tag allows us to distinguish the mutant from the endogenous heavy chains. The inclusion of the HA tag in the class I MHC heavy chains prevents properly folded (W6/32-reactive) class I MHC molecules from reaching the cell surface for reasons as of yet unknown. However, the HA-tagged class I MHC heavy chains continue to be targeted for proteasomal degradation in an US2- and US11-dependent manner (see Figs. 1 and 5B) (18Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing HA-A2 and HA-A2C227S,C283S were metabolically labeled for 15 min in the absence of proteasome inhibitors and chased for up to 30 min (Fig. 1). The HA-A2 and HA-A2C227S,C283S molecules were recovered with anti-HA antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). In control cells, both the HA-A2 and the HA-A2C227S,283S molecules are stable over the course of the chase (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 3 and 4). The HA-A2 molecule is unstable in the presence of both US2 and US11 (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6) (18Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), respectively. Strikingly, HA-A2C227S,C283S molecules are unstable in US11-expressing cells but are completely stable in US2-expressing cells (Fig. 1, compare lanes 9 and 10 and lanes 7 and 8). This suggests that class I MHC molecules must acquire a properly folded conformation to be targeted for degradation by US2. On the other hand, US11-mediated degradation is not dependent on the tertiary structure of class I MHC molecules. Moreover, US2 and US11 have markedly different length requirements for the cytoplasmic tail of class I MHC molecules to mediate dislocation. 3P. Stern, M. J. Kim, H. Ploegh, and D. Tortorella, unpublished observations. These results suggest the involvement of different pathways utilized by US2 and US11 to target class I MHC molecules for degradation.Fig. 5Ubiquitination of the cytosolic domain of class I MHC is not required for dislocation in vivo and in vitro. As shown in A, HA-A2 and HA-A2K-R mRNAs were in vitro translated in US2-containing microsomes for 45 min followed by the in vitro degradation assay in the presence of MG132. Microsome (lanes 1–4) and supernatant (sup., lanes 5–8) fractions were analyzed separately by SDS-PAGE (10%). As shown in B, US2 cells stably expressing HA-A2 or HA-A2K-R were metabolically labeled and chased up to 40 min in the absence of proteasome inhibitor. Cells were lysed in 1% SDS to allow recovery of the total population of HA-tagged molecules followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody (lanes 1–6) and anti-heavy chain and anti-US2 serum, respectively (lanes 7–12). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12.5%).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Class I MHC Conjugates Are Stabilized by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in US2-expressing Cells—A protein covalently tagged with ubiquitin is usually degraded in the cytoplasm by the proteasome. In the presence of US11, a small fraction of class I MHC heavy chains is polyubiquitinated (18Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and a functional ubiquitination system is necessary for the dislocation of class I MHC heavy chains (19Shamu C.E. Flierman D. Ploegh H.L. Rapoport T.A. Chau V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2546-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 20Kikkert M. Hassink G. Barel M. Hirsch C. van der Wal F.J. Wiertz E. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ubiquitin plays a role in US11-mediated dislocation of class I MHC heavy chains. The different conformational requirements for class I MHC degradation mediated by US2 and that mediated by US11 (see above) prompted us to investigate whether US2 and US11 also induce the formation of ubiquitin-modified class I MHC heavy chains differently. We examined whether in the presence of US2 the class I MHC heavy chains are modified with ubiquitin. The addition and removal of ubiquitin, by ubiquitin ligases and ubiquitin-specific isopeptidases, respectively, are reactions that depend on a cysteine residue in their active sites. To block these activities, the alkylating agent NEM was included in a pulse-chase experiment. US2-expressing astrocytoma cells were pulsed for 15 min with [35S]methionine in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (ZL3VS) and chased for 30 min in the presence and absence of NEM (Fig. 2). Free class I MHC heavy chains were recovered from cell lysates with anti-heavy chain serum (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3), and properly folded class I MHC molecules were retrieved using the monoclonal antibody W6/32 (25Parham P. Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. J. Immunol. 1979; 123: 342-349PubMed Google Scholar). A diagnostic trait of US2-mediated degradation of class I MHC heavy chains is the removal of the single N-linked glycan on class I MHC heavy chains (HC + CHO) by a cytoplasmic N-glycanase. This deglycosylated intermediate (HC–CHO) is seen only in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (5Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). In anti-heavy chain immunoprecipitates from US2-expressing cells treated with ZL3VS, the cytosolic deglycosylated heavy chains (HC–CHO) are present at both the 0- and 30-min chase period (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). In US2-expressing cells treated with NEM at the onset of the chase, dislocation of the unfolded class I MHC heavy chains is inhibited, and no conversion of the heavy chains to deglycosylated species occurs (Fig. 2, lane 3) (33Tortorella D. Story C.M. Huppa J.B. Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Bacik I. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Because until recently we had assumed that dislocation would require full dissociation and unfolding of the class I MHC substrate, we had not examined in any detail the possible modification of the folded class I MHC molecule. In W6/32 immunoprecipitations from US2-expressing cells, we now detect a series of polypeptides with a slower mobility than the glycosylated heavy chain backbone (Fig. 2, lanes 4–6, asterisk). These conjugates are recovered exclusively with W6/32 (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 6). In proteasome inhibitor-treated cells, the conjugates disappear over the chase period but are stabilized when cells are chased in the presence of NEM (Fig. 2, compare lanes 5 and 6). The composition of the conjugates visualized in the presence of NEM appears to be somewhat different from those seen in the absence of NEM. Although the underlying cause of this difference was not identified, differential attack by ubiquitin-specific proteases could contribute. We have so far been unable to explore this issue further. W6/32 recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope on the lumenal domain of class I MHC molecules. Therefore, we consider it unlikely that the slower migrating class I MHC conjugates are modified on the lumenal domain, but rather reflect modification of the cytoplasmic tail. As we will show below (see Fig. 5), the appearance of these modified class I MHC heavy chain species requires at least in vitro the presence of the lysine residues in the cytoplasmic tail. This suggests that the slower migrating species may be ubiquitinated class I MHC polypeptides. HLA-A2 Molecules Are Mono-, Di-, and Triubiquitinated in the Presence of US2 and Not US11—We identified these higher molecular weight species as modified class I MHC heavy chains by a reimmunoprecipitation experiment, considering that [35S]methionine cells contain many polypeptides that may co-precipitate with W6/32-reactive material (Fig. 3A). Control, US2-, and US11-expressing cells were metabolically labeled for 15 min in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (ZL3VS). NEM was added to the cells 1 min prior to lysis. Folded class I MHC heavy chains were recovered with W6/32 (1° IP). Immunoprecipitates were then fully denatured by boiling in 1% SDS and reimmunoprecipitated with anti-heavy chain serum (2° IP) (Fig. 3A , lanes 1–3). The higher molecular weight class I MHC heavy chain conjugates are recognized by the anti-heavy chain serum and are present in samples derived from US2-expressing cells but not in samples from control or US11-expressing cells (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 with lanes 1 and 3). Therefore, these higher molecular weight polypeptides correspond to modified class I MHC heavy chains and not to co-precipitating proteins. To examine whether these polypeptides are ubiquitinated heavy chains, a portion of the W6/32 immunoprecipitations was denatured and reimmunoprecipitated with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (2° IP) (Fig. 3A , lanes 4–6). This immunoprecipitation recovered a subset of the polypeptide species seen in the anti-HC immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3A , lane 5). The fact that not all of the higher molecular weight class I MHC conjugates are recognized in this reimmunoprecipitation experiment may be related to the inability of the anti-Ub antibody to recognize all oligoubiquitinylated species equally well. Based on this result, we cannot formally exclude the modification of class I MHC heavy chains with a polypeptide(s) other than ubiquitin. A trace amount of heavy chain polypeptides is observed in anti-Ub immunoprecipitations from all three cell lines (Fig. 3A , lanes 4–6), presumably due to the relatively high level of unmodified heavy chains present in the initial immunoprecipitates. The slower migrating heavy chain polypeptides have molecular masses of ∼52, 60, and 68 kDa. The molecular mass of ubiquitin is ∼8 kDa, and that of class I MHC heavy chain is 43 kDa. The heavy chain conjugates are therefore predicted to be modified with one, two, and three ubiquitins. For heavy chains that contain two or three ubiquitin moieties, attachment at two or three sites, as well as the possible occurrence of di- and tri-Ub chains could generate a large number of different isomers, each with distinct electrophoretic properties, and thus contribute to the electrophoretic heterogeneity observed. Moreover, the U373 cell line expresses multiple HLA-A, -B, and -C locus products, further contributing to heterogeneity. To verify that ubiquitin is indeed conjugated to class I MHC heavy chains in a US2-dependent manner, we generated US2- and US11-expressing cells transfected with an influenza HA epitope-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) expression construct. ControlHA-Ub, US2HA-Ub, and US11HA-Ub cells were metabolically labeled for 15 min in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (ZL3VS) (Fig. 3B). Folded class I MHC heavy chains were recovered with W6/32 (1° IP). One-third of the W6/32 immunoprecipitates was analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B , lanes 1–3). Consistent with the experiment in Figs. 2 and 3A, the slower migrating class I MHC heavy chain conjugates were recovered from US2-expressing cells (Fig. 3B , lane 2) and not from control and US11-expressing cells. The remaining two-thirds of the W6/32 reactive material was fu"
https://openalex.org/W2006518149,"Mouse mCRY1 and zebrafish zCRY1a and zCRY3 belong to the DNA photolyase/Cryptochrome family. mCRY1 and zCRY1a repress CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription, whereas zCRY3 does not. Reciprocal chimeras between zCRY1a and zCRY3 were generated to determine the zCRY1a regions responsible for nuclear translocation, interaction with the CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimer, and repression of CLOCK:BMAL1-mediated transcription. Three regions, RD-2a-(126–196), RD-1-(197–263), and RD-2b-(264–293), were identified. Proteins in this family consist of an N-terminal α/β domain and a C-terminal helical domain connected by an interdomain loop. RD-2a is within this loop, RD-1 is at the N-terminal 50 amino acids, and RD-2b at the following 31 amino acid residues of the helical domain. Either RD-2a or RD-1 is required for interaction with the CLOCK: BMAL1 heterodimer, and either RD-1 or RD-2b is required for the nuclear translocation of CRY. Both of these functions are prerequisites for the transcriptional repressor activity. The functional nuclear localizing signal in the RD-2b region also was identified. The sequence is well conserved among repressor-type CRYs, including mCRY1. Mutations in the nuclear localizing signal of mCRY1 reduce the extent of its nuclear localization. These findings show that both nuclear localization and interaction with the CLOCK:BMAL heterodimer are essential for transcriptional repression by CRY.

Organisms ranging from bacteria to humans have daily rhythms driven by endogenous oscillators called circadian clocks that regulate various biochemical, physiological, and behavioral processes with a periodicity of approximate by 24 h (1Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar, 2King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Annu. Rev.

Under natural conditions, rhythms are entrained to a 24-h day by environmental time cues, most commonly light. These circadian clock mechanisms have been investigated by characterizing the “clock genes” that affect the daily rhythm. The core of the clock mechanisms in Drosophila, Neurospora, mammals, and cyanobacteria is expressed by a transcription/translation-based negative feedback loop that relies on positive and negative oscillator elements. The negative feedback loop begins by activating the transcription of clock genes, the products of which then negatively regulate their own expression, setting up the rhythmic oscillations of gene expression that drive the circadian clock. Although negative feedback loop is a common mechanism in Drosophila, Neurospora, mammals, and cyanobacteria, its components differ with the species. Drosophila and mammals have common components (orthologous gene products), except for the negative elements TIM 1The abbreviations used are: TIM, TIMELESS; CRY, Cryptochrome; PER, PERIOD; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; NLS, nuclear localization signal; z, zebrafish; m, mouse. (TIMELESS) and CRY (Cryptochrome). PER (PERIOD), and TIM, identified as the negative elements in Drosophila, form a heterodimer that translocates to the nucleus where its components interact with the positive elements dCLOCK and CYC (4Saez L. Young M.W. Neuron. 1996; 17: 911-920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Formation of a complex decreases dCLOCK:CYC-mediated transcription, resulting in the repression of expression (5Gekakis N. Saez L. Delahaye-Brown A.M. Myers M.P. Sehgal A. Young M.W. Weitz C.J. Science. 1995; 270: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 6Sehgal A. Rothenfluh-Hilfiker A. Hunter-Ensor M. Chen Y. Myers M.P. Young M.W. Science. 1995; 270: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In mammals, CRY1 and CRY2 are partners of the PER heterodimer, rather than TIM. In mammals, the mPER and mCRY proteins form heterodimers that translocate to the nucleus where they act as negative regulators by interacting with CLOCK and BMAL1 (CYC is the Drosophila homolog of BMAL1) to inhibit transcription (7Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M.

Science. 1999; 285: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This interaction disrupts their inhibitory effect on transactivation of the CLOCK:CYC heterodimer, leading to a phase shift in circadian rhythm. Consistent with this model, cryb mutant flies that bear a mutation within the dcry gene display free-running behavioral rhythms but lack light entrainment capability. Furthermore, these flies show rhythmicity in constant light, whereas wild-type ones are arrhythmic under such conditions (9Stanewsky R. Kaneko M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A.

These findings show that the role of dCRY is as a circadian photoreceptor and indicate diversity in CRY functions in different species. Mouse CRY was designated a repressor-type, Drosophila CRY a non-repressor-type. The zebrafish provides an attractive vertebrate model for biological clock analyses. Several of its clock genes have now been identified, and in vitro analyses has shown that the zebrafish negative feedback loop consists of components similar to those of mammals. zPER and zCRY act as negative regulators, and zCLOCK and zBMAL as positive elements (14Vitaterna M.H.

They repress the activities of mouse CLOCK and BMAL, as well as those of zebrafish CLOCK and BMAL, indicative that the basic function of repressor-type zCRYs is the same as that of mCRYs (16Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A unique feature of zebrafish CRY is the presence of extra paralogous genes. In addition to repressor-type CRYs, the zebrafish has a unique CRY, zCRY3, that despite high structural similarity to repressor-type CRYs, lacks transcriptional repression (16Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). zCRY3 therefore can be classified as a non-repressor-type CRY, but its function has yet to be identified. CRYs are members of the DNA photolyase/cryptochrome protein family (21Todo T. Ryo H. Yamamoto K. Toh H. Inui T. Ayaki H. Nomura T. Ikenaga M. Science. 1996; 272: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Todo T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Cashmore A.R. Jarillo J.A. Wu Y.J. Liu D. Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar) that comprise such functionally diverse members as DNA photolyase and CRY. DNA photolyase is a unique enzyme that repairs a UV-induced DNA damage in a light-dependent manner (24Todo T. Takemori H. Ryo H. Ihara M. Matsunaga T. Nikaido O. Sato K. Nomura T.

Despite functional diversity, the members of this protein family have a high degree of sequence similarity and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a common cofactor. Although animal CRYs have a crucial role in the central circadian clock, because of structural complexity their functional domains have not been well characterized. CRYs require FAD as a cofactor to maintain proper conformation, and FAD binding sites are present within the N-terminal conserved regions (27Hsu D.S. Zhao X. Zhao S. Kazantsev A. Wang R.P. Todo T.

Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 313: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Any deletion in the N-terminal region therefore causes complete loss of the CRY function. This interferes with the deletion analysis commonly used to determine the functional domains of a protein. We took advantage of the similarity in nucleotide/amino acid sequences and difference in transcriptional repressor activities of the repressor-type zCRY (zCRY1a) and non-repressor-type zCRY (zCRY3) to form chimeras, which allowed us to map the region responsible for transcriptional repressor activity. We identified the sequence elements required for the interaction of CRY with other clock proteins, as well as for regulation of the subcellular distribution and transcriptional repression. The findings for these chimeras show that both the nuclear localization and interaction with the CLOCK:BMAL heterodimer are essential for transcriptional repression by CRY. Plasmid Construction—Novel restriction enzyme sites were introduced within zCRY1a and -3 to prepare the zCRY1a-3 chimeras. Site-directed mutagenesis system Mutan-Super Express KM kit (Takara) was used, which included a PmaCI site at bp 375 of the cDNA encoding zCRY1a, and PmaCI at bp 375, SacI at bp 589, SalI at bp 785, and EcoRI at bp 880 of the nucleotide sequence encoding zCRY3. Synthetic oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: for PmaCI in the zCRY1a sequence, 5′-GGAGGTGATCACGTGCATCTCTCA-3′ (covering bp 366–389); for PmaCI in the zCRY3 sequence, 5′-GGAAACCGTCACGTGTAACACTCAC-3′ (covering bp 366–390); for SacI in the zCRY3 sequence, 5′-CTCTCTAGAGGAGCTCGGTTTTAGG-3′ (covering bp 589–603); for SalI in the zCRY3 sequence, 5′-TGTCATGTCGACTGTTTTACTA-3′ (covering bp 789–800); and for EcoRI in the zCRY3 sequence, 5′-GGCGGGAATTCTTCTACACG-3′ (covering bp 875–894). Each of these enzyme sites is underlined above. The zCRY1a-3 chimeras shown in Figs. 2A and 3A were generated by switching each segment between zCRY1a and -3 at the newly introduced restriction enzyme sites, the Eco52I site (at bp 1254 of the cDNA encoding zCRY1a or -3), or both. The chimeras then were ligated into pcDNA3.1(+), pcDNA-GAL4, pcDNA-VP16, or pcDNA-V5, which generated each chimera construct used.Fig. 3The zCRY1a region required for interaction with CLOCK or BMAL proteins. zCRY1a, zCRY3, or an indicated chimera (A) were tested in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (B) and by co-immunoprecipitation (C) for its ability to interact with zCLOCK1 or zBMAL3. In the mammalian two-hybrid assay, each GAL-chimeric CRY was co-expressed with VP16-zCLOCK1 or VP16-zBMAL3. Effects on transactivation of the pGL-5G reporter plasmid were assayed. Results are given as -fold activation relative to the pGL-5G reporter plasmid alone. Values are mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments. In the co-immunoprecipitation, FLAG-zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3-V5 were co-expressed in the COS7 cells. The cell extract was mixed with extract containing each singly expressed VP16-zCRY or non-tagged zCRY protein, incubated on ice for 1 h, then immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitated materials and whole cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-VP16 (zCRY1a and chimera 17), anti-zCRY3 (chimeras 11, 18, and zCRY3), anti-V5 (zB-MAL3), or anti-FLAG antibodies (zCLOCK1).

The segment encoding amino acids 265–282 of zCRY3 was amplified by the use of oligonucleotides with SalI or EcoRI then ligated into the SalI-EcoRI site of pGFP-CI, generating pGFP-zCRY3 (amino acids 265–282). The coding region of mouse Cry1 cDNA was obtained from mouse brain RNA by a reverse transcriptase-PCR then ligated into pcDNA-V5, generating pV5-mCRY1. Amino acid substitutions in mCRY1 NLS (amino acids 265–282) of mCRY1-V5 were introduced by a two-step PCR scheme that used primers encoding the mutated nucleotide. The PmaCI site was introduced at bp 375 of the nucleotide sequence encoding mCRY1 by a two-step PCR scheme, generating pV5-mCRY1 (PmaCI) and pV5-NLS-mutated mCRY1 (PmaCI). The HindIII-PmaCI fragment bearing zCRY3 (amino acids 1–125) was ligated into the corresponding sites of pV5-mCRY1 (PmaCI) and pV5-NLS-mutated mCRY1 (PmaCI), generating the zC3-mCRY1 chimeras (Fig. 7). All the constructs described were verified by sequence analysis. Other plasmids used in this study have been described elsewhere (16Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H.

Cells, Transfection, and Luciferase Assay—NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% calf serum. COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The day before transfection, both types of the cells were each plated in 12-well plates, and then were transfected the next day with 50 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, 20 ng of sea pansy luciferase reporter plasmid (pRL-SV40 (Promega)), and expression plasmids (indicated in each figure), by the use of LipofectAMINE Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). As reporter plasmids, the E-box element and its flanking sequences within the promoter/enhancer region of mouse vasopressin and five GAL4-binding sites were, respectively, cloned into the pGL-Basic vector (Promega) for the luciferase-reporter and two-hybrid assays (designated as mAVP-pGL and 5G-pGL). Total amounts of expression plasmids were adjusted by adding the pcDNA3.1 vector as the carrier. The preparation of cell lysates and the dual luciferase assays, using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega), were performed 24 h after transfection. Firefly and sea pansy luciferase activities were quantified by means of a luminometer, with the firefly luciferase activity normalized for transfection efficiency based on the sea pansy luciferase activity. All experiments were done three times. Antibodies—Polyclonal antisera against the glutathione S-transferase-fused zCRY3 C-terminal polypeptide (amino acids 506–598) were raised in rabbits. Anti-VP16 antibody was purchased from Clontech, anti-FLAG from Sigma, anti-V5 from Invitrogen, and anti-GFP from Roche Diagnostics Corp. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation was done as previously described (7Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M.

COS7 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes, and were transfected the following day with the expression plasmids described in each figure. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 24 h after transfection, homogenized in binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture tablets, and then clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g. Total protein (100 μg) from the supernatant was incubated with 15 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 4 °C, after which the material was centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with either the anti-V5 mouse antibodies (Invitrogen) or the anti-VP16 rabbit antibody, and 15 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads. The beads were then washed three times with binding buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and centrifuged. The supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting, as described below. Western Blot Analysis—Total protein (10 μg), extracted from the cells as described previously, was separated by SDS-PAGE in a 6.5% gel and transferred electrophoretically onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 7% nonfat milk and incubated with the mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), the mouse anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), the rabbit anti-zCRY3 antibody, or the rabbit anti-VP16 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Santa Cruz), and blots were developed with the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—NIH cells (3 × 105) were seeded on glass coverslips in 6-well dishes and transfected the following day (as described above) with 1 μg of total DNA per well. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed, and blocked for 30 min at 37 °C in 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The anti-V5, anti-zCRY3, or anti-VP16 antibodies were diluted in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS, and then incubated with the cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in 10% PBS, and then the cells were incubated with the fluorescein isothiocyanate- (Santa Cruz) and/or the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for1hat37 °C. After several washes, the cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the cells were mounted for fluorescence microscopy. Protein Modeling—The amino acid sequences of Escherichia coli CPD photolyase, mCRY1, zCRY1a, and zCRY3 were aligned by the use of commercially available software, GENENTYX-MAC version 8.0 (Software Development Co., Ltd.). Tertiary models of mCRY1 and zCRY1a were constructed by comparative modeling based on the structure of E. coli CPD photolyase (Protein Data Bank code 1dnp), using our original programs: a loop search method for the backbone structure (31Nakamura H. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Ikehara M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1817-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a dead-end elimination method for the side chain structure (32Tanimura R. Kidera A. Nakamura H. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2358-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and a conformation energy minimization method for structure refinement (33Morikami K. Nakai T.

Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3604) Google Scholar). The quality of the model structure was examined by the program PROCHECK (35Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and it was shown to have the quality corresponding to a crystal structure with 2.0 to 2.5-Å resolution. The atom coordinates of the model structure are available from the corresponding author when requested. Construction of Chimeric zCRYs with Exchanged zCRY1a and zCRY3 Regions—A comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of mCRY1 and zCRY1a and -3 shows that the zebrafish proteins are close structural homologs of mCRY1 (Fig. 1A). CRY protein consists of the N-terminal chromophore-binding and C-terminal extension domains, the former well conserved among all the CRY proteins, the latter having no known homology (22Todo T. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 23Cashmore A.R. Jarillo J.A. Wu Y.J. Liu D. Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar, 29Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 31-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In fact, the sequence of the former domain is highly conserved between mCRY and zCRY1a and -3 with 77–81% identity (Fig. 1A). Despite sharing a well conserved primary structure, the three CRYs differ markedly in their functional activities. zCRY1a, as well as mCRY1, represses CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription, whereas zCRY3 does not (16Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Hirayama J. Fukuda I. Ishikawa T. Kobayashi Y. Todo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the similarities between the nucleotide/amino acid sequences and the differences in transcriptional repressor activities of zCRY1a and -3 to produce zCRY1a-3 chimeras, which permitted mapping of the region responsible for transcriptional repressor activity. Alignment of the amino acid sequences of zCRY1a and -3 showed no insertion or deletion of the amino acid sequences between the N-terminal chromophore-binding domains of the two proteins (Fig. 1A), indicative of minimized disruption of the native conformation by chimera construction. To generate the chimeric constructs, restriction recognition sites were created in each cDNA clone by site-directed mutagenesis. In each mutagenesis, alterations in the nucleotide sequences were designed to minimize changes in the encoded amino acids. To determine which domain to exchange reciprocally, we constructed a structural model of zCRY1a, using the crystal structure of E. coli photolyase, a member of the DNA photolyase/Cryptochrome family, as the starting point (Fig. 1B). With this structural model as a guide and considering restrictions within the nucleotide sequence for creating new restriction enzyme sites, six zCRY1a regions were selected for reciprocal domain swaps: residues 1–125, 126–196, 197–263, 264–293, 294–419, and 420–557 (Fig. 1, A–C). As seen in Fig. 1C, zCRY1a is folded into two domains, an N-terminal α/β domain (residues 1–127) and a C-terminal helical one (residues 214–557), which are connected by a long interdomain loop (residues 128–213). The first (residues 1–125) and second (residues 126–196) regions were designed, respectively, to carry the N-terminal α/β domain and subsequent interdomain loop. The remaining 197–557 region has a helical domain that is the FAD binding site, and its primary structure is well conserved within this protein family. Initially, we planned to divide this region into three parts: residues 197–293, 294–419, and 420–557, because the amino acid sequence in 294–419 is the best conserved, whereas those in 197–293 and 420–557 have diverged to some extent (Fig. 1A). The region was further divided into two subregions, 197–263 and 264–293, to analyze the functionally important 197–293 region more precisely. As shown schematically in Fig. 2A, 19 chimeras composed of reciprocal domain swaps were generated between zCRY1a and -3. Determination of Those Sequence Elements of zCRY1a Sufficient for Transcriptional Repression—Effects of the chimeric zCRYs on zCLOCK:zBMAL-mediated transcription were examined in a luciferase reporter gene assay. As reported elsewhere (16Kobayashi Y. Ishikawa T. Hirayama J. Daiyasu H. Kanai S. Toh H. Fukuda I. Tsujimura T. Terada N. Kamei Y. Yuba S. Iwai S. Todo T. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Hirayama J. Fukuda I. Ishikawa T. Kobayashi Y. Todo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), co-expression of zCRY1a efficiently inhibits zCLOCK1:zBMAL3-mediated transcription (Fig. 2B, lane 3), whereas that of zCRY3 does not (lane 4). First, two chimera series (chimeras 1–8), in which the N- or C-terminal regions of zCRY1a were replaced sequentially by the corresponding regions of zCRY3, were tested. Two chimeras, 3 with amino acids 197–557 and 6 with 1–293 of zCRY1a, maintained transcriptional repression activity (lanes 7 and 10), whereas their reciprocals, chimeras 4 and 5, lacked that activity (lanes 8 and 9). This showed that the region between amino acids 197 and 293 of zCRY1a is necessary for transcriptional repression. In fact, chimera 9, which had amino acids 197–293 of zCRY1a, had repressor activity (lane 13), whereas its reciprocal, chimera 10, did not (lane 14). To identify precisely the critical domain, the 197–293 region was divided into two subregions, 197–263 and 264–293. Four chimeras, 11, 12, 13, and 14, carrying each region, were tested for repressor activity. Chimera 11 with the 197–263 residues of zCRY1a had activity (lane 15), whereas chimera 13 with the rest of the region (264–293) lacked it (lane 17), evidence that the 197–263 region of zCRY1a is sufficient to repress zCLOCK1:zBMAL3-mediated transcription. Consistent with this conclusion, chimera 14, with all zCRY1a sequences except the 264–293 region, which was replaced by zCRY3, had repressor activity (lane 18). Unexpectedly, chimera 12, in which the 197–263 region of zCRY1a was replaced with that of zCRY3, also had repressor activity (lane 16). This suggests that besides the 197–263 region of zCRY1a sufficient for repressor activity, a second region al"

Pentasaccharide promotes inhibition of both f.IXa and f.Xa generated in recalcified plasma. This result demonstrates that antithrombin is the predominant inhibitor of f.IXa in plasma, and that the activity of antithrombin is promoted by pentasaccharide. Kinetic experiments reveal that pentasaccharide increases the rates of antithrombin-mediated inhibition of both f.IXa and f.Xa by 2 orders of magnitude. These findings indicate that pentasaccharide-induced conformational changes in antithrombin enhance its capacity to inhibit both f.IXa and f.Xa. In the presence of Ca2+, full-length heparin produces an additional ∼10-fold increase in the rates of inhibition of both enzymes, consistent with a template role of heparin. Heparin binding to f.Xa was previously shown to be promoted in the presence of Ca2+. Binding studies with f.IXa reveal a 10-fold higher affinity for heparin in the presence of Ca2+ compared with its absence. Thus, Ca2+ promotes heparin-catalyzed inhibition of f.IXa and f.Xa by antithrombin by augmenting the template mechanism. These results indicate that heparin-mediated catalysis of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin reflects both pentasaccharide-induced conformational changes and heparin-mediated bridging of antithrombin to f.IXa. Furthermore, our data suggest that the efficacy of pentasaccharide for prevention and treatment of thrombotic disorders may reflect its action at two sites in the coagulation system.

Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 321-334Google Scholar). Binding of heparin and LMWH to antithrombin is mediated by a unique pentasaccharide sequence found on one-third of heparin chains and one-fifth of LMWH chains (2Weitz J.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 337: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar). Pentasaccharide-mediated binding of heparin or LMWH to antithrombin induces a conformational change in the reactive center loop of antithrombin that facilitates its interaction with f.Xa (3Jin L.

Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Consequently, both agents increase the rate at which antithrombin inhibits f.Xa by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude (6Lin P. Sinha U. Betz A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1526: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 7Hirsh J. Levine M.N. Blood. 1992; 79: 1-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient catalysis of thrombin inhibition by antithrombin requires a specific pentasaccharide-containing heparin chain of sufficient length to bridge antithrombin to thrombin, thereby forming a ternary heparin-thrombin-antithrombin complex (8Olson S.T.

Lormeau J.C. Herbert J.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Only heparin chains that contain at least 13 saccharide units in addition to the pentasaccharide, or a minimum molecular mass of 5400, are long enough to bridge antithrombin to thrombin (10Hoylaerts M. Owen W.G. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5670-5677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With a mean molecular mass of 5000, the majority of LMWH chains are too short to provide this bridging activity. Consequently, LMWH has reduced ability to catalyze thrombin inhibition relative to heparin. An analog of the antithrombin-binding pentasaccharide sequence in heparin or LMWH has recently been synthesized (11Herbert J.M. Herault J.P. Bernat A. Van Amsterdam R.G.M. Vogel G.M.T. Lormeau J.C. Petitou M. Meuleman D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 590-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This agent, known as fondaparinux, has been compared with LMWH for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism (12Bauer K.A. Hawkins D.W. Peters P.C. Petitou M. Herbert J.M. van Boeckel C.A.

When compared with LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in high risk orthopedic patients, fondaparinux produces a 55% reduction in the risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. More recent studies have compared fondaparinux with LMWH for treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis or with heparin for therapy of patients with pulmonary embolism. In these studies, the efficacy and safety of fondaparinux were similar to those of LMWH or heparin (16Investigators Matisse Blood. 2002; 100 (abstr.): 83aGoogle Scholar). F.IXa plays a critical role in the amplification of thrombin generation after clotting is triggered by tissue factor exposure (17Colman R.W. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Marder V.J. Colman R.W. Hirsh J.

Haemostasis. 1976; 35: 295-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analyses suggest that, like the case with thrombin, heparin accomplishes this by serving as a template onto which f.IXa and antithrombin bind. These studies have been corroborated by the identification of the heparin-binding site on f.IXa, which has been localized to a region distinct from the active site of the enzyme (26Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although kinetic analyses suggest that heparin serves as a template to catalyze f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin, the effect of heparin chain length on this reaction has not been extensively evaluated. In addition to heparin chain length, divalent cations also influence rates of protease inhibition. Ca2+ enhances the rate of f.Xa inhibition by antithrombin, presumably by inducing the exposure of a heparin-binding site on the protease, thereby allowing formation of a ternary heparin-antithrombin-f.Xa complex (27Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16824-16827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 28Rezaie A.R. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12083-12090Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrating that the binding of heparin to f.Xa is Ca2+-dependent (29Badellino K.O. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7569-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the same study, it also was determined that heparin binds to f.IXa with a Kd of 17.8 nm, but only in the presence of Ca2+. The Ca2+ dependence of the heparin-f.IXa interaction may explain why, depending on the Ca2+ concentration, previous studies reported different rates of f.IXa inactivation by the heparin-antithrombin complex (21Pieters J. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15313-15318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Pieters J. Lindhout T. Willems G. Blood. 1990; 76: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin and the role played by Ca2+. Preliminary experiments were performed in recalcified plasma to examine the effect of heparin or fondaparinux on antithrombin inhibition of f.IXa generated in situ. To establish the mechanism of heparin catalysis of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin, we compared the effects of fondaparinux or heparin on the rates of f.IXa inhibition in a buffer system in the absence and presence of Ca2+. The influence of these glycosaminoglycans on the rates of f.Xa and thrombin inhibition by antithrombin also were determined for comparative purposes. All reagents used were of analytical grade. Polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide), heparin (174 units/mg; from porcine intestinal mucosa), fluorescein isothiocyanate, and the fluorogenic substrate B-9760 (Boc-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride) were purchased from Sigma. Pefafluor 10148 (CH3SO2-(d)-cyclohexylglycine-Gly-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin acetic acid) and Pefachrome FIXa 3107 (CH3SO2-d-cyclohexylglycine-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanalide acetic acid), substrates for f.IXa, and Prionex were obtained from Centerchem Inc. (Stamford, CT). S-2765 (N-α-benzyloxycarbonyl-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanalide) was obtained from Chromogenix (Molndal, Sweden). Tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanalide was obtained from Roche Diagnostics Canada. Fondaparinux was obtained from Sanofi Recherche (Markham, ON)/Organon (Scarborough, ON). Hypersulfated LMWH (HS-LMWH) was synthesized and labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (fluorescein-HS-LMWH) as described (31Anderson J.A.M. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Guo Y.S. Hirsh J. Ghazarossian V. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9755-9761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin and factor Xa were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). Human f.IXa was obtained from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Human antithrombin was from Affinity Biologicals Inc. (Ancaster, ON). Analysis of F.II, F.IX, and F.X Activation and Subsequent Inhibition in Activated Plasma—Pooled platelet-poor plasma, collected from a minimum of 10 healthy donors, was defibrinated by the addition of Arvin (Knoll Pharma Canada) to a concentration of 0.75 units/ml (1% v/v). After 20 min, the clot was wound around a plastic spatula and removed. The plasma was stored in aliquots at –70 °C. Equal volumes of plasma and Thrombosil (Beckman, Mississauga, ON) were mixed and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, one-tenth volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TS) containing 0.01% polyethylene glycol (TSP), 6 μg/ml fondaparinux, or 6 μg/ml heparin was added to one of three tubes together with CaCl2 to a final concentration of 16 mm. Immediately after CaCl2 addition, and at time points thereafter, triplicate aliquots of 4–6 μl were removed into separate tubes containing 10 μl of SDS gel sample buffer. Samples were placed in a boiling water bath for 3 min prior to electrophoresis on three 4–15% polyacrylamide gels (Criterion, Bio-Rad). Standards containing zymogen, enzyme, and enzyme-antithrombin complex were included in each gel. After separating the proteins, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using a Transblot device, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked by incubation in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 80 (TBS-Tw) containing 5% skim milk powder for 45 min at 23 °C. After aspiration of the buffer, the membrane was incubated for 90 min with the antibody diluted in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 80. The membrane was then washed four times, for 5 min each, with TBS-Tw and then incubated with a detecting antibody. In all cases, chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies. Membranes were exposed to radiographic film for varying lengths of time and autoradiographs were scanned by densitometry (ImageMaster; Amersham Biosciences) and band densities were quantified using the instrument software. Membranes were stripped for reuse by washing for 30 min at 50 °C in 62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 70 mm mercaptoethanol. Various antibodies were used for blotting; for f.IX, the first antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody against human f.IX (Research Diagnostics Inc., Flanders, NJ), whereas the detecting antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad). For f.X, the first antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody against the light chain of human f.X (Sigma), whereas the second antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad). For f.II, the first antibody was a sheep polyclonal antibody against human thrombin (Research Diagnostics Inc.), and the second antibody was a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-sheep antibody (Sigma). Effect of Glycosaminoglycans on the Rates of F.IXa, F.Xa, and Thrombin Inhibition by Antithrombin—Rates of f.IXa, f.Xa, and thrombin inhibition by antithrombin were measured in a discontinuous assay under pseudo-first order rate conditions at 23 °C in TS buffer containing 0.5% Prionex (27Rezaie A.R.

Enzyme concentrations ranged from 1 to 500 nm and antithrombin concentrations from 10 to 3500 nm with a minimum enzyme:antithrombin ratio of 1:10 in a 20-μl reaction volume. A solution containing antithrombin and glycosaminoglycan in TSP was aliquoted into wells of a 96-well plate. At various time intervals, aliquots of enzyme were added to individual wells. All reactions were stopped simultaneously by addition of 180 μl of a solution of Polybrene (10 mg/ml) and 200–500 μm of the appropriate chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate. Chromogenic or fluorogenic assays monitoring f.IXa contained 30% ethylene glycol (33Sturzebecher J. Kopetzki E. Bode W. Hopfner K.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Residual enzyme activity was monitored in Spectra Max or Thermo Max Gemini plate readers (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). The rate of substrate cleavage (V) was determined in each well over a 5-min period by the instrument software. The pseudo-first order rate constant (k 1) was determined by plotting ln (V/V 0) versus time, where V 0 is the rate of substrate cleavage by the enzyme in the absence of antithrombin. The apparent second-order inhibition rate constant (k 2) was determined by dividing k 1 by the antithrombin concentration. Binding Experiments—The affinity of fluorescein-HS-LMWH for f.IXa was measured as previously described and competition experiments were then performed to determine the affinities of heparin and fondaparinux for f.IXa (31Anderson J.A.M. Fredenburgh J.C. Stafford A.R. Guo Y.S. Hirsh J. Ghazarossian V. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9755-9761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, the affinity of fluorescein-HS-LMWH for f.IXa was determined by monitoring fluorescence of a titration of fluorescein-HS-LMWH with f.IXa. The affinity of unlabeled heparin or fondaparinux was then measured in separate experiments where fluorescein-HS-LMWH was displaced from a fixed concentration of f.IXa by increasing concentrations of competing glycosaminoglycan. Influence of Fondaparinux and Heparin on Inhibition of Thrombin, F.IXa, and F.Xa in Activated Plasma—Plasma experiments were performed to verify f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin and to determine the extent to which the reaction was promoted by fondaparinux or heparin. For comparative purposes, the inhibition of thrombin and f.Xa was also monitored. Defibrinogenated platelet-poor plasma was recalcified and activated at 23 °C with Thrombosil, an agent that uses silica to activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, in the absence or presence of 0.6 μg/ml fondaparinux (0.33 μm) or heparin (0.04 μm). Aliquots were removed at various times and the extent of enzyme-inhibitor complex formation was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies that recognize the zymogen, activated, and antithrombin-inhibited forms of factors IX, X, or II (Fig. 1). Mobility and immunoreactivity of these forms were verified with markers prepared from purified zymogens, enzymes, and enzyme-antithrombin complexes. Membranes were scanned and the densities of individual bands were calculated as a percent of total (not shown). In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, 80% f.IX was activated over the 15-min incubation. By this time, about half of the f.IXa was in complex with antithrombin. These results confirm that antithrombin is the predominant inhibitor of f.IXa in plasma (24Fuchs H.E. Trapp H.G. Griffith M.J. Roberts H.R. Pizzo S.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1696-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Pieters J. Lindhout T. Willems G. Blood. 1990; 76: 549-554Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time course of f.IX activation was attenuated slightly in the presence of heparin or fondaparinux. With both glycosaminoglycans, formation of f.IXa-antithrombin complexes was enhanced and accelerated, with heparin demonstrating slightly better efficacy than fondaparinux. These results indicate that both heparin and fondaparinux promote f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin. In the absence of glycosaminoglycan, f.X was activated more rapidly than f.IX, with about 80% f.X activation by 5 min. Free f.Xa accumulated to a lesser extent than f.IXa. However, much of f.Xa (70%) was rapidly inhibited by antithrombin in the absence of glycosaminoglycan. Consequently, f.Xa-antithrombin complexes formed earlier than f.IXa-antithrombin complexes and there was greater inhibition of f.Xa. In the presence of heparin, activation of f.X was attenuated, with only about 50% activation after 15 min. It is likely that retarded f.X activation reflects the inhibitory effect of heparin on upstream steps in the coagulation system, including inhibition of f.IXa. In comparison to heparin, fondaparinux had less effect on the time course of f.X activation. Like heparin, however, fondaparinux reduced accumulation of free f.Xa and promoted formation of f.Xa-antithrombin complexes. Prothrombin was activated more rapidly than f.IX or f.X in the absence of glycosaminoglycan, reaching full activation by 2 min. Levels of free thrombin rapidly reached 30%, and declined to about 5% after 15 min. Free f.Xa also showed a rapid increase with subsequent decline, whereas f.IXa demonstrated a gradual increase in concentration. Heparin delayed activation of prothrombin, as expected. Heparin was more effective at promoting thrombin inhibition by antithrombin than it was at enhancing f.Xa inhibition, a finding that is consistent with inhibition rate constants. Fondaparinux had little effect on prothrombin activation or thrombin inhibition in these experiments. Heparin-catalyzed Rates of F.IXa Inhibition—To investigate the mechanism of heparin catalysis of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin, rate constants of inhibition were determined under pseudo-first order conditions in the absence or presence of fondaparinux or heparin. Use of a f.IXa fluorogenic substrate permitted sensitive determination of residual f.IXa activity in the inhibition assays (33Sturzebecher J. Kopetzki E. Bode W. Hopfner K.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the presence of 2 mm CaCl2, the plot of the second-order rate constants of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin versus heparin concentration is bell-shaped (Fig. 2A), characteristic of a template mechanism of catalysis. The uncatalyzed rate of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin, 1.34 × 104m–1 min–1, was increased up to 1210-fold by heparin to a maximum rate of inhibition of 1.62 × 107m–1 min–1 (Table I). Heparin caused a concentration-dependent increase in f.IXa inhibition in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 until the rate reached a plateau at a heparin concentration of 2 μg/ml (0.13 μm), and heparin concentrations above 200 μg/ml (13 μm) led to a decrease in k 2 values. These data support earlier studies examining the effect of heparin on f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin, which also suggested that a template mechanism was important (20Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M.

Second-order rate constants of 0.8–3 × 104 and 0.3–10 × 107m–1 min–1 for uncatalyzed and heparincatalyzed rates of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin reported in these studies are in good agreement with the values determined in the present study.Table ISecond-order rate constants (k2) of inhibition of f.IXa, f.Xa, and f.IIa by antithrombin in the absence or presence of heparin or fondaparinuxNo GAGHeparin k2Fondaparinuxm-1 min-1F.IXa1.34 ± 0.7 × 1041.62 ± 0.6 × 1071.44 ± 0.6 × 106F.Xa1.83 ± 0.2 × 1053.47 ± 0.2 × 1082.85 ± 0.3 × 107F.IIa2.89 ± 0.6 × 1057.14 ± 1.1 × 1084.82 ± 0.7 × 105 Open table in a new tab To quantify the contribution of pentasaccharide-induced conformational changes in antithrombin to its interaction with f.IXa, the effect of fondaparinux on the rates of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin was monitored. The plot of k 2 versus fondaparinux concentration indicates that fondaparinux enhances the rate of f.IXa inhibition (Fig. 2B). Whereas the plot of k 2 versus heparin concentration is bell-shaped, a similar plot of fondaparinux-catalyzed f.IXa inhibition yields a plateau, at a rate of ∼1.44 × 106m–1 min–1, with a fondaparinux concentration of 0.6 μg/ml (0.33 μm). To compare the effects of fondaparinux and heparin on the relative increases in the rate of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin, the maximum second-order rate constants of fondaparinux- and heparin-catalyzed inhibition were divided by the uncatalyzed rates of inhibition. Fondaparinux produces a maximal 107-fold increase in the rate of inhibition of f.IXa by antithrombin compared with the rate measured in the absence of glycosaminoglycan (Fig. 3). With heparin, the rate is increased 1210-fold. Thus, heparin increases the rate of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin 11-fold more than fondaparinux. In contrast to the current results, a recent study failed to show a catalytic influence of fondaparinux on antithrombin inhibition of f.IXa (34Herault J.P. Gaich C. Bono F. Driguez P.A. Duchaussoy P. Petitou M. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Methodological differences may account for these disparate results. We used a kinetic approach in the current study, whereas a single time point, measured in the absence of Ca2+, was used to quantify inhibition in the work of Herault and colleagues (34Herault J.P. Gaich C. Bono F. Driguez P.A. Duchaussoy P. Petitou M. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 88: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, we directly quantified residual f.IXa activity by fluorogenic assay, whereas an indirect tenase system was used in the previous publication. Another study, using methods similar to ours, demonstrates pentasaccharide-mediated stimulation comparable with that reported here (26Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Rates of F.Xa and Thrombin Inhibition by Antithrombin— Because the mechanisms by which heparin catalyzes the inhibition of f.Xa and thrombin by antithrombin are distinct, inhibition studies of these two enzymes were performed for comparison purposes. In the presence of 2 mm CaCl2, heparin produced a 1900-fold increase in the rate of f.Xa inhibition by antithrombin (from 1.83 × 105m–1 min–1 to 3.47 × 108m–1 min–1) (Fig. 2; Table I). The k 2 value continued to increase as a function of heparin concentration until a plateau was reached at a heparin concentration of ∼6 μg/ml (0.4 μm). Heparin concentrations over 200 μg/ml (13 μm) caused dose-dependent decreases in the rate of f.Xa inhibition by antithrombin (Fig. 2A). When the rate of f.Xa inhibition by antithrombin is plotted versus fondaparinux concentration, there is a concentration-dependent increase until a plateau of 2.85 × 107m–1 min–1 is reached with a fondaparinux concentration of 0.6 μg/ml (0.33 μm) (Fig. 2B). The effect of fondaparinux on the rate of f.Xa inhibition by antithrombin was similar to its effect on the rate of f.IXa inhibition (Fig. 3), with maximum stimulation of 156- and 107-fold, respectively. Like f.IXa, the rate of f.Xa inhibition by antithrombin is 11–12-fold higher with heparin than with fondaparinux (Fig. 3). These values are in agreement with earlier reports demonstrating that the rates of f.Xa inhibition with heparin are higher than those with pentasaccharide (8Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A.

The plots of the second-order rate constants of f.IXa and f.Xa inhibition by antithrombin versus fondaparinux concentration both reach a plateau. However, the approximate 10-fold lower basal rate of inhibition of f.IXa versus f.Xa in the absence of a glycosaminoglycan is maintained in the presence of fondaparinux. The results presented here suggest that the mechanism of heparin-induced catalysis of f.IXa inhibition by antithrombin closely resembles that for f.Xa. In both cases, pentasaccharide-induced conformational changes in antithrombin enhance the reactivity of the serpin with the target protease. However, Ca2+-dependent bridging by longer heparin chains produces"

Several collagenous transmembrane proteins have been found to harbor a conserved sequence next to their membrane-spanning regions, and in the case of type XIII collagen this sequence has been demonstrated to be important for chain association. We show here that this 21-residue sequence is necessary but not sufficient for NC1 association. Furthermore, the NC1 association region was predicted to form an α-helical coiled-coil structure, which may already begin at the membrane-spanning region, as is also predicted for the related collagen types XXIII and XXV. Interestingly, a second coiled-coil structure is predicted to be located in the NC3 domain of type XIII collagen and in the corresponding domains of types XXIII and XXV. It is found experimentally that the absence of the NC1 coiled-coil domain leads to a lack of disulfide-bonded trimers and misfolding of the membrane-proximal collagenous domain COL1, whereas the COL2 and COL3 domains are correctly folded. We suggest that the NC1 coiled-coil domain is important for association of the N-terminal part of the type XIII collagen α chains, whereas the NC3 coiled-coil domain is implicated in the association of the C-terminal part of the molecule. All in all, we propose that two widely separated coiled-coil domains of type XIII and related collagens function as independent oligomerization domains participating in the folding of distinct areas of the molecule.

Type XIII collagen is a type II transmembrane protein that is expressed in many tissues throughout development and adult life (1Sund M. Väisänen T. Kaukinen S. Ilves M. Tu H. Autio-Harmainen H.

It is located in focal adhesions of cultured fibroblasts and other cells and in adhesive structures of tissues such as the myotendinous junctions in muscle, intercalated discs in heart, and the cell basement membrane interphases (1Sund M.

Due to its location at the tissue and cell level and its binding properties, it has been postulated that type XIII collagen is involved in cellular adhesion and migration.Type XIII collagen α chains produced in a recombinant insect cell culture system have been shown to form homotrimers (6Snellman A. Keränen M.R. Hägg P.O. Lamberg A. Hiltunen J.K. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8936-8944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The primary structure is composed of three collagenous domains (COL1 1The abbreviations used are: COL, collagenous domain; NC, non-collagenous domain; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; 4PH, prolyl 4-hydroxylase; MSRs, macrophage scavenger receptors; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SRCL, scavenger receptor with C-type lectin.1The abbreviations used are: COL, collagenous domain; NC, non-collagenous domain; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; 4PH, prolyl 4-hydroxylase; MSRs, macrophage scavenger receptors; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; SRCL, scavenger receptor with C-type lectin. to COL3), which are flanked and interrupted by non-collagenous domains (NC1 to NC4). The short cytosolic domain and the transmembrane domain encompass about half of the NC1 domain, whereas the rest of the molecule forms the ectodomain, which is a rod of about 150 nm with two flexible hinges coinciding with the NC2 and NC3 domains (5Tu H.

It has been shown recently that extracellular sequences adjacent to the transmembrane domain are important for the association of type XIII collagen into trimeric molecules (4Snellman A. Tu H.

It appears that triple helix formation proceeds in the opposite orientation than for the fibrillar collagens, i.e. from the N terminus to the C terminus. Because type XIII collagen does not contain a signal sequence, its translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum has been thought to be mediated by the transmembrane domain sequences, residues 37–59 in the mouse and 39–61 in man (11Hägg P.

Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 206-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).By using homologous gene targeting, we have previously generated a mouse line, Col13a1 N/N, expressing modified type XIII collagen that lacks the extreme 96 N-terminal residues, including the cytosolic, transmembrane, and association domains, which are replaced by unique sequences not found in any other protein (13Kvist A.P.

Analysis of tissues and cultured cells derived from homozygous Col13a1 N/N mice has shown that the altered type XIII collagen molecules are transported to roughly the correct location despite the lack of a transmembrane domain. Expression of the N-terminally altered type XIII collagen molecules results in changes in muscle integrity in the gene-targeted mice, including abnormalities in the sarcolemma-basement membrane interphase. Immunoelectron microscopy has indicated that the mutant molecules are situated in the adjacent extracellular space, whereas wild-type type XIII collagen molecules are adherent to the plasma membrane. Moreover, cells extracted from the mutant mice showed decreased adhesiveness to the basement membrane component type IV collagen.Studies with the Col13a1 N/N mice have revealed a role for the N terminus of type XIII collagen in anchoring muscle cells to the basement membrane. Nevertheless, the mutant molecules were secreted, and they may retain intact some aspects of their functional properties. This prompted us to study the molecular properties of the N-terminally altered type XIII collagen. The amount of type XIII collagen in tissues is very low, and thus insect cell expression was used to obtain sufficient protein for these studies. A series of N-terminal variants was tested for their ability to form stable disulfide-bonded type XIII collagen molecules. The data led us to search for other regions in addition to the NC1 domain that may be important for chain association and stability in type XIII collagen and other collagenous transmembrane and non-transmembrane proteins.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Expression Vectors and Generation of Recombinant Baculoviruses—Human type XIII collagen variant del1–38 and del1–83 viruses have been described previously (6Snellman A.

Viruses coding for the various type XIII collagen variants were used at m.o.i. 5 together with the virus coding for both subunits of human prolyl 4-hydroxylase (4PHαβ) (19Nokelainen M. Helaakoski T.

For infection, insect cells were seeded on plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2. As a control, cells were infected with the prolyl 4-hydroxylase virus alone. Fresh ascorbate phosphate (80 μg/ml, Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.) was added to the infected cells daily.The cells were detached 48 h post-infection by gently pipeting with the medium. The cells were collected by centrifuging at 340 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and the medium was supplemented with 2 mm EDTA or Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture (Roche Applied Science) to prevent proteolytic cleavage. The cells were washed with PBS and collected as described previously. They were then homogenized in 67 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 267 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture and incubated for 30 min on ice. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant was recovered, and the precipitate was dissolved in 1% SDS. Samples of the different fractions were analyzed by denaturing SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions. The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-human type XIII polyclonal antibody XIII/NC3-1 (11Hägg P. Rehn M. Huhtala P. Väisänen T. Tamminen M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol.

The percentage of secreted protein was estimated by scanning densitometry using the Quantity One Quantitation software (Bio-Rad).Pepsin Digestions of Recombinant Proteins—Cell lysate supernatants not supplemented with any protease inhibitor were digested with 0.1–0.15 mg/ml pepsin (Roche Applied Science) for 2–5 min at room temperature.

Braun Biotech) with 130 rpm horizontal agitation at 27 °C. The High Five cells were co-infected at a density of 1 × 106/ml with the virus encoding mouse XIIIN-short at m.o.i. 5 and with the virus 4PHαβ at m.o.i. 1. Once they were infected, ascorbate phosphate (80 μg/ml) was added to the culture medium daily. 500 ml of cell culture medium was separated from the cells 48 h post-infection by centrifuging at 340 × g for 10 min at room temperature, and 2 mm EDTA was added, after which the medium was further centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to remove the debris and viruses. The medium was then applied to a Resource S 6-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted using a gradient program on ÄKTA explorer 10 (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using the antibody XIII/NC3-1, and those containing XIIIN-short protein were concentrated to 1 ml and purified on a Sephacryl S-500 column (1.6 × 100 cm, Amersham Biosciences) using 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.15 m NaCl. The relevant fractions were then concentrated to 0.5 μg/μl (total protein), and about 10 μg of total protein was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions and electroblotted onto a ProBlott™ membrane (Applied Biosystems), which was stained with Serva Blue R (Serva). The authenticity of the XIIIN-short protein was confirmed by N-terminal protein sequencing using a 492 Procise™ protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems).40 μg of partly purified XIIIN-short protein was digested with 0.8 μgof pepsin (50:1 w/w) for 2 min at room temperature. The digestion products were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a ProBlott™ membrane for N-terminal protein sequencing analysis.For the sequencing of XIIIN-long proteins in the cell lysate, infected insect cells from a 100-ml suspension culture were harvested after 48 h of infection by centrifuging at 340 × g for 10 min at room temperature. They were then washed with 10 ml of PBS twice, homogenized with 10 ml of PBS, and incubated for 30 min on ice. The debris and insoluble molecules were removed by centrifugation at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. The supernatant of the cell lysate was separated out in steps using a HiTrap Q 5-ml column (Amersham Biosciences), by increasing the concentration of NaCl in the PBS buffer. The fractions containing XIIIN-long were concentrated to 0.5 ml and subsequently precipitated with 75% cold ethanol for 30 min. The ethanol precipitates were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, applied to SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted onto a ProBlott™ membrane for N-terminal protein sequencing analysis.For the sequencing of XIIIN-long proteins in medium, the medium sample described above was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C to remove the virus and small debris and then loaded onto a HiTrap Q 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm MES, 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 6.0, at 0.5 ml/min, followed by step-by-step elution with the same buffer containing 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1 m NaCl, respectively. All the fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using the antibody XIII/NC3-1. The fractions containing XIIIN-long protein were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a Resource Q 1-ml column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer at 0.5 ml/min at 4 °C. The elution was performed by means of a programmed gradient with ÄKTA Explorer 10 starting from 0.15 to 1.0 m NaCl in the 20 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, buffer for a 20-column volume. The elution fractions containing the XIIIN-long protein were concentrated to 1 ml and further separated by Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) in ÄKTA Explorer 10 with 20 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.0. The fractions containing XIIIN-long protein were concentrated and applied to the SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting onto a ProBlott™ membrane for N-terminal protein sequencing analysis.Amino Acid Sequence Analysis and Secondary Structure Prediction— Sequence alignment of collagen types XIII, XXIII, XXV, and XXVI was performed using the ClustalW method (20Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55190) Google Scholar) and compiled into a figure using BOXSHADE (ch.EMBnet.org). Coiled-coil predictions for collagen types XIII, XVII, XXIII, XXV, XXVI, MARCO, and EDA were made using the COILS program (version 2.1 (21Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar)). The GenBank™ data base accession numbers for collagen types XIII, XVII, XXV, XXVI, MARCO, and EDA are AJ293624, NM_000494, AF293340, AB085837, NM_006770, and NM_001399, respectively. The positions of the heptad repeats in the NC1 and NC3 domain of type XIII collagen were predicted according to the COILS program.RESULTSSecretion of Type XIII Collagen Molecules Expressed in Insect Cells—The type XIII collagen molecules synthesized by the Col13a1 N/N mice lacked the cytosolic, transmembrane, and association domains (the 96 extreme N-terminal residues encoded by exon 1) but retained the large collagenous ectodomain. Surprisingly, these molecules were located in association with adherence structures apparently secreted into the pericellular matrix, and they were correctly located in focal adhesions in cultured cells derived from these mice (13Kvist A.P. Latvanlehto A. Sund M. Eklund L. Väisänen T. Hägg P. Sormunen R. Komulainen J. Fässler R. Pihlajaniemi T. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1581-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To test the effect of the altered N terminus on association and folding of the mutant α1(XIII) chains, we prepared recombinant DNA expression constructs encoding identically altered mouse α1(XIII) chains (Fig. 1), the deleted N-terminal sequences in the Col13a1 N/N mice being replaced by either 65 or 11 residues of sequences unique to the mutant α1(XIII) chains depending on which of the two potential new translation initiation sites was used. Consequently, two constructs were prepared, namely XIIIN-long and XIIIN-short, corresponding to full-length α1(XIII) chains from residue 97 onwards and preceded by the longer or shorter mutant N termini (Fig. 1A). The del1–38 variant lacks the cytosolic domain but corresponds to full-length human α1(XIII) chains in terms of chain association and folding, and this was used as a control on account of its superior expression levels relative to full-length human and mouse α chains (Fig. 1B (6Snellman A. Keränen M.R. Hägg P.O. Lamberg A. Hiltunen J.K. Kivirikko K.I. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8936-8944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). In addition, constructs del1–61 and del1–83 were prepared, encoding human α1(XIII) chains lacking either the first 61 or 83 residues, respectively (Fig. 1B). In each case insect cells were infected with viruses encoding α1(XIII) and prolyl 4-hydroxylase (4PHαβ), the latter being necessary in order to obtain hydroxylated recombinant collagen chains when using insect cells as hosts (22Lamberg A. Helaakoski T. Myllyharju J. Peltonen S. Notbohm H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11988-11995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Proteins were extracted from infected insect cells by homogenizing the cells in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and the remaining precipitates were solubilized in 1% SDS. The volumes of the cell and medium fractions were adjusted to correspond to the same cell number, and the samples were fractionated on denaturing SDS-PAGE gels under reducing or non-reducing conditions and analyzed by Western blotting. Because the SDS fractions contained only minimal amounts of protein, these were excluded from the final pictures, which contain only the Triton X-100 cellular fractions and medium samples for each variant (Fig. 2). It has been shown previously that about half of the del1–38 α1(XIII) chains are secreted into the medium through proteolytic cleavage by one or more furin-type proteases when cultured in medium supplemented with serum (4Snellman A. Tu H. Väisänen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5051-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). A furin consensus sequence can be found at amino acid residues 105–108 in human type XIII collagen (under GenBank™ data base accession number CAC00688 (4Snellman A. Tu H. Väisänen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P. Pihlajaniemi T.

Here we used serum-free medium, and only about 10% of the del1–38 protein was secreted (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2), possibly because of a decrease in proprotease activators in the medium. Similar or slightly higher portions of the protein, namely about 50% for XIIIN-short, 15% for XIIIN-long, 40% for del1–61, and 15% for del1–83, were found to be secreted (Fig. 2B, lanes 3–10).Fig. 2Western blotting analysis of expressed recombinant proteins in cell and medium fractions under reducing or non-reducing conditions. Cells were infected with viruses coding for various type XIII collagen variants together with a virus encoding both prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunits. Medium samples were collected 48 h post-infection, and proteins were extracted from the cells with a buffer containing Triton X-100. Proteins analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions are shown in A and by 5% SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions are shown in B. The samples for both panels were derived from cells infected with viruses coding for del1–38 (lanes 1 and 2), XIIIN-short (lanes 3 and 4), XIIIN-long (lanes 5 and 6), del1–61 (lanes 7 and 8), and del1–83 (lanes 9 and 10) and extracted with a buffer containing Triton X-100 (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9), or else the medium proportioned to the cell number (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10).

This difference is known to reflect the high imino acid content of collagens in addition to post-translational modification of the polypeptides (23Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 41: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar).

Our previous work indicated that this association might be due to the heme content of red meat. In rat studies, dietary heme increased colonic cytotoxicity and epithelial cell turnover, carcinogenesis biomarkers. Here we apply DNA microarray technology to examine effects of heme on colonic gene expression. A rat colon-specific microarray was constructed and hybridized in duplicate to RNA extracts from colon scrapings of rats fed diets with or without heme (n=6-7). We were able to reproducibly identify changes in colonic mRNA abundance in response to heme. Most striking was a >10-fold down-regulation of a single rat gene, an unprecedented gene-modulating effect of a dietary component. Based on homology, the novel gene encodes a pentraxin, the first identified in colon. Pentraxins are postulated to be involved in dealing with dying cells. Quantitative PCR confirmed the strong heme-induced down-regulation of this gene, which we named mucosal pentraxin (Mptx). Overall, our data support the efficacy of cDNA array expression profiling to investigate effects of specific nutrients in an in vivo system and may provide an approach to establishing markers for diet-induced stress of mammalian colonic mucosa."

Previous results showed endostatin/collagen XVIII labeling in few endothelial cells in human glioblastoma multiforme. We have now observed constitutive release of endostatin from one of four endothelial cell lines. Induction of endostatin release was observed after H2O2, an in vitro model of cell stress, CoCl2, a model of hypoxia, and by IFN-gamma challenge. Endostatin expression and release was reduced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors aminoguanidine and L-NAME and induced by the NO synthase-independent NO donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and spermine-NONO-ate. SNP-mediated endostatin induction was abrogated by the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1.2.4) oxadiazolo (4,3-A) quinoxalin-1-one. Adenoviral endostatin transduction resulted in the release of endostatin from endothelial cells and in down-regulation of iNOS (NOS2) and eNOS (NOS3), and surprisingly in a 10% induction of PCNA. These results describe the modulation of endostatin release by the NO signaling cascade and provide important new pharmacological information for the systemic induction of endogenous endostatin release by common NO donor pharmacotherapy."

https://openalex.org/W1963732943,"Double-strand DNA breaks are the most lethal type of DNA damage induced by ionizing radiations. Previously, we reported that double-strand DNA breaks can be enzymatically produced from two DNA damages located on opposite DNA strands 18 or 30 base pairs apart in a cell-free double-strand DNA break formation assay (Vispé, S., and Satoh, M. S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 27386–27392). In the assay that we developed, these two DNA damages are converted into single-strand interruptions by enzymes involved in base excision repair. We showed that these single-strand interruptions are converted into double-strand DNA breaks; however, it was not due to spontaneous denaturation of DNA. Thus, we proposed a model in which DNA polymerase δ/ϵ, by producing repair patches at single-strand interruptions, collide, resulting in double-strand DNA break formation. We tested the model and investigated whether other enzymes/factors are involved in double-strand DNA break formation. Here we report that, instead of DNA polymerase δ/ϵ, flap endonuclease-1 (FEN-1), an enzyme involved in base excision repair, is responsible for the formation of double-strand DNA break in the assay. Furthermore, by transfecting a flap endonuclease-1 expression construct into cells, thus altering their flap endonuclease-1 content, we found an increased number of double-strand DNA breaks after γ-ray irradiation of these cells. These results suggest that flap endonuclease-1 acts as a double-strand DNA break formation factor. Because FEN-1 is an essential enzyme that plays its roles in DNA repair and DNA replication, DSBs may be produced in cells as by-products of the activity of FEN-1.

Energy deposition by these forms of ionizing radiations in water results in production of multiple radical pairs (3Brenner D.J. Ward J.F. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1992; 61: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). When this energy deposition occurs in close proximity to DNA, multiple damages are produced, often within a short stretch of DNA, resulting in the formation of DNA damage clusters (2Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Such energy deposition results in production of various types of damages, including oxidized DNA bases and single-strand DNA breaks (1von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis, London1987Google Scholar, 4Boudaiffa B. Cloutier P. Hunting D. Huels M.A. Sanche L. Science. 2000; 287: 1658-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar). If two single-strand DNA breaks are produced on opposite DNA strands within a few bases, DNA can be denatured spontaneously and thus converted into DSBs (1von Sonntag C. The Chemical Basis of Radiation Biology. Taylor & Francis, London1987Google Scholar). Alternatively, if two oxidized DNA bases are produced on opposite DNA strands a few bases apart, these damaged bases are converted into single-strand interruptions (SSIs) by base excision repair (BER) enzymes (5Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar, 6Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar); DNA glycosylases remove the oxidized DNA bases, leading to the formation of apyrimidinic/apurinic (AP) sites (5Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4347) Google Scholar, 6Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and then such sites are incised by AP-endonucleases (6Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Two closely spaced SSIs on opposite DNA strands are thus produced by this mechanism, resulting in spontaneous denaturation of DNA (7Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 914-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 8Chaudhry M.A. Weinfeld M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15650-15655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). If the denaturation temperature of the sequence between the two DNA damages is over 37 °C (12 base pairs apart, assuming a GC content of 50%), the induction of SSIs at the sites of DNA damage, however, cannot produce DSB through spontaneous denaturation. Using a model substrate DNA and the cell-free DSB formation assay we developed, we previously demonstrated that two DNA damages produced on opposite DNA strands can be converted into DSBs even when the denaturation temperature of the intervening sequence is over 37 °C (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This conversion is associated with long repair patch formation, which is mediated by BER enzymes. At the sites of SSIs produced by BER enzymes, DNA polymerase δ/ϵ (pol δ/ϵ) and DNA ligase I (lig I) can produce repair patches over 2 nucleotides in length (a long repair patch) (10Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar, 11Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). During the synthesis of a long repair patch, the DNA strand is cleaved from the 5′ termini (11Klungland A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3341-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). A 5′–3′ exonuclease activity of flap endonuclease (FEN-1) is involved in this cleavage (12Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). In the cell-free DSB formation assay, circular substrate DNA is expected to be linearized when DSBs are produced between two DNA damages. With extracts prepared from MRC5 cells, which are normal fibroblasts that mainly produce short repair patches, some DSB formation was observed. However, when 46BR cell extracts, which produce long repair patches due to an abnormality in lig I (13Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E. Lehmann A.R. Webster A.D. Lindahl T. Cell. 1992; 69: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), were employed, more DSBs were observed. Thus, these results suggest that the amount of DSBs produced is correlated with the size of the repair patches. Based on these observations, we proposed that enzymes involved in long repair patch formation collide between two DNA damages, resulting in DSB formation (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if DSBs are produced by this mechanism, two distantly formed DNA damages located on opposite DNA strands can be converted into DSBs, as repair patches of over 40 bases are found in vivo (2Ward J.F. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 95-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 14Cleaver J.E. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 1163-1169PubMed Google Scholar, 15Walker I.G. Th'ng J.P. Schrader T.J. Norry T.W. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1984; 62: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because long repair patches are produced by pol δ/ϵ, we previously proposed that collision of pol δ/ϵ between two DNA damages was responsible for DSB formation. However, here we report that FEN-1 is actually involved in the productions of DSBs. Our results suggest that FEN-1 initiates DNA strand cleavage from two SSIs produced on opposite DNA strands, thus lowering the denaturation temperature of the intervening sequence. When the denaturation temperature falls below 37 °C, the DNA strands separate and a DSB is produced. In addition, cells with a higher FEN-1 content produced more DSBs after exposure to γ-rays. Thus, based on these results, we conclude that FEN-1 has an activity to produce DSBs both in vitro and in vivo. Because FEN-1 is an essential enzyme that plays its roles in DNA repair and DNA replication (16Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DSBs may be produced in cells as by-products of the activity of FEN-1. Preparation of Substrate DNA—P1U and P2U18 DNA were prepared as described previously (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Irradiated DNA was prepared by exposure of pBluescript K/S+ (3.4 mg/ml) in 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA to 100 Gy of γ-rays (Co60, dose rate: 0.51 Gy/min, Gamma Cell 220, Atomic Energy of Canada). After irradiation, nicked circular DNA produced due to the formation of SSIs, and linearized DNA was removed by ethidium bromide (EtBr)-CsCl centrifugation (21Satoh M.S. Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6335-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and the remaining closed circular DNA was used for cell-free DSB formation assay. Cell-free DSB Formation Assay—Cell-free DSB formation assay was carried out as described previously (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, either P1U, P2U18, or closed circular pBluescript K/S+ irradiated with 100 Gy of γ-rays (160 ng) was incubated with cell-free extracts (50 μg) prepared from either 46BR or MRC5 fibroblasts (European Collection of Cell Cultures) in a total volume of 50 μl of reaction mixture at 30 °C for 2 h. For neutralization of FEN-1 activity, extracts were pre-incubated with anti-FEN-1 polyclonal rabbit antibody (22Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1344-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) for 30 min at 0 °C. In some reactions, [α-32P]ATP (4 μCi/ml) was included. After the reaction, DNA was purified and fractionated on an EtBr-1% agarose gel to separate covalently closed circular, open circular, and linear DNA. The gel was exposed to UV to visualize the DNA. Then, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film to determine the amount of [α-32P]dAMP incorporated into the DNA. Analysis of DNA Fragments by Sequencing-Gel Electrophoresis— Linearized DNA by DSB formation from the cell-free DSB formation assay with 46BR cell extracts (50 μg) was extracted from the agarose gel using Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The DNA was then incubated with [γ-32P]ATP together with T4 polynucleotide kinase to label the 5′ ends. After ethanol precipitation of the DNA fragment, labeled DNA was digested with either SacI or NlaIII. Alternatively, linearized DNA was incubated with [α-32P]ddATP with terminal transferase to label the 3′ ends. After precipitation of the DNA by ethanol, DNA was digested with either SacI or NlaIII. These digested DNA fragments were denatured, and then separated by 8.5% polyacrylamide sequencing-gel electrophoresis. To prepare the size markers, sequencing reactions were carried out with a primer hybridized to the SacI site (5′-GAGGCGGCCGCCACCGCGGTGG-3′) or to the NlaIII site (5′-GTTAATTCCGAGCTTGGCGTAATCATG-3′) of P2U18. The gel was dried, and 32P activity was visualized by autoradiography. Recombinant Enzymes—Lig I and DNA ligase III cDNAs, cloned into pET11a (pET11a/L1) and pET16b (pET16b/L3), respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. T. Lindahl. pET3228D/PCNA, which contains the PCNA cDNA, was provided by Dr. Y Matsumoto. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pET11a/L1, and HMS174 (DE3) pLysS was transformed with pET16b/L3 and pET3228D/PCNA. The expression of recombinant DNA ligases and PCNA were induced using 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and 1 liter of culture was spun down at 3500 × g for 10 min 3 h later. The pellet was washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Purification of recombinant lig I from the E. coli pellet was carried out essentially following the method of Mackenney et al. (23Mackenney V.J. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11550-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recombinant DNA ligase III and PCNA were extracted from E. coli pellets by sonication after resuspension in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 2 m NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (WB buffer), containing 10 mm imidazole. After 30 min of centrifugation at 35,000 × g, the supernatant was used for purification. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (1 ml, Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with WB buffer containing 10 mm imidazole was added to the lysate and gently mixed for 30 min at 4 °C. The resin was then washed with WB buffer containing 1 mm imidazole until the absorbance at OD280 nm fell below 0.1 and with WB buffer containing 20 mm imidazole until the absorbance fell below 0.05. Bound enzymes were eluted with WB buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluate was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. The activity of the resulting DNA ligases was determined using T4 DNA ligase (Amersham Biosciences) as a standard and expressed in Weiss units. The expression construct of recombinant FEN-1 was obtained from R. Savva and L. Pearl (Department of Crystallography, Birkbeck College, London, UK) and used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3). Induction and extraction of recombinant FEN-1 was carried out as described above. E. coli lysate was then applied onto SP-Sepharose column preequilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer FE). After washing the column with 10 volumes of buffer A, proteins were eluted on a linear gradient from 0 to 1.6 m NaCl over 5 column volumes. Positive fractions were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentration of NaCl in the positive fractions was then brought up to 1 m, and the fractions were applied to a Superdex-75 gel filtration column preequilibrated with 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After elution of the proteins, the positive fractions were determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. FEN-1 Assay—FEN-1 assay was carried out following the method of Harrington and Lieber (12Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, a flap substrate was prepared by annealing three oligonucleotides: 5′-CGTGGTACCT GGGGTCCGGA GGGCATCTTA CCATGGCCGC CTAGGCCGAA TTCCC-3′ (base strand), 5′-GGGAATTGGC CTAGGCGGCC ATGGTAAGAT G-3′ (adjacent strand), and 32P-5′-CTAGGCCTCG CCCTCCGGAC CCCAGGTAC CACG-3′ (flap strand). The reactions were carried out using the same conditions as for the cell-free DSB formation assay with the addition of 1 pmol of flap substrate and 2 μg of salmon sperm DNA. After termination of the reactions by addition of 1% SDS and 250 μg/ml proteinase K, DNA was purified, denatured, and fractionated on 10% polyacrylamide-8 m urea gel. The dried gel was used for autoradiography to visualize 32P-labeled DNA. Western Blotting—Western blotting of FEN-1 was carried out with an anti-FEN-1 antibody (N-17) (100-fold dilution) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Separation of Cells Transfected with the Expression Construct of FEN-1—FEN-1 mammalian expression construct (0.05 μg, pcDNA 3.1-/GS/FEN-1, ResGene), pMACS KK.II (2.2 μg, Miltenyi Biotec), containing a genetically modified mouse H-2KK cDNA, and pBluescript K/S+ (4.25 μg) were mixed with 19.5 μl of Tfx-20 (Promega) and 5.2 ml of serum-free DMEM. As a control, pBluescript K/S+ (2.25 μg) was transfected. After 15 min of incubation at room temperature, the mixture was added to a 10-cm cell culture dish containing HeLa S3 or MO59J (American Type Culture Collection) cells at 80% confluence. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, then 25 ml of complete DMEM was added, and the cells were cultured for another 24 h. The cells were then harvested with trypsin-EDTA and resuspended in complete DMEM, and 1 × 107 cells were centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 300 μl of complete DMEM and mixed with 40 μl of colloidal superparamagnetic microbeads coated with anti-H-2KK antibody (MACSelect KK MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec)). To allow the H-2KK-expressing cells to bind to the beads, the suspension was gently mixed for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of 1660 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 5 mm EDTA (PBE). An MS column (Miltenyi Biotec), held by a magnet, was pre-equilibrated with 500 μl of PBE. Cells were then loaded onto the column and washed four times with 500 μl of PBE. Magnetically retained cells were eluted with 1 ml of PBE after removing the magnet. Constant-field Gel Electrophoresis—The separated cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of [2-14C]thymidine (0.01 μCi/ml for HeLa S3 cells and 0.31 μCi/ml for MO59J cells). Cells were exposed to γ-rays on ice (Co60, dose rate: 0.51 Gy/min, Gamma Cell 220, Atomic Energy of Canada). Then, cells were cultured for various periods at 37 °C. Constant-field gel electrophoresis was carried out essentially according to a reported method (24Wlodek D. Banath J. Olive P.L. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1991; 60: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, after embedding 1 × 105 cells into a 0.8% agarose plug (1 × 10 × 5 mm) containing phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed with 1% SDS and proteinase K (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 16 h. The agarose plugs were then soaked in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA for 2 h and then embedded into a 0.8% agarose gel containing 0.5 × TBE. Electrophoresis was carried out for 72 h at 0.6 V/cm with buffer circulation. DNA was released from the plug as a single band due to DSB formation (24Wlodek D. Banath J. Olive P.L. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1991; 60: 779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After staining the DNA with SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes), the gel was sliced. The gel slices were melted in liquid scintillation vials with 1 ml of water, then liquid scintillation mixture (Amersham Biosciences) was added. The 14C activity in both the agarose plug and released DNA was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The percentage of DNA released was calculated as 14C activity in released DNA/(14C activity in plug + 14C activity in released DNA). Inhibition of pol δ/ϵ—We have previously developed a DSB formation assay based on a cell-free assay (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used for the study of BER (25Satoh M.S. Lindahl T. Nature. 1992; 356: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Our assay uses whole cell-free extracts and a defined substrate: a closed circular DNA construct containing two uracils on opposite DNA strands (Fig. 1A). The whole cell-free extracts contain uracil DNA glycosylase, which removes the uracils, leaving AP sites. These sites can then be cleaved by AP-endonuclease, producing two SSIs (Fig. 1A). For P2U18, which contains two uracils on opposite DNA strand 18 base pairs apart (the uracils are designated as U1 and U2), the denaturation temperature of the intervening sequence is 62 °C, and the formation of two SSIs at the uracil sites does not cause linearization of P2U18 by spontaneous denaturation (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, incised P2U18 can only be linearized by enzymatic formation of DSBs (Fig. 1A) (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this assay, we previously observed that 46BR cell extracts, which produce long repair patches (over two nucleotides in length) due to an abnormality in lig I (13Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E. Lehmann A.R. Webster A.D. Lindahl T. Cell. 1992; 69: 495-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), generated more linearized P2U18 than extracts prepared from MRC5 cells (normal fibroblasts), which mainly produce short repair patches (Ref. 9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and see Fig. 1B, EtBr, lane 5 versus lane 7). However, such DSB formation was not observed when P1U, which contains one uracil residue, was used (Ref. 9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and see Fig. 1B, EtBr, lane 3 versus lane 7), suggesting that two DNA damages are required for the DSB formation. We proposed that the collision of enzymes involved in long repair patch synthesis initiated at those two SSIs converts these two damages into a DSB (Fig. 1A). pol δ/ϵ were potential candidates for the enzymatic production of DSBs, as they both mediate long patch BER. Thus, to investigate the molecular mechanism of DSB formation, we first tested the effect of aphidicolin, an inhibitor of pol δ/ϵ, on DSB formation. As shown in Fig. 1B (autoradiography), aphidicolin inhibited incorporation of [α-32P]dAMP into DNA, suggesting that DNA strand synthesis by pol δ/ϵ was inhibited by aphidicolin. However, linearization of P2U18 by 46BR cell extracts due to DSB formation was not inhibited (Fig. 1B, lane 7 versus lane 8 and C). Instead, we found an increased amount of DSBs in DSB formation assay with MRC5 cell extracts and aphidicolin (Fig. 1B, lane 5 versus lane 6 and C). Thus, these results suggest that DSBs are not produced by collision of pol δ/ϵ, but, on the contrary, that pol δ/ϵ have an inhibitory effect on DSB formation. DSB End Structure—To identify other potential enzymes involved in DSB formation, the DSB end structures were analyzed. Linearized P2U18 produced by 46BR cell extracts was 32P-labeled at either the 3′ or 5′ end (Fig. 2A) and was digested with either SacI or NlaIII. The resulting fragments were denatured, and their lengths were determined by sequencing-gel electrophoresis. The expected length of Fragment 1 from the SacI site to the SSI at the first uracil (U1) is 84 bases. If DNA polymerization occurs from the SSIs, the length of this fragment is expected to increase. However, as shown in Fig. 2B, the majority of Fragment 1 was 84 bases in length (85 bases on the gel due to ddAMP labeling), suggesting that no DNA synthesis occurred on this fragment. A one-base extension occurred on remaining Fragment 1 (85 bases in length (86 bases on the gel)), although one base extension is unlikely to be sufficient to reduce the denaturation temperature of the intervening sequence below 37 °C to produce DSBs. We also did not find any increase in the length of Fragment 3; its expected length from NlaIII to the second uracil (U2) is 55 bases (56 bases on the gel) (Fig. 2C). Thus, the lack of DNA elongation on the majority of Fragments 1 and 3 suggests that DNA polymerization has no major role in DSB formation, consistent with the results obtained from the assay with aphidicolin (Fig. 1, B and C). On the other hand, the majority of the 5′ labeled Fragment 2 (expected length of 107 bases) and Fragment 4 (expected length of 78 bases) were shorter than expected, suggesting that the DNA strands are cleaved in the 5′ to 3′ direction from the SSIs. Taken together, these results suggest that DSBs are produced by cleavage of DNA strands from the 5′ ends, as summarized in the legend to Fig. 2D. Effect of FEN-1 on DSB Formation—In long patch BER, FEN-1 is known to cleave DNA strands from the 5′ to 3′ direction by releasing fragments of 2 to 3 nucleotides (20Matsumoto Y. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Price A. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to investigate the possible involvement of FEN-1 in DSB formation. In the DSB formation assay, we added up to three times the amount of FEN-1 (corresponding to 3U) normally present in 50 μg of extracts. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, adding 3U of FEN-1 using MRC5 cell extracts produced a 4-fold increase in the amount of DSBs formed. When P1U, which contains one uracil, was used, no DSB formation was found (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, increased DSB formation is not due to nonspecific nicking of DNA by FEN-1, suggesting that FEN-1 can generate DSBs from two DNA damages located on opposite DNA strands. Addition of PCNA, which promotes the activity of FEN-1 (27Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 28Li X. Li J. Harrington J. Lieber M.R. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22109-22112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), to the DSB formation assay did not increase DSB formation (data not shown), possibly due to the fact that the extracts already contain sufficient amount of PCNA. In the same experimental conditions, but using 46BR cell extracts, FEN-1 did not promote DSB formation (Fig. 3, A and B). We also did not observe the formation of more than 28–30 ng of linearized DNA, even after addition of an increased amount of FEN-1 in the assay using MRC5 cell extracts (data not shown). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, two uracil residues are required to be simultaneously converted into SSIs for DSB formation. Thus, if such simultaneous SSI formation occurs only in 10% (30 ng) of a given substrate DNA (P2U18), over 30 ng of DSB cannot be produced in the cell-free DSB formation assay, even after addition of increased amounts of FEN-1. Inhibition of FEN-1-mediated DSB Formation by Lig I—We have previously reported that adding lig I to 46BR cell extracts reduces the formation of DSBs (9Vispé S. Satoh M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27386-27392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, when FEN-1 activity in 46BR cell extracts was neutralized by an anti-FEN-1 antibody (data not shown), the DSB formation activity of 46BR cell extracts was also reduced by the neutralization (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3, E and F, addition of 10 units of lig I to this assay inhibited the DSB formation promoted by FEN-1 with MRC5 cell extracts. Among the DNA ligases that we tested, lig I showed the most significant inhibitory effect on DSB formation. Therefore, the results suggest that FEN-1 can act as a factor converting two DNA damages produced on opposite DNA strands into DSBs, while lig I can counteract this activity. Conversion of γ-Ray-induced DNA Damage into DSBs by FEN-1—To further investigate the involvement of FEN-1 in DSB formation, we used γ-irradiated plasmid DNA instead of the model substrate, P2U18. pBluescript K/S+ was exposed to γ-rays, and plasmid DNA containing SSIs and linearized DNA (products of direct action of free-radicals) were removed by EtBr-CsCl centrifugation (21Satoh M.S. Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6335-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The remaining closed circular DNA was used for the DSB formation assay. With this substrate, FEN-1 was able to promote the linearization of the irradiated plasmid DNA (Fig. 4), consistent with results obtained from assays using P2U18. These results suggest that γ-"

Here we report that in fibroblasts, activated H-Ras and Raf-1 oncogenes decrease biosynthesis, association with β1 integrins, and surface expression of tTG because of down-regulation of tTG mRNA. In turn, the reduction of surface tTG inhibits adhesion of H-Ras- and Raf-1-transformed cells on fibronectin and, in particular, on its tTG-binding fragment I(6)II(1,2)I(7–9), which does not interact directly with integrins. Analysis of Ras/Raf downstream signaling with specific pharmacological inhibitors reveals that the decrease in tTG expression is mediated by the p38 MAPK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. In contrast, increased activation of the ERK pathway by constitutively active MEK1 stimulates tTG mRNA expression, biosynthesis, and surface expression of tTG, whereas MEK inhibitors or dominant negative MEK1 exert an opposite effect. This modulation of surface tTG by ERK signaling alters adhesion of cells on fibronectin and its fragment that binds tTG. Furthermore, transient stimulation of ERK signaling in untransformed fibroblasts by adhesion on fibronectin or growth factors elevates tTG biosynthesis, increases complex formation with β1 integrins, and raises surface expression of tTG. Finally, ERK activation is required for growth factor-induced redistribution of tTG on the surface of adherent fibroblasts and co-clustering of β1 integrins and tTG at cell-matrix adhesion contacts. Together, our data indicate that down-regulation of surface tTG by Ras and Raf oncogenes contributes to adhesive deficiency of transformed fibroblasts, whereas stimulation of biosynthesis and surface expression of tTG by the MEK1/ERK module promotes and sustains cell-matrix adhesion of untransformed cells. Contrasting effects of Ras/Raf oncogenes and their immediate downstream signaling module, MEK1/ERK, on tTG expression are consistent with adhesive function of surface tTG.

Transglutaminases are a multigene family of Ca2+-dependent enzymes that mediate covalent cross-linking of proteins by forming amide bonds between glutamines and ϵ-amino groups of lysines and mechanically stabilize tissues by formation of protein multimers resistant to enzymatic and physical degradation (1Lorand L.

Whereas most transglutaminases are restricted to one or several cell types, tissue transglutaminase (tTG) 1The abbreviations used are: tTG, tissue transglutaminase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; CA, constitutively active; DN, dominant-negative. is widely expressed and is particularly abundant in endothelium and smooth muscle cells (3Thomazy V. Fesus L. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 255: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It localizes primarily in the cytoplasm, with a small part of its intracellular pool present in the nucleus (4Lesort M. Attanavanich K. Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11991-11994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Because the cross-linking activity of tTG is induced by Ca2+ and inhibited by GTP, it is mostly dormant inside the cell, but can be drastically enhanced following a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ (5Monsonego A. Friedmann I. Shani Y. Eisenstein M. Schwartz M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several intracellular targets of cross-linking by cytoplasmic tTG were identified, although physiological significance of these events has not been elucidated (6Chen J.S. Mehta K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 817-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). tTG also binds and hydrolyzes GTP and mediates intracellular signaling from the α1B adrenergic receptor (7Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) to downstream targets such as phospholipase Cδ (8Murthy S.N.P. Lomasney J.W. Mak E.C. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11815-11819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, tTG inhibits adenylate cyclase activity and this effect does not require its cross-linking function (9Gentile V. Porta R.

Therefore, cytoplasmic tTG has some direct signaling functions apart from its enzymatic activity. Importantly, some amounts of tTG are present on the cell surface (10Martinez J. Chalupowicz D.G. Roush R.K. Sheth A. Barsigian C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2538-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in the ECM (11Upchurch H.F. Conway E. Maxwell M.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) where it can interact with several proteins including fibronectin (12Turner P.M. Lorand L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Unlike cytoplasmic tTG, the cell surface enzyme is constitutively active because of high Ca2+ concentrations in the extracellular space and is able to cross-link fibronectin (10Martinez J. Chalupowicz D.G. Roush R.K. Sheth A. Barsigian C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2538-2545Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Jones R.A. Nicholas B. Mian S. Davies P.J. Griffin M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2461-2472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and several other ECM proteins. Because there is no leader sequence in tTG (14Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains essentially unknown how the protein is exported to the cell surface. Several previous studies suggested a role of surface tTG in cell adhesion (14Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol.

We recently expanded these observations by showing that tTG binds directly to the extracellular domain of β1 and β3 integrin subunits and forms ternary complexes with integrins and fibronectin on the cell surface (18Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Surface tTG was found to affect a wide range of integrin functions. It stimulates adhesion, spreading, and migration of several cell types on fibronectin (18Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 19Belkin A.M. Akimov S.S. Zaritskaya L.S. Ratnikov B.I. Deryugina E.I. Strongin A.Y. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and promotes integrin-dependent fibronectin assembly into deoxycholate-insoluble matrix (21Akimov S.S. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2989-3000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This newly defined adhesive function of surface tTG is independent of its cross-linking activity (18Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 21Akimov S.S. Belkin A.M. J.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 140-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 16Menter D.G. Patton J.T. Updyke T.V. Kerbel R.S. McIntire L.V. Nicolson G.L. Cell Biophys. 1991; 18: 123-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and, therefore its expression is regulated by multiple factors. Several regulatory sites were located within the promoter region of the tTG gene (23Lu S. Saydak M. Gentile V. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9748-9756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Retinoids act as acute stimulators of biosynthesis and cross-linking activity of tTG (24Davies P.J.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Activation of the tTG gene promoter by retinoids was found to depend on the proximal element and a 30-base pair tripartite retinoid response element located 1.7 kilobases upstream of the transcription start site (26Nagy L. Saydak M. Shipley N. Lu S. Basilion J.P. Yan Z.H. Syka P. Chandraratna R.A. Stein J.P. Heyman R.A. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4355-4365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Several inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α trigger a sharp increase in biosynthesis of tTG during tissue injury and inflammation (27Chen R. Gao B. Huang C. Olsen B. Rotundo R.F. Blumenstock F. Saba T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L161-L174Crossref Google Scholar, 28Johnson K. Hashimoto S. Lotz M. Protzker K. Terkeltaub R. Am. J.

Physiol. 1998; 274: G240-G245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by acting via NF-κB and the corresponding regulatory site in the promoter (30Mirza A. Liu S.-L. Frizell E. Zhu J. Maddukuri S. Martinez J. Davies P.J. Schwarting R. Norton P. Zern M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G281-G288PubMed Google Scholar). A large body of work demonstrated that both expression and enzymatic activity of tTG are greatly enhanced by transforming growth factor β in several cell types (31George M.D. Vollberg T.M. Floyd E.E. Stein J.P. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11098-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, transforming growth factor β1 response element 5′-GAGTTGGTGC-3′ was mapped 868 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site in the promoter (32Ritter S.J. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12798-12806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about the role of these and other pathways in modulation of adhesive function of cell surface tTG. The purpose of the present study is to analyze regulatory mechanisms that control expression and localization of tTG on the surface of untransformed and oncogene-transformed cells. In this report we show that H-Ras, Raf-1 oncogenes, and the ERK signaling cascade have opposing effects on tTG mRNA expression and, consequently, on biosynthesis of tTG, formation of integrin-tTG complexes, and surface levels of tTG. Importantly, tTG is known to exert tumor suppressor function by inhibiting cell proliferation (33Haroon Z.A. Lai T.S. Hettash J.M. Lindberg R.A. Dewhirst M.W. Greenberg C.S. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1679-1686PubMed Google Scholar, 34Johnson T.S. Knight C.R. el-Alaoui S. Mian S. Rees R.C. Gentile V. Davies P.J. Griffin M.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and its expression is frequently decreased in human tumors (36Birckbichler P.J Bonner R.B. Hurst R.E. Bane B.L. Pitha J.V. Hemstreet G.P. Cancer. 2000; 89: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Hager H. Jensen P.H. Hamilton-Dutoit S. Neilsen M.S. Birckbichler P. Gliemann J. J.

Lab. Invest. 1996; 75: 637-645PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of biosynthesis and surface expression of tTG by activated forms of H-Ras and Raf-1 oncogenes might explain the reduction of tTG in primary tumors and contribute to adhesive deficiency and anchorage-independent growth of transformed cells. Moreover, we found that down-regulation of tTG is likely a common feature of Ras and Raf family members, because activated forms of K-Ras and B-Raf oncogenes, often detected in human cancers (39Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 147-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), also inhibit tTG expression. At the same time, analysis of Ras/Raf downstream signaling pathways showed that constitutive activation or transient stimulation of the MEK1/ERK signaling module by adhesion or growth factors increases tTG biosynthesis and expression on the surface of untransformed cells. Finally, ERK activation is required for growth factor-dependent integrin clustering and formation of cell-matrix contacts containing β1 integrins and tTG. Opposite regulation of expression and surface localization of tTG by Ras/Raf oncogenes and MEK1/ERK signaling identified in this study is in agreement with the adhesive function of this protein, which is independent of its cross-linking activity and promotes interactions of cells with the surrounding matrix (1Lorand L.

Polyclonal antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of β1A integrin and secondary affinity purified fluorescein- and rhodamine-labeled IgGs were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Cell Culture and Transfections—NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) with pSV3-Neo plasmid containing cDNA inserts for rasH(12V) or Δraf22W and stable transfectants were selected with 500 μg/ml neomycin. To generate regulated expression of rasH(12V) or Δraf22W in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the GeneSwitch™ inducible expression system from Invitrogen was used. Cells were initially transfected with pSwitch plasmid and stable transfectants were selected with 300 μg/ml hygromycin. Then, the resulting stable transfectants were transfected again with the original pGene plasmid or the same vector encoding rasH(12V) or Δraf22W and selected with 150 μg/ml zeocin. Inducible expression of activated H-Ras or Raf-1 oncogenes in NIH 3T3 double transfectants was achieved by treatment with 10 ng/ml mifepristone for 36 h. The same method was employed for inducible expression of rasK(12V) and rafB1-CAAX oncogenes. For regulated expression of constitutively active and dominant negative MEK1(S218E/S222E) and MEK1(S218A/S222A) mutants, the 1.2-kb BamHI cDNA fragments encoding MEK1 mutants were subcloned into the pGene vector. Expression of MEK1(S218E/S222E) or MEK1(S218A/S222A) in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts was induced by treatment with 10 ng/ml mifepristone for 36 h. To express exogenous tTG in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts transformed with activated H-Ras or Raf-1 oncogenes, cells transfected with pSwitch and pGene plasmids encoding vector alone, rasH(12V), or Δraf22W were then transfected with tTG cDNA (14Gentile V. Saydak M. Chiocca E.A. Akande O. Birckbichler P.J. Lee K.N. Stein J.P. Davies P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 478-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in pcDNA3.1neo plasmid and the resulting transfectants were selected with 800 μg/ml G-418 (neomycin). Analysis of tTG mRNA Expression—For Northern blot hybridization, equal amounts of purified total cellular RNA (25 μg/lane) were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and 1× FA gel buffer (20 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCH3COO, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0), transferred to Nylon membrane (Osmonics, Westborough, MA), and UV cross-linked to the membrane. The membrane was prehybridized by incubation with Church's buffer for 8 h at 65 °C (45Retta S.F. Cassara G. D'Amato M. Alessandro R. Pellegrino M. Degani S. De Leo G. Silengo L. Tarone G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3126-3138Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and then hybridized with 32P-labeled mouse tTG cDNA probe (ResGen, Carlsbad, CA) in Church's buffer overnight at 65 °C. After hybridization, the membrane was consecutively washed for 15 min at 65 °C in 2× SSC + 0.1% SDS, 1× SSC + 0.1% SDS, 0.2× SSC + 0.1% SDS, and 0.1× SSC + 0.1% SDS. To visualize tTG mRNA bands, the Storm 860 Phosphor Screen storage system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. ImageQuant 5.0 software was applied for quantitation of the intensity of tTG mRNA bands. The same blots were rehybridized with the control housekeeping gene β-actin to ensure equal loading. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation of tTG and β 1 Integrin-tTG Complexes—All the procedures of metabolic labeling were performed in methionine-, cysteine-free medium. When present, methionine-, cysteine-deficient FBS was used during the labeling. Briefly, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in serum-free medium were either kept in suspension or plated on fibronectin-coated dishes for 3 h. Cells in suspension and cells adhering on fibronectin were then labeled with 35S for 1 h. Also, quiescent (serum-starved for 48 h) adherent NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were pretreated for 5 min with 10% FBS, 25 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor-1, 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor-BB, or left untreated. Then, both quiescent and growth factor-stimulated cells were labeled with 35S for 1 h, while growth factors were kept in the medium during the labeling. In another set of experiments, adherent NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of 10% FBS were pretreated for 12 h with 10 μm U0126, 10 μm SB203580, 20 μm LY294002, or 20 μm SP125600 before 35S labeling for 1 h in the presence of these inhibitors. In all these cases, 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label™ was used for metabolic labeling. Alternatively, adherent NIH 3T3 transfectants expressing MEK1 mutants, H-Ras(12V), or ΔRaf-22W in the presence of 10% FBS were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml Tran35S-label™ for 12 h. Cell lysis in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled β1 integrins, tTG, and β1 integrin-tTG complexes were performed essentially as described (18Akimov S.S. Krylov D.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2989-3000Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3 × 108 cpm of protein-incorporated 35S-labeled radioactivity equivalent to 1 mg of total cellular protein was used for each sample in immunoprecipitation experiments. 5 μg/sample of mAb HMβ1-1 was used for immunoprecipitation of β1 integrin-tTG complexes (18Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). To reprecipitate tTG from the β1 integrin-tTG complexes, the resulting immune complexes were boiled in 1% SDS, and the eluate was reconstituted with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, to a final SDS concentration of 0.1% (18Akimov S.S.

Half of each sample was subjected to reprecipitation with 3 μl of polyclonal antibody to β1A integrin cytoplasmic domain (Chemicon) and another half with 5 μg of polyclonal anti-tTG antibody (18Akimov S.S.

The resulting 35S-labeled β1 integrin immune complexes and β1 integrin and tTG immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide, 0.25% bisacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis the gels were fixed and treated with Autofluor™ (Amersham Biosciences) for fluorography. Autoradiograph images were generated using Bio-Max MR single emulsion film (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). Measurement of Cell Surface tTG by Flow Cytometry—For flow cytometry, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts that were kept in suspension in the absence of serum for 4 h were initially compared with serum-starved adherent cells that were detached from fibronectin-coated dishes with EDTA immediately before the experiment. Likewise, NIH 3T3 transfectants, quiescent untransformed NIH 3T3 cells, and cells stimulated with growth factors or 10% FBS for 3 h or pretreated with pharmacological inhibitors of signaling pathways for 12 h, were detached from tissue culture dishes with EDTA and used instantly for flow cytometry. First, live non-permeabilized cells were incubated with 20 μg/ml polyclonal antibody against tTG for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the cells with PBS, they were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed again, and then stained with 20 μg/ml secondary fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG for 30 min at 25 °C. Staining for cell surface tTG was analyzed in FACScan™ flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Analysis of ERK Activation—Analysis of ERK activation was performed by SDS-PAGE with 20 μg of total cell lysates on 15% acrylamide, 0.25% bisacrylamide gels followed by immunoblotting with antibodies to dually phosphorylated (activated) or total ERK1/ERK2. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Subconfluent cultures of vector-transfected, H-Ras- and Raf-1-transformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on glass coverslips were used for immunofluorescence. Confluent serum-starved untransformed NIH 3T3 fibroblasts on glass coverslips were either kept quiescent or were stimulated with 10% FBS (with or without 10 μm U0126)"
