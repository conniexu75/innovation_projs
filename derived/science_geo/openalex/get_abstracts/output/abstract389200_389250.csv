https://openalex.org/W2054530178,"The mechanism for how metformin activates AMPK (AMP-activated kinase) was investigated in isolated skeletal muscle L6 cells. A widely held notion is that inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is central to the mechanism. We also considered other proposals for metformin action. As metabolic pathway markers, we focused on glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation. We also confirmed metformin actions on other metabolic processes in L6 cells. Metformin stimulated both glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation. The mitochondrial Complex I inhibitor rotenone also stimulated glucose transport but it inhibited fatty acid oxidation, independently of metformin. The peroxynitrite generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine stimulated glucose transport, but inhibited fatty acid oxidation. Addition of the nitric oxide precursor arginine to cells did not affect glucose transport. These studies differentiate metformin from inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and from active nitrogen species. Knockdown of adenylate kinase also failed to affect metformin stimulation of glucose transport. Hence, any means of increase in ADP appears not to be involved in the metformin mechanism. Knockdown of LKB1, an upstream kinase and AMPK activator, did not affect metformin action. Having ruled out existing proposals, we suggest a new one: metformin might increase AMP through inhibition of AMP deaminase (AMPD). We found that metformin inhibited purified AMP deaminase activity. Furthermore, a known inhibitor of AMPD stimulated glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Both metformin and the AMPD inhibitor suppressed ammonia accumulation by the cells. Knockdown of AMPD obviated metformin stimulation of glucose transport. We conclude that AMPD inhibition is the mechanism of metformin action."
https://openalex.org/W1998149716,"Mitochondrial complex II (CII) has been recently identified as a novel target for anti-cancer drugs. Mitochondrially targeted vitamin E succinate (MitoVES) is modified so that it is preferentially localized to mitochondria, greatly enhancing its pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer activity. Using genetically manipulated cells, MitoVES caused apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CII-proficient malignant cells but not their CII-dysfunctional counterparts. MitoVES inhibited the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity of CII with IC(50) of 80 μM, whereas the electron transfer from CII to CIII was inhibited with IC(50) of 1.5 μM. The agent had no effect either on the enzymatic activity of CI or on electron transfer from CI to CIII. Over 24 h, MitoVES caused stabilization of the oxygen-dependent destruction domain of HIF1α fused to GFP, indicating promotion of the state of pseudohypoxia. Molecular modeling predicted the succinyl group anchored into the proximal CII ubiquinone (UbQ)-binding site and successively reduced interaction energies for serially shorter phytyl chain homologs of MitoVES correlated with their lower effects on apoptosis induction, ROS generation, and SDH activity. Mutation of the UbQ-binding Ser(68) within the proximal site of the CII SDHC subunit (S68A or S68L) suppressed both ROS generation and apoptosis induction by MitoVES. In vivo studies indicated that MitoVES also acts by causing pseudohypoxia in the context of tumor suppression. We propose that mitochondrial targeting of VES with an 11-carbon chain localizes the agent into an ideal position across the interface of the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix, optimizing its biological effects as an anti-cancer drug."
https://openalex.org/W1981440793,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by motor neuron degeneration. How this disease affects the central motor network is largely unknown. Here, we combined for the first time structural and functional imaging measures on the motor network in patients with ALS and healthy controls.Structural measures included whole brain cortical thickness and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of crucial motor tracts. These structural measures were combined with functional connectivity analysis of the motor network based on resting state fMRI. Focal cortical thinning was observed in the primary motor area in patients with ALS compared to controls and was found to correlate with disease progression. DTI revealed reduced FA values in the corpus callosum and in the rostral part of the corticospinal tract. Overall functional organisation of the motor network was unchanged in patients with ALS compared to healthy controls, however the level of functional connectedness was significantly correlated with disease progression rate. Patients with increased connectedness appear to have a more progressive disease course.We demonstrate structural motor network deterioration in ALS with preserved functional connectivity measures. The positive correlation between functional connectedness of the motor network and disease progression rate could suggest spread of disease along functional connections of the motor network."
https://openalex.org/W1980906691,"Background Berberine is a plant alkaloid that is widely used as an anti-infective in traditional medicine. Escherichia coli exposed to berberine form filaments, suggesting an antibacterial mechanism that involves inhibition of cell division. Berberine is a DNA ligand and may induce filamentation through induction of the SOS response. Also, there is biochemical evidence for berberine inhibition of the cell division protein FtsZ. Here we aimed to assess possible berberine mechanism(s) of action in growing bacteria using genetics tools. Methodology/Principal Findings First, we tested whether berberine inhibits bacterial growth through DNA damage and induction of the SOS response. The SOS response induced by berberine was much lower compared to that induced by mitomycin C in an SOS response reporter strain. Also, cell filamentation was observed in an SOS-negative E. coli strain. To test whether berberine inhibits FtsZ, we assessed its effects on formation of the cell division Z-rings, and observed a dramatic reduction in Z-rings in the presence of berberine. We next used two different strategies for RNA silencing of ftsZ and both resulted in sensitisation of bacteria to berberine, visible as a drop in the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Furthermore, Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Indices (FICIs) showed a high level of synergy between ftsZ silencing and berberine treatment (FICI values of 0.23 and 0.25 for peptide nucleic acid- and expressed antisense RNA-based silencing of ftsZ, respectively). Finally, over-expression of ftsZ led to a mild rescue effect in berberine-treated cells. Conclusions The results argue against DNA binding as the primary mechanism of action of berberine and support the hypothesis that its antibacterial properties are due to inhibition of the cell division protein FtsZ. In addition, the genetic approach used here provides a means to rapidly test the activity of other putative FtsZ inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2052076068,"The concept of DNA barcoding for species identification has gained considerable momentum in animals because of fairly successful species identification using cytochrome oxidase I (COI). In plants, matK and rbcL have been proposed as standard barcodes. However, barcoding in complex genera is a challenging task.We investigated the species discriminatory power of four reportedly most promising plant DNA barcoding loci (one from nuclear genome--ITS, and three from plastid genome--trnH-psbA, rbcL and matK) in species of Indian Berberis L. (Berberidaceae) and two other genera, Ficus L. (Moraceae) and Gossypium L. (Malvaceae). Berberis species were delineated using morphological characters. These characters resulted in a well resolved species tree. Applying both nucleotide distance and nucleotide character-based approaches, we found that none of the loci, either singly or in combinations, could discriminate the species of Berberis. ITS resolved all the tested species of Ficus and Gossypium and trnH-psbA resolved 82% of the tested species in Ficus. The highly regarded matK and rbcL could not resolve all the species. Finally, we employed amplified fragment length polymorphism test in species of Berberis to determine their relationships. Using ten primer pair combinations in AFLP, the data demonstrated incomplete species resolution. Further, AFLP analysis showed that there was a tendency of the Berberis accessions to cluster according to their geographic origin rather than species affiliation.We reconfirm the earlier reports that the concept of universal barcode in plants may not work in a number of genera. Our results also suggest that the matK and rbcL, recommended as universal barcode loci for plants, may not work in all the genera of land plants. Morphological, geographical and molecular data analyses of Indian species of Berberis suggest probable reticulate evolution and thus barcode markers may not work in this case."
https://openalex.org/W2023405265,"The artemisinin compounds are the frontline drugs for the treatment of drug-resistant malaria. They are selectively cytotoxic to mammalian cancer cell lines and have been implicated as neurotoxic and embryotoxic in animal studies. The endoperoxide functional group is both the pharmacophore and toxicophore, but the proposed chemical mechanisms and targets of cytotoxicity remain unclear. In this study we have used cell models and quantitative drug metabolite analysis to define the role of the mitochondrion and cellular heme in the chemical and molecular mechanisms of cell death induced by artemisinin compounds. HeLa ρ0 cells, which are devoid of a functioning electron transport chain, were used to demonstrate that actively respiring mitochondria play an essential role in endoperoxide-induced cytotoxicity (artesunate IC50 values, 48 h: HeLa cells, 6 ± 3 μm; and HeLa ρ0 cells, 34 ± 5 μm) via the generation of reactive oxygen species and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis but do not have any role in the reductive activation of the endoperoxide to cytotoxic carbon-centered radicals. However, using chemical modulators of heme synthesis (succinylacetone and protoporphyrin IX) and cellular iron content (holotransferrin), we have demonstrated definitively that free or protein-bound heme is responsible for intracellular activation of the endoperoxide group and that this is the chemical basis of cytotoxicity (IC50 value and biomarker of bioactivation levels, respectively: 10β-(p-fluorophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin alone, 0.36 ± 0.20 μm and 11 ± 5%; and with succinylacetone, >100 μm and 2 ± 5%). The artemisinin compounds are the frontline drugs for the treatment of drug-resistant malaria.

The endoperoxide antimalarials are a class of semi-synthetic compounds derived from the natural product artemisinin (1) (see Fig. 1) that are currently deployed in the frontline combination treatments for drug-resistant malaria because of their rapid clearance of parasites and high tolerability in humans (1Nosten F.

(2Park B.K. O'Neill P.M. Maggs J.L. Pirmohamed M. Br. J. Clin.

It is currently perceived that the benefits of these drugs in treating malaria outweigh the risks when administered in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy; however, the World Health Organization have contraindicated the use of ARTs during the first trimester (6World Health Organization WHO/CDS/MAL/2003.1094. 2003; Google Scholar). The emergence of resistance to the ARTs is a pressing problem (7Muller O. Sie A. Meissner P. Schirmer R.H. Kouyate B. Lancet. 2009; 374: 1419-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Taylor S.M. Juliano J.J. Meshnick S.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1807-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the development of novel synthetic endoperoxides with improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics is therefore a priority area (9Noedl H. Se Y. Schaecher K. Smith B.L. Socheat D. Fukuda M.M. Consortium A.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 2619-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 10Jefford C.W. Drug Discovery Today. 2007; 12: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The major structural differences between the novel synthetic derivatives, resulting in increased systemic exposure, have the potential to induce highly variable toxicology and pharmacology (11Mercer A.E. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2009; 12: 125-132PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the elucidation of the factors that define cell susceptibility to the ARTs is essential to facilitate the safe use of existing ARTs therapies; to inform the design of safe, novel, endoperoxide compounds in which pharmacological activity is dissociated from toxicological effects and to define the molecular target to enable their consideration and potential development as anticancer agents (12Posner, G. H., D'Angelo, J., O'Neill, P. M., Mercer, A., (2006) Exp. Opin. Therapeutic Patents 16, 1665–1672.Google Scholar). The endoperoxide group contained within the artemisinin (1) framework functions as both the pharmacophore and toxicophore. It is hypothesized that its one-electron reductive activation by an Fe(II) species to toxic carbon-centered radicals is essential for activity (Fig. 1) (13O'Neill P.M. Posner G.H. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 2945-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The parasiticidal mechanism of action is not fully understood, and the chemical source of activation and the parasite target remain under investigation. However, it has been postulated that the endoperoxides have multiple targets including the parasite sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, PfATP6, and heme- and non-heme-containing proteins while also inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (13O'Neill P.M.

Our previous studies in mammalian cells have demonstrated that activation of the endoperoxide bridge to carbon-centered radicals only occurs in sensitive proliferating cells and not their primary counterparts and therefore that this differential activation is the chemical basis of selective cytotoxicity (17Mercer A.E.

Nevertheless, crucial information defining the primary cellular target of cytotoxicity and the exact intracellular mechanism of chemical activation remains unclear. Intriguingly, the ARTs display a range of cytotoxic activity among mammalian cells (17Mercer A.E. Maggs J.L. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. Chadwick J. O'Neill P.M. Park B.K. J. Biol.

The iron activation hypothesis provides an explanation for this selectivity, proposing that cytotoxicity is dependent upon the higher concentration of iron required by malignant cells and neuronal cells to sustain continued growth and proliferation (21Kwok J.C. Richardson D.R. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2002; 42: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Accordingly, sensitive cells have an increased number of transferrin receptors responsible for cellular iron uptake and higher intracellular iron levels, and pretreatment with iron chelators can reduce cytotoxicity (18Disbrow G.L.

In addition, recent biochemical evidence has been presented suggesting that heme may be a physiologically relevant mediator of the ARTs in cancer cells, and the authors have used biomimetic chemistry to speculate that this may be due to the formation of heme adducts (22Zhang S.M. Gerhard G.S. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Several investigations have implicated the mitochondrion in the antiparasitic (23Jiang J.B. Jacobs G. Liang D.S.

Elegant studies performed with a yeast model and isolated mitochondria of parasite and mammalian cell origin have suggested that, in contrast to the iron activation theory, the mitochondrion may be a direct target and mediator of endoperoxide activity and further may underlie selectivity to the parasite (27Wang J. Huang L. Li J. Fan Q. Long Y. Li Y. Zhou B. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 28Li W. Mo W.K. Shen D. Sun L.B. Wang J. Lu S. Gitschier J.M. Zhou B. PLoS Genet. 2005; 1: 329-334Google Scholar). The authors of these studies hypothesized that the mitochondria play a dual role: the electron transport chain (ETC) delivers reducing equivalents for activation of the endoperoxide function and, as a consequence, the mitochondria are damaged; ROS are generated leading to the eventual induction of parasite death. In the present investigations, we have applied our established techniques to quantify bioactivation of the endoperoxide group via C-centered radicals and cell death in vitro to define more clearly the chemical and molecular mechanisms that determine mammalian cell susceptibility to the ARTs. Specifically we have defined the role of the ETC of the mitochondria, using ρ0 cells that have been depleted of mitochondrial DNA, and that of heme, using chemical modulators of heme synthesis, in the chemical bioactivation of the endoperoxide group and the induction of cell death. The investigations were carried out using two endoperoxide compounds: artesunate (2), which is administered therapeutically as an antimalarial, and 10β-(p-fluorophenoxy)dihydroartemisinin (PFDHA) (3), an artemisinin derivative used as a chemical probe of endoperoxide-induced cell death because of its enhanced metabolic stability (17Mercer A.E.

All other materials and chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. HeLa and HeLa ρ0 cell lines were maintained in DMEM high glucose medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), l-glutamine (1% w/v), and sodium pyruvate, which was supplemented with uridine (50 μm) for HeLa ρ0 cell culture. HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) and l-glutamine (1% w/v). All of the cells were incubated under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell viability was above 95% for all of the experiments based on trypan blue exclusion (30Tennant J.R.

The IC50 values were calculated from individual inhibition curves plotted by Grafit software (Erithacus, West Sussex, UK). Drug-treated cells were stained with annexin V and PI using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. A minimum of 5000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics XL; Beckman Coulter, Buckinghamshire, UK). Annexin V-FITC fluorescence was measured on fluorescence channel 1, and PI fluorescence was measured on fluorescence channel 3. The proportions of viable cells (annexin-negative/PI-negative), apoptotic cells (annexin-positive/PI-negative), and necrotic/late apoptotic cells (annexin-positive/PI-positive) were calculated using WinMDI software (version 2.8; Scripps Institute). Tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) was used to identify cells with a high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) as described previously (17Mercer A.E. Maggs J.L. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. Chadwick J.

ROS generation was monitored using dichlorofluoroescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Plated cells were pretreated with DCFH-DA (5 μm, 30 min), the dye solution was then removed, and the cells were washed twice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (1 ml) before drug was added. Following incubation, the cells were washed twice (HBSS, 1 ml) before resuspension (HBSS, 1 ml) and analysis by flow cytometry. A minimum of 5000 cells were analyzed, and the fluorescence intensity was measured using fluorescence channel 1. To correct for any fluorescence of the drug, duplicate samples were prepared without the addition of DCFH-DA for all incubations. In experiments performed in the presence of the antioxidant tiron, 1 mm tiron was added following incubation with DCFH-DA immediately prior to the addition of artesunate. Drug-treated cells (2 × 105) were washed in ice-cold HBSS and resuspended in 50 μl of mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% digitonin. The cells were left on ice for 10 min before centrifugation (13,000 rpm, 3 min). The pellet was retained as the mitochondrially enriched fraction, and the supernatant was retained as the cytosol-containing fraction. Subsequently, both pellets and supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting for cytochrome c as described previously (32Mercer A.E. Regan S.L. Hirst C.M. Graham E.E. Antoine D.J. Benson C.A.

A commercial caspase-glo 3/7 kit (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to measure the combined DEVD-ase activity of caspases-3 and -7. The assay provides a proluminescent caspase-3/7 substrate, which contains the tetrapeptide sequence DEVD, which is cleaved by the caspases to produce a luminescent signal. The kit was used according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the levels of luminescence were measured using a fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek FL600). The method was based on the protocol of Sassa (33Sassa S. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To a pellet of endoperoxide-treated cells (1 × 105) was added an aqueous solution oxalic acid (500 μl, 2 m). The samples were shaken before heating (100 °C, 30 min). Standard solutions of hemin (0.01–10 mm) were prepared (water/methanol, MeOH 1:1, v/v containing 1% bovine serum albumin) and heated with oxalic acid, as above. The samples and standard solutions (200 μl) were plated into a white 96-well plate, and the fluorescence of the deferrated heme was measured (excitation, 400 nm; emission, 662 nm). The results were corrected for non-heme endogenous porphyrins by preparing cell blanks in oxalic acid without heating. Intracellular activation of the endoperoxides was monitored by LC-MS/MS. The instrument was an API 2000 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (AB Sciex, Warrington, UK) interfaced to a PerkinElmer Series 200 autosampler and a PerkinElmer pump. The data were collected and analyzed by the Analyst 1.3 software (AB Sciex). Cells (1 ml of 1.5 × 104 HeLa cells/ml or 4 ml of 1 × 106 HL-60 cells/ml) were incubated with PFDHA (3) (48 h for HeLa, 24 h for HL-60) at 37 °C. Following incubation, artesunate (2, 1 nmol) was added as an internal standard before the samples were prepared as described previously (17Mercer A.E. Maggs J.L. Sun X.M. Cohen G.M. Chadwick J. O'Neill P.M. Park B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9372-9382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and were analyzed by LC-MS/MS multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Agilent ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C8 column (150 × 3.9 mm inner diameter, 5 μm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The mobile phase consisted of methanol with 10 mm aqueous ammonium acetate (70:30, v/v) delivered at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode. The operating parameters were optimized via the quantitative optimization facility in Analyst software as follows: ion spray voltage of +5.0 kV, back pressures for the collision gas of 2 p.s.i., curtain gas of 20 p.s.i., nebulizer gas (GS1) of 30 p.s.i., and turbo gas (GS2) of 65 p.s.i.; the turbo gas temperature was 300 °C. Analyte-specific parameters and fragmentation transitions are detailed in Table 1. All of the gases used were nitrogen. Calibration curves of peak area versus analyte mass (5–5000 pmol) were generated from solutions of synthetic PFDHA, PFDHA THF acetate, and artesunate in methanol, and the limit of quantification was calculated to be 50 pmol using the method of least squares line fit. The efficiency of PFDHA and PFDHA THF acetate recovery was corrected for by the quantification of the internal standard, artesunate.TABLE 1Analyte specific parameters and fragmentation transitions for tandem mass spectrometric analyses of artesunate (2), PFDHA (3), and PFDHA THF acetate (4)ParameterArtesunate (2)PFDHA (3)PFDHA THF acetate (4)Fragmentation transition402.1 to 163.1396.0 to 163.0396.0 to 266.7Declustering potential (V)21621Focusing potential (V)370370370Entrance potential (V)1285Collision energy (V)301730Collision cell entrance potential (V)18.61419Collision cell exit potential (V)261014Dwell time200200100 Open table in a new tab The values are expressed as the means ± S.E. The data were analyzed for non-normality using a Shapiro-Wilk test. Student's t test was used when normality was indicated; a Mann-Whitney U test was used for nonparametric data. All of the calculations were performed using Stats Direct statistical software; the results were considered significant when the p values were less than 0.05. The role of the activity of the mitochondrial ETC in ART-induced cell death was investigated using HeLa ρ0 cells and their normal HeLa cell counterpart. HeLa ρ0 cells have been depleted of mitochondrial DNA, which encodes the majority of the ETC. Therefore, they still contain mitochondria but lack a fully functional ETC and so utilize glycolysis instead of oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP (34Rodríguez-Enríquez S. Vital-González P.A. Flores-Rodríguez F.L. Marín-Hernández A. Ruiz-Azuara L. Moreno-Sánchez R. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2006; 215: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 35King M.P. Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of PFDHA and artesunate (IC50 values) against HeLa and HeLa ρ0 cells was determined using the MTT assay of total cellular dehydrogenase activity (36Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Protoplasma. 1998; 205: 74-82Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and also by measuring the ability of viable cells to accumulate the cationic dye neutral red in the lysosomes via the maintenance of pH gradients through the production of ATP (31Repetto G. del Peso A. Zurita J.L. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) (Table 2). The neutral red assay was included to confirm that any assessments of ART cytotoxicity made by the MTT assay of dehydrogenase activity were not affected by direct enzyme inhibition or the ETC status of the ρ0 cells. The results demonstrate that the endoperoxide compounds are significantly more cytotoxic to the HeLa cells than the HeLa ρ0 cells, with values three to seven times greater in cells without a functioning ETC.TABLE 2Cytotoxicity of the ARTs against HeLa and HeLa ρ0 cells (48 h)MTT assayNR assayρ+ρ0p valueρ+ρ0p valuePFDHA13 ± 492 ± 90.001215 ± 4>100NDArtesunate6 ± 334 ± 50.011416 ± 644 ± 90.0006 Open table in a new tab The mechanism of cell death induced by artesunate was defined by measuring two diagnostic parameters. The annexin V/PI double staining method was used to identify apoptotic cells in which annexin V binds to the externalized phosphatidylserine residues (annexin-positive) and necrotic and late apoptotic cells in which concomitant PI staining of DNA occurs as a result of leaky cell membranes (annexin- and PI-positive) (Fig. 2A). These results show that in HeLa cells, artesunate induces significant levels of dose-dependent apoptosis, which progresses to low levels of late apoptosis/necrosis at higher concentrations (Fig. 2B). In contrast, in HeLa ρ0 cells, death progresses predominantly via necrosis, with low levels of apoptosis apparent. For example, when treated with artesunate (50 μm, 48 h), HeLa cells are 54 ± 2% apoptotic and 24 ± 9% necrotic/late apoptotic, whereas HeLa ρ0 cells are 21 ± 5% apoptotic and 67 ± 21% necrotic/late apoptotic. The role of the mitochondria was further investigated by examining mitochondria membrane depolarization and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. TMRE was used to label cells with high mitochondrial membrane potential, and any reduction in fluorescence was attributed to MMP (Fig. 2C). Artesunate induced dose-dependent mitochondria membrane depolarization in HeLa cells, which reached a maximum of 71 ± 7% of cells (100 μm), but in HeLa ρ0 the fraction of cells with depolarized mitochondrial membranes was lower, with significant levels only seen from 50 μm and a maximum of 49 ± 4% (100 μm) (Fig. 2C). The release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol is a hallmark of apoptosis (37Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was measured by immunoblot analysis of mitochondria and cytosol-containing fractions prepared from artesunate-treated cells (Fig. 2D). Artesunate induced a significant dose-dependent cytochrome c release in HeLa cells, which reached a maximum of 61 ± 4% of total cytochrome c released (48 h; Fig. 2D). Lower levels of cytochrome c release were evident in HeLa ρ0 cells (maximum of 33 ± 17% release), and their response was also more variable (48 h). During the apoptotic pathway, the release of cytochrome c and the formation of the apoptosome trigger the activation of caspases-3 and-7, which are responsible for chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. The induction of caspase-3 and -7 activities by artesunate was measured using a luminescent assay (Fig. 2E). Artesunate induced a dose-dependent increase in activity at lower concentrations (1–10 μm, 48 h) in HeLa cells. However, the complete death of cells at high concentrations (100 μm) resulted in control levels of caspase activity. Conversely, no significant caspase-3/-7 activity was evident in HeLa ρ0 cells (48 h). The drug-induced generation of ROS was assessed by the pretreatment of cells with DCFH-DA. Esterase cleavage of the acetate groups forms dichlorodihydrofluorescein, which accumulates in the cells and undergoes oxidation by ROS to fluorescent dichlorofluorescin. The investigations of artesunate (100 μm) over a 48-h time course demonstrated that early maximal levels of ROS generation were attained at 16 h (2.3 ± 0.5-fold over control), which is much earlier than cytotoxicity is observed (Fig. 3A). In addition, ROS generation was reduced in HeLa ρ0 cells (Fig. 3A). We have used tiron, a cell membrane-permeable superoxide scavenger (38Greenstock C.L. Miller R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 396: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) to define the link between ROS induction and the initiation of cell death. The results show that the addition of tiron significantly inhibits ROS generation at an early 24-h time point (Fig. 3B) and also inhibits the induction of cytotoxicity (48 h) (Fig. 3C). The cellular bioactivation of the endoperoxide bridge was quantified using PFDHA (3, 10"
https://openalex.org/W2029738976,"Tissue factor has been recognized as a regulator of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. The tissue factor gene is selectively expressed in highly invasive breast cancer cells, and the mechanisms regulating tissue factor expression in these cells remain unclear. This study demonstrates that microRNA-19 (miR-19) regulates tissue factor expression in breast cancer cells, providing a molecular basis for the selective expression of the tissue factor gene. Tissue factor protein was barely detectable in MCF-7, T47D, and ZR-75-1 cells (less invasive breast lines) but was expressed at a significantly higher level in MDA-MB-231 and BT-20 cells (invasive breast lines) as assayed by Western blot. The tissue factor gene promoter was activated, and forced expression of tissue factor cDNA was achieved in MCF-7 cells, implying that the 3'-UTR of the tissue factor transcript is responsible for the suppression of tissue factor expression. Bioinformatics analysis predicted microRNA-binding sites for miR-19, miR-20, and miR-106b in the 3'-UTR of the tissue factor transcript. Reporter gene assay using the TF-3'-UTR luciferase reporter construct confirmed that the 3'-UTR negatively regulates gene expression in MCF-7 cells, an effect reversed by deletion of the miR-19-binding site. Application of the miR-19 inhibitor induces endogenous tissue factor expression in MCF-7 cells, and overexpression of miR-19 down-regulates tissue factor expression in MDA-MB-231 cells. RT-PCR analysis using cDNA made from Ago2-immunoprecipitated RNA samples confirmed that Ago2 binds preferentially to tissue factor 3'-UTR in MCF-7 cells, as compared with MDA-MB-231 cells, consistent with the observation that miR-19 levels are higher in MCF-7 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1574112426,"Pharmacological activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ/β (PPARδ/β) improves glucose handling and insulin sensitivity. The target tissues of drug actions remain unclear. We demonstrate here that adenovirus-mediated liver-restricted PPARδ activation reduces fasting glucose levels in chow- and high fat-fed mice. This effect is accompanied by hepatic glycogen and lipid deposition as well as up-regulation of glucose utilization and de novo lipogenesis pathways. Promoter analyses indicate that PPARδ regulates hepatic metabolic programs through both direct and indirect transcriptional mechanisms partly mediated by its co-activator, PPARγ co-activator-1β. Assessment of the lipid composition reveals that PPARδ increases the production of monounsaturated fatty acids, which are PPAR activators, and reduces that of saturated FAs. Despite the increased lipid accumulation, adeno-PPARδ-infected livers exhibit less damage and show a reduction in JNK stress signaling, suggesting that PPARδ-regulated lipogenic program may protect against lipotoxicity. The altered substrate utilization by PPARδ also results in a secondary effect on AMP-activated protein kinase activation, which likely contributes to the glucose-lowering activity. Collectively, our data suggest that PPARδ controls hepatic energy substrate homeostasis by coordinated regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, which provide a molecular basis for developing PPARδ agonists to manage hyperglycemia and insulin resistance.

Collectively, our data suggest that PPARδ controls hepatic energy substrate homeostasis by coordinated regulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism, which provide a molecular basis for developing PPARδ agonists to manage hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The prevalence of metabolic diseases has increased substantially, partly because of rising obesity caused by sedentary lifestyles and energy surplus. Insulin resistance is at the core of these disorders. Excess energy substrates beyond the catabolic or storage capacity of the body are believed to cause organelle dysfunction (1Qatanani M. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1443-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Elevated nonesterified free fatty acid has been shown to activate inflammatory response through JNK, which suppresses insulin signaling (2Song M.J. Kim K.H. Yoon J.M. Kim J.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Therefore, a key step toward the development of drugs to treat metabolic diseases is to understand the mechanisms controlling energy substrate metabolism. In this regard, the liver is one of the most important tissues for energy homeostasis known for its role in sustaining energy availability through anabolic and catabolic pathways. Hepatic insulin resistance results in overproduction of glucose and VLDLs, worsening the extent of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity (1Qatanani M. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1443-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Metformin is one of the commonly prescribed anti-diabetic drugs that target hepatic glucose output (8Staels B. Curr. Med. Res. Opin. 2006; 22: S27-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This drug increases the activity of AMPK, an energy sensor that is activated by elevated intracellular AMP or AMP/ATP ratio. In the liver, AMPK reduces glucose production by suppressing the expression of gluconeogenic enzymes, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (9Kahn B.B. Alquier T. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 15-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). AMPK also mediates the beneficial effects of adiponectin on glucose and lipid metabolism through adiponectin receptors (10Yamauchi T. Nio Y. Maki T. Kobayashi M. Takazawa T. Iwabu M. Okada-Iwabu M. Kawamoto S. Kubota N. Kubota T. Ito Y. Kamon J. Tsuchida A. Kumagai K. Kozono H. Hada Y. Ogata H. Tokuyama K. Tsunoda M. Ide T. Murakami K. Awazawa M. Takamoto I. Froguel P. Hara K. Tobe K. Nagai R.

Although not a major site for glucose deposition, the liver also plays a role in compartmentalizing glucose during feeding (12Pagliassotti M.J. Cherrington A.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 847-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Postprandial hyperglycemia triggers insulin secretion, which in turn suppresses gluconeogenesis and at the same time induces hepatic glucokinase (GK) expression (13Girard J. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 14Postic C. Shiota M. Magnuson M.A. Recent Prog. Horm.

Glucose transported into the liver through glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) is phosphorylated by GK to generate glucose-6-phosphate, which enters metabolic pathways for glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and lipogenesis. Genetic manipulations that sustain GK protein levels in the liver have been shown to lower blood glucose and improve insulin sensitivity (16Shiota M. Postic C. Fujimoto Y. Jetton T.L. Dixon K. Pan D.

However, it is unclear whether this process can be pharmacologically activated. The three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, PPARα, δ/β and γ, belong to the nuclear receptor family. They are activated by dietary fats and are important metabolic regulators (19Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar, 20Lee C.H. Olson P. Evans R.M. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 2201-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). PPARα and PPARγ mediate the lipid-lowering and insulin-sensitizing effects of fenofibrates and thiazolidinediones, respectively (21Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L.

PPARα reduces circulating triglycerides by up-regulation of fatty acid catabolism in the liver, whereas PPARγ increases insulin sensitivity, in part, through directing fatty acid flux into storage in adipocytes. PPARδ also shows promise as a drug target to treat metabolic diseases (23Reilly S.M. Lee C.H. FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The reported effects of PPARδ activation by systemic ligand administration or by transgenic approaches in animal models include correction of dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia, prevention of diet-induced obesity, enhancement of insulin sensitivity, and modulation of muscle fiber type switching (24Oliver Jr., W.R.

Most of the observed beneficial effects are believed to be mediated by increasing fatty acid catabolism and mitochondria function in muscle and adipocytes. It is proposed that in muscle AMPK activates PPARδ to increase oxidative metabolism and running endurance (30Narkar V.A. Downes M. Yu R.T. Embler E. Wang Y.X. Banayo E. Mihaylova M.M. Nelson M.C.

We and others have recently shown that PPARδ also plays an important role in macrophage alternative activation, which exhibits anti-inflammatory properties and, as such, counteracts the inhibitory effect of inflammatory signaling on insulin sensitivity (31Kang K.

A previous study demonstrated that administration of a synthetic PPARδ agonist, GW501516, lowered hyperglycemia in db/db mice by reducing hepatic glucose production and increasing glucose disposal (28Lee C.H. Olson P. Hevener A. Mehl I. Chong L.W. Olefsky J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Ham J. Kang H. Peters J.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Expression profiling analyses suggested that fatty acid oxidation genes were up-regulated in muscle, whereas several lipogenic genes were induced in the liver. Although the function of PPARδ in muscle fat burning is well documented, whether alteration in hepatic gene expression observed in systemic drug treatment is a primary or secondary effect has not been addressed. In this study, we sought to determine whether PPARδ has a direct role in hepatic metabolic regulation. Our results demonstrated that PPARδ regulates energy substrate utilization and limits lipotoxicity in the liver. C57BL/6 mice (14 age-matched, 8-week-old males from the Jackson Laboratory) were challenged with a high fat, high carbohydrate diet (F3282; Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ) for 10 weeks. They were then transduced with purified adenovirus via tail vein injection (n = 7 for both GFP and PPARδ adenovirus). Adenoviral expression cassettes were constructed in the pShuttle-IRES-hrGFP vector and amplified in AD293 cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 100 μl of 5 × 1010 plaque-forming unit/ml virus was injected into each mouse. Liver-specific PPARδ−/− mice (in C57BL/6 background) was generated by crossing PPARδ f/f mice to albumin-Cre transgenic mice. The mice were fasted overnight for serum collection, tissue harvesting, and glucose tolerance test (GTT). Insulin tolerance test (ITT) was performed after a 6-h fast. A similar metabolic phenotype was observed in two additional cohorts (n = 5), which were used for metabolic cage studies and to determine adenine nucleotide concentrations. The experiment was repeated in 3-month-old chow-fed mice to evaluate gene expression at the fed state (n = 4/group). Statistics analyses were performed using Student's t test (two-tailed), unless otherwise indicated. The values were presented as the means ± S.E. Significance was established at p < 0.05. The animal studies were approved by the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals. Metabolic cage studies were conducted in a Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The mice were placed in metabolic cages for 2 days, and the data were collected at the beginning of the second dark (active) cycle for 24 h. The respiratory exchange ratio was determined by the ratio of CO2 produced (VCO2) over O2 consumed (VO2). The values of respiratory exchange ratio (RER) during the dark (active) and light (rest) cycles were averaged (supplemental Fig. S2). Because the mice were on high fat diet, RER was close to 0.7 throughout the day (RER = 0.7 for fatty acid usage; RER = 1 for glucose usage). For GTT, 1.5 mg of glucose/g of body weight was injected into the peritoneum. Blood glucose was measured before and after injection at the indicated time points using the OneTouch glucose monitoring system (Lifescan, Milpitas, CA). ITT was conducted similarly (0.5 units of insulin/kg of body weight). To determine triglyceride production, the mice were injected with Triton WR1339 (500 μg/g of body weight), and blood was drawn via tail bleeding at different time points for triglyceride concentration measurement. Serum and hepatic triglyceride, nonesterified fatty acid, total cholesterol, as well as serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured using commercial kits (Wako Chemicals and ThermoDMA). Hepatic glycogen was determined as described (33Akiyama T.E. Lambert G. Nicol C.J. Matsusue K. Peters J.M. Brewer Jr., H.B. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20874-20881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Insulin and adiponectin were measured using ELISA kits (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Adenine nucleotides (ATP, ADP, and AMP) were determined in perchloric acid extracts of freeze clamped tissues and normalized by protein concentration as described previously (34Zhang L. He H. Balschi J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H457-H466Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hepatic fatty acid/triglyceride composition was determined by gas-liquid chromatography as described (35Miyazaki M. Kim H.J. Man W.C. Ntambi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39455-39461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Liver samples were either cryo-preserved for GFP detection or fixed in formalin for hematoxylin and eosin or periodic acid-Schiff staining. All of the histology work was performed in the Dana Farber Research Pathology Cores, which provided preliminary histological assessment by a pathologist. SYBR green-based real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) was conducted as described (28Lee C.H. Olson P. Hevener A. Mehl I. Chong L.W. Olefsky J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Ham J. Kang H. Peters J.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), using 36B4 levels as loading controls to obtain relative expression levels. For Western blot analyses, tissue or cell lysates were prepared in a buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Antibodies against AMPK, Akt, Erk, and JNK were purchased from Cell Signaling, and PPARδ and actin antibodies were from Santa Cruz. For reporter assays, the 2- and 0.3-kb mouse GK (liver-specific) as well as the 3-kb mouse fatty acid synthase (FAS) promoter fragment were cloned in the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Human acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) promoters I and II (all in pGL3-basic) were as described previously (28Lee C.H. Olson P. Hevener A. Mehl I. Chong L.W. Olefsky J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Ham J. Kang H. Peters J.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The resulting reporter was co-transfected with expression vectors for PPARδ/RXRα, sterol-responsive element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), PPARγ co-activator-1α (PGC-1α), and PGC-1β, all under the control of a CMV promoter, together with a β-galactosidase internal control in HepG2 cells. The cells were harvested 40–48 h after transfection, and GW501516 (0.1 μm) was treated for 24 h. For endogenous gene regulation by PPARδ, primary hepatocytes were cultured in Williams' E medium with 5% lipoprotein-deficient, dialyzed FBS supplemented with 100 nm insulin and treated with 0.1 μm GW501516 for 6 h. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from 2–3-month-old male C57BL/6 mice through portal vein perfusion with Blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Science) and cultured in Williams' E medium with 5% regular FBS. Hepatocytes were infected with GFP or PPARδ virus for 24 h. The cells were washed and incubated with DMEM (low glucose) for 2 h. To measure glucose flux to glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, and oxidation, hepatocytes transduced with GFP or PPARδ virus were labeled with 1 μCi/ml d-[14C (U)]glucose overnight with or without 100 nm insulin. Medium was collected, and the cells were lysed. For measuring glucose oxidation to CO2, the medium was transferred to a 15-ml conical tube, and 100 μl of 70% perchloric acid was added. Filter paper presoaked in 1 m NaOH was then placed on the top of the tube to capture CO2. The samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the filters were placed in scintillation vials to count radioactivity. Fatty acid oxidation was conducted by loading cells with [3H]palmitate (albumin bound). The rate of β-oxidation was determined by measuring 3H2O produced in the supernatant. For glycogen synthesis from labeled glucose, cellular glycogen was isolated, and the radioactivity was determined. Glucose conversion to extractable lipids (fatty acid/triglyceride) was measured as described (28Lee C.H. Olson P. Hevener A. Mehl I. Chong L.W. Olefsky J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Ham J. Kang H. Peters J.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). For glucose production, hepatocytes were incubated for 2 h in glucose-free DMEM, containing 1 mm pyruvate and 10 mm lactate. Compound C (Calbiochem) and metformin (Sigma), an inhibitor and an activator of AMPK, respectively, were added at final concentrations of 20 μm and 2 mm, respectively. The glucose content in the supernatant was measured using a glucose oxidase kit (Trinity Biotech). All of the values were normalized by protein contents. Statistical analysis for glucose production was performed using one-way analysis of variance. To assess potential roles of hepatic PPARδ in the regulation of glucose homeostasis, we utilized adenovirus mediated gene delivery to increase PPARδ expression/activity in the liver. Previous studies have demonstrated that the overexpressed PPARδ is active in vivo (36Luquet S. Lopez-Soriano J. Holst D. Fredenrich A. Melki J. Rassoulzadegan M. Grimaldi P.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2299-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A cohort of wild type C57BL/6 male mice were fed a high fat diet for 10 weeks to induce insulin resistance, followed by injection with adenoviral GFP (control) or PPARδ (adPPARδ) through the tail vein. Adenovirus delivered through tail vein is known to concentrate in the liver, which is used commonly to achieve liver-restricted expression. Examination of liver sections showed that ∼70% of hepatocytes were infected as determined by GFP expression, resulting in a 4–5-fold increase in the PPARδ protein level (supplemental Fig. S1A). A series of metabolic studies were conducted within a week following the injection. These mice were first placed in metabolic cages, and the RER was examined to determine whether increased hepatic PPARδ altered fuel substrate usage. We found a moderate but significant increase in the RER at the resting period in adPPARδ mice (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that PPARδ may increase glucose utilization in the liver. In line with this, adPPARδ mice had a lower fasting glucose level compared with control animals at the basal state (GFP, 131 ± 7.13; PPARδ, 109.5 ± 3.15, p < 0.05) and throughout the course of GTT (Fig. 1B). Insulin levels measured during GTT showed no significant difference between the two groups (data not shown). Insulin tolerance tests demonstrated that adPPARδ mice had improved insulin sensitivity, supporting the notion that hepatic PPARδ overexpression enhances glucose handling (Fig. 1C). To determine how hepatic PPARδ regulates glucose metabolism, liver samples were collected for histological and gene expression studies. Interestingly, hematoxylin and eosin staining of liver sections revealed signs of glycogen and lipid deposition in adenoviral PPARδ-infected livers (Fig. 1D). Glycogen and lipids accumulation were further determined by periodic acid-Schiff staining and oil red O staining. After an overnight fast, the livers of control mice contained minimal glycogen. In contrast, adenoviral PPARδ-infected livers showed a substantial increase in glycogen-positive staining (Fig. 1D). Similarly, adPPARδ-infected livers had elevated neutral lipid stains (Fig. 1D). Quantitative analyses demonstrated increased glycogen and triglyceride content in livers of adPPARδ mice, whereas fatty acid and cholesterol concentrations remained similar (Fig. 1D). We did not observe significant differences in white adipose tissue histology, body weight, the ratio of liver or white adipose tissue weight to body weight and levels of fasting free fatty acid, triglyceride, and cholesterol between the two groups, indicating that the effects of hepatic PPARδ activation on glucose homeostasis were not secondary to changes in other metabolic parameters (supplemental Table S1). Gene expression analysis determined by real time qPCR demonstrated that genes involved in glucose uptake and utilization, such as GLUT2, GK, and pyruvate kinase, were increased in the livers of adPPARδ mice compared with control animals (Fig. 1E). Lipogenic genes, including FAS, ACC1, ACC2, and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), were up-regulated, and most have been shown to be induced by systemic ligand treatment in livers of db/db mice (28Lee C.H. Olson P. Hevener A. Mehl I. Chong L.W. Olefsky J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Ham J. Kang H. Peters J.M. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 3444-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c and PGC-1β, which has been shown to regulate FAS through co-activation of SREBP-1c, were also induced (37Lin J. Yang R. Tarr P.T. Wu P.H. Handschin C. Li S. Yang W. Pei L. Uldry M. Tontonoz P. Newgard C.B. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 2005; 120: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In contrast, gluconeogenic genes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and HNF4α, were suppressed in PPARδ virus-infected livers (Fig. 1E). Levels of PPARα and its targets genes, acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl-coA transferase 1, and medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) were unaffected, implicating that PPARδ overexpression did not cause nonspecific, cross-regulation of PPARα pathways. In addition, the expression of PPARδ and its target genes was unchanged in other tissues such as muscle and white adipose tissue (supplemental Fig. S1B). These data suggest that increased hepatic PPARδ activity lowers glucose levels in high fat-fed mice and implicate a role for PPARδ in hepatic metabolic regulation. The liver utilizes excess glucose for glycogen and lipid synthesis during feeding. To further probe the function of PPARδ activation in the liver at the fed state without the effects contributed by the high fat diet, adenovirus mediated PPARδ expression was conducted in a cohort of 3-month-old, lean C57BL/6 mice, and liver samples were collected under ad libitum feeding conditions. Histological and quantitative studies demonstrated that increased glycogen and triglyceride contents were also evident in livers of chow-fed adPPARδ mice (Fig. 2A). In concert, we found elevated protein levels of glycogen synthase and ACC (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S3A for quantification). Under ad libitum feeding, only pyruvate kinase, ACC1, and SCD1 were significantly induced in adPPARδ livers (Fig. 2C), which was not unexpected, because genes such as GK and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase are also regulated by insulin at the fed state. Hepatic PPARδ expression also reduced fasting glucose levels in these animals (GFP, 117 ± 3.34; PPARδ, 91.75 ± 9.39, p < 0.05, supplemental Table S1). However, chow-fed control and adPPARδ mice performed similarly in GTT and ITT, and there was no statistical difference in feeding glucose or triglyceride concentrations (data not shown). To determine whether the modulation of hepatic glucose metabolism is cell autonomous, we performed metabolic tracer studies in isolated primary hepatocytes. GFP or PPARδ virus-infected hepatocytes were labeled with [14C]glucose to trace glucose utilization for glycogen synthesis and oxidation as well as lipogenesis without or with insulin stimulation. Insulin-stimulated [14C]glucose incorporation into glycogen (Fig. 3A) and fatty acids (Fig. 3B) were increased in adenoviral PPARδ-infected hepatocytes. In addition, insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation determined by 14CO2 production was also enhanced in these cells (Fig. 3C), whereas basal fatty acid β-oxidation was reduced (Fig. 3D). The increased glucose oxidation and decreased fatty acid catabolism are consistent with the RER result (Fig. 1A). PPARδ overexpression in hepatocytes increased the expression of GK, GLUT2, FAS, ACC1, and PGC-1β (Fig. 3E). To validate gene regulation by endogenous PPARδ and determine immediate targets, we treated primary hepatocytes from wild type or PPARδ−/− livers with a PPARδ ligand, GW501516, for 6 h and found that ACC1, SCD1, and PGC-1β were up-regulated in a PPARδ-dependent manner, whereas GK, GLUT2, and FAS were unchanged (Fig. 3F and data not shown). These data suggest that PPARδ overexpression is sufficient to drive target gene expression, likely because of the presence of endogenous ligands. In addition, PPARδ activation enhances hepatic glucose utilization through direct and indirect transcriptional regulation.FIGURE 3PPARδ increases glucose utilization in primary hepatocytes. A–C, PPARδ increases glucose flux to glycogen synthesis, lipogenesis, and glycolysis determined by radioactive tracers. Hepatocytes infected with GFP or PPARδ virus were labeled with [14C]glucose without or with 100 nm insulin. The conversion of radioactive glucose to glycogen, fatty acid, and CO2 (to estimate g"

However, the effect of increased CYP-mediated EET biosynthesis and decreased soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH, Ephx2)-mediated EET hydrolysis on vascular inflammation in vivo has not been rigorously investigated. Consequently, we characterized acute vascular inflammatory responses to endotoxin in transgenic mice with endothelial expression of the human CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 epoxygenases and mice with targeted disruption of Ephx2. Compared to wild-type controls, CYP2J2 transgenic, CYP2C8 transgenic, and Ephx2(-/-) mice each exhibited a significant attenuation of endotoxin-induced activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling, cellular adhesion molecule, chemokine and cytokine expression, and neutrophil infiltration in lung in vivo. Furthermore, attenuation of endotoxin-induced NF-κB activation and cellular adhesion molecule and chemokine expression was observed in primary pulmonary endothelial cells isolated from CYP2J2 and CYP2C8 transgenic mice. This attenuation was inhibited by a putative EET receptor antagonist and CYP epoxygenase inhibitor, directly implicating CYP epoxygenase-derived EETs with the observed anti-inflammatory phenotype. Collectively, these data demonstrate that potentiation of the CYP epoxygenase pathway by either increased endothelial EET biosynthesis or globally decreased EET hydrolysis attenuates NF-κB-dependent vascular inflammatory responses in vivo and may serve as a viable anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2007993909,"Macrophages detect pathogens via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which trigger several intracellular signaling cascades including the MAPK and NFκB pathways. These in turn mediate the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines that are essential to combat the pathogen. However as the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines results in tissue damage or septic shock, precise control of these signaling pathways is essential and achieved via the induction of multiple negative feedback mechanisms. miRNAs are small regulatory RNAs that are able to affect protein expression, via the regulation of either mRNA stability or translation. Up-regulation of specific miRNAs could have the potential to modulate PRR signaling, as has been shown for both miR-146 and miR-155. Here we have analysed which miRNAs are up-regulated in mouse macrophages in response to the fungal pathogen heat killed Candida albicans and compared the profile to that obtained with the TLR4 ligand LPS. We found that in addition to miR-146 and miR-155, both Candida albicans and LPS were also able to up-regulate miR-455 and miR-125a. Analysis of the signaling pathways required showed that NFκB was necessary for the transcription of all 4 pri-miRNAs, while the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways were also required for pri-miR-125a transcription. In addition the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was found to be able to induce miR-146a and b, but inhibited miR-155 induction. These results suggest that miR-455, miR-125, miR-146 and miR-155 may play important roles in regulating macrophage function following PRR stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2063472038,"Alzheimer disease is intimately linked to an excess amount of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain. Thus, therapeutic inhibition of Aβ production is an attractive clinical approach to treat this disease. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence that the treatment of Tg2576 transgenic mice with an inhibitor of β-secretase, GRL-8234, rescues the age-related cognitive decline. We demonstrated that the injected GRL-8234 effectively enters the brain and rapidly decreases soluble Aβ in the brain of Tg2576 mice. The rescue of cognition, which was observed only after long-term inhibitor treatment ranging from 5 to 7.5 mo, was associated with a decrease of brain amyloid-β plaque load. We also found no accumulation of amyloid-β precursor protein after several months of inhibitor treatment. These observations substantiate the idea that Aβ accumulation plays a major role in the cognitive decline of Tg2576 mice and support the concept of Aβ reduction therapy as a treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2084719535,"Optineurin is a gene linked to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Paget disease of bone, and glaucoma, a major blinding disease. Mutations such as E50K were identified in glaucoma patients. We investigated herein the involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) and autophagy, two major routes for protein clearance, in processing of optineurin in a retinal ganglion cell model line RGC5 and neuronal PC12 cells. It was found that the endogenous optineurin level in neuronal cells was increased by treatment of proteasomal inhibitor but not by autophagic and lysosomal inhibitors. Multiple bands immunoreactive to anti-ubiquitin were seen in the optineurin pulldown, indicating that optineurin was ubiquitinated. In cells overexpressing wild type and E50K optineurin, the level of the proteasome regulatory β5 subunit (PSMB5, indicative of proteasome activity) was reduced, whereas that for autophagy marker microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 was enhanced compared with controls. Autophagosome formation was detected by electron microscopy. The foci formed after optineurin transfection were increased upon treatment of an autophagic inhibitor but were decreased by treatment of an inducer, rapamycin. Moreover, the level of optineurin-triggered apoptosis was reduced by rapamycin. This study thus provides compelling evidence that in a normal homeostatic situation, the turnover of endogenous optineurin involves mainly UPP. When optineurin is up-regulated or mutated, the UPP function is compromised, and autophagy comes into play. A decreased PSMB5 level and an induced autophagy were also demonstrated in vivo in retinal ganglion cells of E50K transgenic mice, validating and making relevant the in vitro findings."
https://openalex.org/W2029723755,"When dietary choline is restricted, most men and postmenopausal women develop multiorgan dysfunction marked by hepatic steatosis (choline deficiency syndrome (CDS)). However, a significant subset of premenopausal women is protected from CDS. Because hepatic PEMT (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) catalyzes de novo biosynthesis of choline and this gene is under estrogenic control, we hypothesized that there are SNPs in PEMT that disrupt the hormonal regulation of PEMT and thereby put women at risk for CDS. In this study, we performed transcript-specific gene expression analysis, which revealed that estrogen regulates PEMT in an isoform-specific fashion. Locus-wide SNP analysis identified a risk-associated haplotype that was selectively associated with loss of hormonal activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, analyzed by locus-wide microarray studies, comprehensively identified regions of estrogen receptor binding in PEMT. The polymorphism (rs12325817) most highly linked with the development of CDS (p < 0.00006) was located within 1 kb of the critical estrogen response element. The risk allele failed to bind either the estrogen receptor or the pioneer factor FOXA1. These data demonstrate that allele-specific ablation of estrogen receptor-DNA interaction in the PEMT locus prevents hormone-inducible PEMT expression, conferring risk of CDS in women."
https://openalex.org/W2038844863,"The response regulator SsrB activates expression of genes encoded within and outside of a pathogenicity island (SPI-2), which is required for systemic infection of Salmonella. SsrB binds upstream of the sifA, sifB, and sseJ effector genes and directly regulates transcription. SsrB also relieves gene silencing by the nucleoid protein H-NS. Single molecule experiments with magnetic tweezers demonstrated that SsrB displaces H-NS from DNA only when it is bound in a polymerization (stiffening) mode and not when H-NS is bound to DNA in the bridging mode. Thus, in contrast to previous views, the polymerization binding mode of H-NS is the relevant form for counter-silencing by SsrB. Our results reveal that response regulators can directly activate transcription and also relieve H-NS silencing. This study adds to the repertoire of mechanisms by which NarL/FixJ subfamily members regulate transcription. Because SsrB-dependent promoters are diversely organized, additional mechanisms of transcriptional activation at other loci are likely."
https://openalex.org/W1964914409,"Mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) have been identified as major genetic determinants of Parkinson's disease (PD). The most prevalent mutation, G2019S, increases LRRK2's kinase activity, therefore understanding the sites and substrates that LRRK2 phosphorylates is critical to understanding its role in disease aetiology. Since the physiological substrates of this kinase are unknown, we set out to reveal potential targets of LRRK2 G2019S by identifying its favored phosphorylation motif. A non-biased screen of an oriented peptide library elucidated F/Y-x-T-x-R/K as the core dependent substrate sequence. Bioinformatic analysis of the consensus phosphorylation motif identified several novel candidate substrates that potentially function in neuronal pathophysiology. Peptides corresponding to the most PD relevant proteins were efficiently phosphorylated by LRRK2 in vitro. Interestingly, the phosphomotif was also identified within LRRK2 itself. Autophosphorylation was detected by mass spectrometry and biochemical means at the only F-x-T-x-R site (Thr 1410) within LRRK2. The relevance of this site was assessed by measuring effects of mutations on autophosphorylation, kinase activity, GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis, and LRRK2 multimerization. These studies indicate that modification of Thr1410 subtly regulates GTP hydrolysis by LRRK2, but with minimal effects on other parameters measured. Together the identification of LRRK2's phosphorylation consensus motif, and the functional consequences of its phosphorylation, provide insights into downstream LRRK2-signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2006774357,"Competitive inhibition of transcription factors by small proteins is an intriguing component of gene regulatory networks in both animals and plants. The small interfering proteins possess limited sequence homologies to specific transcription factors but lack one or more protein motifs required for transcription factor activities. They interfere with the activities of transcription factors, such as DNA binding and transcriptional activation, by forming nonfunctional heterodimers. A potential example is the Arabidopsis MIF1 (mini zinc finger 1) protein consisting of 101 residues. It has a zinc finger domain but lacks other protein motifs normally present in transcription factors. In this work, we show that MIF1 and its functional homologues physically interact with a group of zinc finger homeodomain (ZHD) transcription factors, such as ZHD5, that regulate floral architecture and leaf development. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that MIF1 blocks the DNA binding activity of ZHD5 homodimers by competitively forming MIF1-ZHD5 heterodimers. Accordingly, the transcriptional activation activity of ZHD5 was significantly suppressed by MIF1 coexpressed transiently in Arabidopsis protoplasts. Notably, MIF1 also prevents ZHD5 from nuclear localization. Although ZHD5 was localized exclusively in the nucleus, it was scattered throughout the cytoplasm when MIF1 was coexpressed. Transgenic plants overexpressing the ZHD5 gene (35S:ZHD5) exhibited accelerated growth with larger leaves. Consistent with the negative regulation of ZHD5 by MIF1, the 35S:ZHD5 phenotypes were diminished by MIF1 coexpression. These observations indicate that MIF1 regulates the ZHD5 activities in a dual step manner: nuclear import and DNA binding.

https://openalex.org/W2069215536,"The inheritance of DNA methylation patterns is a popular theory to explain the influence of parental genetic and environmental factors on the phenotype of their offspring but few studies have examined this relationship in humans. Using 120 paired maternal-umbilical cord blood samples randomly selected from a prospective birth cohort in Bangladesh, we quantified DNA methylation by pyrosequencing seven CpG positions in the promoter region of p16, four CpG positions in the promoter region of p53, LINE-1 and Alu. Positive correlations were observed between maternal and umbilical cord blood at p16, LINE-1, and Alu but not p53. Multiple linear regression models observed a significant association between maternal and umbilical cord blood at LINE-1 and Alu (LINE-1: β = 0.63, p<0.0001; Alu: β = 0.28, p = 0.009). After adjusting for multiple comparisons, maternal methylation of p16 at position 4 significantly predicted methylation at the same position in umbilical cord blood (β = 0.43, p = <0.0001). These models explained 48%, 5% and 16% of the observed variability in umbilical cord %5mC for LINE-1, Alu and p16 at position 4, respectively. These results suggest that DNA methylation in maternal blood was correlated with her offspring at LINE-1, Alu, and p16 but not p53. Additional studies are needed to confirm whether these observed associations were due to the inheritance of epigenetic events or the shared environment between mother and fetus. Future studies should also use a multi-generational family-based design that would quantify both maternal and paternal contributions to DNA methylation in offspring across more than one generation."

Subjects were assigned 4:1 to receive 2 doses of H1N1 LAIV or placebo 28 days apart. The primary safety endpoint was fever ≥38.3°C during days 1-8 after the first dose; the primary immunogenicity endpoint was the proportion of subjects experiencing a postdose seroresponse. Solicited symptoms and adverse events were recorded for 14 days after each dose and safety data were collected for 180 days post-final dose. In total, 326 children (H1N1 LAIV, n = 261; placebo, n = 65) and 300 adults (H1N1 LAIV, n = 240; placebo, n = 60) were enrolled. After dose 1, fever ≥38.3°C occurred in 4 (1.5%) pediatric vaccine recipients and 1 (1.5%) placebo recipient (rate difference, 0%; 95% CI: -6.4%, 3.1%). No adults experienced fever following dose 1. Seroresponse rates in children (H1N1 LAIV vs. placebo) were 11.1% vs. 6.3% after dose 1 (rate difference, 4.8%; 95% CI: -9.6%, 13.8%) and 32.0% vs. 14.5% after dose 2 (rate difference, 17.5%; 95% CI: 5.5%, 27.1%).

Solicited symptoms after dose 1 (H1N1 LAIV vs. placebo) occurred in 37.5% vs. 32.3% of children and 41.7% vs. 31.7% of adults. Solicited symptoms occurred less frequently after dose 2 in adults and children. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred.In subjects aged 2 to 49 years, two doses of H1N1 LAIV have a safety and immunogenicity profile similar to other previously studied and efficacious formulations of seasonal trivalent LAIV.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00946101, NCT00945893."
https://openalex.org/W2031350870,"Interpretation of stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen (δ(13)C and δ(15)N) is generally based on the assumption that with each trophic level there is a constant enrichment in the heavier isotope, leading to diet-tissue discrimination factors of 3.4‰ for (15)N (ΔN) and ∼0.5‰ for (13)C (ΔC). Diet-tissue discrimination factors determined from paired tissue and gut samples taken from 152 individuals from 26 fish species at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia demonstrate a large amount of variability around constant values. While caution is necessary in using gut contents to represent diet due to the potential for high temporal variability, there were significant effects of trophic position and season that may also lead to variability in ΔN under natural conditions. Nitrogen enrichment increased significantly at higher trophic levels (higher tissue δ(15)N), with significantly higher ΔN in carnivorous species. Changes in diet led to significant changes in ΔN, but not tissue δ(15)N, between seasons for several species: Acanthurus triostegus, Chromis viridis, Parupeneus signatus and Pomacentrus moluccensis. These results confirm that the use of meta-analysis averages for ΔN is likely to be inappropriate for accurately determining diets and trophic relationships using tissue stable isotope ratios.

A plethora of data shows that proinflammatory cytokines are produced in pancreatic islets by infiltrating mononuclear immune cells. Here, we show that pancreatic islet α cells and β cells express tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and other cytokines capable of promoting islet inflammation when exposed to interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Cytokine expression by β cells was dependent on calcineurin (CN)/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) and MAPK signaling. NFAT associated with the TNF-α promoter in response to stimuli and synergistically activated promoter activity with ATF2 and c-Jun. In contrast, the β-cell-specific transcriptional activator MafA could repress NFAT-mediated TNF-α gene expression whenever C/EBP-β was bound to the promoter. NFAT differentially regulated the TNF-α gene depending upon the expression and MAPK-dependent activation of interacting basic leucine zipper partners in β cells. Both p38 and JNK were required for induction of TNF-α mRNA and protein expression. Collectively, the data show that glucose and IL-1β can activate signaling pathways, which control induction and repression of cytokines in pancreatic endocrine cells. Thus, by these mechanisms, pancreatic β cells themselves may contribute to islet inflammation and their own immunological destruction in the pathogenesis of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1991167961,"In vivo, KCNQ1 α-subunits associate with the β-subunit KCNE1 to generate the slowly activating cardiac potassium current (I(Ks)). Structurally, they share their topology with other Kv channels and consist out of six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) with the S1-S4 segments forming the voltage-sensing domain (VSD). The opening or closure of the intracellular channel gate, which localizes at the bottom of the S6 segment, is directly controlled by the movement of the VSD via an electromechanical coupling. In other Kv channels, this electromechanical coupling is realized by an interaction between the S4-S5 linker (S4S5(L)) and the C-terminal end of S6 (S6(T)). Previously we reported that substitutions for Leu(353) in S6(T) resulted in channels that failed to close completely. Closure could be incomplete because Leu(353) itself is the pore-occluding residue of the channel gate or because of a distorted electromechanical coupling. To resolve this and to address the role of S4S5(L) in KCNQ1 channel gating, we performed an alanine/tryptophan substitution scan of S4S5(L). The residues with a ""high impact"" on channel gating (when mutated) clustered on one side of the S4S5(L) α-helix. Hence, this side of S4S5(L) most likely contributes to the electromechanical coupling and finds its residue counterparts in S6(T). Accordingly, substitutions for Val(254) resulted in channels that were partially constitutively open and the ability to close completely was rescued by combination with substitutions for Leu(353) in S6(T). Double mutant cycle analysis supported this cross-talk indicating that both residues come in close contact and stabilize the closed state of the channel."

However, the presence of Th17 in glia-derived tumors of the central nervous system has not been studied. Methodology/Principal Findings In this report, we demonstrate that mRNA expression for the Th17 cell cytokine IL-17A, as well as Th17 cells, are present in human glioma. The mRNA expression for IL-17A in glioma was recapitulated in an immunocompetent mouse model of malignant glioma. Furthermore, the presence of Th17 cells was confirmed in both human and mouse glioma. Interestingly, some Th17 cells present in mouse glioma co-expressed the Th1 and Th2 lineage markers, IFN-γ and IL-4, respectively, but predominantly co-expressed the Treg lineage marker FoxP3. Conclusions These data confirm the presence of Th17 cells in glia-derived CNS tumors and provide the rationale for further investigation into the role of Th17 cells in malignant glioma."

Phosphorylation of Ser-48, Ser-303, and Ser-424 by cyclin-dependent kinases (cdks) increases RUNX1 trans-activation activity without perturbing p300 interaction. We now find that endogenous RUNX1 interacts with endogenous HDAC1 or HDAC3. Mutation of the three RUNX1 serines to aspartic acid reduces co-immunoprecipitation with HDAC1 or HDAC3 when expressed in 293T cells; mutation of these three serines to alanine increases HDAC interaction, and mutation of each serine individually to aspartic acid also reduces these interactions. GST-RUNX1 isolated from bacterial extracts bound in vitro translated HDAC1 or HDAC3, and these interactions were weakened by mutation of Ser-48, Ser-303, and Ser-424 to aspartic acid. The ability of RUNX1 phosphorylation and not only serine to aspartic acid conversion to reduce HDAC1 binding was demonstrated using wild-type GST-RUNX1 phosphorylated in vitro using cdk1/cyclinB and by exposure of 293T cells transduced with RUNX1 and HDAC1 to roscovitine, a cdk inhibitor. Finally, RUNX1 or RUNX1(tripleD), in which Ser-48, Ser-303, and Ser-424 are mutated to aspartic acid, stimulated proliferation of transduced, lineage-negative murine marrow progenitors more potently than did RUNX1(tripleA), in which these serines are mutated to alanine, suggesting that stimulation of RUNX1 trans-activation by cdk-mediated reduction in HDAC interaction increases marrow progenitor cell proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2050204707,"The ability of microorganisms to adapt to changing environments challenges the prediction of their history-dependent behavior. Cellular biomarkers that are quantitatively correlated to stress adaptive behavior will facilitate our ability to predict the impact of these adaptive traits. Here, we present a framework for identifying cellular biomarkers for mild stress induced enhanced microbial robustness towards lethal stresses. Several candidate-biomarkers were selected by comparing the genome-wide transcriptome profiles of our model-organism Bacillus cereus upon exposure to four mild stress conditions (mild heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress). These candidate-biomarkers—a transcriptional regulator (activating general stress responses), enzymes (removing reactive oxygen species), and chaperones and proteases (maintaining protein quality)—were quantitatively determined at transcript, protein and/or activity level upon exposure to mild heat, acid, salt and oxidative stress for various time intervals. Both unstressed and mild stress treated cells were also exposed to lethal stress conditions (severe heat, acid and oxidative stress) to quantify the robustness advantage provided by mild stress pretreatment. To evaluate whether the candidate-biomarkers could predict the robustness enhancement towards lethal stress elicited by mild stress pretreatment, the biomarker responses upon mild stress treatment were correlated to mild stress induced robustness towards lethal stress. Both short- and long-term biomarkers could be identified of which their induction levels were correlated to mild stress induced enhanced robustness towards lethal heat, acid and/or oxidative stress, respectively, and are therefore predictive cellular indicators for mild stress induced enhanced robustness. The identified biomarkers are among the most consistently induced cellular components in stress responses and ubiquitous in biology, supporting extrapolation to other microorganisms than B. cereus. Our quantitative, systematic approach provides a framework to search for these biomarkers and to evaluate their predictive quality in order to select promising biomarkers that can serve to early detect and predict adaptive traits."
https://openalex.org/W2122256393,"Background Local plant-soil associations are commonly studied at the species-level, while associations at the level of nodes within a phylogeny have been less well explored. Understanding associations within a phylogenetic context, however, can improve our ability to make predictions across systems and can advance our understanding of the role of evolutionary history in structuring communities. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we quantified evolutionary signal in plant-soil associations using a DNA sequence-based community phylogeny and several soil variables (e.g., extractable phosphorus, aluminum and manganese, pH, and slope as a proxy for soil water). We used published plant distributional data from the 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Republic of Panamá. Our results suggest some groups of closely related species do share similar soil associations. Most notably, the node shared by Myrtaceae and Vochysiaceae was associated with high levels of aluminum, a potentially toxic element. The node shared by Apocynaceae was associated with high extractable phosphorus, a nutrient that could be limiting on a taxon specific level. The node shared by the large group of Laurales and Magnoliales was associated with both low extractable phosphorus and with steeper slope. Despite significant node-specific associations, this study detected little to no phylogeny-wide signal. We consider the majority of the ‘traits’ (i.e., soil variables) evaluated to fall within the category of ecological traits. We suggest that, given this category of traits, phylogeny-wide signal might not be expected while node-specific signals can still indicate phylogenetic structure with respect to the variable of interest. Conclusions Within the BCI forest dynamics plot, distributions of some plant taxa are associated with local-scale differences in soil variables when evaluated at individual nodes within the phylogenetic tree, but they are not detectable by phylogeny-wide signal. Trends highlighted in this analysis suggest how plant-soil associations may drive plant distributions and diversity at the local-scale."

To further explore the role of XOR in the inflammatory state of MNP, we studied MNP isolated from inflammatory lungs combined with analyses of MNP cell lines. We demonstrated that XOR activity was increased in inflammatory MNP following insufflation of Th-1 cytokines in vivo and that activity was specifically increased by MNP differentiation. Inhibition of XOR reduced levels of CINC-1 secreted by MNP. Expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) in purified rat lung MNP and MNP cell lines reflected both the presence of PPARγ isoforms and PPARγ SUMOylation, and XOR inhibitors increased levels of SUMO-PPARγ in MNP cell lines. Both ectopic overexpression of XOR cDNA and uric acid supplementation reduced SUMO-PPARγ in MNP cells. Levels of the M2 markers CD36, CD206, and arginase-1 were modulated by uric acid and oxonic acid, whereas siRNA to SUMO-1 or PIAS-1 also reduced arginase-1 in RAW264.7 cells.

In this work, we report that the splicing activity of the intein present in the RecA recombinase of M. tuberculosis is potently inhibited by the anticancer drug cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloro-platinum(II)). This previously unrecognized activity of cisplatin was established using both an in vitro intein splicing assay, which yielded an IC50 of ∼2 μm, and a genetic reporter for intein splicing in Escherichia coli.

Here we studied the regulation of JAM-A expression in cultured brain EC and evaluated sJAM-A as a serum biomarker of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function.As previously reported in non-CNS EC types, pro-inflammatory stimulation of primary or immortalized (hCMEC/D3) human brain microvascular EC (HBMEC) induced a redistribution of cell-bound JAM-A on the cell surface away from tight junctions, along with a dissociation from the cytoskeleton. This was paralleled by reduced immunocytochemical staining of occludin and zonula occludens-1 as well as by increased paracellular permeability for dextran 3000. Both a self-developed ELISA test and Western blot analysis detected a constitutive sJAM-A release by HBMEC into culture supernatants, which importantly was unaffected by pro-inflammatory or hypoxia/reoxygenation challenge. Accordingly, serum levels of sJAM-A were unaltered in 14 patients with clinically active multiple sclerosis compared to 45 stable patients and remained unchanged in 13 patients with acute ischemic non-small vessel stroke over time.Soluble JAM-A was not suited as a biomarker of BBB breakdown in our hands. The unexpected non-inducibility of sJAM-A release at the human BBB might contribute to a particular resistance of brain EC to inflammatory stimuli, protecting the CNS compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2139240266,"Various types of stem cells have been shown to have beneficial effects on cardiac function. It is still debated whether fusion of injected stem cells with local resident cardiomyocytes is one of the mechanisms. To better understand the role of fusion in stem cell-based myocardial regeneration, the present study was designed to investigate the fate of human adipose tissue-derived stem cells (hASCs) fused with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes in vitro. hASCs labeled with the green fluorescent probe Vybrant DiO were cocultured with neonatal rat cardiomyocytes labeled with the red fluorescent probe Vybrant Dil and then treated with fusion-inducing hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ). Cells that incorporated both red and green fluorescent signals were considered to be hASCs that had fused with rat cardiomyocytes. Fusion efficiency was 19.86 ± 4.84% at 5 d after treatment with HVJ. Most fused cells displayed cardiomyocyte-like morphology and exhibited spontaneous rhythmic contraction. Both immunofluorescence staining and lentiviral vector labeling showed that fused cells contained separate rat cardiomyocyte and hASC nuclei. Immunofluorescence staining assays demonstrated that human nuclei in fused cells still expressed the proliferation marker Ki67. In addition, hASCs fused with rat cardiomyocytes were positive for troponin I. Whole-cell voltage-clamp analysis demonstrated action potentials in beating fused cells. RT-PCR analysis using rat- or human-specific myosin heavy chain primers revealed that the myosin heavy-chain expression in fused cells was derived from rat cardiomyocytes. Real-time PCR identified expression of human troponin T in fused cells and the presence of rat cardiomyocytes induced a cardiomyogenic protein expression of troponin T in human ASCs. This study illustrates that hASCs exhibit both stem cell (proliferation) and cardiomyocyte properties (action potential and spontaneous rhythmic beating) after fusion with rat cardiomyocytes, supporting the theory that fusion, even if artificially induced in our study, could indeed be a mechanism for cardiomyocyte renewal in the heart.—Metzele, R., Alt, C., Bai, X., Yan, Y., Zhang, Z., Pan, Z., Coleman, M., Vykoukal, J., Song, Y.-H., Alt, E.

https://openalex.org/W1968603229,"Biochemical purifications from mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes revealed that vertebrate Mi-2 proteins reside in multisubunit NuRD (Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase) complexes. Since all NuRD subunits are highly conserved in the genomes of C. elegans and Drosophila, it was suggested that NuRD complexes also exist in invertebrates. Recently, a novel dMec complex, composed of dMi-2 and dMEP-1 was identified in Drosophila. The genome of C. elegans encodes two highly homologous Mi-2 orthologues, LET-418 and CHD-3. Here we demonstrate that these proteins define at least three different protein complexes, two distinct NuRD complexes and one MEC complex. The two canonical NuRD complexes share the same core subunits HDA-1/HDAC, LIN-53/RbAp and LIN-40/MTA, but differ in their Mi-2 orthologues LET-418 or CHD-3. LET-418 but not CHD-3, interacts with the Krüppel-like protein MEP-1 in a distinct complex, the MEC complex. Based on microarrays analyses, we propose that MEC constitutes an important LET-418 containing regulatory complex during C. elegans embryonic and early larval development. It is required for the repression of germline potential in somatic cells and acts when blastomeres are still dividing and differentiating. The two NuRD complexes may not be important for the early development, but may act later during postembryonic development. Altogether, our data suggest a considerable complexity in the composition, the developmental function and the tissue-specificity of the different C. elegans Mi-2 complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2017555338,"TGF-β1 is overexpressed in wound repair and in most proliferative disorders including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. The stromal microenvironment at these sites is reactive and typified by altered phenotype, matrix deposition, inflammatory responses, and alterations in nerve density and biology. TGF-β1 is known to modulate several stromal responses; however there are few transgenic models to study its integrated biology. To address the actions of TGF-β1 in prostate disorders, we targeted expression of an epitope tagged and constitutively active TGF-β1 via the enhanced probasin promoter to the murine prostate gland epithelium. Transgenic mice developed age-dependent lesions leading to severe, yet focal attenuation of epithelium, and a discontinuous basal lamina. These changes were associated with elevated fibroplasia and frequency of collagenous micronodules in collapsed acini, along with an induced inflammation in nerve ganglia and small vessels. Elevated recruitment of CD115+ myeloid cells but not mature macrophages was observed in nerve ganglia, also in an age-dependent manner. Similar phenotypic changes were observed using a human prostate epithelium tissue recombination xenograft model, where epithelial cells engineered to overexpress TGF-β1 induced fibrosis and altered matrix deposition concurrent with inflammation in the stromal compartment. Together, these data suggest that elevated TGF-β1 expression induces a fibroplasia stromal response associated with breach of epithelial wall structure and inflammatory involvement of nerve ganglia and vessels. The novel findings of ganglia and vessel inflammation associated with formation of collagenous micronodules in collapsed acini is important as each of these are observed in human prostate carcinoma and may play a role in disease progression."

Downstream of GK, glucose metabolism leads to an elevation of the ATP:ADP ratio to a point where it promotes closure of KATP channels, resulting in the depolarization of the β-cell plasma membrane and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium to enter the cytosol and promote insulin exocytosis (4Prentki M.

The importance of ARNT/HIF-1β in GSIS was evidenced by the diminished glucose competence in islets obtained from β-cell-specific ARNT/HIF-1β knock-out mice as well as in Min6 cells where the transcription factor was effectively silenced by siRNA technology (35Gunton J.E.

We demonstrate that impairment in GSIS become eminent when ARNT/HIF-1β is silenced in our INS-1-derived 832/13 cells. Our novel findings that ARNT/HIF-1β plays a role in regulating biphasic insulin secretion and anaplerosis as well as other key metabolic pathways suggest that the mechanism of ARNT/HIF-1β-regulated insulin release appears to be independent of ATP production and likely involves the altered KATP-independent pathway of insulin release.DISCUSSIONExpression profiling of type 2 diabetic human islets showed that ARNT/HIF-1β was reduced by 90% (35Gunton J.E.

In this study, we assessed the metabolic profile of pancreatic β-cells with low ARNT/HIF-1β expression levels to provide more insight into the metabolic pathways that are affected by ARNT/HIF-1β knockdown and to identify the underlying mechanisms that impair GSIS under these conditions.Based on the available literature, we hypothesized that ARNT/HIF-1β would be required for maintaining glycolytic flux and normal GSIS. Although we confirmed that GSIS was dramatically reduced, we found that glucose utilization was only decreased by 31%, and glucose oxidation and glucose-stimulated ATP production were not significantly altered. To gain more insight into the metabolic consequence of the loss of ARNT/HIF-1β, we employed a metabolomics approach to assess a wide range of cellular metabolites. As expected, glycolytic intermediates were significantly reduced in siARNT1-treated cells; however, the most dramatic reductions were seen for TCA intermediates suggesting that anaplerosis is an important target of ARNT/HIF-1β. These studies also demonstrate that the role of ARNT/HIF-1β in regulating insulin release in response to glucose is independent of altered glucose oxidation and ATP production and likely involves altered anaplerosis.Anaplerosis has been suggested to play an important role in insulin secretion. In β-cells, when glucose is abundant, the mitochondrial entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle occurs via PDH and PC in almost equal proportions, giving rise to the existence of two separate pyruvate pools, with one feeding acetyl-CoA into the TCA cycle for oxidation (PDH pathway) and the other leading to a net accumulation of TCA intermediates (PC pathway) (21Lu D.

In the PDH pathway, the increase in mitochondrial glucose metabolism and acetyl-CoA will promote the transfer of reducing equivalents into the respiratory chain, resulting in mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization and increased ATP production.

Our results support the idea that ARNT/HIF-1β plays a role in regulating anaplerosis as both anaplerotic related genes (PC, DIC, and OGC) and TCA intermediates are both reduced in response to lower ARNT/HIF-1β expression levels. We also found that anaplerosis was lower at low glucose, and this was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in basal insulin secretion in siARNT1- and siARNT2-treated cells. This suggests that anaplerosis may play a role in basal insulin secretion as well as high glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.Pyruvate cycling has been proposed to be a novel pathway involved in regulating insulin secretion by numerous groups (11Jensen M.V.

Pyruvate cycling has been suggested to generate two potentially important signaling molecules for insulin release, α-ketoglutarate and NADPH. NADPH can be produced via one of three pyruvate cycling pathways, the pyruvate/malate pathway, the pyruvate/citrate pathway, or the pyruvate/isocitrate pathway. A key NADPH-producing enzyme for both the pyruvate malate and pyruvate citrate pathways is the MEc (11Jensen M.V. Joseph J.W. Ronnebaum S.M. Burgess S.C. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. Am. J. Physiol.

Our results support a role for ARNT/HIF-1β in pyruvate cycling as important genes in the pathway are down-regulated (PC and MEc).Gunton et al. (35Gunton J.E. Kulkarni R.N. Yim S. Okada T. Hawthorne W.J. Tseng Y.H. Roberson R.S. Ricordi C. O'Connell P.J. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R.

Here, we confirm their findings as siRNA-mediated knockdown of ARNT/HIF-1β in INS-1-derived 832/13 cells also reduced GSIS by 60% when compared with control cells. We also found that both first and second phase insulin secretion was down-regulated in perifused pseudoislets. To identify the underlying mechanisms that cause this loss in glucose responsiveness, we initially measured glucose utilization and glucose oxidation. At 2 mm glucose, ARNT/HIF-1β knockdown did not significantly affect glucose utilization or glucose oxidation, which is in agreement with the observation that pyruvate levels did not deviate from control under these conditions. However, when exposed to 16.7 mm glucose, the glycolytic flux was clearly suppressed by ∼31% in siARNT1-treated cells, and this reduction in glycolysis was not accompanied by a drop in the glucose oxidation. These findings are in agreement with an earlier report showing that the expression levels of several glycolytic enzymes are lowered upon ARNT/HIF-1β knockdown (35Gunton J.E. Kulkarni R.N. Yim S. Okada T. Hawthorne W.J. Tseng Y.H. Roberson R.S. Ricordi C. O'Connell P.J. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R. Cell. 2005; 122: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Our data showing a lack of an effect on the oxidative entry of pyruvate into the TCA cycle is surprising considering that glycolytic flux was markedly reduced in ARNT/HIF-1β silenced β-cells.Others have established that either suppression or complete loss of ARNT/HIF-1β in β-cells does not significantly affect the expression levels of the glycolytic pacemaker, glucokinase, or the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT2 (35Gunton J.E. Kulkarni R.N. Yim S. Okada T. Hawthorne W.J. Tseng Y.H. Roberson R.S. Ricordi C. O'Connell P.J. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R. Cell. 2005; 122: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); however, our results suggest that there may be an effect on GLUT2 and GK. Although in our experiments GLUT2 and GK expressions are lower, the metabolomics results support the idea that overall glucose entry and glucokinase activity are not affected by ARNT/HIF-1β knockdown as glucose 6-phosphate levels were similar in siARNT1-treated cells exposed to the high glucose concentration. Therefore, it seems more likely that steps downstream of glucokinase have attained rate-limiting properties for glycolysis in β-cells where ARNT/HIF-1β function is impaired. One possible explanation is that low expression levels of other glycolytic enzymes, such as glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, phosphofructokinase, and aldolase, become limiting for the substrate flow-through glycolysis (35Gunton J.E. Kulkarni R.N. Yim S. Okada T. Hawthorne W.J. Tseng Y.H. Roberson R.S. Ricordi C. O'Connell P.J. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R. Cell. 2005; 122: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, we observed that the dihydroxyacetone phosphate and pyruvate levels were significantly lower in siARNT1-treated cells than in siControl-treated cells exposed to 16.7 mm glucose. The 31% reduction in glycolytic flux in siARNT1-treated cells was not reflected in a lack of an increase in glucose oxidation and the ATP:ADP ratio in response to glucose stimulation.The novel finding that reducing ARNT/HIF-1β levels leads to a profound reduction in PC, DIC, and OGC expression levels and a reduction in TCA metabolites, even though glucose oxidation and ATP production were unaltered, is an unexpected result. These collective changes in metabolite levels demonstrate that the oxidative entry of pyruvate is preserved when siARNT1-treated cells are placed under a stimulatory glucose regime and such is likely to occur at the expense of the anaplerotic input into the TCA cycle.Several arguments can be brought forward to support the idea that both anaplerotic input and pyruvate cycling activity are negatively affected by ARNT/HIF-1β knockdown. First, the reduction in glycolytic flux by ∼31% is disproportionate to the 65% lower pyruvate levels detected in ARNT/HIF-1β-silenced 832/13 cells suggesting that anaplerotic and pyruvate cycling pathways are sacrificed at the expenses of maintaining mitochondrial oxidation.Second, the glycolytic end product pyruvate and the TCA intermediates malate, citrate, and isocitrate, which collectively play a flux-determining role in the pyruvate cycling activity via the pyruvate-malate, pyruvate-citrate, and pyruvate-isocitrate shuttle, were significantly reduced by 50–70%. We also found that a key pyruvate cycling gene MEc was significantly reduced. As such, these pyruvate cycling metabolites control the amount of cytosolic NADPH being produced at stimulatory glucose concentrations, and this becomes particularly interesting from the perspective that NADPH has been proposed to act as a metabolic coupling factor (11Jensen M.V.

These observations suggest that the mitochondrial export of citrate via the citrate/isocitrate carrier (CIC), which provides an essential source of glucose carbon for lipogenesis (30Joseph J.W.

The abrogated glucose-stimulated fatty acid production in siARNT1-treated cells is relevant as the glucose-stimulated production of malonyl-CoA and LC-CoA has been suggested to serve as a metabolic coupling factor in GSIS (25Corkey B.E.

Our metabolic data also show that β-cells with low ARNT/HIF-1β levels have lost the ability to generate l-glutamate when glucose levels are raised from basal to stimulatory levels. This may represent another facet in the stimulus-secretion coupling that is affected by a profound reduction in ARNT/HIF-1β as l-glutamate has been proposed to act as a metabolic signal in the KATP channel-independent pathway that controls GSIS (42Maechler P. Wollheim C.B. Nature. 1999; 402: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar).Our data support the concept that reducing ARNT/HIF-1β expression inhibits insulin secretion by lowering glucose-stimulated anaplerosis without affecting glucose oxidation and ATP production. ARNT/HIF-1β may lower insulin secretion by decreasing a novel anaplerotic dependent pathway involved in insulin secretion called pyruvate cycling. However, the link between ARNT/HIF-1β and pyruvate cycling has not yet been established.In summary, we performed an extensive metabolic survey of β-cells with reduced ARNT/HIF-1β levels to identify the metabolic pathways that are affected by the transcription factor. We provide proof that ARNT/HIF-1β plays an important role in β-cell glucose metabolism as siRNA-mediated knockdown of the transcription factor causes a significant reduction in glycolytic flux, biphasic insulin secretion, and TCA substrate levels. Considering that glucose oxidation or glucose-induced ATP production was not significantly affected by ARNT/HIF-1β knockdown, the observed shift in the metabolic profile seems to be consistent with a marked reduction in anaplerosis. The idea that low levels of ARNT/HIF-1β negatively affects the anaplerotic input into the TCA cycle is furthermore supported by the observation that glucose-induced fatty acid and glutamate production are completely absent in siARNT1-treated 832/13 cells. Taken together, we provide evidence that ARNT/HIF-1β is absolutely required to keep pancreatic β-cells in a glucose-responsive state by ensuring sufficient substrate flow through the KATP-independent pathways that regulate GSIS (Fig. 8). IntroductionThe ability of the pancreatic β-cell to maintain glucose homeostasis critically depends on the existence of a functional glucose sensor that operates within the physiologic range of glucose concentrations (1Matschinsky F.M.

Downstream of GK, glucose metabolism leads to an elevation of the ATP:ADP ratio to a point where it promotes closure of KATP channels, resulting in the depolarization of the β-cell plasma membrane and opening of voltage-gated calcium channels, allowing calcium to enter the cytosol and promote insulin exocytosis (4Prentki M.

Our novel findings that ARNT/HIF-1β plays a role in regulating biphasic insulin secretion and anaplerosis as well as other key metabolic pathways suggest that the mechanism of ARNT/HIF-1β-regulated insulin release appears to be independent of ATP production and likely involves the altered KATP-independent pathway of insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W2091238367,"Ro ribonucleoprotein particles (Ro RNPs) consist of a non-coding Y RNA bound by Ro60, La and possibly other proteins. The physiological function of Ro RNPs is controversial as divergent functions have been reported for its different constituents. We have recently shown that Y RNAs are essential for the initiation of mammalian chromosomal DNA replication, whereas Ro RNPs are implicated in RNA stability and RNA quality control. Therefore, we investigate here the functional consequences of RNP formation between Ro60, La and nucleolin proteins with hY RNAs for human chromosomal DNA replication.We first immunoprecipitated Ro60, La and nucleolin together with associated hY RNAs from HeLa cytosolic cell extract, and analysed the protein and RNA compositions of these precipitated RNPs by Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR. We found that Y RNAs exist in several RNP complexes. One RNP comprises Ro60, La and hY RNA, and a different RNP comprises nucleolin and hY RNA. In addition about 50% of the Y RNAs in the extract are present outside of these two RNPs. Next, we immunodepleted these RNP complexes from the cytosolic extract and tested the ability of the depleted extracts to reconstitute DNA replication in a human cell-free system. We found that depletion of these RNP complexes from the cytosolic extract does not inhibit DNA replication in vitro. Finally, we tested if an excess of recombinant pure Ro or La protein inhibits Y RNA-dependent DNA replication in this cell-free system. We found that Ro60 and La proteins do not inhibit DNA replication in vitro.We conclude that RNPs containing hY RNAs and Ro60, La or nucleolin are not required for the function of hY RNAs in chromosomal DNA replication in a human cell-free system, which can be mediated by Y RNAs outside of these RNPs. These data suggest that Y RNAs can support different cellular functions depending on associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2134258957,"Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling components are expressed during retinal development in dynamic spatial and temporal patterns. To probe the competence of retinal cells to mount a transcriptional response to TH, reporters that included thyroid response elements (TREs) were introduced into developing retinal tissue. The TREs were placed upstream of a minimal TATA-box and two reporter genes, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). Six of the seven tested TREs were first tested in vitro where they were shown to drive TH-dependent expression. However, when introduced into the developing retina, the TREs reported in different cell types in both a TH-dependent and TH-independent manner, as well as revealed specific spatial patterns in their expression. The role of the known thyroid receptors (TR), TRα and TRβ, was probed using shRNAs, which were co-electroporated into the retina with the TREs. Some TREs were positively activated by TR+TH in the developing outer nuclear layer (ONL), where photoreceptors reside, as well as in the outer neuroblastic layer (ONBL) where cycling progenitor cells are located. Other TREs were actively repressed by TR+TH in cells of the ONBL. These data demonstrate that non-TRs can activate some TREs in a spatially regulated manner, whereas other TREs respond only to the known TRs, which also read out activity in a spatially regulated manner. The transcriptional response to even simple TREs provides a starting point for understanding the regulation of genes by TH, and highlights the complexity of transcriptional regulation within developing tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1988200984,"The generation of long-lived memory T cells is critical for successful vaccination but the factors controlling their differentiation are still poorly defined. We tested the hypothesis that the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling contributed to memory CD8(+) T cell generation.We manipulated the density of antigenic epitope presented by dendritic cells to mouse naïve CD8(+) T cells, without varying TCR affinity. Our results show that a two-fold decrease in antigen dose selectively affects memory CD8(+) T cell generation without influencing T cell expansion and acquisition of effector functions. Moreover, we show that low antigen dose alters the duration of the interaction between T cells and dendritic cells and finely tunes the expression level of the transcription factors Eomes and Bcl6. Furthermore, we demonstrate that priming with higher epitope density results in a 2-fold decrease in the expression of Neuron-derived orphan nuclear receptor 1 (Nor-1) and this correlates with a lower level of conversion of Bcl-2 into a pro-apoptotic molecule and an increased number of memory T cells.Our results show that the amount of antigen encountered by naïve CD8(+) T cells following immunization with dendritic cells does not influence the generation of functional effector CD8(+) T cells but rather the number of CD8(+) memory T cells that persist in the host. Our data support a model where antigenic epitope density sensed by CD8(+) T cells at priming influences memory generation by modulating Bcl6, Eomes and Nor-1 expression."

https://openalex.org/W1981903094,"Background Integrins are heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules, with 18 α (ITGA) and eight β (ITGB) subunits forming 24 heterodimers classified into five families. Certain integrins, especially the α4/α9 (ITGA4/ITGA9) family, interact with members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family. ADAM2 is among the better characterized and also of interest because of its role in sperm function. Having shown that ITGA9 on mouse eggs participates in mouse sperm-egg interactions, we sought to characterize ITGA4/ITGA9-ADAM2 interactions. Methodology/Principal Findings An anti-β1/ITGB1 function-blocking antibody that reduces sperm-egg binding significantly inhibited ADAM2 binding to mouse eggs. Analysis of integrin subunit expression indicates that mouse eggs could express at least ten different integrins, five in the RGD-binding family, two in the laminin-binding family, two in the collagen-binding family, and ITGA9-ITGB1. Adhesion assays to characterize ADAM2 interactions with ITGA4/ITGA9 family members produced the surprising result that RPMI 8866 cell adhesion to ADAM2 was inhibited by an anti-ITGA9 antibody, noteworthy because ITGA9 has only been reported to dimerize with ITGB1, and RPMI 8866 cells lack detectable ITGB1. Antibody and siRNA studies demonstrate that ITGB7 is the β subunit contributing to RPMI 8866 adhesion to ADAM2. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that a novel integrin α-β combination, ITGA9-ITGB7 (α9β7), in RPMI 8866 cells functions as a binding partner for ADAM2. ITGA9 had previously only been reported to dimerize with ITGB1. Although ITGA9-ITGB7 is unlikely to be a widely expressed integrin and appears to be the result of “compensatory dimerization” occurring in the context of little/no ITGB1 expression, the data indicate that ITGA9-ITGB7 functions as an ADAM binding partner in certain cellular contexts, with implications for mammalian fertilization and integrin function."
https://openalex.org/W2081490022,"Background Parasites can cause energetically costly behavioural and immunological responses which potentially can reduce host fitness. However, although most laboratory studies indicate that the metabolic rate of the host increases with parasite infestation, this has never been shown in free-living host populations. In fact, studies thus far have shown no effect of parasitism on field metabolic rate (FMR). Methodology and Results We tested the effect of parasites on the energy expenditure of a host by measuring FMR using doubly-labelled water in free-living Baluchistan gerbils (Gerbillus nanus) infested by naturally occurring fleas during winter, spring and summer. We showed for the first time that FMR of free-living G. nanus was significantly and positively correlated with parasite load in spring when parasite load was highest; this relationship approached significance in summer when parasite load was lowest but was insignificant in winter. Among seasons, winter FMRs were highest and summer FMRs were lowest in G. nanus. Discussion The lack of parasite effect on FMR in winter could be related to the fact that FMR rates were highest among seasons. In this season, thermoregulatory costs are high which may indicate that less energy could be allocated to defend against parasites or to compensate for other costly activities. The question about the cost of parasitism in nature is now one of the major themes in ecological physiology. Our study supports the hypothesis that parasites can elevate FMR of their hosts, at least under certain conditions. However, the effect is complex and factors such as season and parasite load are involved."
https://openalex.org/W2061874172,"The calcium ion (Ca2+) is an important messenger for signal transduction, and the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) changes in response to an excitation of the cell. To reveal the spatiotemporal properties of the propagation of an excitatory signal with action potentials in the primary visual cortical circuit, we conducted a Ca2+ imaging study on slices of the mouse visual cortex. Electrical stimulation of layer 4 evoked [Ca2+]i transients around the stimulus electrode. Subsequently, the high [Ca2+]i region mainly propagated perpendicular to the cortical layer (vertical propagation), with horizontal propagation being restricted. When the excitatory synaptic transmission was blocked, only weak and concentric [Ca2+]i transients were observed. When the action potential was blocked, the [Ca2+]i transients disappeared almost completely. These results suggested that the action potential contributed to the induction of the [Ca2+]i transients, and that excitatory synaptic connections were involved in the propagation of the high [Ca2+]i region in the primary visual cortical circuit. To elucidate the involvement of inhibitory synaptic connections in signal propagation in the primary visual cortex, the GABAA receptor inhibitor bicuculline was applied. In this case, the evoked signal propagated from layer 4 to the entire field of view, and the prolonged [Ca2+]i transients were observed compared with the control condition. Our results suggest that excitatory neurons are widely connected to each other over the entire primary visual cortex with recurrent synapses, and inhibitory neurons play a fundamental role in the organization of functional sub-networks by restricting the propagation of excitation signals."
https://openalex.org/W1983184451,"The first chloride transporter identified in the superfamily of ClC chloride channels was from Escherichia coli (EClC) (Accardi, A., and Miller, C. (2004) Nature 427, 803-807). Pathways, energetics, and mechanism of proton and chloride translocation and their coupling are up to now unclear. To bridge the hydrophobic gap of proton transport, we modeled four stable buried waters into both subunits of the WT EClC structure. Together they form a ""water wire"" connecting Glu-203 with the chloride at the central site, which in turn connects to Glu-148, the hypothetical proton exit site. Assuming the transient production of hydrochloride in the central chloride binding site of EClC, the water wire could establish a transmembrane proton transport pathway starting from Glu-203 all the way downstream onto Glu-148. We demonstrated by electrostatic and quantum chemical computations that protonation of the central chloride is energetically feasible. We characterized all chloride occupancies and protonation states possibly relevant for the proton-chloride transport cycle in EClC and constructed a working model. Accordingly, EClC evolves through states involving up to two excess protons and between one and three chlorides, which was required to fulfill the experimentally observed 2:1 stoichiometry. We show that the Y445F and E203H mutants of EClC can operate similarly, thus explaining why they exhibit almost WT activity levels. The proposed mechanism of coupled chloride-proton transport in EClC is consistent with available experimental data and allows predictions on the importance of specific amino acids, which may be probed by mutation experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2065873501,"Benign infantile convulsions and paroxysmal dyskinesia are episodic cerebral disorders that can share common genetic bases. They can be co-inherited as one single autosomal dominant trait (ICCA syndrome); the disease ICCA gene maps at chromosome 16p12-q12. Despite intensive and conventional mutation screening, the ICCA gene remains unknown to date. The critical area displays highly complicated genomic architecture and is the site of deletions and duplications associated with various diseases. The possibility that the ICCA syndrome is related to the existence of large-scale genomic alterations was addressed in the present study.A combination of whole genome and dedicated oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization coupled with quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used. Low copy number of a region corresponding to a genomic variant (Variation_7105) located at 16p11 nearby the centromere was detected with statistical significance at much higher frequency in patients from ICCA families than in ethnically matched controls. The genomic variant showed no apparent difference in size and copy number between patients and controls, making it very unlikely that the genomic alteration detected here is ICCA-specific. Furthermore, no other genomic alteration that would directly cause the ICCA syndrome in those nine families was detected in the ICCA critical area.Our data excluded that inherited genomic deletion or duplication events directly cause the ICCA syndrome; rather, they help narrowing down the critical ICCA region dramatically and indicate that the disease ICCA genetic defect lies very close to or within Variation_7105 and hence should now be searched in the corresponding genomic area and its surrounding regions."
https://openalex.org/W2153779089,"Background Agrobacterium tumefaciens has long been known to transform plant tissue in nature as part of its infection process. This natural mechanism has been utilised over the last few decades in laboratories world wide to genetically manipulate many species of plants. More recently this technology has been successfully applied to non-plant organisms in the laboratory, including fungi, where the plant wound hormone acetosyringone, an inducer of transformation, is supplied exogenously. In the natural environment it is possible that Agrobacterium and fungi may encounter each other at plant wound sites, where acetosyringone would be present, raising the possibility of natural gene transfer from bacterium to fungus. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigate this hypothesis through the development of experiments designed to replicate such a situation at a plant wound site. A. tumefaciens harbouring the plasmid pCAMDsRed was co-cultivated with the common plant pathogenic fungus Verticillium albo-atrum on a range of wounded plant tissues. Fungal transformants were obtained from co-cultivation on a range of plant tissue types, demonstrating that plant tissue provides sufficient vir gene inducers to allow A. tumefaciens to transform fungi in planta. Conclusions/Significance This work raises interesting questions about whether A. tumefaciens may be able to transform organisms other than plants in nature, or indeed should be considered during GM risk assessments, with further investigations required to determine whether this phenomenon has already occurred in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2025538272,"Superantigens (SAgs) are bacterial or viral toxins that bind MHC class II (MHC-II) molecules and T-cell receptor (TCR) in a nonconventional manner, inducing T-cell activation that leads to inflammatory cytokine production, which may result in acute toxic shock. In addition, the emerging threat of purpura fulminans and community-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus emphasizes the importance of a better characterization of SAg binding to their natural ligands that may allow the development of reagents to neutralize their action. The three-dimensional structure of the complex between a mouse TCR β chain (mVβ8.2) and staphylococcal enterotoxin G (SEG) at 2.0 Å resolution revealed a binding site that does not conserve the “hot spots” present in mVβ8.2-SEC2, mVβ8.2-SEC3, mVβ8.2-SEB, and mVβ8.2-SPEA complexes. Analysis of the mVβ8.2-SEG interface allowed us to explain the higher affinity of this complex compared with the others, which may account for the early activation of T-cells bearing mVβ8.2 by SEG. This mode of interaction between SEG and mVβ8.2 could be an adaptive advantage to bestow on the pathogen a faster rate of colonization of the host.

Superantigens (SAgs) 3The abbreviations used are: SAg, superantigens; TCR, T-cell receptor; SEB, staphylococcal enterotoxin B; SEC, staphylococcal enterotoxin C; SEU, staphylococcal enterotoxin U; SSA, streptococcal superantigen A; SPEA, streptococcal pyrogenic enterotoxin A; SEG, staphylococcal enterotoxin G; mVβ8, mouse TCR β chain; r.m.s., root mean square; CDR, complementary determining region; HV4, hypervariable region 4. are bacterial toxins or viral proteins that bind simultaneously as unprocessed molecules the T-cell receptor (TCR) and MHC-II molecules. As a consequence of this interaction, SAgs activate large numbers of T-cells, promoting a massive release of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-2, TNF-α, and TNF-β. These host cytokines are believed to be responsible for the most severe consequences of SAg intoxication, including capillary leak, renal failure, acute respiratory distress, and death. Systemic intoxication by SAgs can lead to a severe condition known as toxic shock syndrome (reviewed in Ref. 1Fraser J.D. Proft T. Immunol. Rev. 2008; 225: 226-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), which is an acute, multisystem, toxin-mediated illness, often resulting in multiorgan failure. Toxic shock syndrome represents the most devastating expression of a spectrum of diseases caused by SAg-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (reviewed in Ref. 2Lappin E. Ferguson A.J. Lancet Infect. Dis. 2009; 9: 281-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Bacterial SAgs have also been identified as category B agents of bioterrorism by the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention due to their extreme virulence and the ease with which they can be produced and disseminated. Most of the known SAgs share a characteristic three-dimensional structure and bind MHC-II outside of the peptide-binding groove (3Swaminathan S. Furey W. Pletcher J. Sax M.

On the other hand, the binding to the TCR is not yet so well characterized due to the few TCR-SAg complexes that have been crystallized (16Malchiodi E.L. Eisenstein E. Fields B.A. Ohlendorf D.H.

SAgs have been classified into five evolutionary groups or families based on their amino acid sequence (20McCormick J.K. Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). All members of group II, or the SEB family, which include SAgs from S. pyogenes SPEA and SSA and S. aureus SAgs SEB and SEC1–3 are known to interact with the mouse TCR Vβ8.2 (mVβ8.2) chain. Because mVβ8.2 was described as the principal TCR involved in experimental autoimmune encephalitis, and taking into account the potential role of SAgs in autoimmune diseases (21Brocke S. Hausmann S. Steinman L. Wucherpfennig K.W. Semin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Yarwood J.M. Leung D.Y. Schlievert P.M. FEMS Microbiol.

Immunol. 2003; 170: 2985-2992Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), it is important to analyze the binding of SAgs that stimulate T-cells carrying this particular β chain. Four members of this family, SEB, SEC2, SEC3, and SPEA, have been crystallized in complex with mVβ8.2, allowing detailed characterization of this interaction. The binding mode to mVβ8.2 is strictly conserved among the members of the SEB family and occurs through the variable region of the TCR β chain, contacting complementary determining region (CDR) 2, frameworks regions (FR) 2 and 3 and hypervariable region 4 (HV4) (17Fields B.A. Malchiodi E.L.

The streptococcal SAg SPEA also contacts CDR1 (19Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S. McCormick J.K. Tormo J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. Structure. 2002; 10: 687-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to the crystal structures, an extensive biophysical analysis of SAg mutants identified the energetic hot spots in binding to mVβ8.2 (24Leder L. Llera A. Lavoie P.M. Lebedeva M.I. Li H. Sékaly R.P. Bohach G.A. Gahr P.J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The SAgs from S. aureus SEG and SEU are the latest to be included in the SEB family (20McCormick J.K. Yarwood J.M. Schlievert P.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). SEG was identified by Munson et al. (25Munson S.H. Tremaine M.T. Betley M.J. Welch R.A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 3337-3348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is contained in the egc enterotoxin gene cluster with other four SAgs (26Jarraud S. Peyrat M.A. Lim A. Tristan A. Bes M. Mougel C. Etienne J. Vandenesch F. Bonneville M. Lina G. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). SEG is 233-residues-long, corresponding to a mature protein of 27 kDa, which shares 41 to 46% amino acid sequence identity with other members of the SEB family. SEG has being implicated in toxic shock syndrome and scarlet fever associated with infecting S. aureus strains that lack genes for the classical members of the pyrogenic toxin SAg, comprising genes sea-see and the tsst-1 (27Jarraud S. Cozon G. Vandenesch F. Bes M. Etienne J. Lina G. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 2446-2449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports showed a higher frequency of seg than the classical genes in S. aureus isolated from several sources (28Banks M.C. Kamel N.S. Zabriskie J.B. Larone D.H. Ursea D. Posnett D.N. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Becker K. Friedrich A.W. Lubritz G. Weilert M. Peters G. Von Eiff C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2003; 41: 1434-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). We recently reported that, in vivo, SEG stimulates mouse T-cells carrying Vβ7 and Vβ9 TCRs. Stimulation reached a maximum at day 4 or later after injection (30Fernández M.M. De Marzi M.C. Berguer P. Burzyn D. Langley R.J. Piazzon I. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as usually happens with T-cells stimulated by SEC2–3 or SEB (31MacDonald H.R. Baschieri S. Lees R.K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 32Renno T. Attinger A. Locatelli S. Bakker T. Vacheron S. MacDonald H.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6312-6315PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we also found that SEG stimulates an earlier, stronger, and more widespread stimulation of mVβ8.2-bearing T-cells, compared with other members of the SEB family, which reached a maximum at day 2 instead of day 4 or later (30Fernández M.M. De Marzi M.C. Berguer P. Burzyn D. Langley R.J. Piazzon I. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, we analyzed SEG binding to mVβ8.2 by surface plasmon resonance and isothermal titration calorimetry, which yielded similar results. The affinity (KD = 0.125 μm by isothermal titration calorimetry and 0.270 μm by surface plasmon resonance) is the highest reported for an interaction of a wild-type SAg and a TCR (33Fernández M.M. Bhattacharya S. De Marzi M.C. Brown P.H. Kerzic M. Schuck P. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Proteins. 2007; 68: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of SEB family members revealed that SEG has changes in three highly conserved key amino acid positions, N58S, Y88F, and Q206P (SEG numbering), that were predicted to contact mVβ8.2. The crystal structure of SEG in unbound form (33Fernández M.M. Bhattacharya S. De Marzi M.C. Brown P.H. Kerzic M. Schuck P. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Proteins. 2007; 68: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggested that deletions in the sequence and natural mutations of hot spot residues are responsible for structural remodeling of the putative TCR-binding surface but could not explain the high affinity mentioned above. We also analyzed SEG binding to a mutant of mVβ8.2 (designated L2CM) that displays high affinity for SEC3 (33Fernández M.M. Bhattacharya S. De Marzi M.C. Brown P.H. Kerzic M. Schuck P. Mariuzza R.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 50412-50421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We found that the mutated residues responsible for the increased affinity of L2CM for SEC3, as well as SSA, did not greatly improve the affinity for SEG (33Fernández M.M. Bhattacharya S. De Marzi M.C. Brown P.H. Kerzic M. Schuck P. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Proteins. 2007; 68: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structure of SEG bound to mVβ8.2 and L2CM and compare these structures with those of other SAgs bound to mVβ8.2. The cloning of SEG was described previously (30Fernández M.M. De Marzi M.C. Berguer P. Burzyn D. Langley R.J. Piazzon I. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli BL1(DE3) cells were transformed with seg cloned into the NcoI and BamHI sites of the pET22b expression vector. For expression of C-terminal His6-tagged SEG mature protein, BL21 cells were grown in LB medium/ampicillin 100 μg/ml at 30 °C and induced with 0.2 mm IPTG at an A600 of 1. SEG was expressed as a soluble protein in the bacterial periplasmic space and released by osmotic shock, using Tris-EDTA-sucrose buffer. Soluble SEG was purified using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The cloning of mouse TCR β chain mVβ8.2 and the high affinity mutant LC2M was described previously (34Yang J. Swaminathan C.P. Huang Y. Guan R. Cho S. Kieke M.C. Kranz D.M. Mariuzza R.A. Sundberg E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50412-50421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, Vβ8.2 and LC2M were cloned into expression vector pT7–7 and expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21(DE3). The inclusion bodies were washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and another three times with the same buffer without Triton X-100, and then solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 8 m urea, 2 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. For in vitro folding, solubilized TCR was diluted to a final concentration of 20–50 μg/ml into 1.0 m arginine, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm cysteamine and 0.5 mm cystamine. After 3 days at 4 °C, the folding mixture was concentrated, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and applied to a Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient. Further purification was carried out by size exclusion using a Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) in PBS. Purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS and mixed in an equimolar ratio for further complex purification by size exclusion chromatography. The exclusion volume containing the complex was concentrated to 7.5 mg/ml of protein prior to dialysis against 0.01 m HEPES (pH 7) and 0.02 m NaCl. Crystallization trials on the SEG-Vβ8.2 and SEG-L2CM complexes were carried out in hanging drops at an initial protein concentration of 3.25 mg/ml in the drop, by mixing 2 μl each of protein solution and mother liquor. Crystals of the SEG-Vβ8.2 and SEG-L2CM complexes grew at room temperature in 1.4 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), and 0.2 m sodium citrate, 30% isopropanol and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), respectively. SEG-Vβ8.2 and SEG-L2CM crystals were transferred to mother liquor containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data to 2.6 and 2.8 Å resolutions, respectively, were obtained at 100 K on an R-axis IV2+ image plate detector (Rigaku). Higher resolution data (2.0 and 2.6 Å, respectively) were collected using synchrotron radiation at beamline X-25 of the National Synchrotron Light Source, and were processed using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The SEG-Vβ8.2 and SEG-L2CM complex structures were determined by molecular replacement using the program Molrep in the CCP4 program suite (36Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr.

Two SEG-Vβ8.2 and eight SEG-L2CM complexes were found in the asymmetric unit with a Matthews coefficient of 3.65 Å3/Da and 4.03 Å3/Da, respectively (solvent content ∼65 and ∼70%, respectively). Initial refinement was performed using CNS with positional, simulated annealing and individual B factor refinement. Manual model rebuilding was carried out iteratively in XtalView (38McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar) using σA-weighted 2Fo-Fc maps.

Open table in a new tab We determined the structure of the complex between SEG and the mVβ8.2 chain to 2.0 Å resolution (Table 1). There are two SEG and two mVβ8.2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. All the regions of the complex are well ordered, with only the β4–β5 loop of SEG lacking electron density. SEG appears to be less ordered than the Vβ domain, as reflected by higher mean temperature (B) factors. Although two complexes are present in the asymmetric unit, their superposition does not indicate significant differences (0.26 and 0.15 Å for the Vβ chain and SEG, respectively). In addition, the same set of hydrogen bonds is observed, the van der Waals contacts involve the same residues, and the buried surface in both complexes exhibit no significant differences. The overall structure of the mVβ8.2-SEG complex is shown in Fig. 1A. The complex is formed through contacts between CDR2 and FR2 and -3 of the variable domain of the mVβ8.2 chain, which binds in the cleft between the small and large domains of SEG. Although SEG does not contact HV4 of mVβ8.2, the overall binding site of mVβ8.2-SEG is in close agreement with those previously described in the mVβ8.2-SEC2, mVβ8.2-SEC3, mVβ8.2-SEB, and mVβ8.2-SPEA complexes (17Fields B.A. Malchiodi E.L.

However, detailed interactions at the interface are different, as described below. The buried surface for mVβ8.2-SEG is 1285 Å2, with equal contributions from both molecules. This value is within the range observed in other mVβ8.2 complexes with S. aureus SAgs (17Fields B.A. Malchiodi E.L. Li H. Ysern X. Stauffacher C.V. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A.

By contrast, the complex of mVβ8.2 bound to S. pyogenes SAg SPEA displays a higher buried surface (1324 Å2) because SPEA also contacts the CDR1 loop of Vβ (19Sundberg E.J. Li H. Llera A.S.

The SEG-MHC-II complex has not been crystallized, but sequence and structural alignment of SEG (33Fernández M.M. Bhattacharya S. De Marzi M.C. Brown P.H. Kerzic M. Schuck P. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Proteins. 2007; 68: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) with SEB, the only SAg of the family crystallized in complex with DR1 (11Jardetzky T.S. Brown J.H. Gorga J.C.

Nature. 1994; 368: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), showed that the putative binding site is conserved and adjacent to the TCR-binding site. The “hot spot” residues identified in SEB and SEC3 (24Leder L. Llera A. Lavoie P.M. Lebedeva M.I. Li H. Sékaly R.P. Bohach G.A. Gahr P.J. Schlievert P.M. Karjalainen K. Mariuzza R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) that make the greatest energetic contribution to stabilization of the mVβ8.2-SAg complex (Asn-24, Tyr-88, and Gln-206; SEG numbering), as well as the energetically less important Asn-58, are strictly conserved in SEC1–3, SEB, SSA, and SPEA. The residues at positions 21, 27, 89, and 171, despite not being conserved throughout the SEB family, form part of the mVβ8.2 binding interface on the SAgs with less energetic contribution (9Li H. Llera A. Malchiodi E.L. Mariuzza R.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 435-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Sundberg E.J. Li Y. Mariuzza R.A. Curr. Opin.

J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 823-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The binding surface formed by all these residues is shared by the mVβ8.2-SEB, mVβ8.2-SEC2, mVβ8.2-SEC3, and mVβ8.2-SPEA complexes and thus are characteristic of group II SAgs for binding to mVβ8.2. However, SEG displays a substantially different binding surface. SEG uses 10 residues in the interaction with mVβ8.2: Phe-88 and Tyr-89 of the small domain, and Lys-19, Gly-20, Thr-21, Asn-24, Phe-171, Asp-172, Pro-203, and Phe-204 of the large domain (Fig. 1B). Five of these positions (21, 24, 88, 89, and 171), but not strictly the residues at each of them, correlate with those of SEB, SEC2–3, and SPEA interacting with mVβ8.2. Only the residue at position 24 (Asn) that contacts mVβ8.2 is strictly conserved in all five SAg complexes, as well as in all SAgs of the SEB family (33Fernández M.M. Bhattacharya S. De Marzi M.C. Brown P.H. Kerzic M. Schuck P. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Proteins. 2007; 68: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). SEG does not use residues 27, 58, and 206 in the interaction, as the other SAgs do, but uses Lys-19 and Gly-20 (both absent in the other SAgs), Asp-172 and Pro-203 (not conserved), and Phe-204 (present in all the SAgs of the SEB family). Residues at these positions do not contact mVβ8.2 in any other of the four complexes. These SEG residues can interact with mVβ8.2 due to insertions of three and one residues in the α1–α2 and β11–η2 loops of SEG, respectively (33Fernández M.M. Bhattacharya S. De Marzi M.C. Brown P.H. Kerzic M. Schuck P. Mariuzza R.A. Malchiodi E.L. Proteins. 2007; 68: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The hydrogen bonds established between these two loops and FR3 of mVβ8.2 are mostly between the main chain of the SAg and side chains of the TCR (Fig. 1B). Altogether, these SEG residues contribute 30% of the total hydrogen bonds and several van der Waals contacts to the interface. SEG displays an insertion of three residues in the α1α2 loop, which is absent in SEB, SEC3, and SPEA, promoting an interaction between FR3 Gly-58β and Lys-19SEG through an extra hydrogen bond and additional van der Waals contacts (Fig. 2A), which are possible due to a conformational change in the Lys-19SEG side chain after binding. In addition, Gly-20SEG and Asp-172SEG contribute with two extra hydrogen bonds to the interaction with FR3. These interactions are absent in the other complexes. Asn-24, which is conserved throughout the SEB family, makes five hydrogen bonds in SEG-mVβ8.2, compared with two in the SEB-mVβ8.2 and SEC3-mVβ8.2 complexes (Fig. 2B). The orientation of Pro-203SEG and Phe-204SEG allows the formation of several van der Waals contacts and a hydrogen bond with Glu-56β, which are absent in the other complexes (Fig. 2C and Table 2).TABLE 2mVβ8.2-SAg interactionsHydrogen bondsβSEGSEBSEC3Gly-53 OAsn-24 Oδ1Gln-206 Nϵ2Gln-206 Nϵ2Thr-55 NAsn-24 Oδ1Asn-24 Oδ1Asn-24 Oδ1Thr-55 OAsn-24 Oδ1Asn-24 Nδ2Asn-24 Nδ2Thr-55 OAsn-24 Nδ2Thr-18 Oγ1Glu-56 Oϵ1Asn-24 Nδ2Glu-56 Oϵ1Phe-204 NLys-57 NζAsp-172 Oδ1Thr-18 OLys-57 NζGly-20 OGly-58 OLys-19 NζPro-70Asn-58 Nδ2Asn-58 Nδ2van der Waals contactsβSEGSEBSEC3His-47Phe-171Leu-21Phe-171Tyr-50Tyr-89Tyr-89Val-89Pro-203Gly-51Val-89Ala-52Phe-88Tyr-88Tyr-88Gly-53Asn-24Asn-24Tyr-27Gln-206Ser-54Asn-24Asn-24Asn-24Tyr-89Val-89Asn-24Leu-21Thr-21Thr-55Phe-171Asn-24Asn-24Glu-23Phe-171Glu-56Pro-203Leu-21Thr-21Phe-204Asn-24Lys-57Thr-21Gly-17Gly-17Asp-172Leu-21Thr-21Gly-58Lys-19Tyr-65Phe-171Lys-66Phe-171Phe-171Phe-171Ala-67Phe-171Phe-171Phe-171Pro-70Asn-58Leu-56Ser-71Asn-58Asn-58 Open table in a new tab The mVβ8.2 residues in contact with SEG are as follo"
https://openalex.org/W2058997065,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporters but serves as a chloride channel dysfunctional in cystic fibrosis. The activity of CFTR is tightly controlled not only by ATP-driven dimerization of its nucleotide-binding domains but also by phosphorylation of a unique regulatory (R) domain by protein kinase A (PKA). The R domain has multiple excitatory phosphorylation sites, but Ser(737) and Ser(768) are inhibitory. The underlying mechanism is unclear. Here, sulfhydryl-specific cross-linking strategy was employed to demonstrate that Ser(768) or Ser(737) could interact with outwardly facing hydrophilic residues of cytoplasmic loop 3 regulating channel gating. Furthermore, mutation of these residues to alanines promoted channel opening by curcumin in an ATP-dependent manner even in the absence of PKA. However, mutation of Ser(768) and His(950) with different hydrogen bond donors or acceptors clearly changed ATP- and PKA-dependent channel activity no matter whether curcumin was present or not. More importantly, significant activation of a double mutant H950R/S768R needed only ATP. Finally, in vitro and in vivo single channel recordings suggest that Ser(768) may form a putative hydrogen bond with His(950) of cytoplasmic loop 3 to prevent channel opening by ATP in the non-phosphorylated state and by subsequent cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. These observations support an electron cryomicroscopy-based structural model on which the R domain is closed to cytoplasmic loops regulating channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2012883453,"Background Centromere identity is determined epigenetically by deposition of CenH3, a centromere-specific histone H3 variant that dictates kinetochore assembly. The molecular basis of the contribution of CenH3 to centromere/kinetochore functions is, however, incompletely understood, as its interactions with the rest of centromere/kinetochore components remain largely uncharacterised at the molecular/structural level. Principal Findings Here, we report on the contribution of Drosophila CenH3CID to recruitment of BubR1, a conserved kinetochore protein that is a core component of the spindle attachment checkpoint (SAC). This interaction is mediated by the N-terminal domain of CenH3CID (NCenH3CID), as tethering NCenH3CID to an ectopic reporter construct results in BubR1 recruitment and BubR1-dependent silencing of the reporter gene. Here, we also show that this interaction depends on a short arginine (R)-rich motif and that, most remarkably, it appears to be evolutionarily conserved, as tethering constructs carrying the highly divergent NCenH3 of budding yeast and human also induce silencing of the reporter. Interestingly, though NCenH3 shows an exceedingly low degree of conservation, the presence of R-rich motives is a common feature of NCenH3 from distant species. Finally, our results also indicate that two other conserved sequence motives within NCenH3CID might also be involved in interactions with kinetochore components. Conclusions These results unveil an unexpected contribution of the hypervariable N-domain of CenH3 to recruitment of kinetochore components, identifying simple R-rich motives within it as evolutionary conserved structural determinants involved in BubR1 recruitment."

This test is a further development of a previously described molecular typing technique that is based on length polymorphisms of the 16S-23S rDNA interspace region of S. aureus.A novel approach of IS-typing was performed in which binary profiles are created. 424 human and animal derived MRSA and MSSA isolates were tested and a subset of these isolates was compared with multi locus sequence typing (MLST) and Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP). Binary IS typing had a high discriminatory potential and a good correlation with MLST and AFLP.Binary IS typing is easy to perform and binary profiles can be generated in a standardized fashion. These two features, combined with the high correlation with MLST clonal complexes, make the technique applicable for large-scale inter-laboratory molecular epidemiological comparisons."

Here, we report that functional expression of the Eag channel is temperature-sensitive by a mechanism that is independent of trafficking or surface targeting of the channel protein. Eag channels in cells grown at 37 °C exhibit voltage-evoked gating charge movements but fail to conduct K+ ions. By mutagenesis and chimeric channel studies, we show that the N- and C-terminal regions are involved in controlling a step after movement of the voltage sensor, as well as in regulating biophysical properties of the Eag channel. Synthesis and assembly of Eag at high temperature disrupt the ability of these domains to carry out their function.

Voltage-gated K+ channels consist of a large family of proteins that selectively conduct potassium ions when activated by changes of membrane potential (1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). They consist of four subunits, each containing six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) that assemble together to form the voltage sensor and central pore domains (2Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 3Wray D. Eur. Biophys. J. 2009; 38: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). It is now well established that opening of these channels is initiated by conformational changes of the voltage sensor domains upon membrane depolarization. Little, however, is known regarding the molecular and physical mechanisms underlying the coupling between the voltage sensor and activation gate of these K+ channels (4Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 23-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Voltage-gated K+ channels diverge significantly in their N- and C-terminal (NT 4The abbreviations used are: NT, N-terminal; CT, C-terminal; mEag, mouse homologue of Eag; TM, transmembrane; hERG, human eag-related gene; ANOVA, analysis of variance; EGFP, enhanced GFP; pF, picofarad; TEA, tetraethylammonium. and CT) regions, and for many channels these domains have been shown to be important for binding of auxiliary subunits or modulators (5Levitan I.B. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The roles of intracellular domains in gating, activation, and inactivation are less well understood (6Jiang Y. Lee A.

The Drosophila ether-à-go-go channel (Eag) is the founding member of an evolutionarily conserved subfamily of voltage-gated K+ channels, which includes hERG (human eag-related gene), a channel that plays an important role in regulating cardiac excitability and maintaining normal cardiac rhythm (9Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 10Perrin M.J. Subbiah R.N. Vandenberg J.I. Hill A.P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). hERG channel dysfunction is responsible for a third of the congenital long QT syndrome and the vast majority of drug-induced long QT (10Perrin M.J. Subbiah R.N. Vandenberg J.I. Hill A.P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2008; 98: 137-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In flies, mutation of eag increases neuronal excitability and affects memory formation (11Ganetzky B. Wu C.F. J. Neurogenet. 1983; 1: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Griffith L.C. Wang J. Zhong Y. Wu C.F. Greenspan R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 10044-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This family of channels is therefore critical to the function of multiple types of excitable cells across the animal kingdom. Structurally, Eag family channels are related to both voltage-gated K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels as they not only have transmembrane domains for voltage sensing and K+ ion permeation but also contain a cyclic nucleotide-binding motif within their C-terminal regions (13Ganetzky B. Robertson G.A. Wilson G.F. Trudeau M.C. Titus S.A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 356-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 14Bauer C.K. Schwarz J.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although Eag family channels may not be directly gated by cyclic nucleotides, several lines of evidence have suggested their NT and CT domains are important to channel function. First, mutations in these regions can result in defective synthesis, trafficking, or gating of the channels. Such mutations in hERG channels are one of the most prevalent causes of congenital human long QT syndrome (15Jenke M. Sánchez A. Monje F. Stühmer W. Weseloh R.M. Pardo L.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 395-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Welch W.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1432-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Second, Eag channel activity and/or surface expression are regulated by a number of signaling molecules through direct binding to the NT and CT domains (17Wilson G.F. Wang Z. Chouinard S.W.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10206-10214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Moreover, the eag transcript can be alternatively spliced to produce a protein that contains only the NT and CT regions and modulates cellular signal transduction pathways (21Sun X.X. Bostrom S.L. Griffith L.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 40: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we report a direct involvement of these intracellular regions in the activation of Eag K+ channels. Our data reveal that, in heterologous expression systems, the NT and CT regions of Eag are critical for functional expression of K+ currents, specifically processes following movement of the voltage-sensing domain. The cDNA encoding Drosophila Eag (kindly provided by Dr. Gisela Wilson, University of Wisconsin, Madison) was subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3. The myc-eag and eag-EGFP cDNAs were constructed by either cloning the eag coding sequence into the pCS2 vector containing six Myc epitopes or fusing EGFP to the C terminus of the eag coding region in the pEGFP-N1 vector. To measure surface expression of Eag proteins, a Myc tag was inserted in the extracellular loop that connects transmembrane domains S1 and S2 of the Eag channel (Eag-EX-myc). The insertion changes the amino acid sequence between S1 and S2 to 255PYNVAFKEQKLISEEDLNKTSEDVS, in which the Myc epitope is shown in boldface type. The chimeric Eag-mEag channels (Eag-NTmEag, Eag-CTmEag, or Eag-S1-S6mEag) were created by replacing the N- and C-terminal tails or transmembrane region of Drosophila Eag (residues 1–211, 501–1174, or 212–500) with the corresponding region of the mouse Eag channel (residues 1–192, 509–987, or 193–508). A similar approach was utilized to generate N-terminal truncation mutants of Eag or mEag. The mEag NT domain (mEagNT(1–190)-HA) was cloned into the pIRES-EGFP vector. The C-terminal truncation mutants of wild-type Eag, mEag, or chimeric Eag were constructed by introducing a stop codon into the cDNA at appropriate locations using the QuikChange strategy (Stratagene). All cDNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing in the Florida State University Biology Sequencing Facility, Tallahassee, FL. eag-pcDNA3 was transiently expressed in tsA 201 cells using a calcium phosphate-mediated transfection protocol. 2 days after transfection, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml EZ-link-Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) in PBS, pH 8.0, at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation. After removing the reagent by washing cells three times with PBS, cells were harvested and lysed using standard protocols (22Li Y. Wu Y. Zhou Y. Neuron. 2006; 51: 755-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins were precipitated from cell lysates with ImmunoPure streptavidin beads (Pierce). Channel proteins in total cell lysates and streptavidin precipitates were analyzed by immunoblot using an affinity-purified anti-Eag antibody as described previously (20Sun X.X. Hodge J.J. Zhou Y. Nguyen M. Griffith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10206-10214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To confirm that the biotinylation reagent did not leak into the cell and label intracellular proteins, we stripped and reprobed the same blots with an anti-GAPDH antibody (EnCor Biotechnology, Inc.). Immunoblot images were quantified using ImageJ 1.43 (rsb.info.nih.gov). tsA 201 or Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-treated cover glasses and transfected with eag-EX-myc cDNAs. To label cell surface Eag proteins, cells were first incubated with 20 μg/ml anti-Myc antibody (Millipore) for 30 min at 37 °C, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (30 min), blocked in 5% goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (30 min), and labeled with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (2 h). To visualize total Eag proteins, transfected cells were first fixed and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton and then incubated with anti-Eag antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody in the presence of 10% goat serum. Fluorescence images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS laser confocal microscope and analyzed using the ImageJ 1.43 software. Ionic and gating currents of Eag channels were measured in the whole-cell configuration from CHO or tsA 201 cells transiently transfected with various eag cDNAs along with the pEGFP-N1 vector cDNA (Clontech) in a 9:1 ratio using either the FuGENE 6 (for tsA 201 cells; Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine LTX (for CHO cells; Invitrogen) transfection reagents. Transfected cells bearing GFP fluorescence were identified with a FITC filter set on a TE2000U inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon). Patch electrodes with resistances of 2–4 megohms were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished. Ionic and gating currents were digitized at 20 kHz and filtered at 1 and 5 kHz, respectively, with an Axopatch 200B amplifier. Data acquisition and analysis were performed with pCLAMP10 software (Molecular Devices). To record gating currents, a P/4 protocol was applied on line to subtract leak and capacitive currents (23Perozo E. MacKinnon R. Bezanilla F. Stefani E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 353-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). For ionic K+ current recording, the standard bath solution contained 2 mm KCl, 148 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4. The pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4. For gating currents measurements, the extracellular Na+ and intracellular K+ ions were replaced with equal molar of either NMG+ or TEA-Cl. Recordings were generally conducted at room temperature. In experiments involving acute temperature changes, the bath temperature was maintained by a heated stage with the temperature controller, TC-344B (Warner Instruments). The channel conductance was determined by measuring the amplitudes of isochronal tail currents evoked by repolarizing to −60 mV from various depolarizing potentials. Tail current amplitudes were normalized to the maximum value obtained in the experiment and plotted versus depolarizing potentials. Data were fitted with a single Boltzmann function using Origin 7.0 (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). Deactivation kinetics was measured by fitting the tail currents with a single exponential function to obtain values for the deactivation time constant (τdeact) using the Clampfit 10 program (Molecular Devices). As Eag channel currents display the sigmoid rise phase, activation kinetics was quantified by measuring the time to half-maximal current amplitude (t½) at a depolarizing potential of +60 mV. tsA 201 or CHO cells were maintained at 37 °C. For experiments performed at 26 °C, cells were kept at 37 °C for 24 h following transfection and then switched to an incubator maintained at 26 °C. The majority of data were analyzed statistically by one-way ANOVA using Origin 7 software. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. To compare the probability of gating currents occurrence between groups, we used standard logistic regression analysis using the statistical software R-2.11.1. Eag produces voltage-dependent outward K+ currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes (24Robertson G.A. Warmke J.M. Ganetzky B. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, when eag cDNA is transfected into cultured mammalian cells, no significant macroscopic K+ current is elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from either transfected CHO or tsA 201 cells (Fig. 1, A and B, left panels). Mammalian cell lines differ from Xenopus oocytes in their culture temperature (37 °C), which is known to affect trafficking and/or surface targeting of some ion channels, including mutant hERG channels (25Lansdell S.J.

To determine whether temperature was affecting current levels, we measured whole-cell K+ currents from mammalian cells that were cultivated at lower temperatures after transfection with eag cDNA. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B (right panels), cultivation at 26 °C for 24 h resulted in production of voltage-dependent macroscopic K+ currents in both CHO and tsA 201 cells transfected with eag cDNA. Similar to Eag K+ currents recorded from Xenopus oocytes, the whole-cell K+ currents seen after growth at 26 °C were activated around −40 mV and exhibited open state inactivation at depolarized voltages. In addition, activation kinetics of the K+ currents were slowed by either increasing the concentration of extracellular Mg2+ or applying a hyperpolarizing prepulse potential (29Liu X. Wu Y. Zhou Y. Channels. 2010; 4: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), both of which are characteristic features of Eag channels (28Yang K. Fang K. Fromondi L. Chan K.W. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4113-4118Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Tang C.Y. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To assess the effect of cultivation temperature on current expression of Eag channels, we measured whole-cell K+ currents in eag-transfected CHO cells after cultivating at various temperatures for 24 h. As quantified by current density (pA/pF) at a depolarizing potential of +40 mV, macroscopic K+ currents began to be restored by lowering cultivation temperature to 30 °C, whereas the largest augmentation of current level was observed at 26 °C (Fig. 1C). At 26 °C, restoration of macroscopic K+ currents required cultivation of transfected cells for a minimum of 3 h, and the level of Eag K+ currents was substantially increased by longer cultivation at the lower temperature (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these results, recording at room temperature for an extended period did not restore currents from cells cultivated at 37 °C, nor did acute up-shift of temperature to 37 °C during recordings affect the rate of rundown or abolish K+ currents in cells grown at 26 °C (Fig. 1D). Together, these data suggest that temperature-dependent expression of Eag currents is not a direct effect of recording temperature on channel activation. One explanation for the restoration of macroscopic K+ currents by lower temperature could involve temperature sensitivity of the cell surface expression of the channel. To test this, we assessed the effect of culture temperature on plasma membrane targeting of Eag proteins using surface biotinylation with avidin pulldown to selectively harvest Eag proteins that were on the plasma membrane. Similar to previous reports, the anti-Eag antibody identifies two bands from both avidin pulldown and total cell lysates (Fig. 2A), corresponding to the full-length channel and an 80-kDa protein (Eag80), which was produced from a cryptic in-frame splicing event and occurs with transfections of the full-length eag cDNA (21Sun X.X. Bostrom S.L. Griffith L.C. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2009; 40: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Surface expression of Eag channels was not affected by cultivation temperature, as the ratio of biotinylated Eag proteins to those in total lysates was not significantly different between cells cultivated at 26 and 37 °C (Fig. 2B). As a control, we also examined surface targeting of a chimeric Eag-NTmEag channel whose current expression was independent of cultivation temperature (see Fig. 5). For both Eag and Eag-NTmEag, the full-length proteins are identically sized tight bands at 26 and 37 °C (Fig. 2A), suggesting that there was no temperature-dependent shift in the molecular weight of channel proteins in these cells that could reflect differential glycosylation or other maturation processes.FIGURE 5Temperature-independent expression of chimeric Eag-mEag channels. Schematics of chimeric channels are shown on the left. mEag is indicated in black, Eag in gray. Macroscopic K+ currents were measured in cells cultivated at either 37 °C (left) or 26 °C (right) after transfection with cDNA for mEag (A) or the chimeric channels Eag-NTmEag (B), Eag-CTmEag (C) and Eag-S1-S6mEag (D). E, quantification of current density (mean ± S.E.) at +40 mV from CHO cells transfected with wild-type or various chimeric channels cultivated at either 37 or 26 °C (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA). Dotted line indicates current density of zero. Chimeric channels showed alterations in biophysical properties. F, plot of normalized conductance (G/Gmax) as a function of voltage (V) determined from CHO cells cultivated at 26 °C that expressed Eag (open square), Eag-NTmEag (open triangle), or Eag-CTmEag (filled square) channels. The G-V curve of Eag-CTmEag channels has a significant left shift, indicating an increase in voltage sensitivity. G, comparison of the deactivation kinetics of Eag and the two chimeric channels, measured as the deactivation time constant (τdeact) (mean ± S.E.). Unlike Eag-NTmEag, the Eag-CTmEag channel deactivates significantly slower than Eag (**, p < 0.01, one-way ANOVA).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next directly visualized the surface expression of Eag proteins using immunofluorescence. In these experiments, surface-targeted Eag channels were probed with an anti-Myc antibody that recognized a Myc epitope inserted on the extracellular side of the Eag channel and visualized with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody by confocal microscopy. In Fig. 2C (top panels), it can be seen that Eag channels were localized to the plasma membrane in transfected cells cultured at both 37 and 26 °C. When the cell membranes were permeabilized with nonionic detergent, we did not observe any significant difference in the cytoplasmic distribution of total Eag proteins between cells cultivated at 26 and 37 °C (Fig. 2C, bottom panels). Together, these data demonstrate that the temperature-dependent expression of K+ channel currents cannot be attributed to a deficit in trafficking or surface targeting of Eag channels. Voltage-dependent opening of ion channels is a process that entails coordinated conformational changes of both the voltage sensor and the activation gate (4Tombola F. Pathak M.M. Isacoff E.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 23-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To identify the defective step(s) that might have caused the failure to conduct K+ ions when the Eag channel is assembled and targeted at 37 °C, we assessed the integrity of its voltage sensor by measuring voltage-dependent gating charge movements. To record Eag gating currents, we used intracellular and extracellular NMG+ solutions to substitute for K+ and Na+ ions and applied a P/−4 voltage protocol to subtract capacitive and leak currents. As shown in Fig. 3A, on- and off-gating currents were elicited by depolarizing voltages in some eag-transfected CHO cells cultivated at either 26 or 37 °C. These were genuine gating currents of Eag channels, because they were not present in any untransfected or vector-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3B) (31Suda N. Franzius D. Fleig A. Nishimura S. Bödding M. Hoth M. Takeshima H. Penner R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and were similar in voltage dependence and kinetics to that of the Eag on- and off-gating currents previously recorded in oocytes (30Tang C.Y. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 32Bannister J.P. Chanda B. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 18718-18723Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, unlike Shaker channels that exhibited ample gating currents in a majority of transfected cells, Eag gating currents had smaller amplitudes, and well resolved on- and off-gating currents were only detected above noise in a fraction of eag-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the percentage of cells that exhibited measurable gating currents was not different in transfected cells cultivated at the two temperatures (Fig. 3B), and a comparison of the charge-voltage relationship (Q-V) also revealed little difference between Eag gating currents recorded from cells cultivated at 26 and 37 °C (Fig. 3C). We also recorded Eag gating currents using intracellular and extracellular solutions containing a K+ channel blocker, TEA. In eag-transfected cells, this recording condition yielded sizeable on-gating but very small off-gating currents, which is consistent with the short pulse duration and the presence of TEA in these experiments (23Perozo E. MacKinnon R. Bezanilla F. Stefani E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 353-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 30Tang C.Y. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 319-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Different from on-gating currents of Shaker K+ channels, Eag on-gating currents were activated at higher depolarizing voltages and had a slower rising phase (Fig. 3D). The kinetics and voltage dependence of the on-gating currents were not significantly different for eag-transfected cells cultivated at 26 and 37 °C, confirming that cultivation temperatures did not affect voltage-dependent gating charge movements of the Eag channel. The Eag protein shares substantial homology with its mammalian counterparts (Fig. 4), but functional expression of other Eag homologues is not dependent on cultivation temperatures (14Bauer C.K. Schwarz J.R. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 182: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine the potential role of various regions of the Eag channel in mediating temperature-dependent expression of functional K+ channels, we employed a chimeric channel strategy. We first generated three chimeric channels (Eag-S1-S6mEag, Eag-CTmEag, and Eag-NTmEag) in which either the transmembrane (S1–S6), C-, or N-terminal domain of the Eag channel was replaced with the corresponding region of its mouse homologue, mEag (Fig. 4). meag-transfected cells have robust K+ currents regardless of culture temperature (Fig. 5A). When either its NT or CT was replaced with mEag sequences, the temperature dependence of Eag current was alleviated. Robust K+ currents were elicited from transfected cells at both temperatures (Fig. 5, B and C), although the current density was higher in cells maintained at 26 °C than that at 37 °C (Fig. 5E). In addition, the chimeric channels exhibited changes in their biophysical properties. The Eag-NTmEag channel had slower activation kinetics than wild-type Eag (supplemental Fig. S1A), whereas the Eag-CTmEag channel had an enhanced voltage sensitivity (Fig. 5F) and considerably slower deactivation kinetics than Eag and Eag-NTmEag channels (Fig. 5G). One possible interpretation of the finding that replacement of either the NT or CT of Eag with mEag was sufficient to restore currents at 37 °C is that Eag channel assembly at high temperature disrupts some interaction between these two domains that blocks their ability to participate in allowing opening of the channel following movement of the voltage sensor. Substitution of the mEag NT or CT allows a functional interaction between terminal domains and rescues activation. To further probe the role of the interaction of the transmembrane domain with the intracellular domains in activation, we generated a chimeric channel that contained both the EagNT and CT attached to the mEag transmembrane domains. Although it was expressed at the cell surface (supplemental Fig. S2), the Eag-S1-S6mEag channel failed to produce any significant K+ currents when it was transfected into mammalian cells cultivated at either 26 or 37 °C (Fig. 5, D and E). Hence, although this experiment confirmed the importance of intracellular domains for function, the failure of EagNT and CT domains to support activation of the mEag channel suggested that there were significant differences in how the TM regions interacted with their cognate intracellular domains. Comparison of the fly and mouse Eag channels sequences reveals that only the proximal regions of their CT domains (amino acid residues 496–734 of Eag and 504–743 of mEag) show good conservation (Fig. 4). To test the differential roles of the distal and proximal CT domains, we generated Eag and mEag channels, which have a truncation of the distal CT sequence where Eag and mEag are least homologous (Fig. 4). Notably, none of the channels (mouse, fly, and chimera) that lack the distal CT domain produced current at 37 °C, and all had greatly reduced current amplitudes at 26 °C (Fig. 6; note difference in the y axis scale between Figs. 6G and 5E). This indicates a general role for the distal CT in modulation of current amplitude. The distal CT also appeared to have additional functionality. When transfected into mammalian cells, the EagΔ735–1174 channel was not much different from the full-length wild-type channel in its temperature-dependent conduction of K+ ions (Fig. 6A). In contrast, this C-terminal deletion converted the nonconducting chimeric channels that had the mEag transmembrane domains into an Eag-like K+ channel. Eag-S1-S6mEagΔ735–1174 channels produced macroscopic K+ currents but only when the transfected cells were cultivated at lower temperatures (Fig. 6B), implying that the distal CT was responsible for the inability of the Eag-TMmEag channel (Fig. 5D) to conduct K+. Interestingly, after a deletion of the equivalent distal C-terminal region, the two temperature-independent channels, mEag and Eag-CTmEag, became temperature-sensitive, as both mEagΔ744–987 and Eag-CTmEagΔ744–987 only generated K+ currents when cultivated at lower temperatures (Fig. 6, C and D), suggesting another role for the distal CT in stabilization of the NT/proximal CT interaction. Removal of the entire CT domain (Eag Δ502–1174) rendered the fly Eag channel nonconductive at either temperature (Fig. 6E). In contrast, the mutant mEag channel devoid of the C-terminal tail (mEagΔ510–987) was capable of producing a low level of macroscopic K+ currents at 26 °C (Fig. 6F). The proximal CT domain appears to be absolutely required in the fly but not in the mouse for ion conductance. In addition, these CT-truncated mutant channels had slower activation kinetics when compared with the respective full-length channels (supplemental Fig. S1B), indicating an"
https://openalex.org/W1970132961,"Background In order to improve our understanding of the molecular pathways that mediate tumor proliferation and angiogenesis, and to evaluate the biological response to anti-angiogenic therapy, we analyzed the changes in the protein profile of glioblastoma in response to treatment with recombinant human Platelet Factor 4-DLR mutated protein (PF4-DLR), an inhibitor of angiogenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings U87-derived experimental glioblastomas were grown in the brain of xenografted nude mice, treated with PF4-DLR, and processed for proteomic analysis. More than fifty proteins were differentially expressed in response to PF4-DLR treatment. Among them, integrin-linked kinase 1 (ILK1) signaling pathway was first down-regulated but then up-regulated after treatment for prolonged period. The activity of PF4-DLR can be increased by simultaneously treating mice orthotopically implanted with glioblastomas, with ILK1-specific siRNA. As ILK1 is related to malignant progression and a poor prognosis in various types of tumors, we measured ILK1 expression in human glioblatomas, astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas, and found that it varied widely; however, a high level of ILK1 expression was correlated to a poor prognosis. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that identifying the molecular pathways induced by anti-angiogenic therapies may help the development of combinaatorial treatment strategies that increase the therapeutic efficacy of angiogenesis inhibitors by association with specific agents that disrupt signaling in tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2034206976,"Many methods, including parametric, nonparametric, and Bayesian methods, have been used for detecting differentially expressed genes based on the assumption that biological systems are linear, which ignores the nonlinear characteristics of most biological systems. More importantly, those methods do not simultaneously consider means, variances, and high moments, resulting in relatively high false positive rate. To overcome the limitations, the SWang test is proposed to determine differentially expressed genes according to the equality of distributions between case and control. Our method not only latently incorporates functional relationships among genes to consider nonlinear biological system but also considers the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of expression profiles simultaneously. To illustrate biological significance of high moments, we construct a nonlinear gene interaction model, demonstrating that skewness and kurtosis could contain useful information of function association among genes in microarrays. Simulations and real microarray results show that false positive rate of SWang is lower than currently popular methods (T-test, F-test, SAM, and Fold-change) with much higher statistical power. Additionally, SWang can uniquely detect significant genes in real microarray data with imperceptible differential expression but higher variety in kurtosis and skewness. Those identified genes were confirmed with previous published literature or RT-PCR experiments performed in our lab."
https://openalex.org/W2012500049,"Gene network information has been used to improve gene selection in microarray-based studies by selecting marker genes based both on their expression and the coordinate expression of genes within their gene network under a given condition. Here we propose a new network-embedded gene selection model. In this model, we first address the limitations of microarray data. Microarray data, although widely used for gene selection, measures only mRNA abundance, which does not always reflect the ultimate gene phenotype, since it does not account for post-transcriptional effects. To overcome this important (critical in certain cases) but ignored-in-almost-all-existing-studies limitation, we design a new strategy to integrate together microarray data with the information of microRNA, the major post-transcriptional regulatory factor. We also handle the challenges led by gene collaboration mechanism. To incorporate the biological facts that genes without direct interactions may work closely due to signal transduction and that two genes may be functionally connected through multi paths, we adopt the concept of diffusion distance. This concept permits us to simulate biological signal propagation and therefore to estimate the collaboration probability for all gene pairs, directly or indirectly-connected, according to multi paths connecting them. We demonstrate, using type 2 diabetes (DM2) as an example, that the proposed strategies can enhance the identification of functional gene partners, which is the key issue in a network-embedded gene selection model. More importantly, we show that our gene selection model outperforms related ones. Genes selected by our model 1) have improved classification capability; 2) agree with biological evidence of DM2-association; and 3) are involved in many well-known DM2-associated pathways."
