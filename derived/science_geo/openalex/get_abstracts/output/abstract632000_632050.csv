Importantly, odor concentration rises with physical proximity to an odorous source, suggesting a framework for orienting within olfactory landscapes to optimize behavior. Here, we created a two-dimensional odor space composed purely of odor stimuli to model how a navigator encounters smells in a natural environment. We show that human subjects can learn to navigate in olfactory space and form predictions of to-be-encountered smells. During navigation, fMRI responses in entorhinal cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex take the form of grid-like representations with hexagonal periodicity and entorhinal grid strength scaled with behavioral performance across subjects. The identification of olfactory grid-like codes with 6-fold symmetry highlights a unique neural mechanism by which odor information can be assembled into spatially navigable cognitive maps, optimizing orientation, and path finding toward an odor source.

The identification of olfactory grid-like codes with 6-fold symmetry highlights a unique neural mechanism by which odor information can be assembled into spatially navigable cognitive maps, optimizing orientation, and path finding toward an odor source. A key function of sensory systems is to optimize one’s physical proximity to distant objects. Sensory cues are essential for guiding animals closer to appetitive sources and further from aversive sources. Through exploration and experience, animals can adaptively learn to harness the sensory properties of their environments, enabling them not only to locate salient positions in space but also to plan and predict the most efficient route to those positions. Across different sensory modalities, the olfactory system is uniquely suited for achieving these goals. The sense of smell is fundamentally a predictive sense. Each sniff represents an olfactory snapshot at a specific time and place and simultaneously represents a prediction of what odor is likely to be encountered on the next sniff, at the next time and place (Jacobs, 2012Jacobs L.F. From chemotaxis to the cognitive map: the function of olfaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 10693-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The sense of smell is also a distance sense, as airborne odors can defy physical boundaries and the absence of light in ways that visual information cannot, providing a means of identifying and tracking remote sources (Gire et al., 2016Gire D.H. Kapoor V. Arrighi-Allisan A. Seminara A. Murthy V.N. Mice develop efficient strategies for foraging and navigation using complex natural stimuli.Curr. Biol. 2016; 26: 1261-1273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Finally, there is a relative physical constancy of an odor source, given that a lingering imprint of the odor is typically rooted at a fixed position in the environment. These features endow the olfactory system with a keen capacity for using chemical cues to navigate physical spaces. Curiously, studies examining the behavioral and neural underpinnings of odor navigation are sparse (Jacobs, 2012Jacobs L.F. From chemotaxis to the cognitive map: the function of olfaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 10693-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the animal kingdom, olfactory cues play an indispensable role in navigation, such as foraging in insects (Reinhard et al., 2004Reinhard J. Srinivasan M.V. Zhang S. Olfaction: scent-triggered navigation in honeybees.Nature. 2004; 427: 411Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), homing behaviors in pigeons (Papi, 1991Papi F. Orientation in birds. Olfactory navigation.EXS. 1991; 60: 52-85PubMed Google Scholar), and scent tracking in dogs (Thesen et al., 1993Thesen A. Steen J.B. Døving K.B. Behaviour of dogs during olfactory tracking.J. Exp. Biol. 1993; 180: 247-251PubMed Google Scholar). When blindfolded, humans are able to track odors (Porter et al., 2007Porter J. Craven B. Khan R.M. Chang S.J. Kang I. Judkewitz B. Volpe J. Settles G. Sobel N. Mechanisms of scent-tracking in humans.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and identify the direction of an odor source from distance (Welge-Lussen et al., 2014Welge-Lussen A. Looser G.L. Westermann B. Hummel T. Olfactory source localization in the open field using one or both nostrils.Rhinology. 2014; 52: 41-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether humans can navigate a sensory space informed only by odor cues and how the brain might internalize a representation of two-dimensional olfactory space. Here, we posit a world populated exclusively with odor stimuli to determine whether and how a navigator—with only the luxury of the sense of smell—can traverse an olfactory landscape. Our first step was to design an ecologically plausible landscape of smells that might be naturally encountered in the environment. We took advantage of the fact that odor concentration decreases with distance from its source and that perceived odor intensity monotonically scales with concentration (Conover, 2007Conover M.R.

Odour-plume dynamics influence the brain’s olfactory code.Nature. 2001; 410: 466-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To this end, we created a two-dimensional plane where x,y coordinates were defined by two different odors (banana and pine) that independently varied in perceived intensity from 0% to 100%, at 20% increments, forming a 6 × 6 space (Figures 1A and 1B ). Based on theoretical (Wallraff, 2000Wallraff H.G. Simulated navigation based on observed gradients of atmospheric trace gases (Models on pigeon homing, part 3).J. Theor.

Olfactory orientation and navigation in humans.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10: e0129387Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) data, each position in this two-dimensional space can be derived from the intensity of the two odors, enabling a navigator to extrapolate new information from learned odors, to predict future odor percepts, and, by extension, to predict future locations (Jacobs, 2012Jacobs L.F. From chemotaxis to the cognitive map: the function of olfaction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 10693-10700Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An important feature of our stimulus set was guided by hypotheses about how the brain would encode a mental map of odor space. In rodents, open-field foraging elicits spatially modulated activity in medial entorhinal cortex (ERC), with individual neurons (grid cells) firing at multiple discrete and hexagonally periodic locations in space (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T.

In tiling spatial fields, grid cells provide a neural metric and internalized representation for self-location, route planning, and path integration (Bush et al., 2015Bush D. Barry C. Manson D.

Neurosci. 2013; 16: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on our hypothesis that navigation of an odor-informed space would rely on a grid-like coding scheme, we ensured the odor array was optimized to assess grid-like fMRI responses, including sufficient angle resolution to identify hexagonal (6-fold) symmetry and sufficient range to characterize odor trajectories rather than odor identities per se (Figures 1C and S1). In this study, we asked human subjects to mentally navigate along a trajectory defined by a “start” odor and an “end” odor and to indicate whether their predicted translation corresponded to the veridical end odor. Success on this task requires access to an internalized map of odor space, and our behavioral data revealed above-chance accuracy in orienting within this space. We demonstrate that grid-like representations with hexagonal periodicity emerged in ERC and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during olfactory navigation, with grid strength in ERC correlating with behavioral performance across subjects. Our findings reveal that two-dimensional arrays of odor intensities, which themselves cannot be topographically encoded as a set of Cartesian coordinates on the olfactory epithelial sheet, nevertheless map onto grid-like scaffolds that can support spatial orientation and route planning within an olfactory space. To encourage mental navigation through odor space, we adapted a task similar to those used in virtual and abstract navigation studies (Bellmund et al., 2016Bellmund J.L. Deuker L. Navarro Schröder T.

Bellmund J.L.S. Doeller C.F. Hexadirectional coding of visual space in human entorhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Subjects were provided a start location and a trajectory and then assessed whether their predicted (imagined) endpoint along the trajectory corresponded to the veridical endpoint. Our task was introduced to subjects as an “odor prediction” task, but the latent structure of the map was not revealed until after the experiment. Trajectories were defined using a start odor mixture, along with a visual instruction screen indicating how much the intensities of banana and pine in the mixture would change upon delivery of the end odor (Figures 1B, 1D, and S2). After a 6-s period of mental navigation along the specified trajectory, subjects received the end odor and indicated whether it matched their prediction. On 50% of trials, the end odor was on trajectory, and on 50% of trials, the end odor was off trajectory, varying by 15°–60°. Correct answers would be compatible with successful navigation. Twenty-five subjects underwent behavioral training on the prediction task for 4 days, followed by fMRI scanning on day 5. Two different measures of task performance suggested that subjects internalized mental maps of the odor space. First, prediction accuracy was consistently higher than chance (50%) on training and scan days (Figure 2A), though no significant difference was observed across days (repeated-measures ANOVA; F3.41,81.91 = 1.41; p = 0.24). Second, we used signal detection methods to derive a navigation index, which adjusted for subject-specific olfactory perceptual limits (see STAR Methods). This analysis revealed an effect of training on navigation performance, particularly for easier trials in which the “off-trajectory” end odor was at a larger angle from the instructed trajectory, with a significant performance gain from day 1 to subsequent days (t24 = −2.17; p = 0.04; paired t test; two-tailed; Figure 2B). Collectively, these findings indicate that human subjects can generate predictions of to-be-encountered odors that vary in magnitude across two independent feature dimensions. We next asked whether the human brain uses a grid-like architecture as a metric of odor space. Because most grid cells share a common grid-axis angle in the same animal (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I.

Conjunctive representation of position, direction, and velocity in entorhinal cortex.Science. 2006; 312: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), the group activities of grid cells can be manifested in fMRI signals showing a hexagonal periodicity as a function of moving direction (Figures 3A and 3B ). Such profiles have been identified in ERC and medial prefrontal cortex in neuroimaging studies of human navigation (Bellmund et al., 2016Bellmund J.L. Deuker L. Navarro Schröder T. Doeller C.F.

Epstein R.A. Human entorhinal cortex represents visual space using a boundary-anchored grid.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Nau et al., 2018Nau M. Navarro Schröder T. Bellmund J.L.S. Doeller C.F. Hexadirectional coding of visual space in human entorhinal cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Here, we first searched for regions where fMRI signals were hexagonally modulated by the odor trajectory direction θ during the navigation period (Figure 1D). Using a quadrature filter (effectively, a pair of sine and cosine regressors with 60° periodicities; Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Evidence for grid cells in a human memory network.Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar; see STAR Methods), we identified the largest cluster in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (Figure 3C). Notably, within the vmPFC region of interest (ROI) of a given subject, the grid angles of individual voxels were closely aligned to the same angle, a profile that was observed in all but one subject (Figure S3A). Insofar as the quadrature filter is effectively a functional localizer, this approach is predisposed toward identifying regions with 6-fold symmetry. Therefore, to minimize any analysis bias, we created a new independent anatomical localizer of the vmPFC (5-mm radius), centered at the vmPFC coordinate (6, 44, −10) reported in the grid cell study by Constantinescu et al., 2016Constantinescu A.O. O’Reilly J.X. Behrens T.E.J. Organizing conceptual knowledge in humans with a gridlike code.Science. 2016; 352: 1464-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar. In this way, we could test the strength of vmPFC modulation for the 6-symmetry fold, as well as for other control folds (from 3- to 5-fold). Among all symmetries tested, only the 6-fold model yielded a significant modulatory effect, but not 3-, 4-, or 5-fold models (Figure S4). Our 6-fold model of odor space included the “movement” period of the task, in which vertical translations of two visual bars informed upcoming changes in odor intensity. To minimize the possibility that the observed grid-like effects could be attributed to visual stimulation, we ensured the positions of the odor columns (“pine” and “banana”) and the axis labels (“more” and “less”) were randomly alternated across trials, dissociating spatial changes in visual features from magnitude changes in odor features. As a formal test that grid-like maps in vmPFC were not driven by visual confounds, we designed a complementary model in which θ was determined by the absolute directions and translations of the visual bars (Figure S5). Visual stimulation had no significant effect on grid-like vmPFC representations, and the emergence of hexagonally modulated activity was specific for odor versus visual trajectory (Figure 3D). Interestingly, a visual model with 4-fold symmetry showed significant modulation of fMRI activity in primary visual cortex (Figure 4), indicating sensitivity to the low-level visual movements of the rating scale bars. Finally, to assess the reproducibility of these effects in vmPFC, we performed a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis to test whether the 6-fold periodic signals conform to a consistent grid-axis angle across time. Using N-1 scan runs, we estimated each subject’s grid angle φ from the vmPFC and reserved the left-out (Nth) run as the test set, which was organized into 12 conditions by binning trials into successive 30° bins relative to φ. The key prediction was that fMRI activity would be higher for trials aligned to φ (0° modulo 60°) than those misaligned (30° modulo 60°). Using this unbiased analysis, we confirmed that the same grid angle was consistently identified in vmPFC (Figure 3E), implying stability of grid angle over the duration of the experiment. This effect was specific to 6-fold symmetry: a control analysis based on a 4-fold periodicity, corresponding to a square grid field, did not elicit significant modulation in vmPFC (Figure 3F). Using the same approach, we tested whether other brain regions might align to the same vmPFC angle (Figure 3G). The demonstration of interregional angle stability would support the idea that a coordinated network of regions—tuned to the same grid angle—helps direct navigation of an odor space. Here, we focused on ERC, based on its prominent role in grid cell coding (Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Evidence for grid cells in a human memory network.Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T. Fyhn M. Molden S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar), and anterior and posterior piriform cortex (APC and PPC), given that our task centers on exploration of olfactory space (Giessel and Datta, 2014Giessel A.J. Datta S.R. Olfactory maps, circuits and computations.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2014; 24: 120-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Of note, mean fMRI signal activity in APC significantly varied in a 6-fold symmetric manner, entrained to the same angle as in vmPFC (Figure 3H). A similar trend was observed in PPC but was not significant (aligned > misaligned; t24 = 2.02; p = 0.027; α = 0.016; Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons of three ROIs). No hexagonal effect was found in the mean ERC signal (aligned > misaligned; t24 = 0.19; p = 0.42), and the preferred grid angles independently estimated in vmPFC and in ERC were not correlated across subjects (circular correlation r = −0.034; p = 0.86). Although grid-like coding in ERC was not identified in the above analysis, it is possible that ERC employs a distributed coding scheme during odor navigation (Diehl et al., 2017Diehl G.W. Hon O.J.

A multiplexed, heterogeneous, and adaptive code for navigation in medial entorhinal cortex.Neuron. 2017; 94: 375-387.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which might be better characterized using multi-voxel pattern-based approaches (Bellmund et al., 2016Bellmund J.L. Deuker L. Navarro Schröder T. Doeller C.F. Grid-cell representations in mental simulation.eLife. 2016; 5: e17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, to the extent that low signal quality in ERC (due to its location in an area of high susceptibility artifact) limits our ability to resolve ERC grid angles using univariate analyses, multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) methods might be more robust to signal dropout in ERC. To this end, we reasoned that, if distributed grid-like representations of odor space exist in ERC, then for each subject, there should be an intrinsic preferred grid angle φ (presumably aligned with vmPFC) with 60° periodicity, such that trial trajectory θ at any 60° equivalent of φ should exhibit greater pattern overlap than with 30° trajectories (Figures 5A and S6). A region-of-interest analysis in ERC (Figure 3G) confirmed this prediction: after aligning trials to φ estimated from vmPFC activity, ensemble pattern similarity in ERC was significantly greater for trial pairs with trajectories aligned to the same 60° periodicity, in comparison to trial pairs in which one of the trajectories was offset by 30° (Figure 5B). To test whether this multivariate effect in ERC emerged only in context of 6-fold rotational symmetry, we conducted the same analyses with 3- to 5-fold symmetries. Importantly, we found no evidence of periodic pattern signals in 3-, 4-, or 5-fold control models (Figure 6A). Moreover, a visual model where trajectory directions were determined by visual movements of the scale bars found no significant grid-like coding in ERC patterns (Figure 6B). Interestingly, a complementary whole-brain searchlight analysis did reveal limited evidence for 6-fold multivoxel representations in vmPFC (Figure S7), though these effects were relatively weak and did not survive multiple comparison correction (Z = 2.74; p = 0.003 uncorrected). Finally, to investigate whether olfactory grid-like pattern representations in ERC are capable of supporting behavior, we computed the linear correlation between grid-pattern robustness (aligned versus misaligned) and performance on the odor prediction task. Across subjects, stronger grid-like ensemble activity in ERC was associated with greater ability to predict which odor would be encountered on a specified trajectory (Figure 6C), implicating the potential involvement of this region in orienting an olfactory navigator in two-dimensional odor space. Our pattern analysis was based on the assumption that the grid angle in ERC was aligned to vmPFC grid angle φ (see STAR Methods). However, it remains possible that any periodic regularity in the ERC signal, irrespective of vmPFC grid angle φ, might still show significant variations between mod 60° and mod 30°. Therefore, we explicitly tested the hypothesis that the pattern-based hexagonal effect in ERC is most robust at vmPFC grid angle φ. Here, the prediction was that, with increasing divergence from φ (estimated in vmPFC), the strength of the correlation difference (between aligned and misaligned pairs) in ERC would progressively decrease. In this analysis, we computed correlations by offsetting the assumed grid angle φ by 15°, 30°, and 45° away from the subject’s preferred vmPFC angle. These results establish that the hexagonal effect is only significant for the vmPFC grid angle φ, but not for the other three conditions (Figure 6D). Moreover, fitting a linear regression across the four conditions revealed that the slope is significantly negative across subjects (t24 = −2.65; p = 0.014). The use of angular parameters as regressors in our models of 6-fold symmetry is predicated on the assumption that the olfactory behavioral trials to which subjects were exposed were analogous to navigating on a two-dimensional “arena.” However, it remains possible that the same brain areas would have been uncovered if the data had been analyzed without including any angular parameters. In other words, it would be important to determine whether ERC is reflecting the discriminative abilities of the subjects rather than the spatial structure underlying the odorant combinations. To explore this question, we sorted trials into correct responses (hits + correct rejections) and incorrect responses (misses + false alarms). We then used two different classifier methods to assess whether information about odor discrimination aptitude could be decoded from pattern representations in ERC. First, a correlation analysis between linear vectors of voxel-wise pattern activity demonstrated that within-condition pattern similarities (e.g., “correct” versus correct trial pairs) did not differ from between-condition similarities (e.g., correct versus “incorrect” trial pairs; t24 = 0.046; p = 0.96). Second, a support vector machine (SVM)-decoding analysis showed that classification accuracy (correct or incorrect) for individual trials was not different from 50% chance level (t24 = 0.034; p = 0.97). Together, these data suggest that odor discrimination per se did not influence effects in ERC. We also inspected three additional potential confounding factors. First, we examined task difficulty. Here, trials were sorted into “hard” versus (“medium” + “easy”) difficulty levels, based on our definition of “difficulty” as the dif"

Primary aptamers were attached to metal particles of a SERS substrate, and influenza viruses were captured and bound with secondary aptamers labelled with Raman-active molecules. The signal was affected by the concentration of both primary and secondary aptamers. The limit of detection was as low as 1 · 10-4 hemagglutination units per probe as tested for the H3N2 virus (A/England/42/72). Aptamer-based sensors provided recognition of various influenza viral strains, including H1, H3, and H5 hemagglutinin subtypes. Therefore, the aptasensors could be applied for fast and low-cost strain-independent determination of influenza viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2941630696,"The presence of a quaternary centre-a carbon with four other carbons bonded to it-in any given molecule can have a substantial chemical and biological impact. In many cases, it can enable otherwise challenging chemistry. For example, quaternary centres induce large rate enhancements in cyclization reactions-known as the Thorpe-Ingold effect-which has application in drug delivery for molecules with modest bioavailability1. Similarly, the addition of quaternary centres to a drug candidate can enhance both its activity and its metabolic stability2. When present in chiral ligands3, catalysts4 and auxiliaries5, quaternary centres can guide reactions toward both improved and unique regio-, stereo- and/or enantioselectivity. However, owing to their distinct steric congestion and conformational restriction, the formation of quaternary centres can be achieved reliably by only a few chemical transformations6,7. For particularly challenging cases-for example, the vicinal all-carbon8, oxa- and aza-quaternary centres9 in molecules such as azadirachtin10,11, scopadulcic acid A12,13 and acutumine14-the development of target-specific approaches as well as multiple functional-group and redox manipulations is often necessary. It is therefore desirable to establish alternative ways in which quaternary centres can positively affect and guide synthetic planning. Here we show that if a synthesis is designed such that each quaternary centre is deliberately leveraged to simplify the construction of the next-either through rate acceleration or blocking effects-then highly efficient, scalable and modular syntheses can result. This approach is illustrated using the conidiogenone family of terpenes as a representative case; however, this framework provides a distinct planning logic that is applicable to other targets of similar synthetic complexity that contain multiple quaternary centres."
https://openalex.org/W2941610003,"Given the amount of time and effort individuals pour into work, scholars and practitioners alike have spent considerable time and resources trying to understand well-being in the workplace. Unfortunately, much of the current research and measurement focuses on workplace well-being from only one perspective (i.e. hedonic well-being rather than eudaimonic well-being) or by generalizing between workplace well-being and general well-being. In this study, we sought to integrate the workplace context into the current eudaimonic perspective to develop an 8-item measure of eudaimonic workplace well-being. Using multi-wave data, we developed and validated a reliable, two-dimensional eudaimonic workplace well-being scale (EWWS). The measure replicated over seven samples and across 1346 participants and showed strong convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity. Furthermore, we combined EWWS with an existing measure of hedonic workplace well-being and the resulting model of overall workplace well-being explained a significant amount of variance in key organizational constructs over and above existing hedonic well-being measures. Overall, the present study suggests that the EWWS is a valuable and valid measure and, when taken together with hedonic workplace well-being, captures what it means to have a holistic sense of well-being at work."
https://openalex.org/W2941321216,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly cancer with limited treatment options. Through genome-wide growth depletion screens using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and expression profiling of primary HCC tumors, we identified 13 clinically relevant target genes with therapeutic potential. Subsequent functional annotation analysis revealed significant enrichment of these 13 genes in the cell cycle, cell death, and survival pathways. Non-structural maintenance of chromosomes condensin I complex subunit G (NCAPG) was ranked the highest among the depletion screens and multiple HCC expression datasets. Transient inhibition of NCAPG using specific small interfering RNAs resulted in a significant reduction in cell growth, migration, and the down-regulation of mitochondrial gene expression in vitro. Small homologous RNA-mediated knockdown of NCAPG significantly impaired cell viability, caused aberrant mitotic division, fragmented the mitochondrial network, and increased cell death in vitro. HCC cells with a reduced expression of NCAPG formed significantly smaller xenograft tumors in vivo. Importantly, high NCAPG expression was significantly associated with poorer overall and disease-free survival in HCC patients. High NCAPG expression is a novel prognostic biomarker to predict HCC early recurrence after surgical resection. In conclusion, NCAPG is an essential gene for HCC tumor cell survival. It represents a promising novel target for treating HCC and a prognostic biomarker for clinical management of HCC.-Wang, Y., Gao, B., Tan, P. Y., Handoko, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2940935668,"Understanding travelers’ acceptance of Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) is crucial to the implementation of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) capable of mitigating traffic congestion and improving network performance. This paper adopted an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to predict and explain road users’ intention to use Variable Message Sign (VMS) information. In addition to the traditional parsimonious TAM constructs (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and behavioral intention), the model examined the effects of attitude towards route diversion, familiarity with road network and information quality on road users’ acceptance of VMS. 762 drivers were interviewed and the obtained data were processed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results showed that travelers’ attitude towards route diversion had a positive effect on perceived usefulness and intention to use VMS. Information quality had a positive direct effect on perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude towards route diversion. Familiarity with the network had a positive effect on attitude towards route diversion and a negative effect on the perceived usefulness of VMS information. Perceived ease of use significantly and positively affected perceived usefulness and intention to use VMS. Perceived usefulness also had a positive effect on intention. Several academic and practical implications were also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2940469649,"The study of selection signatures helps to find genomic regions that have been under selective pressure and might host genes or variants that modulate important phenotypes. Such knowledge improves our understanding of how breeding programmes have shaped the genomes of livestock. In this study, 942 stallions were included from four, exemplarily chosen, German warmblood breeds with divergent historical and recent selection focus and different crossbreeding policies: Trakehner (N = 44), Holsteiner (N = 358), Hanoverian (N = 319) and Oldenburger (N = 221). Those breeds are nowadays bred for athletic performance and aptitude for show-jumping, dressage or eventing, with a particular focus of Holsteiner on the first discipline. Blood samples were collected during the health exams of the stallion preselections before licensing and were genotyped with the Illumina EquineSNP50 BeadChip. Autosomal markers were used for a multi-method search for signals of positive selection. Analyses within and across breeds were conducted by using the integrated Haplotype Score (iHS), cross-population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (xpEHH) and Runs of Homozygosity (ROH). Oldenburger and Hanoverian showed very similar iHS signatures, but breed specificities were detected on multiple chromosomes with the xpEHH. The Trakehner clustered as a distinct group in a principal component analysis and also showed the highest number of ROHs, which reflects their historical bottleneck. Beside breed specific differences, we found shared selection signals in an across breed iHS analysis on chromosomes 1, 4 and 7. After investigation of these iHS signals and shared ROH for potential functional candidate genes and affected pathways including enrichment analyses, we suggest that genes affecting muscle functionality (TPM1, TMOD2-3, MYO5A, MYO5C), energy metabolism and growth (AEBP1, RALGAPA2, IGFBP1, IGFBP3-4), embryonic development (HOXB-complex) and fertility (THEGL, ZPBP1-2, TEX14, ZP1, SUN3 and CFAP61) have been targeted by selection in all breeds. Our findings also indicate selection pressure on KITLG, which is well-documented for influencing pigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W2941642079,"Inadequate access to medicines affected by un-controlled prices is a major concern in developing countries, including Pakistan, which lacks comprehensive data on medicine prices. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Lahore division, Pakistan. The survey was undertaken from November, 2016 till March, 2017 by including 50 medicines, 14 from the WHO/HAI core list and 36 supplementary medicines from national essential medicine list (NEML) at public (n = 16) and private (n = 16) health facilities. The prices, availability and affordability of selected medicines were measured using a variant of the WHO/HAI standard methodology available on HAI website and WHO/HAI manual. A questionnaire was used for data collection from Lahore division. The prices were compared to International reference prices (IRPs) and the daily wage of a lowest paid unskilled government worker was used to calculate medicine affordability. Data suggested poor availability of originator brands (OB) in public and private sector facilities, i.e., 6.8% and 55.0%, respectively. Similarly, low availability was observed for lowest price generics (LPGs), both in public (35.3%) and private sector (20.3%) facilities–far below the WHO global action plan targets of 80% availability of essential medicines by 2025. In private sector, 53% OB and 38% LPG medicines were found excessively priced. The cost of standard treatment with OBs was unaffordable, i.e., above a single daily wage (1.4 day’s wages) was demanded to purchase the standard treatment for the selected diseases in case of OBs medicines. Whereas, the cost of LPGs medicine required to purchase the standard treatment of the selected diseases was 0.6 day’s wage (median), below a single daily wage. In conclusion, access to essential medicines, especially at public sector facilities was affected by low availability, particularly of OBs in comparison to LPGs. Thus, the better availability of LPGs might be a rational basis of transition into a generic system of prescribing that may improve the availability and accessibility of essential medicines in Lahore division. Medicine prices in Lahore division were found higher in comparison to IRPs. Thus, the efforts must be made to formulate patient’s pocket friendly drug pricing policy that favors price cuts and improves affordability."
https://openalex.org/W2940560225,"Perceived discrimination in medical settings remains prevalent within the U.S. health care system. However, the details of these experiences and their associations with perceived quality of care are not well understood. Our study assessed multiple measures of perceived racial/ethnic discrimination in medical settings and investigated the locations and purported perpetrators of the discriminatory experiences within a population-based sample of 1,543 Black, White, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Other adults. We used logistic regression to estimate associations between perceived discrimination in the medical setting and three quality of care indicators. Overall, 40% of the sample reported one or more types of perceived discrimination in a medical setting, with significant differences by race/ethnicity. Discrimination was perceived across health settings and from a variety of providers and staff. In adjusted logistic regression models, individuals reporting discrimination had more than twice the odds of reporting fair or poor quality of care (OR = 2.4 [95% CI: 1.4–4.3]). In addition, perceived discrimination in medical settings was significantly associated with report of not having enough time with the physician and not being as involved in decision-making as desired. These findings expand our understanding of perceived discriminatory experiences in health care and the consequences of it for patients, providers, and health care systems. This information is essential for identifying future provider interventions and improving the training of health care professionals."

Hyperosmotic stress, in both yeast and mammals, raises PI(3,5)P2 levels by about 20-fold, and this rise in PI(3,5)P2 in endo-lysosomal membranes is critical for protection against hyperosmolarity (28Gary J.D.

Mammalian cells also form large vacuoles upon loss of PI(3,5)P2, possibly due to lysosomal coalescence (33Choy C.H. Saffi G. Gray M.A. Wallace C. Dayam R.M. Ou Z.A. Lenk G. Puertollano R.

Yeast fab1Δ and vac14Δ mutants have significantly reduced V-ATPase assembly and activity, under both iso-osmotic conditions and hyper-osmotic stress (34Li S.C. Diakov T.T. Xu T. Tarsio M. Zhu W.

In yeast cells, a Vph1-NT-GFP fusion that lacks the membrane domain can be recruited from the cytosol to the vacuole/endosome in a salt and PI(3,5)P2-dependent manner (34Li S.C. Diakov T.T. Xu T.

Cell. 2014; 25: 1251-126210.1091/mbc.e13-10-0563Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but we were unable to show a direct interaction of Vph1-NT with PI(3,5)P2 liposomes in vitro. In contrast, we have recently shown that the Golgi isoform, Stv1-NT, binds to the Golgi lipid PI(4)P in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction ensures efficient Golgi localization of Stv1-containing V-ATPases (35Banerjee S. Kane P.M. Direct interaction of the Golgi V-ATPase α-subunit isoform with PI(4)P drives localization of Golgi V-ATPases in yeast.Mol. Biol.

Both interaction of Stv1-NT with PI(4)P-containing liposomes in vitro, and Golgi localization of Stv1 in vivo require lysine 84 (Lys-84), which resides in the Golgi retention/retrieval sequence in the proximal domain of Stv1 (35Banerjee S.

The question of whether Vph1 directly binds to PI(3,5)P2 remains unanswered. In this study, we show that exogenous addition of short-chain diC8 PI(3,5)P2 lipids activates Vph1-containing V-ATPases over their basal activity in a cell-free system. Activation is specific to PI(3,5)P2. Using a combination of molecular modeling, sequence comparison, and mutagenesis, we identified a region in the distal domain of VPH1 that is required for PI(3,5)P2-dependent activation but supports basal V-ATPase activity. Mutations in this region allow us to determine the contribution of PI(3,5)P2-dependent interactions with V-ATPases to maintenance of vacuolar morphology and protection from osmotic stress. Although PI(3,5)P2 was shown to be necessary for increased V-ATPase activity in cells subjected to salt stress, and expressed Vph1-NT exhibited PI(3,5)P2-dependent membrane recruitment in vivo, it was not possible to distinguish direct effects of PI(3,5)P2 binding from indirect effects (34Li S.C. Diakov T.T. Xu T. Tarsio M. Zhu W. Couoh-Cardel S. Weisman L.S. Kane P.M. The signaling lipid PI(3,5)P(2) stabilizes V1-Vo sector interactions and activates the V-ATPase.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 1251-126210.1091/mbc.e13-10-0563Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In an attempt to assess more directly whether PI(3,5)P2 activates V-ATPases, we isolated vacuolar vesicles from wildtype (WT) yeast cells and examined the effects of adding exogenous short-chain phosphoinositide (PIP) lipids. Short-chain (C8) lipids are water soluble, but can partition into membranes (37Collins M.D. Gordon S.E. Short-chain phosphoinositide partitioning into plasma membrane models.Biophys. J. 2013; 105 (24314079): 2485-249410.1016/j.bpj.2013.09.035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test the effects of PIP addition, we added water-soluble diC8 PI(3,5)P2 directly to vacuolar vesicles, mixed rapidly, then added the mixture to the ATPase assay mixture, and assessed the rate of ATP hydrolysis. A parallel “mock” sample was treated with water instead of PI(3,5)P2. Addition of 100 μm PI(3,5)P2 activates V-ATPase activity by 37.0 ± 3.8% relative to mock treatment (Fig. 1A, right). Importantly, 100 μm diC8 PI(4)P or diC8 PI(3)P provided significantly less activation than 100 μm PI(3,5)P2 (Fig. 1A, right). The proportion of the lipid that partitions into the membrane is affected by multiple factors, so determining the final mole percentage of the added lipid in the membrane is difficult. However, we found a dose-dependent activation in response to diC8 PI(3,5)P2 as shown in Fig. 1A. Specifically, 10 μm PI(3,5)P2 was activated by 18.6 ± 7.5%, and 1 μm PI(3,5)P2 by 11.7 ± 4.8% (Fig. 1A, left). We also did dose-response curves for PI(4)P and PI(3)P. The lower concentrations of PI(4)P did activate ATPase activity to a level comparable with lower concentrations of PI(3,5)P2, but as described below (Fig. 3), the PI(4)P activation may not be physiologically significant. PI(3)P gave no activation at any concentration.Figure 3.PI(3,5)P2 promotes ATP-dependent proton pumping in isolated vacuolar vesicles. A, schematic of acridine orange quenching assay: vacuoles were loaded with the dye for 1 min followed by addition of 0.5 mm ATP and 1 mm MgSO4 (MgATP) (t = 1 min). After allowing an initial fluorescence quenching for 5 min, 10 μm diC8 PIP lipid was added to the reaction (t = 6 min) and fluorescent reading was continued. After 5 min (t = 11 min), the V-ATPase inhibitor ConA (ccA) (thick blue arrow) was added to observe de-quenching of fluorescence and the reaction was ended 3 min later (t = 14 min). ConA (thin blue arrow) was added to test if quenching is V-ATPase dependent before Mg-ATP addition.

It was suggested that V1 subunits might be more loosely associated with Vo in the absence of PI(3,5)P2, and that PI(3,5)P2-dependent activation of V-ATPases in salt-stressed cells might reflect tightened V1-Vo interactions (34Li S.C.

Cell. 2014; 25: 1251-126210.1091/mbc.e13-10-0563Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that despite the partial assembly defect, vacuolar vesicles isolated from vac14Δ cells might contain a population of V-ATPases that could be activated by PI(3,5)P2. Consistent with previous results, vacuolar vesicles isolated from vac14Δ cells had only ∼50% of the V-ATPase activity of WT cells (Fig. 1B). However, addition of diC8 PI(3,5)P2 increased the V-ATPase activity in vac14Δ vacuolar vesicles by 65% (Fig. 1C). This is consistent with vac14Δ vacuolar vesicles retaining a population of assembled V-ATPases with low ATPase activity that can be activated when supplied with PI(3,5)P2. There is no canonical PIP-binding domain in the available and predicted structures of Vph1-NT or Stv1-NT. We identified the Stv1(K84A) PI(4)P-binding mutation through modeling, sequence comparisons, and mutagenesis (35Banerjee S. Kane P.M. Direct interaction of the Golgi V-ATPase α-subunit isoform with PI(4)P drives localization of Golgi V-ATPases in yeast.Mol. Biol.

We used a similar strategy to identify candidate PIP-binding residues in Vph1-NT that might affect PI(3,5)P2-dependent V-ATPase activation (Fig. S1, A and B). Recent structures indicate Vph1-NT undergoes structural reorganization between the assembled V1-Vo ATPase and the disassembled and autoinhibited Vo (20Roh S.H. Stam N.J. Hryc C.F. Couoh-Cardel S.

https://openalex.org/W2941356410,"Deregulation of Ca2+ signaling has been regarded as one of the key features of cancer progression. Lysine-deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1), a major regulator of renal ion transport, regulates Ca2+ signaling through stimulating the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIα (PI4KIIIα) to activate Gαq-coupled receptor/PLC-β signaling. However, the contribution of WNK1-mediated Ca2+ signaling in the development of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is yet unknown. We found that the canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC)6 was widely expressed in ccRCC tissues and functioned as a primary Ca2+ influx mechanism. We further identified that the expressions of WNK1, PI4KIIIα, TRPC6, and the nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) were elevated in the tumor tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. WNK1 expression was directly associated with the nuclear grade of ccRCC tissues. Functional experiments showed that WNK1 activated TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ influx and current by stimulating PI4KIIIα. Notably, the inhibition of WNK1-mediated TRPC6 activation and its downstream substrate calcineurin attenuated NFATc1 activation and the subsequent migration and proliferation of ccRCC. These findings revealed a novel perspective of WNK1 signaling in targeting the TRPC6-NFATc1 pathway as a therapeutic potential for renal-cell carcinoma.-Kim, J.-H., Hwang, K.-H., Eom, M., Kim, M., Park, E.

Of these ligands, VEGF-A exhibits the highest binding affinity for VEGFR2 and is considered the most potent angiogenic agent. VEGF-A is a disulfide-linked, antiparallel homodimer (16Muller Y.A.

VEGF-A121 is the smallest isoform of VEGF-A; however, it contains the full VEGFR2-binding site but lacks the sites mediating the interaction with the extracellular matrix and other coreceptors. It has been found that VEGFR2 can exist in either a monomeric or a dimeric form on the plasma membrane of cells, even in the absence of ligand (21Sarabipour S. Ballmer-Hofer K. Hristova K.

The existence of VEGFR2 monomers and dimers on the plasma membrane suggests that the formation of VEGF-bound, active dimers can occur through several different pathways (see Fig. 1). In one pathway, the monomeric receptors dimerize on the plasma membrane, upon which a ligand may then bind to the preformed dimer and activate it. Alternatively, a ligand may bind to a monomer of VEGFR2. This liganded monomer may then dimerize with an unliganded VEGFR2 monomer to form an active liganded VEGFR2 dimer. At very high VEGF concentrations, a third pathway exists in which two ligand-bound VEGFR2 monomers can dimerize to form an active dimer upon release of one of the bound VEGF ligands. The prevalence of these pathways in an experiment designed to measure VEGF–VEGFR2 binding affinities will depend on the VEGFR2 ligand-free monomer–dimer association constant and thus on the total concentration of VEGFR2 on the plasma membrane of cells, on the possibly different binding affinities of VEGF for monomeric and dimeric forms of VEGFR2, and on the concentration of free VEGF in the medium around the cells. There are previous reports of measurements of effective VEGF binding constants, but they do not discriminate between the association state of the receptor on the surface of the cell because they do not account for the surface density dependence of VEGFR2 dimer formation on the plasma membrane (24Terman B.I.

Thus, most methods used to assess ligand binding to cell surface receptors cannot provide an answer as to which of the pathways is preferentially utilized in the VEGF–VEGFR2 system. Here, we overcome these prior methodological limitations by employing the fully quantified spectral imaging (FSI) methodology (22King C. Stoneman M. Raicu V. Hristova K. Fully quantified spectral imaging reveals in vivo membrane protein interactions.Integr. Biol. 2016; 8 (26787445): 216-22910.1039/c5ib00202hCrossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) to directly measure the surface density of expressed VEGFR2, the surface density of bound VEGF on the same cell, and the free VEGF concentration in the buffer surrounding the cells. Imaging many cells at different free VEGF concentrations enables the use of a rigorous thermodynamics approach and global fitting to simultaneously determine the separate affinities of VEGF for monomeric and dimeric forms of VEGFR2. To perform these measurements, we use a commercially available Alexa Fluor 594–labeled version of a recombinant single-chain derivative of vascular endothelial growth factor (scVEGF) (28Anderson C.R. Rychak J.J. Backer M. Backer J. Ley K. Klibanov A.L. scVEGF microbubble ultrasound contrast agents: a novel probe for ultrasound molecular imaging of tumor angiogenesis.Invest.

Although VEGF-A is a disulfide-linked dimer of two separate chains, scVEGF is an engineered fusion protein that combines two fragments, each composed of amino acids 3–112 of VEGF-A121, that are cloned consecutively in a head-to-tail fashion. By creating a single recombinant protein, Backer and Backer (29Backer M.V. Backer J.M. Targeting endothelial cells overexpressing VEGFR-2: selective toxicity of Shiga-like toxin-VEGF fusion proteins.Bioconjug. Chem. 2001; 12 (11716701): 1066-107310.1021/bc015534jCrossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were able to introduce an N-terminal 15-amino-acid tag containing a unique cysteine residue that could be used for site-specific attachment of a single fluorophore despite the presence of 16 native cysteines. scVEGF is a fully functional form of VEGF-A121 as it binds and activates VEGFR2 just like endogenous VEGFs. It is widely used in translational research and has already proven its utility as an imaging and a therapeutic agent (28Anderson C.R. Rychak J.J. Backer M. Backer J. Ley K.

We utilize a thermodynamic cycle that accounts for all of the different forms of VEGFR2 that can exist in the absence and presence of VEGF: monomers (M), dimers (D), ligand-bound monomers (LM), and ligand-bound dimers (LD) as shown in Fig. 1A. This model assumes that one molecule of VEGF can bind either a VEGFR2 monomer or a VEGFR2 dimer. This thermodynamic cycle includes all the possible pathways leading from unliganded VEGFR2 monomers to active, VEGF-bound VEGFR2 dimers. Along the top of the cycle, VEGFR2 can undergo unliganded dimerization with affinity KR in units of (receptors/μm2)−1. KR=[D][M]2(Eq. 1) VEGF can then bind to the preformed dimer of VEGFR2 with affinity KLD having inverse molar units (m−1). KLD=[LD][L]free[D](Eq. 2) Alternatively, a VEGF ligand in solution can bind to a monomer of VEGFR2 with affinity KLM (m−1) (moving from the top left position in the thermodynamic cycle down in a counterclockwise direction in Fig. 1A). KLM=[LM][L]free[M](Eq. 3) Moving right in the cycle, a VEGF-bound VEGFR2 monomer, LM, can dimerize with an unliganded VEGFR2 monomer, M, again forming the ligand-bound, active dimeric form of VEGFR2 with an affinity of KLMD, having units of (receptors/μm2)−1. KLMD=[LD][LM][M](Eq. 4) Traversing further counterclockwise around the cycle, under saturating VEGF conditions two liganded VEGFR2 monomers, (LM), can combine to form a liganded dimer of VEGFR2 (LD) only upon release of a VEGF molecule into solution. This process is described by the association constant KLM–LD with units of m·(receptors/μm2)−1. KLM−LD=[LD][L]free[LM]2(Eq. 5) Experimentally, we measure the total surface density of YFP-labeled VEGFR2, [T]. [T]=[M]+2[D]+[LM]+2[LD](Eq. 6) We also measure the total bound surface density of scVEGF-AF594 on the same cell. [L]bound=[LM]+[LD](Eq. 7) Finally, we measure the free VEGF concentration in the medium surrounding the cells, [L]free. Using the association constants defined above, we write the total concentration of VEGF2, [T], in terms of the free VEGF concentration and the concentration of monomeric VEGFR2. [T]=2KR(1+[L]freeKLD)[M]2+(1+[L]freeKLM)[M](Eq. 8) Next, the bound surface density of VEGF (Equation 7) is written in terms of the monomeric VEGFR2 surface density, the free VEGF concentration, and the association constants. [L]bound=[L]free[M](KLM+[M]KLDKR)(Eq. 9) When [M] is determined from Equation 8 and substituted into Equation 9, Equation 9 provides a link between the measured parameters, KR, [L]free, and [T], and the unknown binding constants, KLM and KLD. Note that KR has been measured previously (22King C. Stoneman M. Raicu V. Hristova K. Fully quantified spectral imaging reveals in vivo membrane protein interactions.Integr. Biol. 2016; 8 (26787445): 216-22910.1039/c5ib00202hCrossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the measured value is given in Table 1. Thus, there are two unknowns in these experiments, KLM and KLD, and measurements of [T] and [L]bound for many cells at different [L]free concentrations yield an overdetermined system of equations that is used to determine the best-fit values of the monomeric and dimeric binding affinities, KLM and KLD.Table 1Thermodynamic parameters describing VEGF binding to VEGFR2Association constantECTM VEGFR2Full-length VEGFR2KLM (m−1)9.6 × 107 ± 1.8 × 1079.6 × 107 ± 1.8 × 107KLD (m−1)4.3 × 109 ± 0.6 × 1094.3 × 109 ± 0.6 × 109KRaMeasured previously (21, 22).

We use a VEGFR2 construct, VEGFR2 ECTM-YFP, in which the kinase domain is substituted with YFP attached via a (GGS)5 flexible linker to the TM domain (see Discussion below). Fluorescent AF594-scVEGF is added to the hypotonic swelling medium, and cells expressing VEGFR2 are imaged under two-photon excitation with the OptiMis spectral detection system (37Raicu V.

As shown in Fig. 2A, YFP is intracellularly located, whereas AF594-scVEGF is bound to the extracellular domain of VEGFR2. Fig. 2B shows a schematic of the experimental setup. Measurements of the plasma membrane VEGFR2 surface densities, bound VEGF surface densities, and free VEGF concentrations in the media are performed with the FSI methodology. As described previously (22King C. Stoneman M. Raicu V. Hristova K. Fully quantified spectral imaging reveals in vivo membrane protein interactions.Integr. Biol. 2016; 8 (26787445): 216-22910.1039/c5ib00202hCrossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), FSI enables the measurements of the surface density of fluorophore-labeled membrane proteins in 2–3-μm-size patches by performing two scans, a “donor scan” to excite YFP at 960 nm and an “acceptor scan” to excite AF594 at 800 nm. The fluorescence absorbance and emission spectra of YFP and AF594 are shown in Fig. 2C. FSI also allows for the measurement of the three-dimensional concentration of freely diffusing, fluorescent moieties, in this case free AF594-scVEGF, in the solution surrounding the cells. Fig. 2, D and E, show three transiently transfected HEK293T cells that have been swollen with hypotonic medium in the presence of AF594-scVEGF. The three cells are each expressing different levels of VEGFR2 ECTM-YFP, as indicated by the differing VEGFR2 ECTM-YFP intensities. Fig. 2D, top, shows the cells under excitation at 960 nm, such that YFP attached to VEGFR2 ECTM is primarily excited. Large stretches of homogenous membrane fluorescence are visible, with the protein primarily localized in the plasma membrane. Fig. 2D, bottom, shows the same cells under excitation at 800 nm, exciting primarily AF594-scVEGF. AF594-scVEGF is highly concentrated on the surface of the cells, but no Alexa Fluor 594 fluorescence originates from the intracellular space. Thus, the ligand is not endocytosed as expected, primarily because cell swelling inhibits endocytosis (39Rauch C. Farge E. Endocytosis switch controlled by transmembrane osmotic pressure and phospholipid number asymmetry.Biophys.

Furthermore, the VEGFR2 ECTM construct lacks a kinase domain and does not undergo internalization. On cells with no measurable VEGFR2 ECTM-YFP fluorescence, we see no measurable AF594-scVEGF fluorescence (Fig. 3), indicating that nonspecific binding of VEGF provides a minimal contribution to our measurements. We measured the surface densities of VEGFR2 ECTM-YFP and bound AF594-scVEGF and the free AF594-scVEGF concentration in 12 independent experiments (at different free ligand concentrations) with a total of 387 cells. The free VEGF concentrations were varied across 3 orders of magnitude, from 0.21 to 42.4 nm, and were measured directly with the FSI method (Fig. 4). These experiments provided a total of 661 data points at the 12 free VEGF concentrations. Fig. 2E shows the measured total apparent FRET efficiency between the intracellular YFP of VEGFR2 ECTM and the extracellularly bound AF594-scVEGF as a function of total VEGFR2 surface density. The FRET efficiency is zero for all concentrations of VEGFR2. This is expected because YFP (the FRET donor) and the AF594 (the FRET acceptor) are further than 10 nm apart when VEGF is bound to the distal region of VEGFR2’s EC domain (see Fig. 2A). Indeed, the plasma membrane is ∼5 nm thick on its own, and the intracellular YFP is a large β-barrel connected to VEGFR2 TM domains via a 15-amino-acid (GGS)5 flexible linker, whereas VEGF is bound to the extracellular D2 and D3 subunits of VEGFR2. Thus, the negligible FRET efficiencies measured for all VEGFR2 surface densities and all free VEGF concentrations serve as an important control for these experiments. Fig. 5 shows the bound AF"
https://openalex.org/W2940682522,"Background No consensus has been reached on whether depression decreases or increases with age in later life. Majority of the evidence comes from Western societies, while little is known about this relationship and its rural-urban disparities in the Chinese context. Methods Three waves of data from 15,501 Chinese adults aged 45–85 years from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, Chinese sister study of Health and Retirement Study, were used. Depression caseness was identified using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (score ≥12). Urbanisation levels were determined by combining rural-urban residence and rural-urban Hukou (a household registration system). Odds ratios and predicted probabilities of depression caseness were estimated using generalised linear mixed models. Results For both men and women and across all ages, the crude predicted probability of depression caseness was the highest in the rural group, followed by the semi-urban group, and the lowest in the urban group. The probability was stable over age among urban men (around 0.05), but it increased at an accelerated rate with age among semi-urban men (0.25 at age 85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13–0.44) and rural men (0.29 at age 85, 95% CI: 0.22–0.39). Among women the age pattern was similar between the urbanisation groups: the probability increased with age, reached a peak at ages 75–80 (urban women: 0.16, 95% CI: 0.13–0.20; semi-urban women: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.20–0.39; rural women: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.36–0.46), and decreased slightly afterwards. These differences were significantly attenuated when socio-demographic characteristics and physical disability, but not when behaviour-related factors, were controlled for. Conclusion The age trajectories of later-life depression caseness varied by gender and urbanisation levels, and were not U-shaped as in many Western societies. The increasing depression caseness with age and the large rural disadvantage were substantially driven by socio-demographic characteristics and physical disability."
https://openalex.org/W2917395421,"The synaptonemal complex (SC) is a supramolecular protein assembly that mediates homologous chromosome synapsis during meiosis. This zipper-like structure assembles in a continuous manner between homologous chromosome axes, enforcing a 100-nm separation along their entire length and providing the necessary three-dimensional framework for cross-over formation. The mammalian SC comprises eight components—synaptonemal complex protein 1–3 (SYCP1–3), synaptonemal complex central element protein 1–3 (SYCE1–3), testis-expressed 12 (TEX12), and six6 opposite strand transcript 1 (SIX6OS1)—arranged in transverse and longitudinal structures. These largely α-helical, coiled-coil proteins undergo heterotypic interactions, coupled with recursive self-assembly of SYCP1, SYCE2–TEX12, and SYCP2–SYCP3, to achieve the vast supramolecular SC structure. Here, we report a novel self-assembly mechanism of the SC central element component SYCE3, identified through multi-angle light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. These analyses revealed that SYCE3 adopts a dimeric four-helical bundle structure that acts as the building block for concentration-dependent self-assembly into a series of discrete higher-order oligomers. We observed that this is achieved through staggered lateral interactions between self-assembly surfaces of SYCE3 dimers and through end-on interactions that likely occur through intermolecular domain swapping between dimer folds. These mechanisms are combined to achieve potentially limitless SYCE3 assembly, particularly favoring formation of dodecamers of three laterally associated end-on tetramers. Our findings extend the family of self-assembling proteins within the SC and reveal additional means for structural stabilization of the SC central element.

The SC was first identified in meiotic cells through its characteristic electron microscopic appearance, in which a ribbon-like structure of three parallel electron-dense components provides a continuous, regular, and complete synapsis between parallel homologous chromosome axes (Fig. 1a) (1Westergaard M. von Wettstein D. The synaptinemal complex.Annu. Rev. Genet. 1972; 6 (4269097): 71-11010.1146/annurev.ge.06.120172.000443Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 4Moses M.J.

Its electron-dense components are described as a midline central element and two flanking lateral elements, with each lateral element assembled on one chromosome axis of the homologous pair. These structures are held together through a series of interdigitated transverse filaments, which enforce a separation of ∼100 nm between lateral elements and thereby between homologous chromosomes (5Schmekel K.

In addition to mediating synapsis, the three-dimensional structure of the SC modifies meiotic chromosome structure and provides the necessary physical framework for the formation of genetic cross-overs that ensure the faithful segregation of homologues (6Kouznetsova A.

An emerging theme in SC protein biochemistry is the formation of obligate α-helical dimeric and tetrameric coiled-coils that self-assemble into supramolecular structures through sequences at their α-helical termini. SYCP1 is an elongated coiled-coil with a tetrameric interface at its N terminus that extends into two C-terminal coiled-coil dimers (23Dunce J.M. Dunne O.M. Ratcliff M. Millán C. Madgwick S. Usón I.

Its N termini form head-to-head dimers-of-dimers that combine with tetramer interfaces to achieve a staggered lattice, whereas C termini undergo protonation-induced assembly into back-to-back tetramers (23Dunce J.M.

SYCE2–TEX12 is an α-helical 4:4 complex that self-assembles into long fibers with dimensions similar to those of the central element (25Davies O.R. Maman J.D. Pellegrini L.

A similar repeating unit has also been observed in limited assemblies of an SYCP2–SYCP3 complex (30West A.M. Rosenberg S.C. Ur S.N. Lehmer M.K. Ye Q. Hagemann G. Caballero I. Usón I. MacQueen A.J.

Thus, whereas SYCP1 forms discrete interactions in lattice assembly, certain central and lateral element components self-assemble into elongated linear structures with the capacity to extend along the chromosome length (Fig. 1a). SYCE3 is a small protein of 88 amino acids that is essential for SC assembly, meiotic division, and fertility (18Schramm S. Fraune J. Naumann R. Hernandez-Hernandez A. Höög C. Cooke H.J. Alsheimer M.

The crystal structure of mouse SYCE3 has been reported, revealing a compact four-helical bundle formed of two helix-loop-helix chains interacting in an anti-parallel configuration (Fig. 1, b and c) (31Lu J. Gu Y. Feng J. Zhou W. Yang X. Shen Y. Structural insight into the central element assembly of the synaptonemal complex.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (25394919)7059 10.1038/srep07059Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition to the dimeric structure, a series of higher-molecular weight SYCE3 oligomers were detected in solution through chemical cross-linking analysis (31Lu J. Gu Y. Feng J. Zhou W. Yang X. Shen Y. Structural insight into the central element assembly of the synaptonemal complex.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (25394919)7059 10.1038/srep07059Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These observations suggested to us that, similar to other SC proteins, the SYCE3 α-helical dimer may undergo self-assembly into structures that contribute to SC architecture. Here, we report a molecular mechanism for SYCE3 self-assembly through multi-angle light scattering and small-angle X-ray scattering studies combined with experimentally directed molecular modeling. We find that SYCE3 dimers readily self-assemble in solution through lateral interactions mediated by surface-exposed aromatic residues and end-on assembly through a potential intermolecular domain-swap event. These self-assembly mechanisms combine to achieve a stable dodecamer of three laterally associated end-on tetramers, which may further assemble into larger molecular species. The previously reported SYCE3 crystal structure revealed a compact four-helical bundle formed of two intertwined helix-loop-helix chains in an anti-parallel configuration (Fig. 1, b and c) (PDB code 4R3Q (31Lu J. Gu Y. Feng J. Zhou W. Yang X. Shen Y. Structural insight into the central element assembly of the synaptonemal complex.Sci. Rep. 2014; 4 (25394919)7059 10.1038/srep07059Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar)). Whereas the two loops had not been built into the deposited structure, we found that they were visible in electron density maps, so we rebuilt and re-refined the SYCE3 structure against the deposited experimental data (Fig. S1 (a and b) and Table 1). The resultant structure is more complete and covers amino acids 10–85, which includes the additional loops and short N-terminal extensions (Fig. 1c). This rebuilt SYCE3 structure was used in all subsequent analyses.Table 1Data collection, phasing, and refinement statisticsSYCE3 (previously released structure), PDB code 4R3QSYCE3 (rebuilt/re-refined structure),aRebuilt and re-refined from a previously released structure (PDB code 4R3Q) (31).

Open table in a new tab We first tested whether the solution structure of SYCE3 corresponds to its compact crystal structure. We utilized size-exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) to determine the unambiguous molecular weight of species within a protein sample. SEC-MALS confirmed that SYCE3 forms a 22-kDa homodimer (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1c), whereas CD spectroscopy confirmed the presence of almost entirely α-helical structure (Fig. S1d). We analyzed the size and shape of proteins in solution by size-exclusion chromatography small-angle X-ray scattering (SEC-SAXS; Table 2). The SAXS scattering curve was poorly fitted by the crystal structure, with a χ2 value of 22.2 (Fig. 1e and Fig. S1e). Further, the SAXS real-space P(r) interatomic distance distribution indicated a maximum dimension of 82 Å (Fig. 1f), which is ∼10 Å larger than the length of the crystal structure, and its ab initio dummy-atom model resembled the crystal structure with additional mass at either end of its long axis (Fig. 1g). We reasoned that this may be due to the 9-amino acid N termini that are present at either end of the molecule but are absent from the crystal structure owing to lack of electron density. We modeled N termini onto the structure using MODELLER, with them adopting largely flexible conformations (Fig. 1g). This full-length model fitted closely to experimental SAXS data with a χ2 value of 1.46 (Fig. 1e), indicating that scattering data are well-explained by the crystal structure with additional unstructured N termini. To confirm these findings, we analyzed a truncated construct of amino acids 12–88 (with subsequently described point mutation L15N), in which unstructured N termini are removed. SEC-MALS and CD analysis confirmed that this construct forms an α-helical dimer in solution (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1d). Further, its SEC-SAXS scattering data were closely fitted by the crystal structure (χ2 = 1.41) (Fig. 1e), with the P(r) distribution demonstrating a maximum dimension of 70 Å (Fig. 1f), and its ab initio model closely matching the crystal structure (Fig. 1g). Finally, SYCE3 full-length and 12–88 L15N demonstrated similar SAXS cross-sectional radii (Fig. S1f), in keeping with the presence of a common structural core. Thus, we conclude that solution-state SYCE3 adopts the compact dimeric fold observed in its crystal structure.Table 2Summary of biophysical dataSYCE3 1–88SYCE3 1–88 W41E/Y44ESYCE3 1–88 W41A/Y44ASYCE3 1–88 P53QSYCE3 1–88 PPP-loopSYCE3 12–88 L15NSEC-MALS Theoretical monomer weight (kDa)10.710.710.710.710.710.510.510.810.810.810.810.810.610.3 Experimental molecular weight (kDa)21.942.062.3131.920.920.339.5High-molecular weight assemblies20.219.1 OligomerDimerTetramerHexamerDodecamerDimerDimerTetramerAssembly 1Assembly 2Assembly 3Assembly 4Assembly 5DimerDimerSEC-SAXS I(0) (cm−1) (from P(r))9.28 × 10−3 ± 9.57 × 10−68.34 × 10−3 ± 2.72 × 10−59.84 × 10−3 ± 3.55 × 10−52.94 × 10−2 ± 5.08 × 10−58.79 × 10−3 ± 2.28 × 10−56.03 × 10−3 ± 3.65 × 10−51.65 × 10−2 ± 7.31 × 10−54.12 × 10−3 ± 4.73 × 10−51.50 × 10−2 ± 5.80 × 10−52.17 × 10−2 ± 1.07 × 10−43.00 × 10−2 ± 1.65 × 10−43.82 × 10−2 ± 2.32 × 10−41.12 × 10−2 ± 1.73 × 10−53.11 × 10−2 ± 3.24 × 10−5 I(0) (cm−1) (from Guinier analysis)9.20 × 10−3 ±"
https://openalex.org/W2940519132,"Objective To understand preferences for and estimate the likely uptake of preventive treatments currently being evaluated in randomized controlled trials with individuals at increased risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods Focus groups were used to identify key attributes of potential preventive treatment for RA (reduction in risk of RA, how treatment is taken, chance of side effects, certainty in estimates, health care providers opinion). A web-based discrete choice experiment (DCE) was administered to people at-risk of developing RA, asking them to first choose their preferred of two hypothetical preventive RA treatments, and then between their preferred treatment and ‘no treatment for now.’ DCE data was analyzed using conditional logit regression to estimate the significance and relative importance of attributes in influencing preferences. Results Two-hundred and eighty-eight first-degree relatives (60% female; 66% aged 18–39 years) completed all tasks in the survey. Fourteen out of fifteen attribute levels significantly influenced preferences for treatments. How treatment is taken (oral vs. infusion β0.983, p<0.001), increasing reduction in risk of RA (β0.922, p<0.001), health care professional preference (β0.900, p<0.001), and avoiding irreversible (β0.839, p<0.001) or reversible serious side effects (β0.799, p<0.001) were most influential. Predicted uptake was high for non-biologic drugs (e.g. 84% hydroxycholoroquine), but very low for atorvastatin (8%) and biologics (<6%). Conclusion Decisions to take preventative treatments are complex, and uptake depends on how treatments can compromise on convenience, potential risks and benefits, and recommendations/preferences of health care professionals. This evidence contributes to understanding whether different preventative treatment strategies are likely to be acceptable to target populations."
https://openalex.org/W2941056772,"Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that has heavy consequences on a child’s wellbeing, especially in the academic, psychological and relational planes. The current evaluation of the disorder is supported by clinical assessment and written tests. A definitive diagnosis is usually made based on the DSM-V criteria. There is a lot of ongoing research on ADHD, in order to determine the neurophysiological basis of the disorder and to reach a more objective diagnosis. The advent of Machine Learning (ML) opens up promising prospects for the development of systems able to predict a diagnosis from phenotypic and neuroimaging data. This was the reason why the ADHD-200 contest was launched a few years ago. Based on the publicly available ADHD-200 collection, participants were challenged to predict ADHD with the best possible predictive accuracy. In the present work, we propose instead a ML methodology which primarily places importance on the explanatory power of a model. Such an approach is intended to achieve a fair trade-off between the needs of performance and interpretability expected from medical diagnosis aid systems. We applied our methodology on a data sample extracted from the ADHD-200 collection, through the development of decision trees which are valued for their readability. Our analysis indicates the relevance of the limbic system for the diagnosis of the disorder. Moreover, while providing explanations that make sense, the resulting decision tree performs favorably given the recent results reported in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W2941047508,"The objectives were 1) to compare the effects of adolescent sport-related concussion (SRC) and sport-related extremity fracture (SRF) on academic outcomes including change in school grades and school attendance; and 2) to determine which specific academic accommodations were most helpful during recovery from these injuries.A prospective cohort study was conducted to compare changes in school grades, school attendance and academic accommodations among students (grades 8-12) with an SRC or SRF. School grades were extracted from student immediate pre- and post-injury report cards. Students completed attendance log books and an exit interview to determine which accommodations were helpful and how accommodating they perceived their school to be during their recovery.Overall, 124 students (92 with SRC and 32 with SRF) submitted both pre- and post-injury report cards. Students who sustained an SRC or SRF experienced similar decreases in grades post-injury (SRC: -1.0%; 95% CI: -2.1, 0.1 and SRF: -0.9%: 95% CI: -2.1, 0.3). Students with an SRC missed significantly more days of school compared to those with an SRF (median of 4 days [IQR: 1, 7] versus 1 day [IQR: 0, 4], p<0.0001). In total, 60/113 (53.1%) SRC students reported their school to be very accommodating while only 31/77 (40.3%) SRF students reported their school to be very accommodating (p = 0.082).Students who sustain an SRC miss significantly more days of school but demonstrate similar changes in school grades post-injury compared to those with an SRF. Future studies are needed to identify the pre- and post-injury factors associated with poor academic functioning following concussion and identify measures that can be taken to help optimize academic outcomes in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2940690256,"The impact of low-normal hemoglobin (Hb) levels and anemia on the risk of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in general populations has rarely been examined.510,620 Korean adults aged 40-80 years without known chronic kidney disease (CKD) underwent health examinations during 2002-2003 and were followed-up until 2013. Incidence of ESRD was identified by hospital discharge and clinical visit records.During a mean follow-up of 10.5, 575 women and 1047 men were diagnosed with ESRD. Lower Hb levels were associated with an increased risk of ESRD at given severity of albuminuria and at given estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Hb 13-13.9 g/dL in men, Hb 11-11.9 g/dL in women, and trace albuminuria assessed by dipstick urinalysis were associated with more than doubled risk. The risk associated with lower Hb was stronger in older (≥60 years) than younger women. Among 349,993 participants with information on eGFR, the multivariable-adjusted HRs associated with 1 g/dL lower Hb in participants with eGFR values ≥60, 30-59, and <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.17-1.54), 1.55 (1.38-1.74), and 1.75 (1.47-2.09), respectively (Pinteraction between eGFR groups = .06).Low-normal Hb levels and anemia are risk factors for ESRD incidence in person without CKD and for CKD progression to ESRD. Lower Hb increases the risk of ESRD through synergistic biological interactions with lower eGFR and albuminuria. The impacts of lower Hb may be stronger in older than younger women. Proper management and screening at earlier stage of Hb decline and anemia might reduce the burden of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2941105060,"We investigate the effects of aerobic exercise training (AET) on the thermogenic response, substrate metabolism and renin angiotensin system (RAS) in the subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SC-WAT) of mice fed cafeteria diet (CAF). Male C57BL/6J mice were assigned into groups CHOW-SED (chow diet, sedentary; n = 10), CHOW-TR (chow diet, trained; n = 10), CAF-SED (CAF, sedentary; n = 10) and CAF-TR (CAF, trained; n = 10). AET consisted in running sessions of 60 min at 60% of maximal speed, five days per week for eight weeks. The CAF-SED group showed higher body weight and adiposity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (IR), while AET prevented such damages in CAF-TR group. AET reduced the p-AKT/t-AKT ratio and increased ATGL expression in CHOW-TR and CAF-TR groups and increased t-HSL and p-HSL/t-HSL ratio in CAF-TR. AET prevented adipocyte hypertrophy in CAF-TR group and increased UCP-1 protein expression only in CHOW-TR. Serum ACE2 increased in CHOW-TR and CAF-TR groups, and Ang (1–7) increased in the CHOW-TR group. In the SC-WAT, CAF-TR group increased the expression of AT1, AT2 and Mas receptors, whereas CHOW-TR increased Ang (1–7) and Ang (1–7)/Ang II ratio in SC-WAT. No changes were observed in ACE and Ang II. Positive correlations were observed between UCP-1 and kITT (r = 0.6), between UCP-1 and Ang (1–7) concentration (r = 0.6), and between UCP-1 and Ang (1–7)/Ang II ratio (r = 0.7). In conclusion, the AET prevented obesity and IR, reduced insulin signaling proteins and increased lipolysis signaling proteins in the SC-WAT. In addition, the CAF diet precludes the AET-induced thermogenic response and the partial modulation of the RAS suggests that the protective effect of AET against obesity and IR could not be associated with SC-WAT RAS."
https://openalex.org/W2942314773,"Oxidative stress plays a key role in steatohepatitis induced by both xenobiotic agents and high fat diet (HFD). The present study aimed to evaluate hepatic oxidative stress and anti-oxidant systems response in rats exposed to HFD and/or non-toxic dose of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), the first metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane. Groups of 8 rats were so treated for 4 weeks: 1- standard diet (N group); 2- standard diet plus DDE (10 mg/kg b.w.) (N+DDE group); 3- HFD (D group); 4- HFD plus DDE (D+DDE group). Oxidative stress was analyzed by determining malondialdehyde as lipid peroxidation product, while the anti-oxidant systems were evaluating by measuring the levels of the principal cytosolic and mitochondrial antioxidant proteins and enzymes, namely superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1, SOD2), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) involved in the control of hepatic reactive oxygens species (ROS) accumulation. The results showed malondialdehyde accumulation in livers of all groups, confirming the pro-oxidant effects of both HFD and DDE, but with a greater effect of DDE in absence of HFD. In addition, we found different levels of the analyzed anti-oxidant systems in the different groups. DDE mainly induced UCP2 and SOD2, while HFD mainly induced GPx1. Noteworthy, in the condition of simultaneous exposure to DDE and HFD, the anti-oxidant response was more similar to the one induced by HFD than to the response induced by DDE. Present findings confirmed that both HFD and xenobiotic exposure induced hepatic oxidative stress and showed that the anti-oxidant defense response was not the same in the diverse groups, suggesting that UCP2 induction could be an adaptive response to limit excessive ROS damage, mainly in condition of xenobiotic exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2949350566,"Cell subtype proportion variability between samples contributes significantly to the variation of functional genomic properties such as gene expression or DNA methylation. Although the impact of the variation of cell subtype composition on measured genomic quantities is recognized, and some innovative tools have been developed for the analysis of heterogeneous samples, most functional genomics studies using samples with mixed cell types still ignore the influence of cell subtype proportion variation, or just deal with it as a nuisance variable to be eliminated. Here we demonstrate how harvesting information about cell subtype proportions from functional genomics data can provide insights into cellular changes associated with phenotypes. We focused on two types of mixed cell populations, human blood and mouse kidney. Cell type prediction is well developed in the former, but not currently in the latter. Estimating the cellular repertoire is easier when a reference dataset from purified samples of all cell types in the tissue is available, as is the case for blood. However, reference datasets are not available for most other tissues, such as the kidney. In this study, we showed that the proportion of alterations attributable to changes in the cellular composition varies strikingly in the two disorders (asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus), suggesting that the contribution of cell subtype proportion changes to functional genomic properties can be disease-specific. We also showed that a reference dataset from a single-cell RNA-seq study successfully estimated the cell subtype proportions in mouse kidney and allowed us to distinguish altered cell subtype differences between two different knock-out mouse models, both of which had reported a reduced number of glomeruli compared to their wild-type counterparts. These findings demonstrate that testing for changes in cell subtype proportions between conditions can yield important insights in functional genomics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2952110448,"The Tec kinases ITK (interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase) and RLK (resting lymphocyte kinase) are critical components of the proximal TCR/CD3 signal transduction machinery, and data in mice suggest that ITK negatively modulates regulatory T cell (TREG) differentiation. However, whether Tec kinases modulate TREG development and/or function in human T cells remains unknown. Using a novel self-delivery siRNA platform (sdRNA), we found that ITK knockdown in human primary naïve peripheral blood CD4 T cells increased Foxp3+ expression under both TREG and T helper priming conditions. TREG differentiated under ITK knockdown conditions exhibited enhanced expression of the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 and were suppressive in a T cell proliferation assay. ITK knockdown decreased IL-17A production in T cells primed under Th17 conditions and promoted Th1 differentiation. Lastly, a dual ITK/RLK Tec kinase inhibitor did not induce Foxp3 in CD4 T cells, but conversely abrogated Foxp3 expression induced by ITK knockdown. Our data suggest that targeting ITK in human T cells may be an effective approach to boost TREG in the context of autoimmune diseases, but concomitant inhibition of other Tec family kinases may negate this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2940952225,"Studies with adult musicians show that beginning lessons before age seven is associated with better performance on musical tasks and enhancement in auditory and motor brain regions. It is hypothesized that early training interacts with periods of heightened neural development to promote greater plasticity and better learning and performance later in life. However, we do not know whether such effects can be observed in childhood. Moreover, we do not know the degree to which such effects are related to training, or whether early training has different effects on particular musical skills depending on their cognitive, perceptual or motor requirements. To address these questions, we compared groups of child musicians who had started lessons earlier or later on age-normed tests of rhythm synchronization and melody discrimination. We also matched for age, years of experience, working memory and global cognitive ability. Results showed that children who started early performed better on simple melody discrimination and that scores on this task were predicted by both age of start (AoS) and cognitive ability. There was no effect of AoS for the more complex rhythm or transposed melody tasks, but these scores were significantly predicted by working memory ability, and for transposed melodies, by hours of weekly practice. These findings provide the first evidence that earlier AoS for music training in childhood results in enhancement of specific musical skills. Integrating these results with those for adult musicians, we hypothesize that early training has an immediate impact on simple melody discrimination skills that develop early, while more complex abilities, like synchronization and transposition require both further maturation and additional training."
https://openalex.org/W2940861929,"Background There is no proven management for mild cases of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pulmonary disease, who do not immediately receive treatment and are managed with observation alone, because its long term-natural course, factors predictive of deterioration, and the effect of treating the disease remain unclear. Thus, we sought to investigate the natural course of mild cases of MAC pulmonary disease. Methods We conducted a multicenter retrospective study. Sixty-five patients with mild MAC pulmonary disease in whom treatment was withheld for at least 6 months after diagnosis were retrospectively recruited after a review of 747 medical records. Longitudinal changes in clinical features were evaluated by using a mixed effects model. Results Mean follow-up was 6.9 ± 5.7 years. During the follow-up period, 15 patients (23%) required treatment and 50 (77%) were managed with observation alone. At diagnosis, 65 patients had nodular bronchiectatic disease without fibrocavitary lesions. Among clinical features, mean body mass index (BMI), forced expiratory volume in 1 second as percent of forced vital capacity (%FEV1), nodular lung lesions, and bronchiectasis worsened significantly in the observation group during follow-up. In the treatment group, BMI, and %FEV1 were stable, but bronchiectasis significantly worsened. At diagnosis, the polyclonal MAC infection rate in the treatment group was higher than that in the observation group. Other microbiological factors, such as insertion sequences, did not differ significantly between the groups. Conclusions Mild MAC pulmonary disease progresses slowly but substantially without treatment. Treatment prevents the deterioration of the disease but not the progression of bronchiectasis. Polyclonal MAC infection is a predictor of disease progression."

However, low fibroblast–cardiomyocyte conversion rates remain a major challenge in this reprogramming. To this end, here we conducted a chemical screen and identified four agents, insulin-like growth factor-1, Mll1 inhibitor MM589, transforming growth factor-β inhibitor A83–01, and Bmi1 inhibitor PTC-209, termed IMAP, which coordinately enhanced reprogramming efficiency. Using α–muscle heavy chain–GFP–tagged mouse embryo fibroblasts as a starting cell type, we observed that the IMAP treatment increases iCM formation 6-fold. IMAP stimulated higher cardiac troponin T and α-actinin expression and increased sarcomere formation, coinciding with up-regulated expression of many cardiac genes and down-regulated fibroblast gene expression. Furthermore, IMAP promoted higher spontaneous beating and calcium transient activities of iCMs derived from neonatal cardiac fibroblasts. Intriguingly, we also observed that the IMAP treatment repressed many genes involved in immune responses, particularly those in specific C-C chemokine signaling pathways. We therefore investigated the roles of C-C motif chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3), CCL6, and CCL17 in cardiac reprogramming and observed that they inhibited iCM formation, whereas inhibitors of C-C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CCR1), CCR4, and CCR5 had the opposite effect. These results indicated that the IMAP treatment directly suppresses specific C-C chemokine signaling pathways and thereby enhances cardiac reprogramming. In conclusion, a combination of four chemicals, named here IMAP, suppresses specific C-C chemokine signaling pathways and facilitates Mef2c/Gata4/Tbx5 (MGT)-induced cardiac reprogramming, providing a potential means for iCM formation in clinical applications.

Mice globally lacking LAL accumulate CE most prominently in the liver. The severity of the CE accumulation phenotype progresses with age and is accompanied by hepatomegaly and hepatic cholesterol crystal deposition. In contrast, hepatic TG accumulation is much less pronounced in these mice, and hepatic RE levels are even decreased. To dissect the functional role of LAL for neutral lipid ester mobilization in the liver, we generated mice specifically lacking LAL in hepatocytes (hep-LAL-ko). On a standard chow diet, hep-LAL-ko mice exhibited increased hepatic CE accumulation but unaltered TG and RE levels. Feeding the hep-LAL-ko mice a vitamin A excess/high-fat diet (VitA/HFD) further increased hepatic cholesterol levels, but hepatic TG and RE levels in these mice were lower than in control mice.

Specifically, osteohistological examination of common fauna can be used to infer growth strategies of biologically uncommon, threatened, or extinct vertebrates. Although nine-banded armadillo biology has been studied extensively, work on growth history is limited. Here we describe long bone microstructure in tibiae and femora of a limited ontogenetic series of nine- banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) to elucidate patterns of bone growth. The cortex of the smallest individual is composed of compacted coarse cancellous bone (CCCB) and woven tissue. Extensive cortical drift is driven by periosteal erosion and further compaction of trabeculae resulting in an increase in the amount of CCCB. The cortex of the largest specimens is primarily CCCB with thickened endosteal bone and thin outer cortices of lamellar and parallel-fibered tissue. The outer cortices of the largest individuals are interpreted as an external fundamental system (EFS) indicating a cessation of appositional bone growth corresponding to skeletal maturity (i.e. asymptotic or adult size). The EFS forms in femora prior to tibiae, indicating femoral growth rates begin decreasing earlier than tibial in D. novemcinctus. Growth trends in common fauna like the nine-banded armadillo can be used as a foundation for understanding life histories of related, but uncommon or extinct, species of cingulates."
https://openalex.org/W2941523384,"The imbalance between circulating concentrations of anti- and pro-angiogenic factors is usually intense in preeclampsia with severe features (sPE). It is possible that pre-delivery circulating levels of angiogenic factors in sPE may be associated with postpartum antihypertensive drug requirements.To determine the predictive association between maternal pre-delivery serum concentrations of angiogenic factors and the use of ≥3 slow- and/or a rapid-acting antihypertensive drug therapy in sPE on postpartum days zero to three following caesarean delivery.Women with sPE (n = 50) and normotensive pregnancies (n = 90) were recruited prior to childbirth. Serum samples were obtained from each participant < 48 hours before delivery to assess the concentrations of placental growth factor (PIGF) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) using the Roche Elecsys platform. Each participant was followed up on postpartum days zero, one, two and three to monitor BP and confirm antihypertensive treatment. The optimal cut-off thresholds of sFlt-1/PIGF ratio from receiver operating characteristic curve predictive of the antihypertensive therapy were subjected to diagnostic accuracy assessment.The majority 58% (29/50) of sPE had multiple severe features of preeclampsia in the antenatal period with the commonest presentation being severe hypertension in 88% (44/50) of this group, followed by features of impending eclampsia which occurred in 42% (21/50). The median gestational age at delivery was 38 (Interquartile range, IQR 1) vs 36 (IQR 6) weeks, p < 0.001 in normotensive and sPE groups respectively. Notably, the median sFlt-1/PIGF ratio in normotensive and sPE groups were 7.3 (IQR 17.9) and 179.1 (IQR 271.2) respectively, p < 0.001. Of the 50 sPE participants, 34% (17/50) had early-onset preeclampsia. The median (IQR) of sFlt-1/PIGF in the early- and late-onset preeclampsia groups were 313.52 (502.25), and 166.59(195.37) respectively, p = 0.006. From postpartum days zero to three, 48% (24/50) of sPE received ≥ 3 slow- and/or a rapid-acting antihypertensive drug. However, the daily administration of ≥ 3 slow- and/or a rapid-acting antihypertensive drug in sPE were pre-delivery 26% (13/50), postpartum day zero 18% (9/50), postpartum day one 34% (17/50), postpartum day two 24% (12/50) and postpartum day three 20% (10/50). In sPE, the pre-delivery sFlt-1/PIGF ratio was predictive of administration of ≥3 slow- and/or a rapid-acting antihypertensive drug on postpartum days zero, one and two with the optimal cut-off ratio being ≥315.0, ≥181.5 and ≥ 267.8 respectively (sensitivity 72.7-75.0%, specificity 64.7-78.6%, positive predictive value 40.0-50.0% and negative predictive value 84.6% - 94.3%). The predictive performance of sFlt-1/PIG ratio on postpartum day 3 among the sPE was not statistically significant (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8).A pre-delivery sFlt-1/PIGF ratio (< 181.5) is a promising predictor for excluding the need for ≥3 slow- and/or a rapid-acting antihypertensive drug therapy in the immediate postpartum period in sPE."
https://openalex.org/W2942016551,"Amaranth plants contain large amounts of betalains, including betaxanthins and betacyanins. Amaranthin is a betacyanin, and its molecular structure and associated metabolic pathway differ from those of betanin in beet plants. The chlorophyll, carotenoid, betalain, and flavonoid contents in amaranth leaves were analyzed. The abundance of betalain, betacyanin, and betaxanthin was 2–5-fold higher in the red leaf sectors than in the green leaf sectors. Moreover, a transcriptome database was constructed for the red and green sectors of amaranth leaves harvested from 30-day-old seedlings. 22 unigenes were selected to analyze the expression profiles in the two leaf sectors. The RNA-sequencing data indicated that many unigenes are involved in betalain metabolic pathways. The potential relationships between diverse metabolic pathways and betalain metabolism were analyzed. The validation of the expression of 22 selected unigenes in a qRT-PCR assay revealed the genes that were differentially expressed in the two leaf sectors. Betalains were biosynthesized in specific tissues of the red sectors of amaranth leaves. Almost all of the genes related to betalain metabolism were identified in the transcriptome database, and the expression profiles were different between the red sectors and green sectors in the leaf. Amaranth plants consist of diverse metabolic pathways, and the betalain metabolic pathway is linked to a group of other metabolic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2941715082,"Presence of mature gametocyte forms of malaria parasites in peripheral blood is a key requirement for malaria transmission. Yet, studies conducted in most malaria transmission zones report the absence of gametocyte in the majority of patients. We therefore sought to determine the risk factors of both all-stage and mature gametocyte carriage in an area with high stable transmission of Plasmodium falciparum in Cameroon. Gametocyte positivity was determined using three complementary methods: thick blood smear microscopy, RT-PCR and RT-LAMP, whereas exposure to the infection was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of 361 malaria endemic residents randomly included in the study (mean age: 28±23 years, age range: 2-100 years, male/female sex ratio: 1.1), 87.8% were diagnosed with P. falciparum infection, of whom 45.7% presented with fever (axillary body temperature ≥37.5°C). Mature gametocyte positivity was 1.9% by thick blood smear microscopy and 8.9% by RT-PCR targeting the mature gametocyte transcript, Pfs25. The gametocyte positivity rate was 24.1% and 36.3% by RT-PCR or RT-LAMP, respectively, when targeting the sexual stage marker, Pfs16. Multivariate analyses revealed anemia as a common independent risk factor for both mature and all-stage gametocyte carriage, whereas fever and low anti-gametocyte antibody levels were independently associated with all-stage gametocyte carriage only. Taken together, the data suggest important differences in risk factors of gametocyte carriage depending on stage analyzed, with anemia, fever and low antiplasmodial plasma antibody levels representing the major contributing risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2950194479,"Immediate early gene (IEG) transcription is rapidly activated by diverse stimuli. This transcriptional regulation is assumed to involve constitutively expressed nuclear factors that are targets of signaling cascades initiated at the cell membrane. NF45 (encoded by ILF2) and its heterodimeric partner NF90/NF110 (encoded by ILF3) are chromatin-interacting proteins that are constitutively expressed and localized predominantly in the nucleus. Previously, NF90/NF110 chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in K562 erythroleukemia cells revealed its enriched association with chromatin at active promoters and strong enhancers. NF90/NF110 specifically occupied the promoters of IEGs. Here, ChIP in serum-starved HEK293 cells demonstrated that NF45 and NF90/NF110 pre-exist and specifically occupy the promoters of IEG transcription factors EGR1, FOS and JUN. Cellular stimulation with phorbol myristyl acetate increased NF90/NF110 chromatin association, while decreasing NF45 chromatin association at promoters of EGR1, FOS and JUN. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with doxycycline-inducible shRNA vectors targeting NF90/NF110 or NF45, doxycycline-mediated knockdown of NF90/NF110 or NF45 attenuated the inducible expression of EGR1, FOS, and JUN at the levels of transcription, RNA and protein. Dynamic chromatin association of NF45 and NF90/NF110 at IEG promoters are observed upon stimulation, and NF45 and NF90/NF110 contribute to inducible transcription of IEGs. NF45 and NF90/NF110 operate as chromatin regulators of the immediate early response."
https://openalex.org/W2940804472,"For standard clinical applications, ASL images are typically acquired with 4–8 mm thick slices and 3–4 mm in-plane resolution. However, in this paper we demonstrate that high-resolution continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) perfusion images can be acquired in a clinically relevant scan time using current MRI technology. CASL was implemented with a separate neck coil for labeling the arterial blood on a 4.7T MRI using standard axial 2D GE-EPI. Typical-resolution to high-resolution (voxels of 95, 60, 45, 27, or 7 mm3) images were compared for qualitative and quantitative cerebral blood flow analysis (CBF) in nine healthy volunteers (ages: 24–32 years). The highest resolution (1.5x1.5x3 = 7 mm3) CASL implementation yielded perfusion images with improved cortex depiction and increased cortical CBF measurements (53 ± 8 ml/100g/min), consistent with reduced partial volume averaging. The 7 mm3 voxel images were acquired with 6 cm brain coverage in a clinically relevant scan of 6 minutes. Improved spatial resolution facilitates CBF measurement with reduced partial volume averaging and may be valuable for the detection of perfusion deficits in small lesions and perfusion measurement in small brain regions."
https://openalex.org/W2941738549,"Rubber surfacing is often used in playgrounds due to its potential injury prevention benefits and as a way to recycle waste tires. Available research on chemicals in recycled rubber has focused on synthetic turf applications, but is limited for playground rubber surfacing. Potential lead contamination from vulcanizing agents used in rubber surfacing are a possible concern; however this has not been researched. We examined levels of lead in poured-in-place rubber and compared them to levels in soil, sand, and wood mulch materials from 28 randomly selected playgrounds in Boston, MA, USA using X-ray fluorescence. To evaluate the association between material type and lead concentrations, we conducted a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and built a linear regression model controlling for distance to major roadway, neighborhood-level status as an environmental justice area, peeling paint on the playground, and rubber condition. Average lead levels were 65.7 μg/g for soil, 22.0 μg/g for rubber, 8.5 μg/g for sand, and 9.0 μg/g for mulch. Our finding of lower concentrations of lead in sand and mulch compared to rubber and soil should be used to inform playground design to optimize children’s health, alongside other chemical and safety considerations."

https://openalex.org/W2941541234,"The aim of this study was to develop a geometric calibration method capable of eliminating the reconstruction artifacts of geometric misalignments in a tomosynthesis prototype with dual-axis scanning geometry. The potential scenarios of geometric misalignments were demonstrated, and their effects on reconstructed images were also evaluated. This method was a phantom-based approach with iterative optimization, and the calibration phantom was designed for specific tomosynthesis scanning geometry. The phantom was used to calculate a set of geometric parameters from each projection, and these parameters were then used to evaluate the geometric misalignments of the dual-axis scanning-geometry prototype. The simulated results revealed that the extracted geometric parameters were similar to the input values and that the artifacts of reconstructed images were minimized due to geometric calibration. Additionally, experimental chest phantom imaging results also indicated that the artifacts of the reconstructed images were suppressed and that object structures were preserved through calibration. And the quantitative analysis result also indicated that the MTF can be further improved with the geometric calibration. All the simulated and experimental results demonstrated that this method is effective for tomosynthesis with dual-axis scanning geometry. Furthermore, this geometric calibration method can also be applied to other tomography imaging systems to reduce geometric misalignments and be used for different geometric calibration phantom configurations."
https://openalex.org/W2940465615,"Background A study of a comprehensive HIV Care Coordination Program (CCP) showed effectiveness in increasing viral load suppression (VLS) among PLWH in New York City (NYC). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a scale-up of the CCP in NYC. Methods We incorporated observed effects and costs of the CCP into a computer simulation of HIV in NYC, comparing strategy scale-up with no implementation. The simulation combined a deterministic compartmental model of HIV transmission with a stochastic microsimulation of HIV progression, and was calibrated to NYC HIV epidemiological data from 1997 to 2009. We assessed incremental cost-effectiveness from a health sector perspective using 2017 $US, a 20-year time horizon, and a 3% annual discount rate. We explored two scenarios: (1) two-year average enrollment and (2) continuous enrollment. Results In scenario 1, scale-up resulted in a cost-per-infection-averted of $898,104 and a cost-per-QALY-gained of $423,721. In sensitivity analyses, scale-up achieved cost-effectiveness if effectiveness increased from RR1.11 to RR1.37 or costs decreased by 41.7%. Limiting the intervention to persons with unsuppressed viral load prior to enrollment (RR1.32) attenuated the cost reduction necessary to 11.5%. In scenario 2, scale-up resulted in a cost-per-infection-averted of $705,171 and cost-per-QALY-gained of $720,970. In sensitivity analyses, scale-up achieved cost-effectiveness if effectiveness increased from RR1.11 to RR1.46 or program costs decreased by 71.3%. Limiting the intervention to persons with unsuppressed viral load attenuated the cost reduction necessary to 38.7%. Conclusion Cost-effective CCP scale-up would require reduced costs and/or focused enrollment within NYC, but may be more readily achieved in cities with lower background VLS levels."

By creating and studying deletion strains in both veA+ and veA1 background, we have characterized the role of HmbA, HmbB and HmbC in sexual development. Expression of the mating-type MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 coding genes were found to be extremely down-regulated in all three mutants on day 4 of sexual development, which results in deficient ascospore production and/or ascospore viability in the mutants. In addition, we found that HmbA and HmbB play also a role in sensing of and response to environmental signals, while HmbC functionally interacts with VeA, a key regulator of the coordination of asexual and sexual development, as well as of secondary metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2941193629,"The shock index (SI) is defined as the ratio of heart rate/systolic blood pressure. This study aimed to determine the performance of delta shock index (ΔSI), a difference between SI upon arrival at the emergency room (ER) and that in the field, in predicting the need for massive transfusion (MT) among adult trauma patients with stable blood pressure.This study included registered data from all trauma patients aged 20 years and above who were hospitalized from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2016. Only patients who were transferred by emergency medical service from the accident site with a systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg at the ER were included. The 7,957 enrolled trauma patients were divided into 2 groups, those who had received blood transfusion ≥ 10 U (MT, n = 82) and those who had not (non-MT, n = 7,875). The odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the need for MT by a given ΔSI were measured. The plot of specific receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves was used to evaluate the best cutoff point of ΔSI that could predict the patient's probability of receiving MT.ROC curve analysis showed that a ΔSI of 0.06 as the cutoff point had the highest AUC of 0.61, with a sensitivity of 0.415 and specificity of 0.841. Patients with a ΔSI ≥ 0.00 had a significant 1.8-fold increase in need for MT than those patients with a ΔSI less than 0.00 (1.4% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.01). The larger the ΔSI, the higher the odds of need for an MT. Using the cutoff point of ΔSI of 0.06, patients with a ΔSI ≥ 0.06 had a significant 3.7-fold increase in need for MT than those patients with a ΔSI less than 0.06 (2.7% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001).This study indicated that, in trauma patients with stable blood pressure at the ER, the accuracy of prediction of the requirement for MT by ΔSI is low. However, the size of the delta is significantly associated with need for MT and a lack of improvement in the patient's SI at the ER compared to that in the field significantly increases the odds of a need for MT."
https://openalex.org/W2941591906,"Artificial metabolically regulated inducible expression systems are often used for the production of essential compounds. In most cases, the application of such systems enables regulating the expression of an entire group of genes in response to any internal signal such as an aerobic/anaerobic switch, a transition to stationary phase, or the exhausting of essential compounds. In this work, we demonstrate an example of another type of artificial autoinducible module, denoted a positive feedback module. This positive feedback module generates an inducer molecule that in turn enhances its own synthesis, promoting an activation signal. Due to the use of acetolactate, an intermediate of the L-valine biosynthetic pathway, as a specific inducer molecule, we realized a positive feedback loop in the biosynthetic pathway of branched chain amino acids. Such positive feedback was demonstrated to improve the production of a target compound."

Thus, in the present paper, we evaluated high school students' knowledge about the endangered and non-endangered mammalian species of the Brazilian Cerrado. We tested whether the recognition of the endangered and non-endangered species varied in a cross-species analysis (twelve total species) according to species characteristics, such as body size, popularity, endangered status and the length of time of inclusion on the endangered species list. Moreover, we tested whether the recognition of the endangered mammal species varied between municipalities (spatial analysis). We interviewed 366 students in their first year of high school in 21 schools (one in each municipality). Our results indicated that the proportion of correctly identified endangered species varied according to species (cross-species). The endangered species that were most often correctly identified were Myrmecophaga tridactyla (known by its popular name, Tamanduá-bandeira, in Brazil), Priodontes maximus (Tatu canastra) and Panthera onca (onça-pintada), with more than 80% correct answers. Thus, students tended to recognize the more popular species and the endangered species more than the non-endangered species. The analysis of student knowledge according to municipality demonstrated that the students' ability to recognize endangered species followed a spatial pattern. Finally, the cross-species and spatial variation patterns detected in the present study indicated the importance of formal education in increasing high school students' knowledge about endangered species and suggested that education should also promote less well-known species, species with smaller body sizes, and other groups of vertebrates and invertebrates and consider local and regional biodiversity whenever possible."

A profiling of transcription assay using digital gene expression profiling was used for transgenic and WT Arabidopsis thaliana. Differentially expressed genes including 40 upregulated and three downregulated genes were identified. In transgenic lines of Hrip1-overexpression, three genes related to jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis were significantly upregulated, and the JA level was found to be higher than WT. Two GDSL family members (GLIP1 and GLIP4) and pathogen-related gene, which participated in pathogen defense action, were upregulated in the transgenic line of Hrip1-overexpression. Thus, Hrip1 is involved in affecting the flower bolting time and regulating endogenous JA biosynthesis and regulatory network to enhance resistance to insect."
https://openalex.org/W2941838685,"Objective Pneumonia is life-threatening in patients with liver cirrhosis. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may increase the risk of these patients developing pneumonia. However, whether PPIs increase mortality in patients with cirrhosis and pneumonia remain unknown. Methods We used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database to enroll 1,201 cirrhotic patients with pneumonia without active gastrointestinal bleeding who were receiving PPIs and were hospitalized between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2013. A one-to-three propensity score match was performed to select a comparison group based on age, gender, and comorbid disorders. Results The overall 30-day and 90-day all-cause mortality rates were 13.7% and 26.9% in the PPI group, and 14.3% and 25.1% in the non-PPI group, respectively. After Cox regression model adjusting for age, gender, and comorbid disorders, the hazard ratios of the effect of PPIs on 30-day and 30 to 90-day mortality were 0.94 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.79–1.12, P = 0.468) and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.05–1.52; P = 0.013), respectively. Conclusions PPIs were not associated with 30-day mortality among cirrhotic patients with pneumonia but not active gastrointestinal bleeding. However, prolonged PPI therapy may be associated with higher mortality."

Background Through the increasing number of minimally invasive procedures in spinal fusion surgery, the complete removal of intervertebral disc (IVD) tissue has become more a challenge. Remaining IVD may interfere with the biological process of bone formation. Objective In order to establish whether complete removal of IVD tissue will improve or inhibit the fusion process, the effects of different concentrations of extracts of inflamed disc tissue on the mitochondrial activity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and the capacity to mineralize their extracellular matrix by osteoblasts and differentiated MSCs were tested in vitro. Methods A MTT assay was conducted to measure the mitochondrial activity of MSCs, and an Alizarin Red S staining quantification assay to measure the deposition of calcium by osteoblasts and differentiated, bone marrow-derived MSCs. Results A significantly higher mitochondrial activity was shown in MSCs co-cultured with extracts of IVD tissue (10%, 50%, and 100%) compared with the control group after 48 hours of incubation, indicating that the IVD tissue extracts stimulated the mitochondrial activity of MSCs. This effect appeared to be inversely proportional to the concentration of IVD tissue extract. No significant differences in mineralization by human osteoblasts or differentiated MSCs were found between the samples incubated with IVD tissue extracts (3% and 33%) and the control samples. Conclusion Our findings indicate that remaining IVD tissue has more of a stimulating than inhibiting effect on the activity of MSCs. Even if inflammatory cytokines are produced, these do not result in a net inhibition of cellular activity or osteogenic differentiation of MSCs."
https://openalex.org/W2942295536,"Quigley derived his hybrid price model to improve the precision of predicted prices of sold homes by statistically merging data of resold homes in a repeat sales model with that of once-sold homes in a single sales hedonic price model. The literature has few applications of the hybrid model aside from those by Quigley and his collaborators. Two reasons for this underuse may be its computational intensiveness and its marginal empirical improvement in comparison with two other models. This paper first demystifies this computational intensiveness by calibrating models in Microsoft Excel with transferable procedures into other software. It second evaluates the hybrid price model’s empirical improvement as a reason for its underuse by predicting prices of 2,559 sold and resold homes observed in two inner-city neighbourhoods in Windsor, Ontario, during a 30-year period. The results as hypothesized are its lower standard errors of regression coefficients and higher simple R-squared than those of a single sales hedonic price model. Moreover, the hybrid model’s predictions have higher correlations than those of the single sales model with not only in-sample observed prices or changes in prices but also out-of-sample ones. The conclusion speculates in plans for future research about reasons for two models’ similar or dissimilar regression coefficients and standard errors predicting correspondingly similar or dissimilar sale prices of homes through time."

The delivery and organization of the phototransduction components within and along the cilium into the series of stacked, highly organized disks is critical for cell function and viability. How disks are formed within the cilium remains an area of active investigation. We have found nuclear distribution protein C (nudC), a key component of mitosis and cytokinesis during development, to be present in the inner segment region of these postmitotic cells in several species, including mouse, tree shrew, monkey, and frog. Further, we found nudC interacts with rhodopsin and the small GTPase rab11a. Here, we show through transgenic tadpole studies that nudC is integral to rod cell disk formation and photoreceptor protein localization. Finally, we demonstrate that short hairpin RNA knockdown of nudC in tadpole rod photoreceptors, which leads to the inability of rod cells to maintain their OS, is rescued through coexpression of murine nudC.-Boitet, E.

https://openalex.org/W2941678923,"Introduction Accurate prediction of embolic events in infective endocarditis could inform critical clinical decisions, such as the timing of cardiac surgical intervention. However, many embolic events occur before hospital admission and echocardiography and are thus non-modifiable. We aimed to identify time-sensitive variables that predict embolic events in infective endocarditis, focusing on those that occur after diagnosis. Methods Clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic characteristics were collected from 116 patients with definite or probable left-sided infective endocarditis admitted to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Toronto, Canada) between October 2013 and July 2016; associations between these characteristics and embolic events were identified using simple logistic regression. Results The mean (SD) age was 66 (17) years; 82 patients (71%) were men. The most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (23%) and viridans group streptococci (21%). Seventy-nine (68%) patients had left-sided vegetations, with involvement of the aortic valve in 34 (43%) patients, mitral valve in 37 (47%) patients, and both in 8 (10%) patients. The mean (SD) vegetation size was 10 (7) mm. Forty-three unique patients (37%) had 50 embolic events, with most (34/43; 79%) having a first embolic event (38/50; 76%) before or on the day of echocardiography. There were no significant predictors of the 11 patients with an embolic event after echocardiography; significant predictors of an embolic event at any time were single valve vegetation vs. no vegetation (OR, 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76–12.78) and, among patients with a vegetation, mitral vs. aortic valve location (OR, 4.43; 95%CI, 1.63–12.04). Conclusions Associations between patient and echocardiographic characteristics and embolism in patients with infective endocarditis may be time-sensitive, as few embolic events occurred after clinical and echocardiographic assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2941712299,"A randomized clinical trial was conducted to assess efficacy of intramammary cloxacillin and ampicillin (CLOXIMM), intramammary cefquinome (CEFIMM), and intramuscular cefquinome (CEFIM) to treat Streptococcus agalactiae intramammary infections (Trial 1). Subsequently, two treatment groups were extended to assess whether CLOXIMM was not inferior to CEFIMM (Trial 2). Nine farms were included in the study. Milk samples were collected from all quarters of all lactating cows for microbiological identification of S. agalactiae. Positive cows were randomly allocated into four groups: CLOXIMM, CEFIMM, CEFIM, or negative control (CONTROL). Study outcomes were bacteriological cure at 14 (CURE14), 21 (CURE21), and 14 and 21 (CURE1421) days after treatment onset, and somatic cell count. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of cure between each treatment and CONTROL. Non-inferiority analysis was performed considering a one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and non-inferiority margins (Δ) of 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, and 0.25. Adjusted S. agalactiae bacteriological cure for CLOXIMM, CEFIMM, CEFIM, and CONTROL was 86, 98, 55, and 25% at day 14; 82, 93, 52, and 0% at day 21; and 82, 92, 40, and 0% at days 14 and 21, respectively. Treatment with CLOXIMM and CEFIMM resulted in greater bacteriological cure rates, as compared with CEFIM or CONTROL, which does not justify the use of CEFIM in S. agalactiae eradication programs. The CURE14 difference between CEFIMM and CLOXIMM was of 12.1 percentage points (95% CI: 0.056–0.184). CLOXIMM was considered not inferior to CEFIMM for Δ = 0.20 or 0.25 and inconclusive for Δ = 0.10 or 0.15. Thus, it should be pondered by veterinarians whether an expected 12.1 (5.6–18.4) percentage points increase in cure rate would justify the use of a fourth-generation cephalosporin, as opposed to a combination of traditional IMM drugs (cloxacillin and ampicillin) to treat S. agalactiae subclinical mastitis."
https://openalex.org/W2942243777,"Background This study investigated the time to appropriate treatment and factors affecting late treatment initiation in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in South Korea. Methods Data from patients with culture-confirmed pulmonary MDR-TB who received treatment at Pusan National University Hospital (PNUH) between January 2010 and July 2018 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups according to the first institution they visited [patients who were transferred to PNUH after diagnosis of MDR-TB (Group A) and patients who were initially diagnosed with TB at PNUH (Group B)]. Results A total of 100 patients were included (53 in Group A and 47 in Group B). The percentage of patients in whom line probe assays (LPAs) for isoniazid and rifampin or Xpert MTB/RIF assays were performed was higher in Group B than in Group A [20.8 vs. 57.4% (P < 0.001) and 17.0 vs. 46.8% (P = 0.001), respectively]. The median time from the first visit to appropriate treatment initiation was longer in Group A (102.0 vs. 77.0 days, P = 0.002). However, a subgroup analysis of patients with pre-extensively or extensively drug-resistant TB (pre-XDR- or XDR-TB) revealed that the time to appropriate treatment did not differ between Groups A and B. Although the time to appropriate treatment decreased during the study period in both Groups A and B, this trend was not evident in patients with pre-XDR- or XDR-TB in Group B. Based on multivariate analyses, performance of LPAs for isoniazid and rifampin, performance of Xpert MTB/RIF assays, and the presence of uncomplicated MDR-TB were protective against delays in appropriate treatment initiation. Conclusions The time to appropriate treatment in patients with MDR-TB in South Korea was not acceptable, particularly for patients diagnosed outside of PNUH and for patients with pre-XDR- or XDR-TB. The use of rapid molecular drug susceptibility tests in various healthcare settings and introduction of second-line LPAs are required."
https://openalex.org/W2941123190,"This experimental study of an artificial stock market investigates what explains the propensity to sell stocks and thus the disposition effect. It is a framed field experiment that follows the steps of a previous observational study of investor behavior in the Finnish stock market. Our experimental approach has an edge over the observational study in that it can control extraneous variables and two or more groups can be compared. We consider in particular the groups of amateur students and professional investors because it is well established in the literature that the disposition effect is less pronounced in professionals. The disposition effect was measured by both the traditional metric and a broader one that properly considers return intervals. A full logit model with control variables was employed in the latter case. As a result, we replicate for the broader definition what already has been found for the traditional measure: that investor experience dampens the disposition effect. Trades with positive returns exhibited higher propensity to sell than trades with negative returns. For the overall sample of participants, we find the disposition effect cannot be explained by prospect theory, but we cast doubt on this stance from partitions of data from amateurs and professionals."
