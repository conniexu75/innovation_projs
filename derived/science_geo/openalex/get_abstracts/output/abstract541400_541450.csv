https://openalex.org/W2150860983,"Stress granules are membrane-less organelles composed of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and RNA. Functional impairment of stress granules has been implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy—diseases that are characterized by fibrillar inclusions of RBPs. Genetic evidence suggests a link between persistent stress granules and the accumulation of pathological inclusions. Here, we demonstrate that the disease-related RBP hnRNPA1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) into protein-rich droplets mediated by a low complexity sequence domain (LCD). While the LCD of hnRNPA1 is sufficient to mediate LLPS, the RNA recognition motifs contribute to LLPS in the presence of RNA, giving rise to several mechanisms for regulating assembly. Importantly, while not required for LLPS, fibrillization is enhanced in protein-rich droplets. We suggest that LCD-mediated LLPS contributes to the assembly of stress granules and their liquid properties and provides a mechanistic link between persistent stress granules and fibrillar protein pathology in disease."

Although outer subventricular zone radial glia may generate the majority of human cortical neurons, their molecular features remain elusive. By analyzing gene expression across single cells, we find that outer radial glia preferentially express genes related to extracellular matrix formation, migration, and stemness, including TNC, PTPRZ1, FAM107A, HOPX, and LIFR. Using dynamic imaging, immunostaining, and clonal analysis, we relate these molecular features to distinctive behaviors of outer radial glia, demonstrate the necessity of STAT3 signaling for their cell cycle progression, and establish their extensive proliferative potential. These results suggest that outer radial glia directly support the subventricular niche through local production of growth factors, potentiation of growth factor signals by extracellular matrix proteins, and activation of self-renewal pathways, thereby enabling the developmental and evolutionary expansion of the human neocortex."
https://openalex.org/W2149765709,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive form of breast cancer that exhibits extremely high levels of genetic complexity and yet a relatively uniform transcriptional program. We postulate that TNBC might be highly dependent on uninterrupted transcription of a key set of genes within this gene expression program and might therefore be exceptionally sensitive to inhibitors of transcription. Utilizing kinase inhibitors and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing, we show here that triple-negative but not hormone receptor-positive breast cancer cells are exceptionally dependent on CDK7, a transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase. TNBC cells are unique in their dependence on this transcriptional CDK and suffer apoptotic cell death upon CDK7 inhibition. An ""Achilles cluster"" of TNBC-specific genes is especially sensitive to CDK7 inhibition and frequently associated with super-enhancers. We conclude that CDK7 mediates transcriptional addiction to a vital cluster of genes in TNBC and CDK7 inhibition may be a useful therapy for this challenging cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2158673389,"Leptin is a hormone produced by the adipose tissue that acts in the brain, stimulating white fat breakdown. We find that the lipolytic effect of leptin is mediated through the action of sympathetic nerve fibers that innervate the adipose tissue. Using intravital two-photon microscopy, we observe that sympathetic nerve fibers establish neuro-adipose junctions, directly ""enveloping"" adipocytes. Local optogenetic stimulation of sympathetic inputs induces a local lipolytic response and depletion of white adipose mass. Conversely, genetic ablation of sympathetic inputs onto fat pads blocks leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase and consequent lipolysis, as do knockouts of dopamine β-hydroxylase, an enzyme required for catecholamine synthesis. Thus, neuro-adipose junctions are necessary and sufficient for the induction of lipolysis in white adipose tissue and are an efferent effector of leptin action. Direct activation of sympathetic inputs to adipose tissues may represent an alternative approach to induce fat loss, circumventing central leptin resistance. PAPERCLIP."

Specifically, the kinase activity of nuclear-targeted FAK in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells drives exhaustion of CD8+ T cells and recruitment of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment by regulating chemokine/cytokine and ligand-receptor networks, including via transcription of Ccl5, which is crucial. These changes inhibit antigen-primed cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activity, permitting growth of FAK-expressing tumors. Mechanistically, nuclear FAK is associated with chromatin and exists in complex with transcription factors and their upstream regulators that control Ccl5 expression. Furthermore, FAK’s immuno-modulatory nuclear activities may be specific to cancerous squamous epithelial cells, as normal keratinocytes do not have nuclear FAK. Finally, we show that a small-molecule FAK kinase inhibitor, VS-4718, which is currently in clinical development, also drives depletion of Tregs and promotes a CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor response. Therefore, FAK inhibitors may trigger immune-mediated tumor regression, providing previously unrecognized therapeutic opportunities. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) promotes anti-tumor immune evasion.

First described more than a decade ago (Onizuka et al., 1999Onizuka S. Tawara I. Shimizu J. Sakaguchi S. Fujita T. Nakayama E.

Increased Treg numbers has been associated with poorer survival in ovarian (Curiel et al., 2004Curiel T.J. Coukos G. Zou L. Alvarez X. Cheng P. Mottram P. Evdemon-Hogan M. Conejo-Garcia J.R. Zhang L.

Indeed, the ratio of CD8+ T cells/Tregs correlates with poor prognosis, shifting the balance from anti-tumor immunity toward tumor tolerance (Quezada et al., 2006Quezada S.A. Peggs K.S.

Mol. Immunol. 2011; 8: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Through secreting a range of chemokines and cytokines, cancer cells can promote the recruitment of Tregs into tumors and can also facilitate their peripheral expansion and retention (Darrasse-Jèze and Podsypanina, 2013Darrasse-Jèze G.

Thus, Tregs can act as a barrier to effective immune-based therapy aimed at activation of a CD8+ T cell anti-tumor immune response. However, the specific signals within tumor cells that stimulate elevated intra-tumoral Tregs, giving rise to tumor tolerance, remain elusive. FAK is a tyrosine kinase that regulates diverse cellular functions, including adhesion, migration, invasion, polarity, proliferation, and survival (Frame et al., 2010Frame M.C. Patel H. Serrels B. Lietha D. Eck M.J. The FERM domain: organizing the structure and function of FAK.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 802-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Using targeted gene deletion in mouse skin, we have previously shown a requirement for fak in tumor initiation and progression to malignant disease (McLean et al., 2004McLean G.W. Komiyama N.H.

Specific deletion of focal adhesion kinase suppresses tumor formation and blocks malignant progression.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2998-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). FAK is also required for mammary tumor progression, intestinal tumorigenesis, and the androgen-independent formation of neuroendocrine carcinoma in a mouse model of prostate cancer (Ashton et al., 2010Ashton G.H.

Cancer Ther. 2009; 8: 2470-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Expression of FAK is elevated in a number of tumor types (reviewed in McLean et al., 2005McLean G.W. Carragher N.O. Avizienyte E. Evans J. Brunton V.G. Frame M.C. The role of focal-adhesion kinase in cancer - a new therapeutic opportunity.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), and FAK inhibitors are being developed as potential cancer therapeutics (Roberts et al., 2008Roberts W.G. Ung E. Whalen P.

Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 237ra68Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Many of FAK’s functions in cancer are via its role in signaling downstream of integrins and growth factor receptors at the plasma membrane. FAK also contains putative nuclear localization sequences (NLS) within the F2 lobe of its FERM domain and can localize to the nucleus upon receipt of cellular stress, where it binds to p53 (Lim et al., 2008Lim S.T. Chen X.L. Lim Y. Hanson D.A. Vo T.T. Howerton K. Larocque N. Fisher S.J. Schlaepfer D.D. Ilic D. Nuclear FAK promotes cell proliferation and survival through FERM-enhanced p53 degradation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 9-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, the extent of FAK’s nuclear functions remains largely unknown. Here, we report a function for nuclear FAK in regulating transcription of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, in turn promoting an immuno-suppressive, pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. This is mediated by recruitment and expansion of Tregs via FAK-regulated chemokine/cytokine networks, and we have found an important role for Ccl5 and TGFβ2. Therefore, FAK controls the tumor environment, and suppressing FAK activity, including via a clinically relevant FAK inhibitor, may be therapeutically beneficial by triggering immune-mediated tumor regression. We used a syngeneic model of SCC in which the fak gene had been deleted by Cre-lox recombination (McLean et al., 2004McLean G.W. Komiyama N.H. Serrels B. Asano H. Reynolds L. Conti F. Hodivala-Dilke K. Metzger D. Chambon P. Grant S.G. Frame M.C.

McLeod K. Canel M. Kinnaird A. Graham K. Frame M.C. Brunton V.G. The role of focal adhesion kinase catalytic activity on the proliferation and migration of squamous cell carcinoma cells.Int. J. Cancer. 2012; 131: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and mutant tumor cell lines generated. We monitored tumor growth following injection of 1 × 106 FAK-deficient cells (FAK−/−) or FAK-deficient cells that re-expressed wild-type FAK (FAK-WT) at comparable levels to endogenous FAK in both CD-1 nude and FVB (syngeneic) host mouse strains. In CD-1 nude mice, SCC FAK−/− tumor growth was characterized by a modest growth delay (Figure 1A) as reported previously (Serrels et al., 2012Serrels A. McLeod K. Canel M. Kinnaird A. Graham K. Frame M.C. Brunton V.G. The role of focal adhesion kinase catalytic activity on the proliferation and migration of squamous cell carcinoma cells.Int. J. Cancer. 2012; 131: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). By contrast, in FVB mice, SCC FAK−/− tumor growth was characterized by an initial period of growth in the first 7 days followed by complete regression by day 21 (Figure 1B). Thus, FAK expression is required for the survival and growth of SCC tumors in FVB mice with a functional adaptive immune system. To characterize the role of adaptive immunity in FAK−/− SCC tumor regression, we used antibody-mediated T cell depletion in animals bearing FAK−/− tumors (Figures 1C and S1). Depletion of CD4+ T cells had no effect on tumor growth. In contrast, depletion of CD8+ T cells, either alone or in combination with CD4+ T cells, restored SCC FAK−/− tumor growth. This implies that cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were responsible for regression of FAK−/− tumors (Figure 1C) but does not exclude an accessory role for CD4+ T cells. T cell depletion in mice bearing SCC FAK-WT tumors (Figure 1D) revealed that: (1) depletion of CD8+ T cells, either alone or in combination with CD4+ T cells, caused a significant increase in tumor growth when compared to isotype-treated controls at day 14, and (2) depletion of CD4+ T cells alone caused regression of FAK-WT SCC tumors by day 21. This implied that FAK-expressing tumors were also under negative pressure from the immune system and that cells from the CD4+ T cell compartment play a role in protecting FAK-WT tumors from immune-mediated regression (reason discussed later; Figure 3). Next, we re-challenged mice with 1 × 106 SCC FAK-WT cells after regression of primary FAK−/− SCC tumors, following 7 days of tumor-free survival after the tumors had regressed (Figure 1E, top and middle graphs). Neither FAK-deficient nor FAK-expressing SCC cells were able to grow after the mice had been pre-challenged with SCC FAK−/− cells. As controls, SCC FAK-WT and FAK−/− cells were injected at day 28 into mice with no pre-challenge, and these grew as expected (Figure 1E, bottom). This implies that, following FAK−/− SCC tumor regression, host mice remain immunized against further tumor challenge because immunological memory had been established. It is possible that either broad immunization against SCCs may have occurred or, more likely, that the FAK−/− and FAK-WT SCCs shared common antigen(s) that are expressed irrespective of FAK status. We conclude that FAK enables SCC cancer cells to suppress an adaptive immune response rather than to circumvent it through evading recognition per se. SCC FAK−/− cells in which a FAK kinase-deficient mutant was re-expressed (SCC FAK-KD) initially grew and then regressed with kinetics that were only modestly delayed when compared to FAK−/− cells, indicating that immune suppression depends on FAK kinase activity (Figure 1F). We next investigated the nature of the T cell response within tumors derived from all three SCC cell lines using FACS analysis on disaggregated tumor tissue taken at day 7. We did not observe a significant change in the percentage of total CD4+ T cells (Figures 2A and S2 and Table S2) or the percentage of CD4+ T cells that expressed the activation marker CD69 (Figure 2B). In contrast, we did observe a significant increase in the proportion of effector CD4+CD44hiCD62Llow T cells in SCC FAK−/− and FAK-KD tumors when compared to FAK-WT tumors (Figures 2C and S2 and Table S2). Analysis of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells revealed a significant increase in SCC FAK−/− and SCC FAK-KD tumors when compared to SCC FAK-WT tumors (Figures 2D and S2 and Table S2), indicative of a heightened cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response. Staining with the activation marker CD69 identified the presence of CD8+CD69+ T cells in all tumors (Figure 2E). Further analysis revealed an increase in percentage of effector CD8+CD44hiCD62Llow T cells in SCC FAK−/− and SCC FAK-KD tumors when compared to SCC FAK-WT tumors (Figures 2F and S2 and Table S2), especially when effector CD8+ T cell numbers were normalized to account for the observed changes in total CD8+ T cells and presented as a “fold change” (Figure 2G). However, while SCC FAK−/− and SCC FAK-KD tumors had increased effector CD8+ T cells, there were activated CD8+ T cells present in all of the SCC tumors, raising the question of why SCC FAK-WT tumors do not succumb to the cytotoxic CD8+ T cell response.Figure S2T Cell FACS Gating Strategy, Related to Figures 2 and 7Show full caption(A) FACS gating strategy applied for identification of T cell sub-populations.

It is now established that not only the quantity of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is important, but also their “quality.” Tumor-induced T cell exhaustion has been reported in a number of tumor types, including melanoma (Fourcade et al., 2010Fourcade J.

USA. 2010; 107: 7875-7880Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), and is characterized by expression of co-inhibitory surface receptors, including programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3), and T cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (Tim-3), either alone or in combination (Fourcade et al., 2010Fourcade J. Sun Z. Benallaoua M. Guillaume P. Luescher I.F. Sander C. Kirkwood J.M. Kuchroo V. Zarour H.M.

T cell exhaustion.Nat. Immunol. 2011; 12: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2431) Google Scholar). Analysis of these markers on antigen-primed CD8+CD44hi T cells infiltrating SCC FAK-WT, FAK−/−, and FAK-KD tumors revealed increased surface expression of PD-1, LAG-3, and Tim-3 in CD8+CD44hi T cells present in SCC FAK-WT tumors (Figures 2H–2J). Together, our data imply that antigen-primed CD8+CD44hi T cells infiltrating SCC FAK-WT tumors exhibit a heightened state of exhaustion indicative of a dysfunctional T cell response. Linked to their exhausted state, there was also evidence of decreased proliferation of CD8+ T cells isolated from SCC FAK-WT tumors (judged by Ki-67 staining in Figure 2K). Histological staining of tumor sections taken at day 7 revealed that: (1) CD8+ T cells are present throughout all tumors, and (2) while CD8+ T cells infiltrating SCC FAK-WT tumors appear predominantly as individual cells, CD8+ T cells infiltrating SCC FAK−/− and FAK-KD tumors are clustered (Figure 2L). Thus, the ability of SCC FAK-WT tumors to evade the anti-tumor immune response is not due to limited CD8+ T cell penetration into these tumors. Macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and Tregs with intrinsic immuno-suppressive capabilities can promote tumor development by inhibiting cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activity in mouse and humans (Beyer and Schultze, 2006Beyer M. Schultze J.L. Regulatory T cells in cancer.Blood. 2006; 108: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, Biragyn and Longo, 2012Biragyn A. Longo D.L.

Flow cytometric analysis revealed no differences in macrophage or MDSC populations that correlated with tumor regression (Figures 3A, 3B , S3, and S4 and Table S2), although this does not rule out an accessory role for these cells in eventual tumor clearance. However, we did find a significantly greater number of CD4+FoxP3+CD25+ Tregs in SCC FAK-WT tumors (Figures 3C and S4 and Table S2) when compared with FAK−/− and FAK-KD tumors (Figure 3C). Tregs have been associated with the development of CD8+ T cell exhaustion (Sakuishi et al., 2013Sakuishi K. Ngiow S.F. Sullivan J.M. Teng M.W. Kuchroo V.K. Smyth M.J. Anderson A.C. TIM3(+)FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells are tissue-specific promoters of T-cell dysfunction in cancer.OncoImmunology. 2013; 2: e23849Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and may therefore be linked to the CD8+ T cell exhaustion that we observed in SCC FAK-WT tumors (Figures 2H–2J). We next calculated the ratio of CD8+ T cells to Tregs (Figure 3D), as this has been reported to correlate with poor prognosis in a number of tumor types (Sato et al., 2005Sato E. Olson S.H. Ahn J. Bundy B. Nishikawa H. Qian F. Jungbluth A.A. Frosina D. Gnjatic S. Ambrosone C. et al.Intraepithelial CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and a high CD8+/regulatory T cell ratio are associated with favorable prognosis in ovarian cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We found a substantially lower CD8+ T cell to Treg ratio in SCC FAK-WT tumors when compared to SCC FAK−/− and SCC FAK-KD tumors, which correlated with outcome in terms of tumor tolerance versus immune-mediated tumor regression.Figure S3Macrophage FACS Gating Strategy, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) FACS gating strategy applied for identification of macrophage sub-populations.

Therefore, FAK-dependent Tregs are required for the growth of FAK-WT-expressing tumors by creating an immuno-suppressive environment that impairs cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activity. This role of CD4+ Tregs is the likely reason for effects of the CD4-depleting antibody in promoting regression of SCC FAK-WT tumors (Figure 1D). We note that high Treg levels have been reported in a number of solid tumor types (Beyer and Schultze, 2006Beyer M. Schultze J.L. Regulatory T cells in cancer.Blood. 2006; 108: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) and that elevated Tregs are linked to poor clinical outcome (Beyer and Schultze, 2006Beyer M. Schultze J.L. Regulatory T cells in cancer.Blood. 2006; 108: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, Sato et al., 2005Sato E. Olson S.H. Ahn J. Bundy B. Nishikawa H. Qian F.

Ambrosone C. et al.Intraepithelial CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and a high CD8+/regulatory T cell ratio are associated with favorable prognosis in ovarian cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 18538-18543Crossref PubMed Scopus (1836) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Tregs derived from SCC FAK-WT tumors expressed the transcription factor (TF) Helios (Figure S5A), indicative of thymic origin (Thornton et al., 2010Thornton A.M. Korty P.E. Tran D.Q. Wohlfert E.A. Murray P.E. Belkaid Y. Shevach E.M.

Immunol. 2010; 184: 3433-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that FAK may drive the recruitment and expansion of the intra-tumoral Tregs by influencing the availability of secreted factors. To address how FAK activity in SCC cancer cells promotes elevated intra-tumoral Tregs, we next analyzed global transcriptional profiles of SCC FAK-WT and SCC FAK−/− cells using Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays (Figure 4A). FAK expression resulted in the upregulation of 498 genes and the downregulation of 598 genes (p < 0.01). The upregulated transcript set in SCC FAK-WT cells was associated with a number of processes, including cell migration, receptor binding, secretion, wounding, and ovulation (Figure 4B, top). Analysis of this gene set revealed the chemokine ligand group of genes to be significantly overrepresented (Figure 4B, bottom), which is interesting given that a number of these chemokines and cytokines mediate both Treg recruitment to tumors and induction of peripheral Tregs within tumors (Goldstein et al., 2013Goldstein J.D.

To establish which chemokines and cytokines were regulated by FAK and to address whether the FAK-dependent transcriptional profile was linked to chemokine receptor expression on tumor-infiltrating Tregs, we performed quantitative (q)RT-PCR array analysis. Comparison of chemokine/cytokine transcript levels between SCC FAK-WT and SCC FAK−/− cells revealed a subset of ligands increased >2-fold in SCC FAK-WT cells (Figure 4C). Several of these (Ccl1, Ccl5, Ccl7, Cxcl10) have roles in Treg recruitment (Ondondo et al., 2013Ondondo B. Jones E. Godkin A. Gallimore A.

Studying animals transplanted with the microbiota from humans representing diverse culinary traditions and fed a sequence of diets representing those of all donors, we found that correlations between bacterial species abundances and transit times are diet dependent. However, the levels of unconjugated bile acids-generated by bacterial bile salt hydrolases (BSH)-correlated with faster transit, including during consumption of a Bangladeshi diet. Mice harboring a consortium of sequenced cultured bacterial strains from the Bangladeshi donor's microbiota and fed a Bangladeshi diet revealed that the commonly used cholekinetic spice, turmeric, affects gut motility through a mechanism that reflects bacterial BSH activity and Ret signaling in the ENS. These results demonstrate how a single food ingredient interacts with a functional microbiota trait to regulate host physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2117898023,"Short- and long-distance circadian communication is essential for integration of temporal information. However, a major challenge in plant biology is to decipher how individual clocks are interconnected to sustain rhythms in the whole plant. Here we show that the shoot apex is composed of an ensemble of coupled clocks that influence rhythms in roots. Live-imaging of single cells, desynchronization of dispersed protoplasts, and mathematical analysis using barycentric coordinates for high-dimensional space show a gradation in the strength of circadian communication in different tissues, with shoot apex clocks displaying the highest coupling. The increased synchrony confers robustness of morning and evening oscillations and particular capabilities for phase readjustments. Rhythms in roots are altered by shoot apex ablation and micrografting, suggesting that signals from the shoot apex are able to synchronize distal organs. Similarly to the mammalian suprachiasmatic nucleus, shoot apexes play a dominant role within the plant hierarchical circadian structure."

To date, only snapshots of different mouse and human cell types have been generated, providing a static view on DNA methylation. To enable monitoring of methylation status as it changes over time, we establish a reporter of genomic methylation (RGM) that relies on a minimal imprinted gene promoter driving a fluorescent protein. We show that insertion of RGM proximal to promoter-associated CpG islands reports the gain or loss of DNA methylation. We further utilized RGM to report endogenous methylation dynamics of non-coding regulatory elements, such as the pluripotency-specific super enhancers of Sox2 and miR290. Loci-specific DNA methylation changes and their correlation with transcription were visualized during cell-state transition following differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and during reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency. RGM will allow the investigation of dynamic methylation changes during development and disease at single-cell resolution."
https://openalex.org/W1918612788,"Medical research has a heavy and continuing demand for rodent models across a range of disciplines. Behavioural assessment of pain in such models is highly time consuming, thus limiting the number of models and analgesics that can be studied. Facial expressions are widely used to assess pain in human infants. Recently the mouse grimace scale (MGS) has been developed and shown to be accurate and reliable, requiring only a short amount of training for the observer. This system therefore has the potential to become a highly useful tool both in pain research and clinical assessment of mouse pain. To date, the MGS has only been used as a research tool, however there is increasing interest in its use in cage-side clinical assessment. It is often wrongly assumed that MGS scores of animals not in pain (i.e. at baseline) are zero. Here, we aimed to assess the variability in baseline MGS scores between cohorts, sexes and strains of mice. Establishing the presence of a consistent baseline MGS score could lead to a valuable clinical pain assessment tool for mice when baseline information from the individual mouse may not be available as a comparator. Results demonstrated a significant difference in baseline MGS scores between both sexes (males > females) and strains of mice. The method used to score the facial action units (Live vs. retrospectively from still images) demonstrated significant differences in scores with live scores being significantly lower than retrospective scoring from images. The level of variation shown demonstrates the need for further research to be undertaken with regard to establishing baseline MGS scores for specific strains and sexes of mice, taking into account the method of scoring, prior to considering clinical implementation of this method in pain assessment."

Thirty-one women with polycystic ovary syndrome (age 27.2 ± 5.5 years; body mass index 26.7 ± 6.0 kg/m2) were randomly assigned to high intensity interval training, strength training, or a control group. The exercise groups exercised three times weekly for 10 weeks.The main outcome measure was change in homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR improved significantly only after high intensity interval training, by -0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.45, -0.20), equal to 17%, with between-group difference (p = 0.014). After high intensity interval training, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 0.2 (95% CI, 0.02, 0.5) mmol/L, with between group difference (p = 0.04). Endothelial function, measured as flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, increased significantly after high intensity interval training, by 2.0 (95% CI, 0.1, 4.0) %, between-group difference (p = 0.08). Fat percentage decreased significantly after both exercise regimes, without changes in body weight. After strength training, anti-Müllarian hormone was significantly reduced, by -14.8 (95% CI, -21.2, -8.4) pmol/L, between-group difference (p = 0.04). There were no significant changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin or leptin in any group.High intensity interval training for ten weeks improved insulin resistance, without weight loss, in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.

To increase the number of potential tissue samples for direct investigation we performed whole exon sequencing of explanted heart muscle samples from 30 patients that had a diagnosis of familial dilated cardiomyopathy and screened for potentially disease-causing mutations in 58 HCM or DCM-related genes.We identified 5 potentially disease-causing OBSCN mutations in 4 samples; one sample had two OBSCN mutations and one mutation was judged to be not disease-related. Also identified were 6 truncating mutations in TTN, 3 mutations in MYH7, 2 in DSP and one each in TNNC1, TNNI3, MYOM1, VCL, GLA, PLB, TCAP, PKP2 and LAMA4. The mean level of obscurin mRNA was significantly greater and more variable in healthy donor samples than the DCM samples but did not correlate with OBSCN mutations. A single obscurin protein band was observed in human heart myofibrils with apparent mass 960 ± 60 kDa. The three samples with OBSCN mutations had significantly lower levels of obscurin immunoreactive material than DCM samples without OBSCN mutations (45±7, 48±3, and 72±6% of control level).Obscurin levels in DCM controls, donor heart and myectomy samples were the same.OBSCN mutations may result in the development of a DCM phenotype via haploinsufficiency. Mutations in the obscurin gene should be considered as a significant causal factor of DCM, alone or in concert with other mutations."

Cremer M. Chromosome territories.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a003889Crossref Scopus (766) Google Scholar). New high-resolution imaging technologies promise to advance our understanding of how chromatin is packaged in the nucleus for appropriate gene expression (Ricci et al., 2015Ricci M.A. Manzo C.

New methods for examining chromatin architecture are needed. The two most widely used strategies, chromosome conformation capture (C-method) and FISH, each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Although C-methods offer base pair resolution and, in the case of HiC, genome-wide analysis of chromatin, this method is most often performed on pooled cell populations, which might obscure cell-type-specific differences that exist in complex tissues. On the other hand, FISH is an ideal method for analysis of different cell types in tissue, but probes are typically limited to a small number of genetic loci. Interestingly, these methods are not always in agreement with regard to chromatin organization. For example, analysis of the HoxD locus in mutant embryonic stem cells shows an open chromatin structure using FISH and a closed structure using 5C (Williamson et al., 2014Williamson I. Berlivet S. Eskeland R. Boyle S. Illingworth R.S. Paquette D. Dostie J. Bickmore W.A. Spatial genome organization: contrasting views from chromosome conformation capture and fluorescence in situ hybridization.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2778-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A potential source of these differences is that C-methods may involve fixation of relatively large, cross-linked chromatin domains, detecting cytological co-localization rather than direct molecular interaction (Belmont, 2014Belmont A.S. Large-scale chromatin organization: the good, the surprising, and the still perplexing.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 26: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Gavrilov et al., 2013Gavrilov A.A. Gushchanskaya E.S. Strelkova O. Zhironkina O. Kireev I.I. Iarovaia O.V. Razin S.V. Disclosure of a structural milieu for the proximity ligation reveals the elusive nature of an active chromatin hub.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 3563-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Also, to associate C-method and FISH results with chromatin modifications requires a separate analysis using different experimental conditions. For these reasons, we sought to develop a quantitative, high-resolution imaging method for investigating chromatin organization in complex tissues. This method would combine analysis of epigenetic modifications by immunostaining, localization of specific DNA sequences by FISH, and high-resolution segregation of nuclear compartments using an advanced imaging technique. We have adapted the array tomography (AT) imaging method for this purpose. AT is a high-resolution imaging method developed for the reconstruction and analysis of neuronal circuitry in the brain (Micheva and Smith, 2007Micheva K.D. Smith S.J. Array tomography: a new tool for imaging the molecular architecture and ultrastructure of neural circuits.Neuron. 2007; 55: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). The enhanced resolution is achieved by generating ultrathin serial sections of the specimen, followed by image acquisition and alignment. Acrylic sections can be stripped repeatedly, allowing for multiple rounds of imaging. This multiplexed staining approach increases the amount of molecular information that can be derived from a tissue volume (Micheva et al., 2010Micheva K.D. Busse B. Weiler N.C. O’Rourke N. Smith S.J. Single-synapse analysis of a diverse synapse population: proteomic imaging methods and markers.Neuron. 2010; 68: 639-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). FISH methods have not been reported for AT, and developing this capability would increase the utility of the approach for localizing DNA sequences or expressed RNAs. Our motivation in developing this method was to gain a deeper understanding of how the genome is organized in the mammalian brain, a tissue with an extreme variety of cell types. To this end, we tested AT for examining neuronal chromatin in mice lacking the DNA binding protein, MeCP2. Mutations in MECP2 give rise to the neurological disorder, Rett syndrome (RTT) (Amir et al., 1999Amir R.E. Van den Veyver I.B. Wan M. Tran C.Q. Francke U. Zoghbi H.Y. Rett syndrome is caused by mutations in X-linked MECP2, encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2.Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (3799) Google Scholar). MeCP2 is expressed to high levels in neurons and binds globally to methyl- and hydroxymethyl-cytosine within different dinucleotide contexts (Guo et al., 2014Guo J.U. Su Y. Shin J.H. Shin J. Li H. Xie B. Zhong C. Hu S. Le T. Fan G. et al.Distribution, recognition and regulation of non-CpG methylation in the adult mammalian brain.Nat.

MeCP2 binds to 5hmC enriched within active genes and accessible chromatin in the nervous system.Cell. 2012; 151: 1417-1430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Mecp2 is an X-linked gene (Quaderi et al., 1994Quaderi N.A. Meehan R.R. Tate P.H. Cross S.H. Bird A.P. Chatterjee A. Herman G.E. Brown S.D. Genetic and physical mapping of a gene encoding a methyl CpG binding protein, Mecp2, to the mouse X chromosome.Genomics. 1994; 22: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and cells in female RTT patients and mouse models are mosaic for loss of MeCP2 due to dosage compensation in mammals (Adler et al., 1995Adler D.A. Quaderi N.A. Brown S.D. Chapman V.M. Moore J. Tate P. Disteche C.M. The X-linked methylated DNA binding protein, Mecp2, is subject to X inactivation in the mouse.Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This mosaicism provides an ideal experimental context wherein neurons with normal chromatin architecture are adjacent to Mecp2-null neurons. While in vitro studies suggest that MeCP2 may regulate higher-order chromatin structure, it is not known how these findings impact chromatin organization in vivo. Further, several additional models for its function, including gene repression and activation, have also been proposed (Lyst and Bird, 2015Lyst M.J. Bird A. Rett syndrome: a complex disorder with simple roots.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2015; 16: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Using AT imaging, we quantify large-scale chromatin changes in symptomatic adult female RTT mouse brain. We detect a significant increase in chromatin compaction in two types of Mecp2-null hippocampal neurons together with a striking redistribution of the H4K20me3 histone modification into pericentromeric heterochromatin. In contrast, we do not detect these changes in cerebellar granule cells. We observe a spectrum of chromatin condensation states among cells in the nervous system providing a potential mechanism to explain cell-type-specific differences in gene expression upon loss of MeCP2. In summary, we show that AT is an ideal tool for investigating chromatin architecture in complex tissues where cellular heterogeneity may confound methods that sample populations of cells. Multiplexed detection of epigenetic modifications and genomic sequences combines with the resolving power of the AT imaging method to permit quantitative analysis within defined nuclear compartments. We initially chose hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons for our investigation due to their location within a well-defined layer in the hippocampus (Figure 1A). Neuronal nuclei, as in other cell types, can be visualized using the fluorescent DNA intercalator, DAPI (Wilson et al., 1990Wilson W.D. Tanious F.A. Barton H.J. Jones R.L. Fox K. Wydra R.L. Strekowski L. DNA sequence dependent binding modes of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8452-8461Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To determine the utility of AT for analyzing chromatin architecture, we exploited the mosaic nature of female RTT mouse brain expressing a knockin Mecp2-EGFP gene fusion (Lyst et al., 2013Lyst M.J. Ekiert R. Ebert D.H. Merusi C. Nowak J. Selfridge J. Guy J. Kastan N.R. Robinson N.D. de Lima Alves F. et al.Rett syndrome mutations abolish the interaction of MeCP2 with the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor.Nat. Neurosci. 2013; 16: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Mosaicism is ideal for imaging comparisons because fixation, embedding, staining, and imaging steps are equivalent for the wild-type (WT) and mutant populations of neurons under investigation. As predicted, due to the X-linked nature of Mecp2 and random X inactivation, the ratio of WT (GFP positive) to mutant cells was approximately 1:1 (Figure 1B). We found that 200 nm sections allowed for full-volume reconstruction of an sufficient number of nuclei for analysis. Figure 1C shows 3D reconstruction for a WT nucleus visualized along the x-y axis, while Figure 1D shows equivalent resolution along the z axis. Heterochromatic foci in neuronal nuclei exhibit a wide range of sizes and numbers. We therefore established a threshold based upon pixel intensity to quantify heterochromatin intensity and volume. A representative surface rendering of the heterochromatic foci enclosed by our threshold is shown in Figure 1E. A second 3D surface enclosing the entire nucleus was used to determine total nuclear volume and DAPI pixel intensity (Figure 1F). The structures enclosed by these surfaces are best visualized in Movie S1. Using AT, we found that the total amount of nuclear DAPI did not differ between WT and Mecp2-null neurons (Figure S1A). However, loss of MeCP2 resulted in a 20% increase in the amount of DNA packaged within the heterochromatin threshold (Figure 1G). The increase in chromatin compaction was detected as both an increase in DAPI density within heterochromatin (Figure 1H), as well as an increase in heterochromatin volume (Figure 1I). These results indicate that, in Mecp2-null neurons, there is a redistribution of DAPI-labeled DNA into more densely compact heterochromatin, and the increase in volume is not due to “unraveling” of chromatin within heterochromatic foci. Previous studies found that nuclear diameters in RTT neurons were smaller than WT neurons (Li et al., 2013Li Y. Wang H. Muffat J. Cheng A.W. Orlando D.A. Lovén J. Kwok S.-M. Feldman D.A. Bateup H.S.

In agreement with these reports, AT analysis of nuclear volume revealed a modest (∼5%) decrease in mutant neurons compared to WT (Figure S1B). Interestingly, we found a strong negative correlation when we plotted heterochromatin content versus nuclear volume for CA1 pyramidal neurons regardless of MeCP2 status (Figure S1C). This is consistent with previous reports that show an expansion of nuclear size when chromatin is decondensed (Mazumder et al., 2008Mazumder A. Roopa T. Basu A. Mahadevan L. Shivashankar G.V.

The other notable advantage of AT over other imaging methods is the ability to perform multiple rounds of imaging on the same sections using a variety of detection reagents. The observation of more compact chromatin in Mecp2-null neurons led us to examine whether we could detect any changes in heterochromatin-associated histone modifications. In Figure 2, we show the results of multiplexed immunostaining using antibodies against five different histone modifications, as well as for DAPI, MeCP2-GFP, and Conconavalin A (ConA). Immunostaining for H3K9me2, H3K9me3, H3K27me3, and H4K20me3 shows expected patterns in terms of their association with DAPI-labeled heterochromatin, indicating that our cytological criterion for heterochromatin is consistent with previously published studies (Figures 2D–2H). We always observed a single intense cluster of H3K27me3 in female cells that represents the Xi (Figure 2F), and MeCP2-GFP was generally excluded from this heterochromatin compartment (Figures 2J–2L). These exclusive heterochromatin territories are best appreciated by viewing the full 3D reconstruction (Movie S2). Using H3K27me3 immunostaining as a guide, we isolated this compartment (green surface in Movie S1) from total heterochromatin. Consistent with the observation that MeCP2 is excluded from this territory, we did not observe a significant difference in DAPI density for the Xi chromosome between WT and mutant neurons (Figure 2M). Further, the density of DAPI within the Xi was less than the density within other heterochromatin compartments (∼80%, compare with Figure 1H). This less condensed heterochromatin state for Xi has been described previously by light and electron microscopy (Rego et al., 2008Rego A. Sinclair P.B. Tao W. Kireev I. Belmont A.S. The facultative heterochromatin of the inactive X chromosome has a distinctive condensed ultrastructure.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 1119-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In addition to quantifying DAPI intensity, the established heterochromatin threshold can be applied to all the imaging channels acquired in an experiment. For example, although it appears upon visual examination that most of the MeCP2 is localized to heterochromatic foci, low-intensity clusters are highly abundant in euchromatin and nucleoplasm, resulting in heterochromatin MeCP2 content being ∼30% of total MeCP2 in a pyramidal cell nucleus (Figure 2N). AT imaging revealed an unexpected alteration in the spatial organization of H4K20me3 when WT and Mecp2-null nuclei were compared. In neurons deficient for MeCP2, H4K20me3 displayed a staining pattern that was almost identical to that of DAPI (compare Figures 3A–3D, right nuclei), which is consistent with previous reports that H4K20me3 is associated with pericentromeric heterochromatin (Schotta et al., 2004Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. A silencing pathway to induce H3-K9 and H4-K20 trimethylation at constitutive heterochromatin.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Strikingly, this extensive overlap with heterochromatic foci was not observed in WT neurons (Figures 3A–3D, left nuclei). In WT neurons, MeCP2 clustered intensely in heterochromatic foci, while the H4K20me3 intensity was reduced in these regions (arrowheads, compare Figures 3D and 3F left nuclei), instead occupying a territory peripheral to the dense heterochromatic foci (arrows, Figures 3D and 3F). These H4K20me3-rich territories are well within the heterochromatin threshold, but they display reduced DAPI intensity when compared to pericentromeric heterochromatin (arrow, Figure 3B). The segregation of H4K20me3, H3K27me3, and MeCP2 enriched heterochromatin territories is easily observed using AT (Movie S3). We performed confocal microscopy on brain sections to confirm that the H4K20me3 territories were not an artifact of the AT procedure. Examination of CA1 pyramidal neurons from female heterozygotes or wild-type (WT) male mice shows that the H4K20me3 territories can be detected using standard microscopy methods albeit at lower resolution (Figure S2).Figure S2Validation of AT Imaging Results by Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A–L) Panels A-L represent confocal images acquired using 20 μm sections through the hippocampal pyramidal cell layer.

Confocal microscopy supports AT imaging results showing MeCP2 immunostaining co-localized with pericentromeric heterochromatin (arrowhead) in WT nuclei while H4K20me3 localizes to a peripheral heterochromatin territory with lower DAPI intensity (arrows). We used the heterochromatin threshold to quantify the extent of this altered localization and detected a robust (65%) redistribution of H4K20me3 into dense heterochromatin upon loss of MeCP2 (Figure 3G). This spatial redistribution occurred in conjunction with a modest (11%) increase in the total nuclear amount of H4K20me3 (see Figure 4F). In contrast to H4K20me3, we did not observe a significant change in the spatial organization of H4K20me2 with loss of MeCP2 (Figure 3H), indicating specificity in spatial organization of different histone marks in mutant nuclei. We also examined the spatial distribution of H3K9me3, another heterochromatin-associated histone modification. Unlike the case for H4K20me3, no heterochromatin territories were enriched exclusively for this modification. In fact, H3K9me3 appeared to be present throughout all of the heterochromatin territories that we observed. Although it was difficult to detect by eye, AT analysis showed that there was still a significant (26%) redistribution of H3K9me3 into densely packed heterochromatin in Mecp2-null nuclei (Figure S3A). This occurred in conjunction with a 10% increase in total nuclear H3K9me3 levels (Figure S3C). We also detected a slight redistribution of H3K9me2 into dense heterochromatin (Figure S3B). To map chromosomal territories more precisely in the nucleus, we used peptide nucleic acid probes specific for both major and minor satellite sequences to localize pericentromeric and centromeric heterochromatin, respectively (Movie S4). We performed one round of immunostaining followed by FISH on the same hippocampal sections to determine the relative positions of H4K20me3, MeCP2-GFP, and the major and minor satellite sequences. As expected, the major satellite probe localized with the most condensed heterochromatic foci (Figures 4A and 4D). As predicted on the basis of our DAPI staining, the H4K20me3-rich territory was adjacent to the major satellite territory in WT nuclei (Figure 4D, left nuclei). In neurons lacking MeCP2, this segregation was lost, and H4K20me3 was enriched significantly in the major satellite territory (Figure 4D, right nuclei). We created a 3D threshold surrounding the major satellite FISH signal and measured the intensity of H4K20me3 immunostaining within the major satellite zone relative to the total nuclear intensity. We detected a robust (100%) redistribution of H4K20me3 into pericentromeric heterochromatin upon loss of MeCP2 (Figure 4E). This spatial reorganization occurred in conjunction with a modest increase in the total nuclear amount of the modification (Figure 4F). To determine if the changes in chromatin architecture we observed for CA1 pyramidal neurons were occurring in other neuronal cell types, we performed a similar analysis for hippocampal dentate granule cells, as well as cerebellar granule cells. We performed two rounds of antibody staining to collect information for both H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 modifications, followed by FISH for major satellite sequences. MeCP2-GFP is abundant in dentate granule cell nuclei, with the typical strong localization in heterochromatic foci (Figure 5B). Similar to CA1 pyramidal neurons, we find that loss of MeCP2 results in a significant redistribution (93%) of H4K20me3 into the major satellite territory (Figures 5D and 5E). Analysis for H3K9me3 showed redistribution to a lesser extent (37%, Figures S4E and S4G), while H3K9me2 levels show a slight decrease in the major satellite territory (Figures S4F and S4H). The changes in H4K20me3 and H3K9me3 in dentate granule cells lacking MeCP2 are accompanied by a 15% increase in DAPI-labeled DNA packaged into densely packed heterochromatin (Figure 5F).Figure S4The H3K9me3 Modification Is Redistributed into Pericentromeric Heterochromatin in Mecp2-Null Dentate Granule Cell Nuclei, Related to Figure 5Show full caption(A–F) Panels A-F show volume renderings through the hippocampal dentate granule cell layer.

To explore new therapeutic options, we successfully encapsulated MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a), a potent endogenous tumor suppressor in NSCLC into S6 aptamer-conjugated dendrimer to form lung cancer-targeted gene delivery nanoparticles (PAM-Ap/pMiR-34a NPs). PAM-Ap/pMiR-34a NPs had a diameter of 100–200 nm and Zeta potential of ~30 mV at applied N/P ratio. The aptamer conjugation significantly improved cellular uptake as well as gene transfection efficiency of PAM-Ap/pMiR-34a NPs in cultured NSCLC cells. We showed that PAM-Ap/pMiR-34a NPs enhanced the regulation of targeted genes, BCL-2 and p53 in vitro. In addition, we revealed PAM-Ap/pMiR-34a NPs significantly inhibited cell growth, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis of lung cancer cells compared with non-targeted NPs. The method provided a novel therapeutic strategy for the experimental treatment of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2211214498,"Background Constipation, a low fiber diet, sedentary lifestyle and gravidity are commonly assumed to increase the risk of hemorrhoids. However, evidence regarding these factors is limited. We examined the association between commonly cited risk factors and the prevalence of hemorrhoids. Methods We performed a cross sectional study of participants who underwent a colonoscopy in a colorectal adenoma prevention trial and who had a detailed assessment of bowel habits, diet and activity. The presence of hemorrhoids was extracted from the subjects’ colonoscopy reports. We used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals while adjusting for age and sex. Results The study included 2,813 participants. Of these, 1,074 had hemorrhoids recorded. Constipation was associated with an increased prevalence of hemorrhoids (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.11, 1.86). Of the fiber subtypes, high grain fiber intake was associated with a reduced risk (OR for quartile 4 versus quartile 1 = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62, 0.98). We found no association when comparing gravid and nulligravida women (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.62–1.40). Sedentary behavior was associated with a reduced risk (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65–0.98), but not physical activity (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66–1.03). Neither being overweight nor obese was associated with the presence of hemorrhoids (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72–1.09 and OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70–1.06). Conclusions Constipation is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhoids. Gravidity and physical activity do not appear to be associated. High grain fiber intake and sedentary behavior are associated with a decreased risk of hemorrhoids."

The aim was to assess the diagnostic value of novel serological extracellular matrix protein fragments as potential biomarkers for clinically significant and advanced fibrosis.Specific protein fragments of matrix metalloprotease degraded type I, III, IV and VI collagen (C1M, C3M, C4M, C6M) and type III and IV collagen formation (Pro-C3 and P4NP7S) were assessed in plasma from 403 chronic hepatitis C patients by specific ELISAs. Patients were stratified according to Metavir Fibrosis stage; F0 (n = 46), F1 (n = 161), F2 (n = 95), F3 (n = 44) and F4 (n = 33) based on liver biopsy.Pro-C3 was significantly elevated in patients with significant fibrosis (≥F2) compared to F0-F1 (p<0.05), while the markers C3M, C4M, C6M and P4NP7S were significantly elevated in patients with advanced fibrosis (≥F3) compared to F0-F2 (p<0.05). C1M showed no difference between fibrosis stages. Using Receiver Operating Characteristics analysis, the best marker for detecting ≥F2 and ≥F3 was Pro-C3 with AUC = 0.75 and AUC = 0.86. Combination of Pro-C3 and C4M with age, BMI and gender in a multiple ordered logistic regression model improved the diagnostic value for detecting ≥F2 and ≥F3 with AUC = 0.80 and AUC = 0.88.The Pro-C3 protein fragment provided clinically relevant diagnostic accuracy as a single marker of liver fibrosis. A model combining Pro-C3 and C4M along with patient's age, body mass index and gender increased the diagnostic power for identifying clinically significant fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2236684539,"The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a retrograde messenger system, consisting of lipid signaling molecules that bind to at least two G-protein-coupled receptors, Cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 (CB1 and 2). As CB2 is primarily expressed on immune cells such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia, it is of great interest how CB2 contributes to immune cell development and function in health and disease. Here, understanding the mechanisms of CB2 involvement in immune-cell function as well as the trafficking and regulation of CB2 expressing cells are crucial issues. Up to now, CB2 antibodies produce unclear results, especially those targeting the murine protein. Therefore, we have generated BAC transgenic GFP reporter mice (CB2-GFPTg) to trace CB2 expression in vitro and in situ. Those mice express GFP under the CB2 promoter and display GFP expression paralleling CB2 expression on the transcript level in spleen, thymus and brain tissue. Furthermore, by using fluorescence techniques we show that the major sources for GFP-CB2 expression are B cells in spleen and blood and microglia in the brain. This novel CB2-GFP transgenic reporter mouse line represents a powerful resource to study CB2 expression in different cell types. Furthermore, it could be used for analyzing CB2-mediated mobilization and trafficking of immune cells as well as studying the fate of recruited immune cells in models of acute and chronic inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2197048537,"Understanding global gene regulation depends critically on accurate annotation of regulatory elements that are functional in a given cell type. CENTIPEDE, a powerful, probabilistic framework for identifying transcription factor binding sites from tissue-specific DNase I cleavage patterns and genomic sequence content, leverages the hypersensitivity of factor-bound chromatin and the information in the DNase I spatial cleavage profile characteristic of each DNA binding protein to accurately infer functional factor binding sites. However, the model for the spatial profile in this framework fails to account for the substantial variation in the DNase I cleavage profiles across different binding sites. Neither does it account for variation in the profiles at the same binding site across multiple replicate DNase I experiments, which are increasingly available. In this work, we introduce new methods, based on multi-scale models for inhomogeneous Poisson processes, to account for such variation in DNase I cleavage patterns both within and across binding sites. These models account for the spatial structure in the heterogeneity in DNase I cleavage patterns for each factor. Using DNase-seq measurements assayed in a lymphoblastoid cell line, we demonstrate the improved performance of this model for several transcription factors by comparing against the Chip-seq peaks for those factors. Finally, we explore the effects of DNase I sequence bias on inference of factor binding using a simple extension to our framework that allows for a more flexible background model. The proposed model can also be easily applied to paired-end ATAC-seq and DNase-seq data. msCentipede, a Python implementation of our algorithm, is available at http://rajanil.github.io/msCentipede."
https://openalex.org/W2342180986,"During the past decade, working memory training has attracted much interest. However, the training outcomes have varied between studies and methodological problems have hampered the interpretation of results. The current study examined transfer after working memory updating training by employing an extensive battery of pre-post cognitive measures with a focus on near transfer. Thirty-one healthy Finnish young adults were randomized into either a working memory training group or an active control group. The working memory training group practiced with three working memory tasks, while the control group trained with three commercial computer games with a low working memory load. The participants trained thrice a week for five weeks, with one training session lasting about 45 minutes. Compared to the control group, the working memory training group showed strongest transfer to an n-back task, followed by working memory updating, which in turn was followed by active working memory capacity. Our results support the view that working memory training produces near transfer effects, and that the degree of transfer depends on the cognitive overlap between the training and transfer measures."
https://openalex.org/W2302169460,"The field of cancer research and treatment has made significant progress, yet we are far from having completely safe, efficient and specific therapies that target cancer cells and spare the healthy tissues. Natural compounds may reduce the problems related to cancer treatment. Currently, many plant products are being used to treat cancer. In this study, Rohitukine, a natural occurring chromone alkaloid extracted from Dysoxylum binectariferum, was investigated for cytotoxic properties against budding yeast as well as against lung cancer (A549) cells. We endeavored to specifically study Rohitukine in S. cerevisiae in the context of MAPK pathways as yeast probably represents the experimental model where the organization and regulation of MAPK pathways are best understood. MAPK are evolutionarily conserved protein kinases that transfer extracellular signals to the machinery controlling essential cellular processes like growth, migration, differentiation, cell division and apoptosis. We aimed at carrying out hypothesis driven studies towards targeting the important network of cellular communication, a critical process that gets awry in cancer. Employing mutant strains of genetic model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae encodes five MAPKs involved in control of distinct cellular responses such as growth, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Our study involves gene knockouts of Slt2 and Hog1 which are functional homologs of human ERK5 and mammalian p38 MAPK, respectively. We performed cytotoxicity assay to evaluate the effect of Rohitukine on cell viability and also determined the effects of drug on generation of reactive oxygen species, induction of apoptosis and expression of Slt2 and Hog1 gene at mRNA level in the presence of drug. The results of this study show a differential effect in the activity of drug between the WT, Slt2 and Hog1 gene deletion strain indicating involvement of MAPK pathway. Further, we investigated Rohitukine induced cytotoxic effects in lung cancer cells and stimulated the productions of ROS after exposure for 24 hrs. Results from western blotting suggest that Rohitukine triggered apoptosis in A549 cell line through upregulation of p53, caspase9 and down regulation of Bcl-2 protein. The scope of this study is to understand the mechanism of anticancer activity of Rohitukine to increase the repertoire of anticancer drugs, so that problem created by emergence of resistance towards standard anticancer compounds can be alleviated."
https://openalex.org/W2196647047,"Breast cancer has become the leading cause of cancer-related death among women. A large number of patients become resistant to drug chemotherapy. Paclitaxel (Taxol) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent used to treat cancer patients. Taxol has been widely used in human malignancies including breast cancer because it can stabilize microtubules resulting in cell death by causing an arrest during the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak) plays an important role in Taxol-induced apoptosis in breast cancer. In our present study, we investigated the expression of the Bak protein and clinicopathological correlations in a large sample of breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry. We found that the percentage of high scores of Bak expression in breast cancer was significantly lower than that of the non-cancerous breast control tissue. In addition, lower Bak expression was positively associated with the clinical TNM stage of breast cancer with a significant decrease in overall survival compared with those with higher Bak expression especially in the Luminal and HER2 subtypes. Importantly, higher Bak expression predicted a favorable clinical outcome in the cases treated with Taxol indicated by a higher overall survival than that of patients with lower Bak expression especially in Luminal and HER2 subtypes. Furthermore, these results were confirmed in vitro since overexpression of Bak sensitized breast cancer cells to Taxol by inhibiting proliferation and promoting apoptosis; in contrast, downregulation of Bak through siRNA transfection inhibited Taxol induced-apoptosis. Therefore, our results demonstrate that Bak acts as a sensitive biomarker and favorable prognostic factor for Taxol treatment in breast cancer. The restoration of Bak expression would be therapeutically beneficial for Taxol resistant breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2210812545,"Although in cirrhosis with portal hypertension levels of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II are increased, this is accompanied by increased production of angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), the endogenous ligand of the Mas receptor (MasR), which blunts hepatic fibrosis and decreases hepatic vascular resistance.

The coloured microsphere technique assessed portal and systemic hemodynamic effects of AVE0991 in vivo. Hepatic expression of eNOS, p-eNOS, iNOS, JAK2, ROCK and p-Moesin were analyzed by western blots. Activities of ACE and ACE2 were investigated fluorometrically. Moreover, fibrosis was assessed in BDL rats receiving AVE0991.In vivo, AVE0991 decreased portal pressure (PP) in both rat models of cirrhosis. Importantly, systemic effects were not observed. The hepatic effects of AVE0991 were based on upregulation of vasodilating pathways involving p-eNOS and iNOS, as well as by downregulation of the vasoconstrictive pathways (ROCK, p-Moesin). Short-term treatment with AVE0991 decreased the activity of ACE2, long-term treatment did not affect hepatic fibrosis in BDL rats.The non-peptidic agonist of Ang-(1-7), AVE0991, decreases portal pressure without influencing systemic pressure. Thus, although it does not inhibit fibrosis, AVE0991 may represent a promising new therapeutic strategy for lowering portal pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2336299972,"Staphylococcus aureus ica-independent biofilms are multifactorial in nature, and various bacterial proteins have been associated with biofilm development, including fibronectin-binding proteins A and B, protein A, surface protein SasG, proteases, and some autolysins. The role of extracellular DNA (eDNA) has also been demonstrated in some S. aureus biofilms. Here, we constructed a Tn551 library, and the screening identified two genes that affected biofilm formation, lrgB and yycI. The repressive effect of both genes on the development of biofilm was also confirmed in knockout strains constructed by allelic recombination. In contrast, the superexpression of either lrgB or yycI by a cadmium-inducible promoter led to a decrease in biofilm accumulation. Indeed, a significant increase in the cell-lysis dependent eDNA release was detected when lrgB or yycI were inactivated, explaining the enhanced biofilm formed by these mutants. In fact, lrgB and yycI genes belong to distinct operons that repress bacterial autolysis through very different mechanisms. LrgB is associated with the synthesis of phage holin/anti-holin analogues, while YycI participates in the activation/repression of the two-component system YycGF (WalKR). Our in vivo data suggest that autolysins activation lead to increased bacterial virulence in the foreign body animal model since a higher number of attached cells was recovered from the implanted catheters inoculated with lrgB or yycI knockout mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1771494502,"Background Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are a heavy burden on society. However, due to the complex etiology of RTIs, the clinical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these infections remain challenging, especially in developing countries. Methods To determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 18 respiratory pathogens, we analyzed 12,502 patients with acute respiratory infections (ARIs) by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient pharyngeal swabs. Results Samples positive for at least 1 pathogen were obtained from 48.42% of the total patients. Of these pathogen-positive patients, 17.99% were infected with more than 1 pathogen. Of the 18 pathogens analyzed, four were detected with a positive detection rate (PDR) > 5%: influenza A virus (IAV) > respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) >Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) > human coronavirus (HCoV). The pathogens with the 4 highest co-infection rates (CIRs) were as follows: HCoV > human bocavirus (HBoV) > enterovirus (EV) > parainfluenza virus (PIV). The overall positive detection rate (PDR) varied significantly according to patient age, the season and year of detection, and the disease subgroup, but not according to patient sex. The individual PDRs of the pathogens followed 3 types of distributions for patient sex, 4 types of distributions for patient age, 4 types of seasonal distributions, 2 types of seasonal epidemic trends, 4 types of yearly epidemic trends, and different susceptibility distributions in the disease subgroups. Additionally, the overall CIR showed significantly different distributions according to patient sex, patient age, and the disease subgroup, whereas the CIRs of individual pathogens suggested significant preference characteristics. Conclusion IAV remains the most common pathogen among the pathogens analyzed. More effort should be directed toward the prevention and control of pathogens that show a trend of increasing incidence such as HCoV, human adenovirus (ADV), and RSV. Although clinically distinguishing specific pathogens responsible for RTIs is difficult, the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the various RTI-causing agents could provide clues for clinicians, thereby informing decisions regarding prevention and medication and guiding appropriate public health strategies."

While most studies to date have focused on the effects of this receptor in platelets, PEAR1 is located in multiple tissues including the endothelium, where it is most highly expressed. Our first objective was to evaluate the role of PEAR1 in endothelial function by examining flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery in 641 participants from the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study. Our second objective was to further define the impact of PEAR1 on cardiovascular disease computationally through meta-analysis of 75,000 microarrays, yielding insights regarding PEAR1 function, and predictions of phenotypes and diseases affected by PEAR1 dysregulation. Based on the results of this meta-analysis we examined whether genetic variation in PEAR1 influences endothelial function using an ex vivo assay of endothelial cell migration. We observed a significant association between rs12041331 and flow-mediated dilation in participants of the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study (P = 0.02). Meta-analysis results revealed that PEAR1 expression is highly correlated with several genes (e.g. ANG2, ACVRL1, ENG) and phenotypes (e.g. endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis) that are integral to endothelial function. Functional validation of these results revealed that PEAR1 rs12041331 is significantly associated with endothelial migration (P = 0.04). Our results suggest for the first time that genetic variation of PEAR1 is a significant determinant of endothelial function through pathways implicated in cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2190000320,"Hypoxia induced oxidative stress incurs pathophysiological changes in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes by promoting translocation of p53 to mitochondria. Here, we investigate the cardio-protective efficacy of nanocurcumin in protecting primary human ventricular cardiomyocytes (HVCM) from hypoxia induced damages. Hypoxia induced hypertrophy was confirmed by FITC-phenylalanine uptake assay, atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels and cell size measurements. Hypoxia induced translocation of p53 was investigated by using mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore blocker cyclosporin A (blocks entry of p53 to mitochondria) and confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence. Mitochondrial damage in hypertrophied HVCM cells was evaluated by analysing bio-energetic, anti-oxidant and metabolic function and substrate switching form lipids to glucose. Nanocurcumin prevented translocation of p53 to mitochondria by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential and de-stressed hypertrophied HVCM cells by significant restoration in lactate, acetyl-coenzyme A, pyruvate and glucose content along with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) activity. Significant restoration in glucose and modulation of GLUT-1 and GLUT-4 levels confirmed that nanocurcumin mediated prevention of substrate switching. Nanocurcumin prevented of mitochondrial stress as confirmed by c-fos/c-jun/p53 signalling. The data indicates decrease in p-300 histone acetyl transferase (HAT) mediated histone acetylation and GATA-4 activation as pharmacological targets of nanocurcumin in preventing hypoxia induced hypertrophy. The study provides an insight into propitious therapeutic effects of nanocurcumin in cardio-protection and usability in clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2180978184,"Background Inflammatory markers are elevated in patients with dementia. Evidence for an association between inflammation and cognitive function in dementia-free individuals is sparse, inconsistent, and predominantly restricted to the elderly. Assessment of inflammatory markers in young adults as predictors of cognitive function in midlife, well before the onset of overt dementia, is lacking. Furthermore, rarely has the relation with longitudinal change in inflammatory markers been examined. Objective To examine the association of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, white blood cell count (WBC) and GlycA, a novel NMR-determined biomarker of systemic inflammation, measured in young adulthood and of GlycA change over 13 years follow-up with cognitive function in midlife. Methods 507 participants of the Jerusalem Lipid Research Clinic (LRC) study were assessed at 3 time points over 18–22 years. First, the inflammatory variables GlycA, CRP, fibrinogen, and WBC were measured in blood samples drawn at ages 28–32. Then, in blood samples drawn a mean 13 years later (range, 12–16 years) at ages 41–46, GlycA was again measured (in 484 individuals). Subsequently at ages 48–52, on average 7 years later, global cognitive function and its five specific component domains were assessed with a NeuroTrax computerized test battery. Multiple regression and multivariable logistic models were applied. Results Inverse unadjusted associations were shown for baseline levels and longitudinal change in inflammatory markers and measures of cognition. Multiple regression models were adjusted for age at cognitive assessment, sex, socio-demographic characteristics, baseline measures of leisure-time vigorous activity, smoking status and body mass index (BMI) at ages 28–32, change in smoking status and BMI between ages 28–32 and 41–46, and depression assessed at the time of cognitive testing. The highest quintile of GlycA change, but not the baseline inflammation measures, was inversely related to global cognition (standardized β = -.109, p = .011) as well as to the information processing speed and memory domains (standardized β = -.124, p = .008 and-.117, p = .014, respectively). The multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for low ranked global cognitive function (lowest fifth) comparing the extreme quintiles of GlycA change was 4.8 (95%CI, 1.7–13.5, p = .003; p for trend = .031). Conclusions In this longitudinal study of a novel systemic inflammatory marker in a population-based cohort of young adults, GlycA increase over 13 years, but not baseline measures of inflammation, was associated with poorer cognitive function in midlife."
https://openalex.org/W2202946415,"Objective The prevalence and distribution of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes in Canada is not known. Genotypic analysis may contribute to a better understanding of HBV strain distribution and transmission risk. Methods HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positive samples of acute (n = 152) and chronic (n = 1533) HBV submitted for strain analysis or reference genotype testing between 2006 and 2012 were analyzed. The HBsAg coding region was amplified to determine the HBV genotype by INNO-LiPA assay or sequence analysis. Single and multivariate analyses were used to describe genotypes’ associations with known demographic and behavioral risk factors for 126 linked cases of acute HBV. Results Nine genotypes were detected (A to I), including mixed infections. Genotype C (HBV/C) dominated within chronic infections while HBV/D and A prevailed among acute HBV cases. History of incarceration and residing with a chronic HBV carrier or injection drug user were the most frequently reported risks for acute HBV infection. Over time, HBV/A increased among both acute and chronic infections, and HBV/C and HBV/D decreased among chronic infections. Conclusion Chronic and acute HBV genotypes in Canada differ in the relative distribution and their associations with known risk factors, suggesting different routes of transmission and clinical progression of infection."
https://openalex.org/W1628424582,"Objectives The benefits of breastfeeding for cognitive development continue to be hotly debated but are yet to be supported by conclusive empirical evidence. Methods We used here a latent growth curve modeling approach to test the association of breastfeeding with IQ growth trajectories, which allows differentiating the variance in the IQ starting point in early life from variance in IQ gains that occur later in childhood through adolescence. Breastfeeding (yes/ no) was modeled as a direct predictor of three IQ latent growth factors (i.e. intercept, slope and quadratic term) and adjusted for the covariates socioeconomic status, mother's age at birth and gestational stage. Data came from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), a prospective cohort study of twins born between 1996 and 1994 in the United Kingdom, who were assessed 9 times on IQ between age 2 and 16 years (N = 11,582). Results Having been breastfed was associated with a small yet significant advantage in IQ at age 2 in girls (β = .07, CI 95% from 0.64 to 3.01; N = 3,035) but not in boys (β = .04, CI 95% from -0.14 to 2.41). Having been breastfeeding was neither associated with the other IQ growth factors in girls (slope: β = .02, CI 95% from -0.25 to 0.43; quadratic: β = .01, CI 95% from -0.02 to 0.02) nor in boys (slope: β = .02, CI 95% from -0.30 to 0.47; quadratic: β = -.01, CI 95% from -0.01 to 0.01). Conclusions Breastfeeding has little benefit for early life intelligence and cognitive growth from toddlerhood through adolescence."
https://openalex.org/W2336296440,"Oligodontia is defined as the congenital absence of six or more permanent teeth, excluding the third molars. Oligodontia may contribute to masticatory dysfunction, speech alteration, aesthetic problems and malocclusion. Numerous gene mutations have been association with oligodontia. In the present study, we identified a de novo AXIN2 missense mutation (c.314T>G) in a Chinese individual with non-syndromic oligodontia. This mutation results in the substitution of Val at residue 105 for Gly (p.Val105Gly); residue 105 is located in the highly conserved regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain of the AXIN2 protein. This is the first report indicating that a mutation in the RGS domain of AXIN2 is responsible for non-syndromic oligodontia. Our study supports the relationship between AXIN2 mutation and non-syndromic oligodontia and extends the mutation spectrum of the AXIN2 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2187633657,"Deficits in impulsivity and affect dysregulation are key features of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) besides impairing levels of hyperactivity and/or inattention. However, the neural substrates underlying these traits are relatively under-investigated. In this study, we use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the hypothesis of diminished functional integration within the affective/limbic network (which includes the amygdala, hippocampus, subgenual cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens) of children with ADHD, which is associated with their behavioral measures of emotional control deficits. Resting state-fMRI data were obtained from 12 healthy control subjects and 15 children with ADHD, all who had a minimum one-month washout period for medications and supplements. Children with ADHD demonstrated less integrated affective network, evidenced by increased bilateral amygdalar and decreased left orbitofrontal connectivity within the affective network compared to healthy controls. The hyper-connectivity at the left amygdalar within the affective network was associated with increased aggressiveness and conduct problems, as well as decline in functioning in children with ADHD. Similar findings in affective network dysconnectivity were replicated in a subset of children with ADHD three months later. Our findings of divergent changes in amygdala and orbitofrontal intrinsic connectivity support the hypothesis of an impaired functional integration within the affective network in childhood ADHD. Larger prospective studies of the intrinsic affective network in ADHD are required, which may provide further insight on the biological mechanisms of emotional control deficits observed in ADHD."

In order to identify dual inhibitors of both proteins, we developed a hierarchical virtual screening approach, followed by in vitro evaluation of the highest scoring hits. Starting from the ZINC database of purchasable compounds, sequential 3D-pharmacophore and molecular docking steps were applied to filter the virtual 'hits'. At the end of virtual screening, 12 compounds were chosen and tested against the in vitro aminopeptidase activity of both PfA-M1 and PfA-M17. Two molecules showed significant inhibitory activity (low micromolar/nanomolar range) against both proteins. Finally, the crystal structure of the most potent compound in complex with both PfA-M1 and PfA-M17 was solved, revealing the binding mode and validating our computational approach."
https://openalex.org/W2208271734,"To evaluate antibiotic consumption in the pediatric wards of Emilia-Romagna Region, from 2004 to 2011, with a focus on the antibiotics reserved to the most serious infections, and to analyse the ADRs reported for antibiotics by the pediatric wards of Emilia-Romagna hospitals.Reference population was represented by all the patients (0-14 years old) admitted to the pediatric wards of all the hospitals of Emilia-Romagna Region. Drug consumption was expressed as number of DDDs per 100 Bed-Days (BD) and data were analysed by active substance, by therapeutic subgroups or by ward type. The time trends of antibiotic consumption were statistically analysed by linear regression. All the suspected ADR reports associated with antibiotics, reported between January 2004 and December 2011 were drawn by the Italian Spontaneous Reporting Database.Overall antibiotic consumption showed only a slight increase (p = 0.224). Among the pediatric wards, pediatric surgery showed the highest increase from 2004 to 2011 (p = 0.011). Penicillins and β-lactamase inhibitors was the first therapeutic group with a statistically significant increase over years (p = 0.038), whereas penicillins with extended spectrum presented a statistically significant reduction (p = 0.008). Moreover, only 5 drugs out of the 8 antibiotics reserved to the most serious infections were used. Pharmacovigilance data showed 27 spontaneous ADR reports associated to ATC J01 drugs. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid had the highest number of ADR reports (n = 7).The steadily increasing consumption in penicillins and β-lactamase inhibitors, in association with a considerable decrease of plain penicillins, raises a serious concern. Pharmacovigilance reports seem to suggest a safe use of antibiotics in the hospital setting of Emilia-Romagna. Further studies to investigate the reason for prescribing antibiotics in children inpatients are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2226918533,"Objective Recent evidence indicates that significant interactions exist between Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and microRNAs (miRNAs) in endothelial cells. Because KLF2 is known to exert anti-inflammatory effects and inhibit the pro-inflammatory activation of monocytes, we sought to identify how inflammation-associated miR-155 is regulated by KLF2 in macrophages. Approach and Results Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type (WT) C57Bl/6 mice were transfected with either recombinant adenovirus vector expressing KLF2 (Ad-KLF2) or siRNA targeting KLF2 (KLF2-siRNA) for 24 h–48 h, then stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL, 50 μg/mL) for 24 h. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that KLF2 markedly reduced the expression of miR-155 in quiescent/ox-LDL-stimulated macrophages. We also found that the increased expression of miR-155, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and interleukin (IL)-6 and the decreased expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-1 and IL-10 in ox-LDL-treated macrophages were significantly suppressed by KLF2. Most importantly, over-expression of miR-155 could partly reverse the suppressive effects of KLF2 on the inflammatory response of macrophages. Conversely, the suppression of miR-155 in KLF2 knockdown macrophages significantly overcame the pro-inflammatory properties associated with KLF2 knockdown. Finally, Ad-KLF2 significantly attenuated the diet-induced formation of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice, which was associated with a significantly reduced expression of miR-155 and its relative inflammatory cytokine genes in the aortic arch and in macrophages. Conclusion KLF2-mediated suppression of miR-155 reduced the inflammatory response of macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2187390070,"In cognitive science there is a seeming paradox: On the one hand, studies of human judgment and decision making have repeatedly shown that people systematically violate optimal behavior when integrating information from multiple sources. On the other hand, optimal models, often Bayesian, have been successful at accounting for information integration in fields such as categorization, memory, and perception. This apparent conflict could be due, in part, to different materials and designs that lead to differences in the nature of processing. Stimuli that require controlled integration of information, such as the quantitative or linguistic information (commonly found in judgment studies), may lead to suboptimal performance. In contrast, perceptual stimuli may lend themselves to automatic processing, resulting in integration that is closer to optimal. We tested this hypothesis with an experiment in which participants categorized faces based on resemblance to a family patriarch. The amount of evidence contained in the top and bottom halves of each test face was independently manipulated. These data allow us to investigate a canonical example of sub-optimal information integration from the judgment and decision making literature, the dilution effect. Splitting the top and bottom halves of a face, a manipulation meant to encourage controlled integration of information, produced farther from optimal behavior and larger dilution effects. The Multi-component Information Accumulation model, a hybrid optimal/averaging model of information integration, successfully accounts for key accuracy, response time, and dilution effects."
https://openalex.org/W2203430754,"The latency and reactivation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection has been well studied. However, there have been few studies of the latency and reactivation of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), the most common etiological non-tuberculous Mycobacterium species next to M. tuberculosis in humans worldwide. We hypothesized that latent MAC infections can be reactivated following immunosuppression after combination chemotherapy with clarithromycin and rifampicin under experimental conditions. To this end, we employed a modified Cornell-like murine model of tuberculosis and investigated six strains consisting of two type strains and four clinical isolates of M. avium and M. intracellulare. After aerosol infection of each MAC strain, five to six mice per group were euthanized at 2, 4, 10, 18, 28 and 35 weeks post-infection, and lungs were sampled to analyze bacterial burden and histopathology. One strain of each species maintained a culture-negative state for 10 weeks after completion of 6 weeks of chemotherapy, but was reactivated after 5 weeks of immunosuppression in the lungs with dexamethasone (three out of six mice in M. avium infection) or sulfasalazine (four out of six mice in both M. avium and M. intracellulare infection). The four remaining MAC strains exhibited decreased bacterial loads in response to chemotherapy; however, they remained at detectable levels and underwent regrowth after immunosuppression. In addition, the exacerbated lung pathology demonstrated a correlation with bacterial burden after reactivation. In conclusion, our results suggest the possibility of MAC reactivation in an experimental mouse model, and experimentally demonstrate that a compromised immune status can induce reactivation and/or regrowth of MAC infection."
https://openalex.org/W2227536446,"Background Household air pollution in low income countries is an important cause of mortality from respiratory infection. We hypothesised that chronic smoke exposure is detrimental to alveolar macrophage function, causing failure of innate immunity. We report the relationship between macrophage function and prior smoke exposure in healthy Malawians. Methods Healthy subjects exposed daily to cooking smoke at home volunteered for bronchoalveolar lavage. Alveolar macrophage particulate content was measured as a known correlate of smoke exposure. Phagocytosis and intraphagosomal function (oxidative burst and proteolysis) were measured by a flow cytometric assay. Cytokine responses in macrophages were compared following re-exposure in vitro to wood smoke, before and after glutathione depletion. Results Volunteers had a range of alveolar macrophage particulate loading. The macrophage capacity for phagosomal oxidative burst was negatively associated with alveolar macrophage particulate content (n = 29, r2 = 0.16, p = 0.033), but phagocytosis per se and proteolytic function were unaffected. High particulate content was associated with lower baseline CXCL8 release (ratio 0.51, CI 0.29–0.89) and lower final concentrations on re-exposure to smoke in vitro (ratio 0.58, CI 0.34–0.97). Glutathione depletion augmented CXCL8 responses by 1.49x (CI 1.02–2.17) compared with wood smoke alone. This response was specific to smoke as macrophages response to LPS were not modulated by glutathione. Conclusion Chronic smoke exposure is associated with reduced human macrophage oxidative burst, and dampened inflammatory cytokine responses. These are critical processes in lung defence against infection and likely to underpin the relationship between air pollution and pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2181301021,"SARA (Smad Anchor for Receptor Activation) plays a crucial role in Rab5-mediated endocytosis in cell lines localizing to early endosomes where it regulates morphology and function. Here, we analyzed the role of SARA during neuronal development and tested whether it functions as a regulator of endocytic trafficking of selected axonal and membrane proteins. Suppression of SARA perturbs the appearance of juxtanuclear endocytic recycling compartments and the neurons show long axons with large growth cones. Furthermore, surface distribution of the cell adhesion molecule L1 in axons and the fusion of vesicles containing transferring receptor (TfR) in dendrites were increased in neurons where SARA was silenced. Conversely, SARA overexpression generated large early endosomes and reduced neurite outgrowth. Taken together, our findings suggest a significant contribution of SARA to key aspects of neuronal development, including neurite formation."
https://openalex.org/W2204379715,"We have previously reported an antisense technology, ‘snoMEN vectors’, for targeted knock-down of protein coding mRNAs using human snoRNAs manipulated to contain short regions of sequence complementarity with the mRNA target. Here we characterise the use of snoMEN vectors to target the knock-down of micro RNA primary transcripts. We document the specific knock-down of miR21 in HeLa cells using plasmid vectors expressing miR21-targeted snoMEN RNAs and show this induces apoptosis. Knock-down is dependent on the presence of complementary sequences in the snoMEN vector and the induction of apoptosis can be suppressed by over-expression of miR21. Furthermore, we have also developed lentiviral vectors for delivery of snoMEN RNAs and show this increases the efficiency of vector transduction in many human cell lines that are difficult to transfect with plasmid vectors. Transduction of lentiviral vectors expressing snoMEN targeted to pri-miR21 induces apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma cells, which express high levels of miR21, but not in human primary cells. We show that snoMEN-mediated suppression of miRNA expression is prevented by siRNA knock-down of Ago2, but not by knock-down of Ago1 or Upf1. snoMEN RNAs colocalise with Ago2 in cell nuclei and nucleoli and can be co-immunoprecipitated from nuclear extracts by antibodies specific for Ago2."
https://openalex.org/W2311400143,"Objective Humans can acquire a wide variety of motor skills using sensory feedback pertaining to discrepancies between intended and actual movements. Acupuncture needle manipulation involves sophisticated hand movements and represents a fundamental skill for acupuncturists. We investigated whether untrained students could improve their motor performance during acupuncture needle manipulation using visual feedback (VF). Methods Twenty-one untrained medical students were included, randomly divided into concurrent (n = 10) and post-trial (n = 11) VF groups. Both groups were trained in simple lift/thrusting techniques during session 1, and in complicated lift/thrusting techniques in session 2 (eight training trials per session). We compared the motion patterns and error magnitudes of pre- and post-training tests. Results During motion pattern analysis, both the concurrent and post-trial VF groups exhibited greater improvements in motion patterns during the complicated lifting/thrusting session. In the magnitude error analysis, both groups also exhibited reduced error magnitudes during the simple lifting/thrusting session. For the training period, the concurrent VF group exhibited reduced error magnitudes across all training trials, whereas the post-trial VF group was characterized by greater error magnitudes during initial trials, which gradually reduced during later trials. Conclusions Our findings suggest that novices can improve the sophisticated hand movements required for acupuncture needle manipulation using sensorimotor learning with VF. Use of two types of VF can be beneficial for untrained students in terms of learning how to manipulate acupuncture needles, using either automatic or cognitive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2182724389,"Fifty percent of cutaneous melanomas are driven by activated BRAFV600E, but tumors treated with RAF inhibitors, even when they respond dramatically, rapidly adapt and develop resistance. Thus, there is a pressing need to identify the major mechanisms of intrinsic and adaptive resistance and develop drug combinations that target these resistance mechanisms. In a combinatorial drug screen on a panel of 12 treatment-naïve BRAFV600E mutant melanoma cell lines of varying levels of resistance to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibition, we identified the combination of PLX4720, a targeted inhibitor of mutated BRaf, and lapatinib, an inhibitor of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, as synergistically cytotoxic in the subset of cell lines that displayed the most resistance to PLX4720. To identify potential mechanisms of resistance to PLX4720 treatment and synergy with lapatinib treatment, we performed a multi-platform functional genomics analysis to profile the genome as well as the transcriptional and proteomic responses of these cell lines to treatment with PLX4720. We found modest levels of resistance correlated with the zygosity of the BRAF V600E allele and receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) mutational status. Layered over base-line resistance was substantial upregulation of many ErbB pathway genes in response to BRaf inhibition, thus generating the vulnerability to combination with lapatinib. The transcriptional responses of ErbB pathway genes are associated with a number of transcription factors, including ETS2 and its associated cofactors that represent a convergent regulatory mechanism conferring synergistic drug susceptibility in the context of diverse mutational landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W2342067501,"Background Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) is a common cause of acute hospitalization. Currently, there is no accepted standard for identifying patients with LGIB in hospital administrative data. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a set of classification algorithms that use hospital administrative data to identify LGIB. Methods Our sample consists of patients admitted between July 1, 2001 and June 30, 2003 (derivation cohort) and July 1, 2003 and June 30, 2005 (validation cohort) to the general medicine inpatient service of the University of Chicago Hospital, a large urban academic medical center. Confirmed cases of LGIB in both cohorts were determined by reviewing the charts of those patients who had at least 1 of 36 principal or secondary International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes associated with LGIB. Classification trees were used on the data of the derivation cohort to develop a set of decision rules for identifying patients with LGIB. These rules were then applied to the validation cohort to assess their performance. Results Three classification algorithms were identified and validated: a high specificity rule with 80.1% sensitivity and 95.8% specificity, a rule that balances sensitivity and specificity (87.8% sensitivity, 90.9% specificity), and a high sensitivity rule with 100% sensitivity and 91.0% specificity. Conclusion These classification algorithms can be used in future studies to evaluate resource utilization and assess outcomes associated with LGIB without the use of chart review."
https://openalex.org/W2337776457,"Currently, there is no effective vaccine to prevent hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, partly due to our insufficient understanding of the virus glycoprotein immunology. Most neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) were identified using glycoprotein immunogens, such as recombinant E1E2, HCV pseudoparticles or cell culture derived HCV. However, the fact that in the HCV acute infection phase, only a small proportion of patients are self-resolved accompanied with the emergence of nAbs, indicates the limited immunogenicity of glycoprotein itself to induce effective antibodies against a highly evolved virus. Secondly, in previous reports, the immunogen sequence was mostly the genotype of the 1a H77 strain. Rarely, other genotypes/subtypes have been studied, although theoretically one genotype/subtype immunogen is able to induce cross-genotype neutralizing antibodies. To overcome these drawbacks and find potential novel neutralizing epitopes, 57 overlapping peptides encompassing the full-length glycoprotein E1E2 of subtype 1b were synthesized to immunize BALB/c mice, and the neutralizing reactive of the induced antisera against HCVpp genotypes 1–6 was determined. We defined a domain comprising amino acids (aa) 192–221, 232–251, 262–281 and 292–331 of E1, and 421–543, 564–583, 594–618 and 634–673 of E2, as the neutralizing regions of HCV glycoprotein. Peptides PUHI26 (aa 444–463) and PUHI45 (aa 604–618)-induced antisera displayed the most potent broad neutralizing reactive. Two monoclonal antibodies recognizing the PUHI26 and PUHI45 epitopes efficiently precluded genotype 2 viral (HCVcc JFH and J6 strains) infection, but they did not neutralize other genotypes. Our study mapped a neutralizing epitope region of HCV glycoprotein using a novel immunization strategy, and identified two monoclonal antibodies effective in preventing genotype 2 virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2188510972,"Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) are generally considered important active biogeochemical pools of total carbon and nitrogen. Many studies have documented the contributions of soil fauna to litter decomposition, but the effects of the soil fauna on labile substances (i.e., DOC and TDN) in litter during early decomposition are not completely clear. Therefore, a field litterbag experiment was carried out from 13th November 2013 to 23rd October 2014 in an alpine forest and an alpine meadow located on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Litterbags with different mesh sizes were used to provide access to or prohibit the access of the soil fauna, and the concentrations of DOC and TDN in the foliar litter were measured during the winter (the onset of freezing, deep freezing and thawing stage) and the growing season (early and late). After one year of field incubation, the concentration of DOC in the litter significantly decreased, whereas the TDN concentration in the litter increased. Similar dynamic patterns were detected under the effects of the soil fauna on both DOC and TDN in the litter between the alpine forest and the alpine meadow. The soil fauna showed greater positive effects on decreasing DOC concentration in the litter in the winter than in the growing season. In contrast, the dynamics of TND in the litter were related to seasonal changes in environmental factors, rather than the soil fauna. In addition, the soil fauna promoted a decrease in litter DOC/TDN ratio in both the alpine forest and the alpine meadow throughout the first year of decomposition, except for in the late growing season. These results suggest that the soil fauna can promote decreases in DOC and TDN concentrations in litter, contributing to early litter decomposition in these cold biomes."
https://openalex.org/W2189641950,"Assessment of non-HLA variants alongside standard HLA testing was previously shown to improve the identification of potential coeliac disease (CD) patients. We intended to identify new genetic variants associated with CD in the Polish population that would improve CD risk prediction when used alongside HLA haplotype analysis. DNA samples of 336 CD and 264 unrelated healthy controls were used to create DNA pools for a genome wide association study (GWAS). GWAS findings were validated with individual HLA tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing of 473 patients and 714 healthy controls. Association analysis using four HLA-tagging SNPs showed that, as was found in other populations, positive predicting genotypes (HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.5, HLA-DQ2.5/DQ2.2, and HLA-DQ2.5/DQ8) were found at higher frequencies in CD patients than in healthy control individuals in the Polish population. Both CD-associated SNPs discovered by GWAS were found in the CD susceptibility region, confirming the previously-determined association of the major histocompatibility (MHC) region with CD pathogenesis. The two most significant SNPs from the GWAS were rs9272346 (HLA-dependent; localized within 1 Kb of DQA1) and rs3130484 (HLA-independent; mapped to MSH5). Specificity of CD prediction using the four HLA-tagging SNPs achieved 92.9%, but sensitivity was only 45.5%. However, when a testing combination of the HLA-tagging SNPs and the MSH5 SNP was used, specificity decreased to 80%, and sensitivity increased to 74%. This study confirmed that improvement of CD risk prediction sensitivity could be achieved by including non-HLA SNPs alongside HLA SNPs in genetic testing."
https://openalex.org/W2340545484,"Huntington's disease (HD) causes progressive motor dysfunction through characteristic atrophy. Changes to neural structure begin in premanifest stages yet individuals are able to maintain a high degree of function, suggesting involvement of supportive processing during motor performance. Electroencephalography (EEG) enables the investigation of subtle impairments at the neuronal level, and possible compensatory strategies, by examining differential activation patterns. We aimed to use EEG to investigate neural motor processing (via the Readiness Potential; RP), premotor processing and sensorimotor integration (Contingent Negative Variation; CNV) during simple motor performance in HD.We assessed neural activity associated with motor preparation and processing in 20 premanifest (pre-HD), 14 symptomatic HD (symp-HD), and 17 healthy controls. Participants performed sequential tapping within two experimental paradigms (simple tapping; Go/No-Go). RP and CNV potentials were calculated separately for each group.Motor components and behavioural measures did not distinguish pre-HD from controls. Compared to controls and pre-HD, symp-HD demonstrated significantly reduced relative amplitude and latency of the RP, whereas controls and pre-HD did not differ. However, early CNV was found to significantly differ between control and pre-HD groups, due to enhanced early CNV in pre-HD.For the first time, we provide evidence of atypical activation during preparatory processing in pre-HD. The increased activation during this early stage of the disease may reflect ancillary processing in the form of recruitment of additional neural resources for adequate motor preparation, despite atrophic disruption to structure and circuitry. We propose an early adaptive compensation mechanism in pre-HD during motor preparation."
https://openalex.org/W1869387685,"Emerging fungi resistant to triazoles are a concern because of the increased use of medical triazoles and exposure to agricultural triazoles. However, little is known about the levels of triazole susceptibility in outdoor airborne fungi making it difficult to assess the risks of inhalation exposure to airborne, antifungal-resistant fungi. This study examined triazole susceptibilities of the airborne thermotolerant fungi isolated from the ambient air of the Seoul Capital Area of South Korea. We used impactor air sampling with triazole-containing nutrient agar plates as the collection substrates to screen for airborne fungal isolates based on their triazole susceptibilities. This study estimated that 0.17% of all the culturable fungi belong to the pathogenic thermotolerant taxa, among which each isolate of Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus tubingensis showed a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2 μg/mL or greater for itraconazole. Their concentration in air was 0.4 CFU/m3. Seven human pathogenic Paecilomyces variotii isolates had MICs of 32 μg/mL or greater and lower than 2 μg/mL for the agricultural fungicide tebuconazole and the medical triazole itraconazole, respectively. Though the concentration was low, our results confirm the presence of airborne fungi with high MICs for itraconazole in ambient air. Inhalation is an important exposure route because people inhale more than 10 m3 of air each day. Vigilance is preferred over monitoring for the emergence of triazole-resistant fungal pathogens in ambient outdoor air."
https://openalex.org/W2338901294,"Von Willebrand A domain Related Protein (WARP), is a recently identified extracellular matrix protein. Based upon its involvement in matrix biology and its expression in the heart, we hypothesized that WARP regulates cardiac remodeling processes in the post-infarct healing process.In the mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI), WARP expression increased in the infarcted area 3-days post-MI. In the healthy myocardium WARP localized with perlecan in the basement membrane, which was disrupted upon injury. In vitro studies showed high expression of WARP by cardiac fibroblasts, which further increases upon TGFβ stimulation. Furthermore, WARP expression correlated with aSMA and COL1 expression, markers of fibroblast to myofibroblast transition, in vivo and in vitro. Finally, WARP knockdown in vitro affected extra- and intracellular basic fibroblast growth factor production in myofibroblasts. To investigate the function for WARP in infarction healing, we performed an MI study in WARP knockout (KO) mice backcrossed more than 10 times on an Australian C57Bl/6-J background and bred in-house, and compared to wild type (WT) mice of the same C57Bl/6-J strain but of commercial European origin. WARP KO mice showed no mortality after MI, whereas 40% of the WT mice died due to cardiac rupture. However, when WARP KO mice were backcrossed on the European C57Bl/6-J background and bred heterozygous in-house, the previously seen protective effect in the WARP KO mice after MI was lost. Importantly, comparison of the cardiac response post-MI in WT mice bred heterozygous in-house versus commercially purchased WT mice revealed differences in cardiac rupture.These data demonstrate a redundant role for WARP in the wound healing process after MI but demonstrate that the continental/breeding/housing origin of mice of the same C57Bl6-J strain is critical in determining the susceptibility to cardiac rupture and stress the importance of using the correct littermate controls."
