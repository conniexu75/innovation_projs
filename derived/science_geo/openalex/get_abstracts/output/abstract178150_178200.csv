https://openalex.org/W2125733184,"Gain modulation is a prominent feature of neuronal activity recorded in behaving animals, but the mechanism by which it occurs is unknown. By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of ""background"" synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability. These results suggest that, within active cortical circuits, the overall level of synaptic input to a neuron acts as a gain control signal that modulates responsiveness to excitatory drive."

https://openalex.org/W2119832782,"The capsaicin receptor, VR1 (also known as TRPV1), is a ligand-gated ion channel expressed on nociceptive sensory neurons that responds to noxious thermal and chemical stimuli. Capsaicin responses in sensory neurons exhibit robust potentiation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In this study, we demonstrate that PKA reduces VR1 desensitization and directly phosphorylates VR1. In vitro phosphorylation, phosphopeptide mapping, and protein sequencing of VR1 cytoplasmic domains delineate several candidate PKA phosphorylation sites. Electrophysiological analysis of phosphorylation site mutants clearly pinpoints Ser116 as the residue responsible for PKA-dependent modulation of VR1. Given the significant roles of VR1 and PKA in inflammatory pain hypersensitivity, VR1 phosphorylation at Ser116 by PKA may represent an important molecular mechanism involved in the regulation of VR1 function after tissue injury."

https://openalex.org/W2052127995,"Nod2, a member of the Apaf1/Nod protein family, confers responsiveness to bacterial products and activates NF-kappaB, a transcription factor that plays a central role in innate immunity. Recently, genetic variation in Nod2 has been associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease. Here, we report that expression of Nod2 is induced upon differentiation of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells into granulocyte or monocyte/macrophages. In peripheral blood cells, the highest levels of Nod2 were observed in CD14(+) (monocytes), CD15(+) (granulocytes), and CD40(+)/CD86(+) (dendritic cells) cell populations. Notably, stimulation of myeloblastic and epithelial cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharide or TNFalpha resulted in up-regulation of Nod2. A search for consensus sites within the Nod2 promoter revealed a NF-kappaB binding element that was required for transcriptional activity in response to TNFalpha. Moreover, ectopic expression of p65 induced transactivation, whereas that of dominant-negative IkappaBalpha blocked the transcriptional activity of the Nod2 promoter. Upon stimulation with TNFalpha or lipopolysaccharide, both p50 and p65 subunits of NF-kappaB were bound to the Nod2 promoter. Thus, Nod2 expression is enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines and bacterial components via NF-kappaB, a mechanism that may contribute to the amplification of the innate immune response and susceptibility to inflammatory disease."

Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar). Recent experiments have shown that myostatin activity is detected in serum by a reporter gene assay only after activation by acid, suggesting that native myostatin circulates as a latent complex (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar). We have used a monoclonal myostatin antibody, JA16, to isolate the native myostatin complex from normal mouse and human serum. Analysis by mass spectrometry and Western blot shows that circulating myostatin is bound to at least two major proteins, the myostatin propeptide and the follistatin-related gene (FLRG). The myostatin propeptide is known to bind and inhibit myostatin in vitro (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar). Here we show that this interaction is relevant in vivo, with a majority (>70%) of myostatin in serum bound to its propeptide. Studies with recombinant V5-His-tagged FLRG protein confirm a direct interaction between mature myostatin and FLRG. Functional studies show that FLRG inhibits myostatin activity in a reporter gene assay. These experiments suggest that the myostatin propeptide and FLRG are major negative regulators of myostatin in vivo. Myostatin, also known as growth and differentiation factor 8, is a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily that negatively regulates skeletal muscle mass (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M.

Myostatin is a member of the TGF-β 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor β; CM, conditioned medium; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; FLRG, follistatin-related gene; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. family that is expressed nearly exclusively in skeletal muscle (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar). Myostatin-deficient mice show a 2–3-fold increase in skeletal muscle mass when compared with their wild-type littermates, implying that myostatin acts as a negative regulator of muscle cells in vivo (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar). This increase seems to be the result of an increase in both the number (hyperplasia) and thickness (hypertrophy) of muscle fibers (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar), explained in part by the observation that myostatin can inhibit proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts in culture (4Thomas M. Langley B. Berry C. Sharma M. Kirk S. Bass J. Kambadur R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40235-40243Google Scholar, 5Taylor W.E. Bhasin S. Artaza J. Byhower F. Azam M. Willard Jr., D.H. Kull Jr., F.C. Gonzalez-Cadavid N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: E221-E228Google Scholar). The myostatin-null mice also show decreased fat accumulation (6McPherron A.C. Lee S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 595-601Google Scholar, 7Lin J. Arnold H.B. Della-Fera M.A. Azain M.J. Hartzell D.L. Baile C.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 701-706Google Scholar) but otherwise appear normal and healthy. Like other TGF-β family members, myostatin is produced as a precursor protein that contains a signal sequence, an N-terminal propeptide domain, and a C-terminal domain that is the active ligand (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar, 8Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Bell J.R. Assoian R.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Goeddel D.V.

Proteolytic processing between the propeptide domain and the C-terminal domain releases mature myostatin (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar, 3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar, 10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar). Both unprocessed and mature active myostatin form disulfide-linked dimers (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar). In vitro, myostatin binds noncovalently to its propeptide after proteolytic processing, producing a biologically inactive complex that is prevented from binding to responsive cells (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar, 10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of myostatin propeptide leads to an increase in muscle mass in transgenic animals (10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Ratovitski T. Brady J.P. Solomon M.B. Wells K.D. Wall R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 60: 351-361Google Scholar). The regulation of myostatin by its propeptide is highly similar to TGF-β, which also binds to its propeptide (often referred to as latency-associated peptide) to form the small latent complex (12Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Google Scholar, 13Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. J. Biol.

The biological activities of other TGF-β family members, such as activin and BMP-2, are not regulated by their propeptide (18Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Google Scholar). However, a diverse array of inhibitory binding proteins performs similar roles for various members of the TGF-β superfamily (reviewed in Refs. 19Smith W.C. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 3-5Google Scholarand 20Massague J. Chen Y.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 627-644Crossref Google Scholar). For example, activin and some bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are inhibited by an interaction with the cysteine-rich glycoprotein follistatin (21Nakamura T. Takio K. Eto Y. Shibai H. Titani K. Sugino H. Science. 1990; 247: 836-838Google Scholar, 22Yamashita H. ten Dijke P. Huylebroeck D. Sampath T.K. Andries M. Smith J.C. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 217-226Google Scholar, 23Fainsod A. Deissler K. Yelin R. Marom K. Epstein M. Pillemer G. Steinbeisser H. Blum M. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 39-50Google Scholar). Interestingly, follistatin can block the activity of both BMP-11, a very close relative of myostatin, and myostatin itself (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar, 10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar, 24Gamer L.W. Wolfman N.M. Celeste A.J. Hattersley G. Hewick R. Rosen V. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 222-232Google Scholar). Like propeptide, overexpression of follistatin in the skeletal muscle of mice results in a double-muscle phenotype that is similar to myostatin-null animals (10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar). In addition, follistatin can inhibit myostatin activity in a transcription-based reporter assay (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar). Thus, follistatin is capable of binding and inhibiting myostatin. A number of proteins show homology to a 10-cysteine repeat in follistatin, including the highly similar follistatin-related gene (FLRG) (25Hayette S. Gadoux M. Martel S. Bertrand S. Tigaud I. Magaud J.P. Rimokh R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2949-2954Google Scholar, 26Tsuchida K. Arai K.Y. Kuramoto Y. Yamakawa N. Hasegawa Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40788-40796Google Scholar). Like follistatin, FLRG binds and inhibits activin and multiple BMPs in vitro (26Tsuchida K. Arai K.Y. Kuramoto Y. Yamakawa N. Hasegawa Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40788-40796Google Scholar, 27Tsuchida K. Matsuzaki T. Yamakawa N. Liu Z. Sugino H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 180: 25-31Google Scholar, 28Schneyer A. Tortoriello D. Sidis Y. Keutmann H. Matsuzaki T. Holmes W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 180: 33-38Google Scholar). Transcription of FLRG is up-regulated by activin and TGF-β signaling through SMAD proteins, initiating a negative feedback loop that controls TGF-β signaling (29Bartholin L. Maguer-Satta V. Hayette S. Martel S. Gadoux M. Corbo L. Magaud J.P. Rimokh R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2227-2235Google Scholar, 30Bartholin L. Maguer-Satta V. Hayette S. Martel S. Gadoux M. Bertrand S. Corbo L. Lamadon C. Morera A.M. Magaud J.P. Rimokh R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5409-5419Google Scholar). To date, however, FLRG has not been tied to a particular growth factor in vivo. Recently, myostatin has been shown to circulate in serum as part of a latent complex (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar). Myostatin activity, as measured by a reporter gene assay, is detected in serum only after activation by acid treatment (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar). However, the myostatin-binding proteins that impart latencyin vivo are currently unknown. To gain insight into the mechanism of myostatin regulation and to aid in the development of a therapeutic agent, we set out to define the composition of the circulating myostatin complex in serum. To accomplish this, we have isolated myostatin from normal mouse and human serum and analyzed co-purified proteins by mass spectrometry and Western blotting. This approach relies entirely on endogenous proteins at normal expression levels, allowing questions of in vivo binding specificity to be addressed. The JA16 monoclonal antibody was generated in myostatin knockout mice by immunization with recombinant mature myostatin protein purified from Chinese hamster ovary cell conditioned medium (10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar) using standard procedures (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar, 31Oi V.T. Herzenberger L.A. Mishell B.B. Shiigi S.M. Henry C. Mishell R.I. Selected Methods in Cellular Immunology. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco1980: 351-372Google Scholar). JA16 recognizes purified recombinant myostatin and the highly similar BMP-11 (24Gamer L.W. Wolfman N.M. Celeste A.J. Hattersley G. Hewick R. Rosen V. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 222-232Google Scholar) as a single band on a nonreducing Western blot but does not recognize purified activin A (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (data not shown). In addition, JA16 inhibits the activity of myostatin and BMP-11, but not activin, in a (CAGA)12 reporter gene assay (data not shown) (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar). The anti-myostatin polyclonal antibody, L8014, was produced in rabbit by immunization with the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide MLYFNGKEQIIYG, corresponding to amino acids 350–362 of human myostatin. The polyclonal anti-myostatin propeptide antibody, L8825, was produced in rabbit by immunization with His6-tagged human myostatin propeptide protein. This protein was expressed in the CM of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding amino acids 1–266 of human myostatin in frame with a C-terminal His6tag and purified by nickel-immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The FLRG monoclonal antibody was the kind gift of Kinihiro Tsuchida (26Tsuchida K. Arai K.Y. Kuramoto Y. Yamakawa N. Hasegawa Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40788-40796Google Scholar, 27Tsuchida K. Matsuzaki T. Yamakawa N. Liu Z. Sugino H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 180: 25-31Google Scholar). Anti-V5 antibodies (Western blots: catalog number V8137; immunoprecipitations: clone V5–10 agarose-conjugate, catalog number V7345) were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human myostatin and myostatin propeptide were purified from Chinese hamster ovary cell conditioned medium as described previously (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar). N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl-activated beads (4% beaded agarose, Sigma H-8635) were washed in MilliQ-H2O and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with the anti-myostatin JA16 monoclonal antibody (3–4 μg/μl in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.5) at a ratio to allow a final concentration of 10 mg of JA16/ml of resin. The remaining reactive groups were blocked by the addition of 100 μl of 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8/ml of resin for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with 100 mmMOPS, pH 7.5, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stored at 4 °C in PBS until use. The control beads were prepared identically without JA16 antibody. A total of 40 μl of packed JA16-conjugated or control beads was incubated with 15 ml of normal Balb/c mouse serum (Golden West Biologicals, Temecula, CA) or 30 ml of pooled normal human serum (ICN Biomedical, Aurora, OH) for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in cold 1% Triton X-100 with PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100 with PBS, or PBS. The proteins were eluted from the beads in three subsequent steps: 1) “Mock elution,” 100 μl of PBS was added to the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected and combined with 30 μl of 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer (Invitrogen). 2) “Peptide elution,” 100 μl of 1 μg/μl JA16 competing peptide in PBS was added to the beads and again incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was collected as before. The competing peptide (sequence: DFGLDSDEHSTESRSSRYPLTVDFEAFGWD-COOH) was identified based on its ability to prevent the binding of JA16 and myostatin using the (CAGA)12 reporter gene assay as a readout (data not shown). 3) “SDS elution,” 30 μl of 4× lithium dodecyl sulfate buffer (Invitrogen) and 100 μl of PBS were added to the beads and heated to 80 °C for 10 min before transferring the supernatant to a fresh tube. The samples were reduced with NuPage 10× reducing agent (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 80 °C and alkylated with 110 μm iodoacetamide for 30 min at 22 °C in the dark. The samples were run immediately on 10% NuPage Bis-Tris gels in an MES buffer system according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen) and silver-stained using a glutaraldehyde-free system (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar). The bands were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in a Digest Pro (Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany) or ProGest Investigator (Genomics Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI). The volume of digested samples was reduced by evaporation and supplemented with 1% acetic acid to a final volume of ∼20 μl. The samples (5–10 μl) were loaded onto a 10-cm × 75-μm inner diameter C18 reverse phase column packed in a Picofrit needle (New Objectives, Woburn, MA). MS/MS data was collected using an LCQ Deca or LCQ Deca XP (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) mass spectrometer and searched against the NCBI nonredundant data base using the Sequest program (Finnigan). All of the peptide sequences listed in this paper had Xcorr scores of >2.4 in the Sequest scoring system and were confirmed manually by examining their corresponding raw MS/MS spectra. The proteins were transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen) and blocked with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl)) at 4 °C overnight. The blots were then probed with primary antibody diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 1–3 h at room temperature, washed five times with Tris-buffered saline, probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer, and washed as before. The signals were detected by autoradiography using the West Pico Substrate (Pierce). Mouse FLRG cDNA was isolated from mouse heart cDNA (Clontech) by PCR usingPfu polymerase (forward primer, CACCATGCGTTCTGGGGCACTGTGGCCGCTG; reverse primer, CACGAAGTTCTCTTCCTCCTCTGCTGG) and cloned into the pcDNA3.1D/V5-His-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing. COS1 cells (∼60% confluent) were transferred to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and transfected with mFLRG-V5-His or the empty vector using the FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). CM was harvested 48 h post-transfection and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. For each immunoprecipitation, 400 μl of mock- or FLRG-transfected CM was combined with 1.2 μg of purified myostatin and/or propeptide protein. JA16 or anti-V5 (Sigma) antibody-conjugated beads (30 μl of packed volume) were incubated with the supplemented CM for 2 h, washed as above, and resuspended in 45 μl of 1× LDS buffer with dithiothreitol. A luciferase reporter construct, pGL3-(CAGA)12 (33Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Google Scholar), was transiently transfected into A204 cells. Multiple dilutions of CM from vector (mock)- or FLRG-transfected COS cells were incubated with 10 ng/ml myostatin for 30 min at 37 °C and assayed as described previously (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar, 3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar). To characterize the major components of the circulating myostatin complex in vivo, we first isolated myostatin and the endogenous myostatin-binding proteins from normal mouse serum by affinity purification with an agarose-conjugated anti-myostatin monoclonal antibody, JA16. Captured proteins were subjected to subsequent elution steps with PBS buffer alone (mock elution), a competing peptide, and SDS sample buffer. A reducing silver-stained gel of the proteins released in each of these elution steps is shown in Fig. 1. Two protein bands of ∼12 and 36 kDa were specifically eluted with peptide from JA16-conjugated beads (Fig. 1, lanes labeled JA16) but not from unconjugated control beads (Fig. 1, lanes labeled 0). Because the molecular mass of reduced myostatin protein is 12 kDa, we speculated that the lower band was mature myostatin. To confirm this hypothesis, we excised the band from the silver-stained gel, digested it with trypsin, and obtained MS/MS spectra of the resulting peptides by liquid chromatography/MS/MS. MS/MS spectra corresponding to six tryptic peptides found in mature myostatin were identified from this excised gel slice (TableI). A representative MS/MS spectrum is shown in Fig. 2 A. In contrast, no myostatin peptides were found in the corresponding region of the peptide-eluted sample from the negative control beads. A Western blot using L8014, a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide epitope found in the mature region of myostatin, confirmed this identification (Fig. 2 B). Although the JA16 antibody recognizes both myostatin and the highly related protein BMP-11 (Ref. 24Gamer L.W. Wolfman N.M. Celeste A.J. Hattersley G. Hewick R. Rosen V. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 222-232Google Scholar and see “Experimental Procedures”), extensive mass spectrometric analysis of the JA16-isolated samples revealed no evidence of BMP-11-derived peptides, suggesting that BMP-11 does not contaminate the JA16 serum immunoprecipitates. Furthermore, we did not detect peptides from any other TGF-β family member in these samples, confirming the selective purification of myostatin in these experiments.Table IPeptides identified in JA16 immunoprecipitates from mouse and human serumSequencezXcorrMouse serumMyostatin (mature)(K)ANYCSGECEFVFLQK3+4.63(K)MSPINMLYFNGK2+3.81(R)DFGLDCDEHSTESR2+3.47(K)ANYCSGECEFVFLQK2+3.31(K)M*SPINMLYFNGKaM*, oxidized methionine.3+2.95(R)YPLTVDFEAFGWDWIIAPK2+2.86(K)M*SPINM*LYFNGK2+2.51(R)GSAGPCCTPTK2+2.43Myostatin (propeptide)(K)LDM*SPGTGIWQSIDVK2+3.82(K)ALDENGHDLAVTFPGPGEDGLNPFLEVK3+3.17(K)LDMSPGTGIWQSIDVK2+2.98(R)ELIDQYDVQR2+2.97(K)TPTTVFVQILR2+2.91(K)AQLWIYLRPVK2+2.77(K)EGLCNACAWR2+2.75FLRG(R)PQSCLVDQTGSAHCVVCR3+3.34(K)DSCDGVECGPGK2+2.99(K)SCAQVVCPR2+2.59Human serumMyostatin (mature)(K)ANYCSGECEFVFLQK2+4.21(R)DFGLDCDEHSTESR3+2.08Myostatin (propeptide)(K)ALDENGHDLAVTFPGPGEDGLNPFLEVK3+3.71(R)ELIDQYDVQR2+3.01FLRG(R)PQSCVVDQTGSAHCVVCR3+3.37(R)CECAPDCSGLPAR2+3.21(R)LQVCGSDGATYR2+3.06a M*, oxidized methionine.

Both N-terminal fragment ions (b ions) and C-terminal fragment ions (y ions) are visible. Notably, the most intense y fragment ions result from fragmentation before the proline residue, a common characteristic of proline containing peptides.B, a Western blot probed with a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the mature region of myostatin confirms the presence of myostatin in the affinity-purified samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Once we had confirmed that our affinity purification technique successfully isolated native myostatin from serum, we proceeded to identify myostatin-binding proteins. Mass spectrometric analysis of the 36-kDa silver-stained band identified two co-migrating proteins that are specific to the JA16 immunopurified sample: myostatin propeptide and FLRG. The peptides identified from each of these proteins are shown in Table I. High quality MS/MS spectra were found for six unique peptides from propeptide and three unique peptides from FLRG (Table I and Fig. 3, Aand C). Furthermore, the presence of both of these proteins was confirmed by Western blotting with antibodies specific to propeptide (L8825) and FLRG, respectively (Fig. 3, B andD). Thus, circulating myostatin is bound to its propeptide and FLRG in vivo. Follistatin itself is present in serum and has been shown to interact with myostatin in vitro and increase muscle mass when overexpressed in vivo (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P.

Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 431-443Google Scholar, 35Schneyer A.L. O'Neil D.A. Crowley Jr., W.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 1320-1324Google Scholar). In addition, the JA16 antibody can recognize and immunoprecipitate a complex between recombinant purified myostatin and follistatin.2 The entire gel region spanning from 6 to 100 kDa was excised into 13 bands, and each band was digested with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry as before. We did not detect follistatin in the JA16-purified samples from serum in any of the four repetitions of this experiment. In contrast, FLRG-derived peptides were identified in every repetition. This finding suggests that in normal serum, myostatin activity is regulated by FLRG rather than follistatin. In an effort to determine the amount of myostatin in serum that is bound to its propeptide, we used purified recombinant myostatin and propeptide protein (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar) as standards to quantitate Western blots. Myostatin was purified from mouse serum using JA16-conjugated beads, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS in a single step. A portion of the eluted proteins was subjected to Western blotting alongside known amounts of purified myostatin (Fig.4 A) or propeptide (Fig.4 B). The blots then were probed with anti-myostatin L8014 (Fig. 4 A) or anti-propeptide L8825 (Fig. 4 B) polyclonal antibodies. Although it is difficult to determine the precise amount of protein in the JA16 immunoprecipitate by this method, the propeptide band contains ∼2–3-fold more protein mass than mature myostatin. Because the molecular mass of propeptide (36 kDa) is three times that of mature myostatin (12 kDa), we estimate that more than 70% of mature myostatin is bound to propeptide in these samples. This finding implies that the majority of circulating myostatin is bound to propeptide and suggests that propeptide may play an important role in the regulation of myostatin activity in vivo. To confirm the interaction between FLRG and myostatin, the mouse FLRG coding sequence (26Tsuchida K. Arai K.Y. Kuramoto Y. Yamakawa N. Hasegawa Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40788-40796Google Scholar) was cloned by PCR from first strand heart cDNA. A mammalian expression vector encoding mouse FLRG with a C-terminal V5-His tag was transiently transfected into COS1 cells. Secreted FLRG-V5-His protein was detected in the conditioned medium by Western blot using an anti-V5 antibody (data not shown). This conditioned medium was supplemented with purified mature myostatin and/or propeptide protein, and the presence of the FLRG-myostatin complex was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with both JA16 and a monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Fig. 5). We found that FLRG bound directly to mature myostatin but not to propeptide. However, propeptide is detected in anti-V5 (anti-FLRG) immunoprecipitates when myostatin is present, suggesting that myostatin can bind simultaneously to both FLRG and propeptide. Because native myostatin is a homodimer (1McPherron A.C. Lawler A.M. Lee S.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 83-90Google Scholar), it is possible that one myostatin molecule in a given dimer is bound to FLRG, whereas the other molecule is bound to propeptide. Thus, it remains unclear whether a single myostatin molecule can bind simultaneously to both FLRG and propeptide. To determine the functional role of FLRG, we looked at the ability of conditioned medium from FLRG-V5-His transfected COS1 cells to modulate myostatin-induced activation of a (CAGA)12 reporter construct in A204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells. This reporter gene assay has been shown to reflect myostatin activity (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar, 3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar). We found that FLRG in conditioned medium potently inhibited myostatin activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.6). In contrast, COS1 conditioned medium from mock transfected cells had no effect. Thus, FLRG inhibits myostatin activity. Acid activation of mouse serum reveals myostatin activity in a reporter gene assay, providing an estimate of the myostatin concentration at 80 ng/ml (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar). In contrast, identically treated human serum does not have detectable myostatin activity in this assay. 2M. V. Davies, unpublished observations. This finding suggests that the concentration of myostatin in human serum is considerably lower than that found in mouse serum. Because myostatin has potential as a therapeutic target, we were interested in determining the composition of the circulating myostatin complex in humans. This knowledge would determine the validity of the mouse model and in myostatin studies. Thus, we repeated the JA16-based affinity purification of myostatin from human serum. Because of the low level of myostatin, bands corresponding to mature myostatin and myostatin propeptide/FLRG were not detected by silver stain (Fig.7 A). However, mass spectrometric analysis of the 12-kDa region of the gel identified peptides derived from myostatin (Table I). In addition, Western blotting with the polyclonal myostatin antibody L8014 revealed the presence of mature myostatin in the JA16-purified samples (Fig.7 B). Unfortunately, the antibodies against propeptide and FLRG were not sufficiently sensitive to detect these proteins in JA16 immunoprecipitations from human serum by Western blot. Thus, we took advantage of the high sensitivity of mass spectrometry to identify proteins that co-purified with mature myostatin. The 36-kDa gel region was excised from the lanes containing the peptide-eluted product from both negative control and JA16-conjugated beads. These gel slices were analyzed by mass spectrometry as before. As with the mouse serum, both propeptide and FLRG were identified in this region of the gel. The peptides found from each of these proteins are listed in Table I. Because of the high degree of conservation between human and mouse myostatin (36McPherron A.C. Lee S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12457-12461Google Scholar), the peptides identified in human serum from the propeptide were identical to ones that had been detected in mouse. In FLRG, peptides unique to the human FLRG sequence were identified. No peptides corresponding to these proteins were found in the negative control sample. This result suggests that the in vivomyostatin complex is conserved between mouse and human, validating the mouse as a model for human disease studies involving myostatin. In this paper, we show that the majority of endogenous myostatin circulates as a latent complex with propeptide and FLRG. Both of these proteins act independently as negative regulators, most likely by preventing the association of myostatin with its receptor (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar, 10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar). It remains unclear why two different inhibitory proteins bind to myostatin. However, based on similarities to TGF-β and activin, a model of the regulation of myostatin activity by its propeptide and FLRG can be proposed. TGF-β superfamily members are produced as a single polypeptide chain that undergoes proteolytic cleavage to form two polypeptide chains, the N-terminal propeptide domain and the C-terminal mature growth factor (8Derynck R. Jarrett J.A. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Bell J.R. Assoian R.K. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1985; 316: 701-705Google Scholar). In the case of TGF-β and myostatin, the propeptide and mature domains remain noncovalently associated after cleavage, resulting in the secretion of a latent complex (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar, 10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar, 12Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Google Scholar, 13Wakefield L.M. Smith D.M. Flanders K.C. Sporn M.B. J.

This mode of processing and secretion is consistent with our finding that more than 70% of myostatin in serum is bound to its propeptide. At the site of TGF-β signaling, it is thought that serine proteases such as plasmin and cathepsin D cleave the propeptide moiety, thus allowing the release of active TGF-β (37Lyons R.M. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1659-1665Google Scholar, 38Lyons R.M. Gentry L.E. Purchio A.F. Moses H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1361-1367Google Scholar). Because propeptide is irreversibly removed during the activation process, it is no longer possible to turn off active TGF-β using this protein. Interestingly, transcription of FLRG has been shown to be up-regulated upon signaling by both TGF-β and activin (29Bartholin L. Maguer-Satta V. Hayette S. Martel S. Gadoux M. Corbo L. Magaud J.P. Rimokh R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2227-2235Google Scholar, 30Bartholin L. Maguer-Satta V. Hayette S. Martel S. Gadoux M. Bertrand S. Corbo L. Lamadon C. Morera A.M. Magaud J.P. Rimokh R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5409-5419Google Scholar). This occurs through binding of activated Smad proteins to a Smad-binding element in the FLRG promoter and results in the increased production of secreted FLRG and the eventual inhibition of activin signaling (29Bartholin L. Maguer-Satta V. Hayette S. Martel S. Gadoux M. Corbo L. Magaud J.P. Rimokh R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2227-2235Google Scholar). This negative feedback loop almost certainly occurs with myostatin signaling, because activin, TGF-β, and myostatin all signal through Smad2 and Smad3 proteins (39Hu P.P. Datto M.B. Wang X.F. Endocr. Rev. 1998; 19: 349-363Google Scholar).2 Here we show that FLRG binds to myostatin in vivo and inhibits its activity. We propose that this FLRG binding likely occurs after myostatin has bound to its receptor and initiated signaling. In this model, propeptide binds to myostatin as it is secreted, providing a pool of latent growth factor. At the site of action, the propeptide is removed by proteolysis. The resulting active myostatin initiates signaling, eventually triggering a negative feedback loop that leads to secretion of FLRG and the inhibition of active myostatin. The apparent absence of follistatin in circulating myostatin complexes is intriguing. It is known that follistatin is present in serum and can bind to myostatin (2Zimmers T.A. Davies M.V. Koniaris L.G. Haynes P. Esquela A.F. Tomkinson K.N. McPherron A.C. Wolfman N.M. Lee S.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1486-1488Google Scholar, 10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar, 34Krummen L.A. Woodruff T.K. DeGuzman G. Cox E.T. Baly D.L. Mann E. Garg S. Wong W.L. Cossum P. Mather J.P. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 431-443Google Scholar, 35Schneyer A.L. O'Neil D.A. Crowley Jr., W.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 1320-1324Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic mice overexpressing follistatin under a skeletal muscle-specific promoter show a double muscle phenotype consistent with the negative regulation of myostatin (10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar). Lastly, the JA16 antibody is capable of immunoprecipitating a myostatin-follistatin complex (data not shown). Thus, it was surprising that we did not find any evidence of follistatin bound to myostatin in vivo after extensive mass spectrometric analysis of the entire gel lane from multiple JA16 immunoprecipitations. Although we cannot eliminate the possibility that follistatin binds to myostatin in serum at a level that is below our ability to detect, FLRG has been identified in every JA16 immunoprecipitation from serum that we have analyzed by mass spectrometry, and follistatin has always been absent. A human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, up-regulates both follistatin and FLRG in response to activin (29Bartholin L. Maguer-Satta V. Hayette S. Martel S. Gadoux M. Corbo L. Magaud J.P. Rimokh R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2227-2235Google Scholar). One way to explain the absence of follistatin-bound myostatin in serum would be if myostatin-responsive cells such as muscle produce only FLRG, not follistatin, in response to myostatin signaling. In this case, free myostatin would bind preferentially to FLRG, because the local concentration of FLRG would be higher than follistatin. Because both follistatin and FLRG bind to activin and BMPs in an essentially irreversible manner (40Schneyer A.L. Rzucidlo D.A. Sluss P.M. Crowley Jr., W.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 667-674Google Scholar), FLRG would remain bound to myostatin despite the presence of follistatin in serum. In contrast, when follistatin is overexpressed in skeletal muscle using transgenic technology (10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar), follistatin is present in high concentrations at the site of myostatin action and thus can bind myostatin as soon as it becomes activated, explaining the increased muscle mass in these animals. It is also possible that follistatin does inhibit myostatin in vivo but that this interaction is limited to the muscle tissue. One of the major differences between follistatin and FLRG is that follistatin contains a heparin-binding sequence that FLRG does not (26Tsuchida K. Arai K.Y. Kuramoto Y. Yamakawa N. Hasegawa Y. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40788-40796Google Scholar,41Ueno N. Ling N. Ying S.Y. Esch F. Shimasaki S. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8282-8286Google Scholar). Because the heparin-binding sequence mediates an interaction between follistatin and cell surface proteoglycans (42Nakamura T. Sugino K. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19432-19437Google Scholar, 43Sugino K. Kurosawa N. Nakamura T. Takio K. Shimasaki S. Ling N. Titani K. Sugino H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15579-15587Google Scholar), follistatin produced in muscle may remain associated with the extracellular matrix of the cells that secrete it. Thus, myostatin that is bound to follistatin may be sequestered in the muscle and therefore absent in serum. In this paper, we have isolated myostatin from normal serum and analyzed the composition of the latent complex. In both mouse and human serum, myostatin circulates as a latent complex with the myostatin propeptide and FLRG. Previous work has shown that the myostatin-propeptide complex is inactive and incapable of binding to its receptor (3Thies R.S. Chen T. Davies M.V. Tomkinson K.N. Pearson A.A. Shakey Q.A. Wolfman N.M. Growth Factors. 2001; 18: 251-259Google Scholar, 10Lee S.J. McPherron A.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9306-9311Google Scholar, 11Yang J. Ratovitski T. Brady J.P. Solomon M.B. Wells K.D. Wall R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 60: 351-361Google Scholar). Here we show that the majority of myostatin in serum is bound to its propeptide, demonstrating that this interaction is relevant in vivo. We have also shown that myostatin in serum binds to FLRG, a follistatin domain containing protein that, like propeptide, negatively regulates myostatin activity. Thus, myostatin is the first physiologically relevant target of FLRG regulation to be identified.

https://openalex.org/W2008069933,One of the most ubiquitous findings in functional neuroimaging research is activation of left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPC) during tasks requiring controlled semantic retrieval. Here we show that LIPC participates in the controlled retrieval of nonsemantic representations as well as semantic representations. Results also demonstrate that LIPC coactivates with dissociable posterior regions depending on the information retrieved: activating with left temporal cortex during the controlled retrieval of semantics and with left posterior frontal and parietal cortex during the controlled retrieval of phonology. Correlation of performance to LIPC activation suggests a processing role associated with mapping relatively ambiguous stimulus-to-representation relationships during both semantic and phonological tasks. These findings suggest that LIPC participates in controlled processing across multiple information domains collaborating with dissociable posterior regions depending upon the kind of information retrieved.

We have identified some of the key intermediates responsible for induction of mitogenesis and wound recovery. Treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells with oligosaccharides of hyaluronan (o-HA) resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation and plasma membrane translocation of phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1). Cytoplasmic loading with inhibitory antibodies to PLCgamma1, Gbeta, and Galpha(i/o/t/z) inhibited activation of extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). Treatment with the Galpha(i/o) inhibitor, pertussis toxin, reduced o-HA-induced PLCgamma1 tyrosine phosphorylation, protein kinase C (PKC) alpha and beta1/2 membrane translocation, ERK1/2 activation, mitogenesis, and wound recovery, suggesting a mechanism for o-HA-induced angiogenesis through G-proteins, PLCgamma1, and PKC. In particular, we demonstrated a possible role for PKCalpha in mitogenesis and PKCbeta1/2 in wound recovery. Using antisense oligonucleotides and the Ras farnesylation inhibitor FTI-277, we showed that o-HA-induced bovine aortic endothelial cell proliferation, wound recovery, and ERK1/2 activation were also partially dependent on Ras activation, and that o-HA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the adapter protein Shc, as well as its association with Sos1. Binding of Src to Shc was required for its activation and for Ras-dependent activation of ERK1/2, cell proliferation, and wound recovery. Neither Src nor Ras activation was inhibited by pertussis toxin, suggesting that their activation was independent of heterotrimeric G-proteins. However, the specific Src kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibited Gbeta subunit co-precipitation with PLCgamma1, suggesting a possible role for Src in activation of PLCgamma1 and interaction between two distinct o-HA-induced signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2032989272,"Elevation of cAMP can overcome myelin inhibitors to encourage regeneration of the CNS. We show that a consequence of elevated cAMP is the synthesis of polyamines, resulting from an up-regulation of Arginase I, a key enzyme in their synthesis. Inhibiting polyamine synthesis blocks the cAMP effect on regeneration. Either over-expression of Arginase I or exogenous polyamines can overcome inhibition by MAG and by myelin in general. While MAG/myelin support the growth of young DRG neurons, they become inhibitory as DRGs mature. Endogenous Arginase I levels are high in young DRGs but drop spontaneously at an age that coincides with the switch from promotion to inhibition by MAG/myelin. Over-expressing Arginase I in maturing DRGs blocks that switch. Arginase I and polyamines are more specific targets than cAMP for intervention to encourage regeneration after CNS injury."

NCSCs isolated by flow-cytometry from E14 sciatic nerve and gut exhibited heritable, cell-intrinsic differences in their responsiveness to lineage determination factors. Gut NCSCs were more responsive to neurogenic factors, while sciatic nerve NCSCs were more responsive to gliogenic factors. Upon transplantation of uncultured NCSCs into developing peripheral nerves in vivo, sciatic nerve NCSCs gave rise only to glia, while gut NCSCs gave rise primarily to neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2071315178,"The mammalian auditory sensory epithelium, the organ of Corti, comprises the hair cells and supporting cells that are pivotal for hearing function. The origin and development of their precursors are poorly understood. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in mouse fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1) cause a dose-dependent disruption of the organ of Corti. Full inactivation of Fgfr1 in the inner ear epithelium by Foxg1-Cre-mediated deletion leads to an 85% reduction in the number of auditory hair cells. The primary cause appears to be reduced precursor cell proliferation in the early cochlear duct. Thus, during development, FGFR1 is required for the generation of the precursor pool, which gives rise to the auditory sensory epithelium. Our data also suggest that FGFR1 might have a distinct later role in intercellular signaling within the differentiating auditory sensory epithelium."

An area in the caudal part of the intraparietal sulcus (area cIPS) also showed priming, but only with identical images of objects. This dorsal-stream area treated rotated images as new objects.

Over days there was a shift in color perception, as measured by the wavelength of unique yellow, which persisted 1-2 weeks after the filters were discontinued. Moreover, color-deficient adults were shown to have altered weightings of inputs to chromatic channels, demonstrating a large neural adjustment to their inherited photopigment defect. Thus, a neural normalization mechanism for color perception, determined by visual experience, operates to compensate for large genetic differences in retinal architecture and for changes in chromatic environment."

Both processes are here recapitulated by MOR23 and M71 OR minigenes, introduced into mice. Minigenes of 9 kb and as short as 2.2 kb are selectively expressed by neurons that do not coexpress the endogenous gene but coproject their axons to the same glomeruli. Deletion of a 395 bp upstream region in the MOR23 minigene abolishes expression. In this region we recognize sequence motifs conserved in many OR genes. Transgenic lines expressing the OR in ectopic epithelial zones form ectopic glomeruli, which also receive input from OSNs expressing the cognate endogenous receptor. This suggests a recruitment through homotypic interactions between OSNs expressing the same OR."

To determine the role of the putative kinase sites in the trafficking and hormonal regulation of human AQP2, three putative casein kinase II (Ser-148, Ser-229, Thr-244), one PKC (Ser-231), and one protein kinase A (Ser-256) site were altered to mimic a constitutively non-phosphorylated/phosphorylated state and were expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Except for Ser-256 mutants, seven correctly folded AQP2 kinase mutants trafficked as wild-type AQP2 to the apical membrane via forskolin-sensitive intracellular vesicles. With or without forskolin, AQP2-Ser-256A was localized in intracellular vesicles, whereas AQP2-S256D was localized in the apical membrane. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced PKC activation following forskolin treatment resulted in vesicular distribution of all AQP2 kinase mutants, while all were still phosphorylated at Ser-256. Our data indicate that in collecting duct cells, AQP2 trafficking to vasopressin-sensitive vesicles is phosphorylation-independent, that phosphorylation of Ser-256 is necessary and sufficient for expression of AQP2 in the apical membrane, and that PMA-induced PKC-mediated endocytosis of AQP2 is independent of the AQP2 phosphorylation state.

To fine-tune this balance, principal cells of the renal collecting duct reabsorb water from pro-urine, which is under control of the anti-diuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP).1 Upon hypovolemia or hypernatremia, pituitary-derived AVP binds its V2 receptor in the basolateral membrane of these cells and initiates an intracellular cAMP signaling cascade that causes a transient increase in cytosolic calcium (1Chou C.L. Yip K.P. Michea L. Kador K. Ferraris J.D. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36839-36846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which in turn phosphorylates homotetrameric aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels and possibly other proteins. Consequently, AQP2-containing vesicles fuse with the apical membrane, rendering the principal cells water-permeable (2Deen P.M.T. Knoers N.V.A.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 3Nielsen S. Frokiaer J. Knepper M.A. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1998; 7: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Driven by an osmotic gradient, water will then enter these cells via AQP2 and will exit the cells via AQP3 and AQP4, located in the basolateral membrane, a process in which urine is concentrated. By using antibodies that recognize Ser-256-phosphorylated AQP2 (p-AQP2), Nishimoto et al. (4Nishimoto G. Zelenina M., Li, D. Yasui M. Aperia A. Nielsen S. Nairn A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F254-F259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were able to show thatin vivo AVP-induced redistribution of AQP2 from vesicles to the apical membrane coincides with phosphorylation of Ser-256. By using similar antibodies, Christensen et al. (5Christensen B.M. Zelenina M. Aperia A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F29-F42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that p-AQP2 is, besides the apical membrane, also present in intracellular vesicles of principal cells and that the intracellular distribution of AQP2 is regulated via V2 receptors by altering the phosphorylation state of Ser-256 in AQP2. In a later study, water permeability analyses of Xenopus oocytes expressing different ratios of AQP2-S256A and AQP2-S256D (which mimic non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated AQP2, respectively) indicated that three or more monomers in an AQP2 tetramer need to be phosphorylated at Ser-256 for a steady state plasma membrane localization of AQP2 (6Kamsteeg E.J. Heijnen I. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), which provided an explanation for the detection of p-AQP2 in intracellular vesicles. The retention of AQP2-S256A in intracellular vesicles of LLC-PK1 cells upon treatment with forskolin, while wt-AQP2 in such cells migrated to the basolateral membrane, revealed that phosphorylation of Ser-256 in AQP2 is essential for re-distribution to the basolateral membrane (7Katsura T. Gustafson C.E. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 41: F816-F822Google Scholar, 8Fushimi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14800-14804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). At present, however, it is unclear whether phosphorylation of Ser-256 is essential and/or sufficient for AQP2 translocation to the apical membrane. Retrieval of AQP2 from the apical membrane of principal cells, which results in a reduction in water reabsorption and urine concentrating ability, is mediated by removal of AVP and by several hormones that activate the protein kinase C (PKC) pathway. Some of these hormones (ATP/UTP, endothelin) are thought to activate PKCs that block the AVP-triggered increase in cAMP (9Kishore B.K. Chou C.L. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 38: F863-F869Google Scholar, 10Nadler S.P. Zimpelmann J.A. Hebert R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, other hormones, such as epidermal growth factor, prostaglandin E2, and agonists of muscarinic receptors did not interfere with the AVP-mediated cAMP increase and, therefore, were suggested to act on the AQP2 shuttling process only (11Nadler S.P. Zimpelmann J.A. Hebert R.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F229-F235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Maeda Y. Terada Y. Nonoguchi H. Knepper M.A. Am. J.

Because the inhibitory effect of these latter hormones was absent upon co-treatment with PKC inhibitors (10Nadler S.P. Zimpelmann J.A. Hebert R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Maeda Y. Terada Y. Nonoguchi H. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: F319-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is a specific activator of several PKCs (14Vaaraniemi J. Palovuori R. Lehto V.P. Eskelinen S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), also inhibits AVP-induced water permeability (13Han J.S. Maeda Y. Ecelbarger C. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F139-F146PubMed Google Scholar), these hormones were suggested to activate PKC isotypes that interfere with shuttling of AQP2 to the apical membrane. For some proteins, it has been shown that PKCs exert their effect through activation of casein kinase II (CKII) proteins (15Bren G.D. Pennington K.N. Paya C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1245-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Sanghera J.S. Charlton L.A. Paddon H.B. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 829-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At present, however, it is unknown whether the AVP-counteracting PKCs mediate the re-distribution of AQP2 to intracellular vesicles via direct or indirect (e.g. through CKII) (de-)phosphorylation of AQP2 or whether it occurs independent of the AQP2 phosphorylation state. Besides modulating the steady state localization of a protein in response to hormonal stimulation, the transit of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to their final subcellular location can also be a phosphorylation-dependent process. For example, phosphorylation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor NR1 and caveolin-1 enables these proteins to exit the ER (17Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Schlegel A. Arvan P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4398-4408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas translocation of numerous proteins from the trans-Golgi network to intracellular compartments or the plasma membrane and vice versa is also regulated by phosphorylation events (19Jones B.G. Thomas L. Molloy S.S. Thulin C.D. Fry M.D. Walsh K.A. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5869-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20van Tiel C.M. Westerman J. Paasman M.A. Hoebens M.M. Wirtz K.W. Snoek G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22447-22452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since such phosphorylation events can be transient, lasting only minutes (21Fujioka T. Ui M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Straussman R. Even L. Ravid S. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3047-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the importance of a phosphorylation event can be easily missed, which will not occur when such a site is constitutively phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated. Several studies have shown that the negative charge introduced by phosphorylation can often be mimicked by changing a phosphorylation site Ser/Thr residue for a Glu or Asp (23Maciejewski P.M. Peterson F.C. Anderson P.J. Brooks C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27661-27665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 24Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of such a site can be prevented by changing it to an Ala residue (25Estrera V.T. Chen D.T. Luo W. Hixson D.C. Lin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15547-15553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Zhang W.Y. Gaynor P.M. Kruth H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31700-31706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Human AQP2 contains three phosphorylation consensus sequences for CKII (Ser-148, Ser-229, and Thr-244), one for PKC (Ser-231), and one for PKA (Ser-256), and in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, the routing to intracellular storage vesicles and the AVP-regulated shuttling of heterologously expressed human AQP2 to and from the apical membrane is similar to those processes in principal renal cells (27Deen P.M.T. Rijss J.P.L. Mulders S.M. Errington R.J. van Baal J. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to address the role of the putative phosphorylation sites in human AQP2 in these processes, MDCK cell lines that stably expressed AQP2 proteins, in which each putative kinase site was changed into an Ala or Glu/Asp residue, were generated and analyzed in detail. For expression of AQP2-S256A and AQP2-S256D in MDCK cells, the encoding cDNA fragments were cut from pT7Ts-AQP2-S256A and pT7Ts-AQP2-S256D constructs (6Kamsteeg E.J. Heijnen I. van Os C.H.

Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To generate pCB6 constructs for expression of the other kinase site mutants, three point PCRs were performed. For this, sense primers for AQP2-S148A (5′-CATCTTCGCCGCCACCGATGA-3′), S148D (5′-GCATCTTCGCCGACACCGATGAGC-3′), S229A (5′-CCAGCCAAGGCCCTGTCGGA-3′), S229D (5′-CCGCCAGCCAAGGATCTGTCGGAG-3′), S231A (5′-AAGAGCCTGGCGGAGCGCCT-3′), S231D (5′-CAAGAGCCTGGATGAGCGCCTGG-3′), T244A (5′-GAGCCGGACGCCGATTGGGA-3′), and T244E (5′-GGAGCCGGACGAGGATTGGGAGG-3′) or their corresponding antisense primers were used in combination with a pT7Ts reverse primer (5′-GCTTAGAGACTCCATTCGGG-3′) or T7 primer, respectively, in a standard PCR with pT7Ts-AQP2 (28Mulders S.M. Bichet D.G. Rijss J.P.L. Kamsteeg E.J. Arthus M.F. Lonergan M. Fujiwara M. Morgan K. Leijendekker R. van der Sluijs P. van Os C.H. Deen P.M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) as a template. The resulting fragments were isolated, and a second PCR, using both fragments as template, combined with the pT7Ts reverse and T7 primer was performed to generate the full-length mutated AQP2 fragment. Subsequently, these fragments were digested with BglII and SpeI and ligated into theBglII and XbaI sites of pCB6. Introduction of only the desired mutations was confirmed using DNA sequence analysis. MDCK type I cells (27Deen P.M.T. Rijss J.P.L. Mulders S.M. Errington R.J. van Baal J. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1997; 8: 1493-1501Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection of MDCK cells, 25 μg of purified circular DNA was transfected using the calcium-phosphate precipitation technique as described in detail previously (30Graham F.L. Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar, 31Deen P.M.T. Nielsen S. Bindels R.J.M. van Os C.H. Pfluegers Arch. 1997; 433: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Twenty four hours after transfection the cells were trypsinized, divided over 6 Petri dishes, and expanded in medium containing 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Ten to fourteen days after transfection, individual clones were selected and grown on selection drug for 4 weeks. Protein samples were denatured by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in 1× Laemmli buffer, subjected to electrophoresis on a 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fluka Biochimica, Switzerland), and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described previously (32Deen P.M.T. Croes H. van Aubel R.A. Ginsel L.A. van Os C.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2291-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dried milk in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, 73 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.6) and subsequently incubated with 1:3000 diluted affinity-purified rabbit AQP2 antibodies (raised against the 15 COOH-terminal amino acids of rat AQP2 (33Deen P.M.T. van Aubel R.A. van Lieburg A.F. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 836-841PubMed Google Scholar)) or rabbit antibodies directed against Ser-256-phosphorylated AQP2 (AN83-2) ((4), diluted in TBS-T with 1% nonfat dried milk. As secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 in TBS-T, Sigma) were used. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Cells seeded at 1.5 × 10−5 cells/cm2 were grown on 1.13-cm2 polycarbonate filters (Corning Costar Europe, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands) for 2 days. After subsequent overnight treatment with 5 × 10−5m indomethacin, cells were incubated for 45 min with DMEM with or without 5 × 10−5m forskolin. To activate PKCs following forskolin treatment, filters were subsequently incubated in DMEM with forskolin and 10−7m PMA (Sigma) for 45 min. In these cases, cells incubated for 90 min with indomethacin with or without forskolin were taken as controls. After these incubations cells were washed twice with PBS-CM (PBS with 0.1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2) and fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Following quenching of aldehyde groups with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 15 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% SDS in PBS for 5 min, incubated with goat serum dilution buffer (GSDB; 16% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100, 0.3m NaCl in PBS) for 30 min to block nonspecific antibody binding, and incubated overnight with a mixture of a 1:100 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit anti-AQP2 antibody (33Deen P.M.T. van Aubel R.A. van Lieburg A.F. van Os C.H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 836-841PubMed Google Scholar) in GSDB. After washing twice with permeabilization buffer (0.3% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA in PBS), filters were incubated with 1:100 diluted goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in GSDB for 45 min. Next, filters were rinsed twice with permeabilization buffer and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). Images were obtained with a Bio-Rad confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) using a 60× oil-immersion objective. MDCK cells were seeded at 1.5 × 105 cells/cm2 on 9.6-cm2 polycarbonate filters (Corning Costar Europe, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands), grown, and treated as described above. Next, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS-CM and incubated twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 500 μl of 1.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (Pierce) in biotinylation buffer (10 mmtriethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, and 125 mm NaCl, pH 8.9) applied to the apical surface of the cells. Subsequently, the filters were incubated for 5 min with quenching solution (50 mm NH4Cl in PBS-CM) at 4 °C and rinsed twice with cold PBS-CM. After the filters were cut from their plastic support, 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the cells were scraped and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. After centrifugation for 5 min, the supernatant was added to streptavidin beads (30 μl/sample), which had been pre-washed twice with high salt buffer (500 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100) and twice with lysis buffer. After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, the beads were centrifuged for 5 min and washed twice with high salt buffer, twice with lysis buffer, and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Finally, the beads were sucked dry with a 30-gauge needle, resuspended in 30 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer, and denatured for 30 min at 37 °C. Transfected MDCK cells were seeded as described for side-specific biotinylation. Two days after seeding, cells were treated overnight with medium containing indomethacin (Sigma). Next, filters were cut from their support and washed once with serum/phosphate-free DMEM (ICN Biomedicals, The Netherlands, Europe). Subsequently, the medium was replaced by serum/phosphate-free DMEM (1 ml/filter) containing indomethacin and 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences). After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C the medium was replaced by medium containing indomethacin with or without forskolin and 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h. Subsequently, for PKC induction, cells treated with forskolin were incubated with medium containing indomethacin, forskolin, PMA, and 20 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for an additional hour. Next, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold wash buffer (PBS + 2 mm EDTA) containing 10 mm NaF and 0.5 mm Na3VO4 to inhibit dephosphorylation. Subsequently, cells were scraped and homogenized in 750 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P40) containing 10 mm NaF and 0.5 mm Na3VO4. The lysates were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation. 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Kem-En-Tec A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) per sample were washed twice in lysis buffer + 1% BSA. Per sample, 4 μl of rabbit 7 anti-AQP2 antibodies was added to 400 μl of lysis buffer and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Before use, the antibody-coupled protein A beads were washed twice in ice-cold lysis buffer. The washed antibody-bound beads were incubated with cleared lysate for 16 h, washed four times with lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors, sucked dry with a 30-gauge needle, and resuspended in 30 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer. [32P]Orthophosphate-labeled samples were split into two equal portions of which one was immunoblotted for AQP2, and the second was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to film for ∼3 days using two amplifying screens at −80 °C. Relative quantification of the signals was performed with a PhosphorImager. To determine the role of phosphorylation of Ser-148, Ser-229, Ser-231, Thr-244, and Ser-256 in the targeting and regulation of shuttling of AQP2, all these sites were independently mutated into alanines to mimic a non-phosphorylated state or into glutamic (Thr-244) or aspartic acids (others) to mimic a phosphorylated state (Fig. 1). Eucaryotic expression constructs coding for these proteins were stably transfected into MDCK cells. Immunoblot analysis of the selected clones revealed that, except for AQP2-S148D, all AQP2 mutants were mainly expressed as unglycosylated 29-kDa proteins, which is also the most prominent band for wt-AQP2 in MDCK cells (Fig. 4). AQP2-S148D, however, was mainly expressed as 29- and 32-kDa AQP2 proteins (Fig.2), which has been shown to be indicative for AQP2 proteins retained in the ER (34Marr N. Bichet D.G. Lonergan M. Arthus M.F. Jeck N. Seyberth H.W. Rosenthal W. van Os C.H. Oksche A. Deen P.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, this mutant was left out of further analyses.Figure 4Apical cell surface expression of the kinase site mutants of AQP2. Cells expressing wt-AQP2 or the AQP2 kinase site mutants (indicated) were grown and treated with indomethacin (I), indomethacin/forskolin (IF), or indomethacin/forskolin/PMA (IFP) as described in the legend of Fig. 3 and subjected to a cell surface biotinylation assay. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads and immunoblotted for AQP2. A sample of the lysed cells was immunoblotted in parallel to visualize the amount of mutant proteins expressed. The data confirmed the results obtained by immunocytochemistry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Immunoblot analysis of AQP2-S148D.Lysates of representative cell lines expressing wt-AQP2 or AQP2-S148D were immunoblotted for AQP2. For wt-AQP2, the unglycosylated 29-kDa and complex-glycosylated 40–45-kDa bands were obtained. Besides the 29-kDa band, a 32-kDa high mannose band is detected for AQP2-S148D, which indicates that this mutant is retained in the ER.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the effects of the introduced mutations on the targeting of AQP2 from the organelle of synthesis (ER) to intracellular vesicles, the cell lines were treated with indomethacin to lower endogenous cAMP levels and subjected to immunocytochemistry. With the exception of AQP2-S148D and AQP2-S256D, CLSM analysis revealed a vesicular localization for all AQP2 mutants that was similar to that of wt-AQP2 (Fig. 3, left column). AQP2-S148D revealed a dispersed intracellular staining, which did not change with forskolin or forskolin/PMA treatments and is typical for ER-retained proteins. Strikingly, AQP2-S256D was, in contrast to wt-AQP2 and all other AQP2 mutants, expressed in the apical membrane. To determine whether the introduced kinase site mutations affected the cAMP-induced re-distribution of AQP2 from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane, all cell lines were treated with forskolin and subjected to immunocytochemistry. CLSM analysis revealed that all AQP2 mutants were mainly expressed in the apical plasma membrane as has been found previously for wt-AQP2, except for AQP2-S256A (Fig. 3, middle column). Of this latter mutant, the vesicular localization did not change upon forskolin treatment, which indicated that phosphorylation of Ser-256 is essential for re-distribution of AQP2 from vesicles to the apical membrane. In severalin vivo studies, it has been shown that hormones and PMA that activate the PKC pathway, counteract the AVP-induced re-distribution of AQP2 from vesicles to the apical membrane in collecting duct cells and, therefore, the concentration of urine (13Han J.S. Maeda Y. Ecelbarger C. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: F139-F146PubMed Google Scholar,35Zelenina M. Christensen B.M. Palmer J. Nairn A.C. Nielsen S. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F388-F394PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this process could be simulated in MDCK cells and whether the kinase site mutants act differently upon activation of the PKC pathway, all cell lines were pre-treated with forskolin and subsequently treated with forskolin and PMA followed by immunocytochemistry. CLSM analysis revealed that wt-AQP2 as well as all kinase site mutants were re-distributed from the apical membrane to intracellular vesicles (Fig. 3, right column). The vesicular localization of AQP2-S256A was not changed by the combined forskolin-PMA treatment. These results indicated that neither phosphorylation of the PKC consensus site nor modification of any other putative kinase site was needed for PMA-induced translocation of AQP2 from the apical membrane to intracellular vesicles. Because AQP2-S256D is also internalized with PMA, these data also suggested that the PKC- induced redistribution of AQP2 to intracellular vesicles is an event that is independent of de-phosphorylation of the PKA phosphorylation site. To biochemically establish expression of the AQP2 proteins in the apical membrane, all cell lines were treated as above and subjected to an apical cell surface biotinylation assay. Immunoblotting revealed that forskolin treatment strongly increased the apical membrane expression of all AQP2 proteins (only shown for wt-AQP2, AQP2-S229A/S229D, and AQP2-S231A/S231D), except for AQP2-S256A and AQP2-S256D (Fig. 4). AQP2-S256A was not detected in the apical membrane, whereas the apical membrane expression of AQP2-S256D in unstimulated cells was not further increased with forskolin. Incubation with forskolin-PMA following forskolin treatment again decreased the apical membrane expression of all kinase site mutants to undetectable levels. Immunoblotting of equivalents of the biotinylated and lysed cells revealed that all cell lines expressed well detectable levels of wt-AQP2 or of the AQP2 mutants (Fig. 4,Total). To determine whether the forskolin and forskolin- PMA-induced redistribution of AQP2 coincided with a changed phosphorylation of the AQP2 protein, wt10 cells and AQP2-S256A-expressing cells were not stimulated or treated with forskolin or forskolin-PMA in the presence of radioactive orthophosphate. After this treatment, AQP2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysed cells, split into two equal portions, and immunoblotted for AQP2 or loaded on a gel and exposed to film. Immunoblotting revealed that per cell line equal amounts of AQP2 were loaded for each condition tested (Fig.5, lower panel). Determination of the level of phosphorylation of wt-AQP2 in wt10 cells revealed that wt-AQP2 was already phosphorylated without stimulation, which was, following normalization for the amounts of AQP2 loaded, increased 2-fold upon stimulation with forskolin. In contrast to wt-AQP2, AQP2-S256A was not labeled in unstimulated, forskolin-stimulated or forskolin-PMA-treated cells, whereas the AQP2-S256A expression was higher than wt-AQP2 (Fig. 5). These results showed that under steady state conditions only Ser-256 in AQP2 is detected as being phosphorylated and that its level of phosphorylation is increased with forskolin. Data obtained for AQP2-S256A and AQP2-S256D described above demonstrated the importance of phosphorylation of Ser-256 to re-distribute AQP2 from intracellular vesicles to the apical membrane. We also wanted to determine whether forskolin-induced translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent re-location to intracellular vesicles with forskolin-PMA treatment coincides with an increased, respectively decreased, phosphorylation of AQP2 at Ser-256. Therefore, the different cell lines were treated as described above and lysed. Immunoblottin"

https://openalex.org/W2106608123,"Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are thought to receive inhibition from other V1 neurons selective for a variety of orientations. Evidence for this inhibition is commonly found in cross-orientation suppression: responses of a V1 neuron to optimally oriented bars are suppressed by superimposed mask bars of different orientation. We show, however, that suppression is unlikely to result from intracortical inhibition. First, suppression can be obtained with masks drifting too rapidly to elicit much of a response in cortex. Second, suppression is immune to hyperpolarization (through visual adaptation) of cortical neurons responding to the mask. Signals mediating suppression might originate in thalamus, rather than in cortex. Thalamic neurons exhibit some suppression; additional suppression might arise from depression at thalamocortical synapses. The mechanisms of suppression are subcortical and possibly include the very first synapse into cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2080632366,"Cell survival is determined by a balance among signaling cascades, including those that recruit the Akt and JNK pathways. Here we describe a novel interaction between Akt1 and JNK interacting protein 1 (JIP1), a JNK pathway scaffold. Direct association between Akt1 and JIP1 was observed in primary neurons. Neuronal exposure to an excitotoxic stimulus decreased the Akt1-JIP1 interaction and concomitantly increased association between JIP1 and JNK. Akt1 interaction with JIP1 inhibited JIP1-mediated potentiation of JNK activity by decreasing JIP1 binding to specific JNK pathway kinases. Consistent with this view, neurons from Akt1-deficient mice exhibited higher susceptibility to kainate than wild-type littermates. Overexpression of Akt1 mutants that bind JIP1 reduced excitotoxic apoptosis. These results suggest that Akt1 binding to JIP1 acts as a regulatory gate preventing JNK activation, which is released under conditions of excitotoxic injury."

These conditions affect many tissues, are painful, and are difficult to treat. In this study, using cornea as a model, we demonstrate for the first time the importance of carbohydrate-binding proteins galectins-3 and -7 in re-epithelialization of wounds. In two different models of corneal wound healing, re-epithelialization of wounds was significantly slower in galectin-3-deficient (gal3−/−) mice compared with wild-type (gal3+/+) mice. In contrast, there was no difference in corneal epithelial wound closure rates between galectin-1-deficient and wild-type mice. Quantitation of the bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in gal3+/+ and gal3−/− corneas revealed that corneal epithelial cell proliferation rate is not perturbed in gal3−/− corneas. Exogenous galectin-3 accelerated re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3+/+ mice but, surprisingly, not in the gal3−/− mice. Gene expression analysis using cDNA microarrays revealed that healing corneas of gal3−/− mice contain markedly reduced levels of galectin-7 compared with those of gal3+/+ mice. More importantly, unlike galectin-3, galectin-7 accelerated re-epithelialization of wounds in both gal3−/− and gal3+/+ mice.

In most cases, failure of re-epithelialization is not attributed to inadequate cell proliferation but the result of a reduced potential of the epithelium to migrate across the wound bed (5Seiler W.O.

Whereas the regulation of cell-matrix interactions is a poorly understood process, it is known that in many instances, cell attachment to the matrix is mediated by recognition between extracellular matrix (ECM)1 molecules and transmembrane integrin receptors. Recent studies have provided evidence that members of the galectin class of β-galactoside-binding proteins (10Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol.

They are found on the cell surface within ECM and in the cytoplasm of cells and are thought to influence cell-matrix adhesion by binding to the ECM and cell surface-glycosylated counter receptors (e.g. certain isoforms of laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and integrins). In addition, galectin-3 is found in the nucleus of the cells and may influence cell-matrix interactions indirectly by influencing the expression of well known cell adhesion molecules (e.g.α6β1 and α4β7integrins) (16Warfield P.R. Makker P.-N. Raz A. Ochieng J. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 101-112PubMed Google Scholar, 17Matarrese P. Fusco O. Tinari N. Liu F.-T. Semeraro M.L. Malorni W. Iacobell S. Int. J.

Lett. 1994; 42: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although all members of the galectin family bind to β-galactoside residues, each galectin has unique fine specificity for more complex oligosaccharides; therefore, different members of the galectin family may bind distinct glycoconjugate receptors, resulting in specific downstream effects. Here we demonstrate that galectin-3 but not galectin-1 plays a role in re-epithelialization of corneal wounds and that another member of the galectin family, galectin-7, is also involved in the wound healing process.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that galectin-3 plays a role in the re-epithelialization of corneal wounds. First, immunohistochemical studies revealed that galectin-3 is located in high density at sites of corneal epithelial cell-matrix adhesion, an ideal location for influencing cell-matrix interactions and cell migration. Second, in two different models of corneal wound healing, re-epithelialization of corneal wounds was significantly slower in the gal3−/−mice compared with that in wild-type mice. In contrast, there was no difference in the rate of re-epithelialization of corneal wounds between galectin-1-deficient and wild-type mice. Third, the exogenous recombinant galectin-3 stimulated re-epithelialization of corneal wounds in gal3+/+ mice in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, recombinant galectin-1 had no influence. We further demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of galectin-3 on the rate of corneal epithelial wound closure can be almost completely abrogated by a competing disaccharide, β-lactose, but not by an irrelevant disaccharide, sucrose. This finding suggested that the carbohydrate recognition domain was directly involved in the beneficial effect of the exogenous lectin on the wound closure.Regarding the mechanism by which galectin-3 may influence re-epithelialization of corneal wounds, the lectin is thought to mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by binding to complementary glycoconjugates containing polylactosamine chains found in many ECM and cell surface molecules, such as certain isoforms of fibronectin, laminin, and integrins (10Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 11Hughes R.C. Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7097-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our findings that exogenous galectin-3 does not accelerate the re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3−/− mice suggest that intracellular galectin-3 contributes significantly to the process of wound healing, most probably, by influencing the expression of specific cell surface and/or ECM receptors, which in turn influence cell-matrix interactions and cell migration. The precedence for this notion is suggested by published studies in which galectin-3 was stably overexpressed in breast carcinoma cell lines, and it was shown that cells overexpressing the lectin expressed elevated levels of α4β7 and α6β1integrins and exhibited enhanced adhesion to various ECM molecules including laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin compared with parental cell lines expressing little or no galectin-3 (16Warfield P.R. Makker P.-N. Raz A. Ochieng J. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 101-112PubMed Google Scholar, 17Matarrese P. Fusco O. Tinari N. Liu F.-T. Semeraro M.L. Malorni W. Iacobell S. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In another study (30Dudas S.P. Yunker C.K. Sternberg I.R. Bresalier R.S. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1553Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), colon cancer carcinoma cell lines transfected with galectin-3 expressed the elevated levels of a specific mucin, MUC2, a major ligand of the lectin itself (31Bresalier R.S. Byrd J.C. Wang L. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4354-4357PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the stimulatory effect of exogenous galectin-3 on the rate of re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3+/+ mice is lactose-inhibitable raises an intriguing possibility that intracellular galectin-3 may in fact regulate the glycosylation of the proteins, which serve as cell surface or ECM receptors of the lectin itself. That intracellular galectin-3 has the potential to act on nuclear matrix to influence complex biological processes is suggested by findings that under certain conditions the lectin can be found to be associated in the nucleus with ribonucleoprotein complexes and can act as a pre-mRNA-splicing factor (32Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Also, Wang et al. (33Wang L. Inohara H. Pienta K.J. Raz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in prostate adenocarcinoma cells, galectin-3 is associated with nuclear matrix and binds with single-stranded DNA and with RNA.An analysis of gene expression patterns of corneas of healing gal3+/+ and gal3−/− mice using mouse cDNA microarrays revealed that the healing corneas of gal3−/−mice expressed markedly reduced levels of galectin-7 compared with those of wild-type mice. Galectin-7, first reported in 1994 (12Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not as well characterized as galectins-1 and -3. To the best of our knowledge, transgenic mice deficient in galectin-7 have not been reported. Unlike galectins-1 and -3, galectin-7 exhibits a remarkable degree of tissue specificity. In adult animals, its expression is restricted to epithelia that are stratified or are destined to become stratified (34Magnaldo T. Fowlis D. Marmon M. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Timmons P.M. Colnot C. Cail I. Poirier F. Magnaldo T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar). The protein is thought to be involved in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions and in apoptosis (36Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Flint T. Gromov P. Kruse T.A. Honore B. Vorum H. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5823-5829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Leonidas D.D. Vatzaki E.H. Vorum H. Celis J.E. Madsen P. Acharya K.R.

A. 1999; 96: 11329-11334Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In general, an inverse correlation exists between galectin-7 expression and keratinocyte proliferation, and galectin-7 expression is abrogated in SV40-transformed keratinocytes as well as in cell lines derived from epidermal tumors. Our findings that exogenous galectin-3 does not stimulate re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3−/−corneas and that the healing gal3−/− corneas contain reduced levels of galectin-7 lead us to speculate that galectin-3 may influence the re-epithelialization of wounds, at least in part, by modulating galectin-7. Indeed, we found that unlike galectin-3, galectin-7 accelerated the re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3−/− corneas in a lactose-inhibitable manner. Also, MEF of gal3−/− mice expressed reduced levels of galectin-7. Regardless of the mechanisms involved, our findings that both galectin-3 and galectin-7 stimulate the re-epithelialization of corneal wounds have broad implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of nonhealing wounds. At present, the treatment of persistent epithelial defects of the cornea is a major clinical problem. Moreover, the need continues for effective treatment of chronic wounds in the elderly, decubitus ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers of the skin. A number of growth factors (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-α, fibroblast growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor) known to stimulate cell proliferation have been tested for usefulness in corneal as well as cutaneous epithelial wound healing with overall disappointing results (1Eaglstein W.H.

The extent of acceleration of re-epithelialization of wounds was far less in most of these studies using growth factors (39Zieske J.D. Gipson I.K. Albert D.M. Jakobiec F.A. Principle and Practice of Ophthalmology. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 364-372Google Scholar, 40Schultz G. Khaw P.T. Oxford K. MaCauley S. Van Setten G. Chegini N. Eye. 1994; 8: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) than that observed with galectins in the current study. Also, the epithelium of corneas treated with growth factors such as epidermal growth factor is hyperplastic (42Singh G. Foster C.S. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1987; 103: 802-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Watanabe K. Nakagawa S. Nishida T. Invest. Ophthlmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 205-211PubMed Google Scholar, 44Singh G. Foster C.S. Cornea. 1989; 8: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar), a clearly undesirable condition. In this respect, the clinical potential of galectin-3 and galectin-7 may be more attractive than that of growth factors because the lectins have not been shown to induce cell mitosis in epithelial cells. That galectin-3 does not induce cell mitosis is further suggested by our findings that the corneal epithelial cell proliferation rate is not perturbed in gal3−/− corneas. Over the last decade, the potential of excimer laser keratectomy to modify the corneal profile for correction of myopia has been realized. Thousands of such procedures are performed each week, providing myopic individuals freedom from eye glasses and contact lenses. In view of the fact that 25–30% of the adult population worldwide is myopic, it has been estimated that nearly half a million such procedures will be performed in the U. S. alone in a given year (45Kliman G.H. Taylor K.P. Wu H.K. Thompson V.M. Stenert R.F. Slade S.G. Hersh P.S. Refractive Surgery. Thieme, New York1999: 469-480Google Scholar). In some cases following excimer laser surgery, there is a delay in epithelial healing. Such a delay is highly undesirable, because it puts the cornea at risk of developing postoperative haze, infectious keratitis, and ulceration. Again, galectin-based drugs may help promote re-epithelialization of wounds in such cases. In a number of organ systems including cornea, skin, and gastrointestinal tract, disorders of wound healing characterized by impaired or delayed re-epithelialization and associated persistent epithelial defects constitute a serious medical problem (1Eaglstein W.H.

Med. 1999; 341: 738-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (4567) Google Scholar). In most cases, failure of re-epithelialization is not attributed to inadequate cell proliferation but the result of a reduced potential of the epithelium to migrate across the wound bed (5Seiler W.O.

Cell migration is a complex biological process that entails sequential adhesion and release from the substrate, a process in which cell-matrix interactions play a key role (8Lauffenburger D.A.

Whereas the regulation of cell-matrix interactions is a poorly understood process, it is known that in many instances, cell attachment to the matrix is mediated by recognition between extracellular matrix (ECM)1 molecules and transmembrane integrin receptors. Recent studies have provided evidence that members of the galectin class of β-galactoside-binding proteins (10Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 11Hughes R.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N.

Both lectins are expressed in inflammatory cells and in epithelia and fibroblasts of various tissues (10Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol.

They are found on the cell surface within ECM and in the cytoplasm of cells and are thought to influence cell-matrix adhesion by binding to the ECM and cell surface-glycosylated counter receptors (e.g. certain isoforms of laminin, fibronectin, vitronectin, and integrins). In addition, galectin-3 is found in the nucleus of the cells and may influence cell-matrix interactions indirectly by influencing the expression of well known cell adhesion molecules (e.g.α6β1 and α4β7integrins) (16Warfield P.R. Makker P.-N. Raz A. Ochieng J. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 101-112PubMed Google Scholar, 17Matarrese P. Fusco O. Tinari N. Liu F.-T. Semeraro M.L. Malorni W. Iacobell S. Int. J.

Lett. 1994; 42: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Although all members of the galectin family bind to β-galactoside residues, each galectin has unique fine specificity for more complex oligosaccharides; therefore, different members of the galectin family may bind distinct glycoconjugate receptors, resulting in specific downstream effects. Here we demonstrate that galectin-3 but not galectin-1 plays a role in re-epithelialization of corneal wounds and that another member of the galectin family, galectin-7, is also involved in the wound healing process. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we demonstrate that galectin-3 plays a role in the re-epithelialization of corneal wounds. First, immunohistochemical studies revealed that galectin-3 is located in high density at sites of corneal epithelial cell-matrix adhesion, an ideal location for influencing cell-matrix interactions and cell migration. Second, in two different models of corneal wound healing, re-epithelialization of corneal wounds was significantly slower in the gal3−/−mice compared with that in wild-type mice. In contrast, there was no difference in the rate of re-epithelialization of corneal wounds between galectin-1-deficient and wild-type mice. Third, the exogenous recombinant galectin-3 stimulated re-epithelialization of corneal wounds in gal3+/+ mice in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, recombinant galectin-1 had no influence. We further demonstrated that the stimulatory effect of galectin-3 on the rate of corneal epithelial wound closure can be almost completely abrogated by a competing disaccharide, β-lactose, but not by an irrelevant disaccharide, sucrose. This finding suggested that the carbohydrate recognition domain was directly involved in the beneficial effect of the exogenous lectin on the wound closure.Regarding the mechanism by which galectin-3 may influence re-epithelialization of corneal wounds, the lectin is thought to mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by binding to complementary glycoconjugates containing polylactosamine chains found in many ECM and cell surface molecules, such as certain isoforms of fibronectin, laminin, and integrins (10Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 11Hughes R.C. Biochem. Soc.

Chem. 1990; 265: 7097-7099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our findings that exogenous galectin-3 does not accelerate the re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3−/− mice suggest that intracellular galectin-3 contributes significantly to the process of wound healing, most probably, by influencing the expression of specific cell surface and/or ECM receptors, which in turn influence cell-matrix interactions and cell migration. The precedence for this notion is suggested by published studies in which galectin-3 was stably overexpressed in breast carcinoma cell lines, and it was shown that cells overexpressing the lectin expressed elevated levels of α4β7 and α6β1integrins and exhibited enhanced adhesion to various ECM molecules including laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin compared with parental cell lines expressing little or no galectin-3 (16Warfield P.R. Makker P.-N. Raz A. Ochieng J. Invasion Metastasis. 1997; 17: 101-112PubMed Google Scholar, 17Matarrese P. Fusco O. Tinari N. Liu F.-T. Semeraro M.L. Malorni W. Iacobell S. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In another study (30Dudas S.P. Yunker C.K. Sternberg I.R. Bresalier R.S. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 1553Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), colon cancer carcinoma cell lines transfected with galectin-3 expressed the elevated levels of a specific mucin, MUC2, a major ligand of the lectin itself (31Bresalier R.S. Byrd J.C. Wang L. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4354-4357PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the stimulatory effect of exogenous galectin-3 on the rate of re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3+/+ mice is lactose-inhibitable raises an intriguing possibility that intracellular galectin-3 may in fact regulate the glycosylation of the proteins, which serve as cell surface or ECM receptors of the lectin itself. That intracellular galectin-3 has the potential to act on nuclear matrix to influence complex biological processes is suggested by findings that under certain conditions the lectin can be found to be associated in the nucleus with ribonucleoprotein complexes and can act as a pre-mRNA-splicing factor (32Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Also, Wang et al. (33Wang L. Inohara H. Pienta K.J. Raz A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 292-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that in prostate adenocarcinoma cells, galectin-3 is associated with nuclear matrix and binds with single-stranded DNA and with RNA.An analysis of gene expression patterns of corneas of healing gal3+/+ and gal3−/− mice using mouse cDNA microarrays revealed that the healing corneas of gal3−/−mice expressed markedly reduced levels of galectin-7 compared with those of wild-type mice. Galectin-7, first reported in 1994 (12Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is not as well characterized as galectins-1 and -3. To the best of our knowledge, transgenic mice deficient in galectin-7 have not been reported. Unlike galectins-1 and -3, galectin-7 exhibits a remarkable degree of tissue specificity. In adult animals, its expression is restricted to epithelia that are stratified or are destined to become stratified (34Magnaldo T. Fowlis D. Marmon M. Differentiation. 1998; 63: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 35Timmons P.M. Colnot C. Cail I. Poirier F. Magnaldo T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 229-235PubMed Google Scholar). The protein is thought to be involved in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions and in apoptosis (36Madsen P. Rasmussen H.H. Flint T. Gromov P. Kruse T.A. Honore B. Vorum H. Celis J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5823-5829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Leonidas D.D. Vatzaki E.H. Vorum H. Celis J.E. Madsen P. Acharya K.R.

A. 1999; 96: 11329-11334Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In general, an inverse correlation exists between galectin-7 expression and keratinocyte proliferation, and galectin-7 expression is abrogated in SV40-transformed keratinocytes as well as in cell lines derived from epidermal tumors. Our findings that exogenous galectin-3 does not stimulate re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3−/−corneas and that the healing gal3−/− corneas contain reduced levels of galectin-7 lead us to speculate that galectin-3 may influence the re-epithelialization of wounds, at least in part, by modulating galectin-7. Indeed, we found that unlike galectin-3, galectin-7 accelerated the re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3−/− corneas in a lactose-inhibitable manner. Also, MEF of gal3−/− mice expressed reduced levels of galectin-7. Regardless of the mechanisms involved, our findings that both galectin-3 and galectin-7 stimulate the re-epithelialization of corneal wounds have broad implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of nonhealing wounds. At present, the treatment of persistent epithelial defects of the cornea is a major clinical problem. Moreover, the need continues for effective treatment of chronic wounds in the elderly, decubitus ulcers, and venous stasis ulcers of the skin. A number of growth factors (epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor-α, fibroblast growth factor, keratinocyte growth factor, and hepatocyte growth factor) known to stimulate cell proliferation have been tested for usefulness in corneal as well as cutaneous epithelial wound healing with overall disappointing results (1Eaglstein W.H.

The extent of acceleration of re-epithelialization of wounds was far less in most of these studies using growth factors (39Zieske J.D. Gipson I.K. Albert D.M. Jakobiec F.A. Principle and Practice of Ophthalmology. 2nd Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA2000: 364-372Google Scholar, 40Schultz G. Khaw P.T. Oxford K. MaCauley S. Van Setten G. Chegini N. Eye. 1994; 8: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) than that observed with galectins in the current study. Also, the epithelium of corneas treated with growth factors such as epidermal growth factor is hyperplastic (42Singh G. Foster C.S. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1987; 103: 802-807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Watanabe K. Nakagawa S. Nishida T. Invest. Ophthlmol. Vis. Sci. 1987; 28: 205-211PubMed Google Scholar, 44Singh G. Foster C.S. Cornea. 1989; 8: 45-53PubMed Google Scholar), a clearly undesirable condition. In this respect, the clinical potential of galectin-3 and galectin-7 may be more attractive than that of growth factors because the lectins have not been shown to induce cell mitosis in epithelial cells. That galectin-3 does not induce cell mitosis is further suggested by our findings that the corneal epithelial cell proliferation rate is not perturbed in gal3−/− corneas. Over the last decade, the potential of excimer laser keratectomy to modify the corneal profile for correction of myopia has been realized. Thousands of such procedures are performed each week, providing myopic individuals freedom from eye glasses and contact lenses. In view of the fact that 25–30% of the adult population worldwide is myopic, it has been estimated that nearly half a million such procedures will be performed in the U. S. alone in a given year (45Kliman G.H. Taylor K.P. Wu H.K. Thompson V.M. Stenert R.F. Slade S.G. Hersh P.S. Refractive Surgery. Thieme, New York1999: 469-480Google Scholar). In some cases following excimer laser surgery, there is a delay in epithelial healing. Such a delay is highly undesirable, because it puts the cornea at risk of developing postoperative haze, infectious keratitis, and ulceration. Again, galectin-based drugs may help promote re-epithelialization of wounds in such cases. In this study, we demonstrate that galectin-3 plays a role in the re-epithelialization of corneal wounds. First, immunohistochemical studies revealed that galectin-3 is located in high density at sites of corneal epithelial cell-matrix adhesion, an ideal location for influencing cell-matrix interactions and cell migration.

Again, galectin-based drugs may help promote re-epithelialization of wounds in such cases. We thank Drs. Pamela Stanley and Brian Schaffhausen for critical reading of the paper and Drs. Douglas N. Cooper and Carrie Miceli for providing galectin-1-deficient mice. Recombinant galectin-1 and polyclonal antibodies to galectin-1 were also provided by Dr. D. N. Cooper. We also thank Dr. James F. Dice for helpful discussions and Dr. Jaison Paliakkra for help during the initial phase of the work."

Receptor-recognized forms of α2-Macroglobulin (α2M*) bind to LRP, but the pattern of signal transduction differs significantly from that observed with other LRP ligands. For example, neither Ni2+ nor the receptor-associated protein, which blocks binding of all known ligands to LRP, block α2M*-induced signal transduction. In the current study, we employed α2-macroglobulin (α2M)-agarose column chromatography to purify cell surface membrane binding proteins from 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and murine macrophages. The predominant binding protein purified from 1-LN prostate cancer cells was Grp 78 with small amounts of LRP, a fact that is consistent with our previous observations that there is little LRP present on the surface of these cells. The ratio of LRP:Grp 78 is much higher in macrophages. Flow cytometry was employed to demonstrate the presence of Grp 78 on the cell surface of 1-LN cells. Purified Grp 78 binds to α2M* with high affinity (K d ∼150 pm). A monoclonal antibody directed against Grp 78 both abolished α2M*-induced signal transduction and co-precipitated LRP. Ligand blotting with α2M* showed binding to both Grp 78 and LRP heavy chains in these preparations. Use of RNA interference to silence LRP expression had no effect on α2M*-mediated signaling. We conclude that Grp 78 is essential for α2M*-induced signal transduction and that a “co-receptor” relationship exists with LRP like that seen with several other ligands and receptors such as the uPA/uPAR (urinary type plasminogen activator or urokinase/uPA receptor) system.

Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). This activated form of α2M is designated α2M*. Though difficult to reconcile, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that α2M*-induced signaling occurs via a receptor that is functionally unique from the previously characterized α2M* receptor, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP). LRP is a scavenger receptor (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) that binds to a variety of proteins, many of which trigger signal transduction (2Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J.

The receptor-associated protein (RAP) that blocks the binding of all known ligands to LRP is also an antagonist for this signaling pathway (2Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

In addition, binding studies with a variety of cells in culture demonstrate two classes of binding sites, one of very high affinity (K d ∼100 pm and 1600 sites/cell) and one of lower affinity (K d ∼2–5 nm and ∼70,000 sites/cell). The high affinity binding site is responsible for α2M*-induced signal transduction and has been termed the α2M* signaling receptor (α2MSR), whereas the lower affinity binding site has been identified as LRP (8Misra U.K. Gawdi G.

In this report we demonstrate by flow analysis that Grp 78 is on the surface of 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and that cell surface Grp 78 is essential for α2M*-induced signal transduction in both 1-LN human prostate cancer cells and murine macrophages. A monoclonal antibody directed against Grp 78 completely abolished α2M*-induced signal transduction in both 1-LN cells and murine macrophages as judged by the effects of this antibody on the ability of α2M* to induce a rise in [Ca2+]i. This response is always seen when signal transduction is activated by α2M* in these cells (8Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

But in the former cells the ratio of Grp 78:LRP is much greater than in macrophages. We also show by ligand binding assays to membranes that α2M* binds to Grp 78 and the heavy, but not light, chain of LRP. The latter observation is consistent with the known receptor-binding properties of LRP (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Using the technique of RNA interference, we find that LRP is not required for α2M*-dependent signal transduction. Finally, we demonstrate that highly purified Grp 78 binds to α2M* with very high affinity (K d∼150 pm). The sources of thioglycollate, cell culture material, and endotoxin-free α2M* have been described previously (2Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

Antibodies against the heavy (515 kDa) and light (85 kDa) chains of LRP were procured from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Antibodies against Grp 78 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Bacitracin and β-octylglucoside were procured from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-human antibodies against Grp 78 and normal goat IgG employed for flow cytometry were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). ChromPure® Goat IgG, Fc Fragment, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated Rabbit Anti-goat IgG, F(ab′)2 Fragment Specific, and Rabbit Gamma Globulins were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Purified anti-mouse H-2Kb (AF6–88.5) was purchased from Pharmingen. Affinity chromatography materials and ECF kits were fromAmersham Biosciences. All other reagents used were procured locally and were of the highest available grade. Murine macrophages and 1-LN human prostate cancer cells were cultured as previously described (2Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

Cell membranes from murine macrophages and 1-LN prostate cancer cells were obtained and solubilized in β-octylglucoside and chromatographed on an α2M*-agarose affinity column as previously described (14Jensen P.E.H. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. Arch. 1989; 5: 171-176Google Scholar). By this procedure both LRP and Grp 78 were isolated as demonstrated by several techniques (see below). Grp 78 was also purified from the cell membranes of 1-LN prostate cancer cells by suspending the membranes in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0 containing 1% Triton X-100 and chromatography on anti-Grp 78-agarose. This procedure yielded Grp 78 free of LRP as demonstrated by several techniques (see below). SDS-PAGE was employed to characterize the proteins obtained from the affinity column. Bands were either directly stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or subjected to blotting for probing with either antibodies or α2M*. Techniques for blotting assays are described in detail elsewhere (15Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J. Højrup P. Everitt L. Hubchak S. Schnaper H.W. Pizzo S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For some studies, immunoprecipitates were obtained from solubilized cell membranes of 1-LN cell and macrophage membranes employing a monoclonal antibody to Grp 78. These precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10%) and blotted to Hybrid P® membranes (AmershamBiosciences) prior to exposure to either appropriate antibodies or α2M*. When α2M* was employed as a ligand, after appropriate washing the bound α2M* was identified by an anti-α2M* antibody and use of ECF (AmershamBiosciences). A Storm® 860 Phosphoimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) was employed to detect the bound α2M*. The use of these techniques is described in detail elsewhere (9Misra U.K. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4069-4078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To study the specific binding of α2M* to immobilized Grp 78, 96-well culture plates were coated with Grp 78 (1 μg/ml in 0.1m sodium carbonate, pH 9.6, 200 μl/well at 37 °C for 2 h). After coating, plates were rinsed with 10 mmsodium phosphate/100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 80 (PBS-Tween) to remove unbound protein. Nonspecific sites were blocked by incubation with PBS-Tween containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Plates were rinsed twice with PBS-Tween, air-dried, and stored at 4 °C. For assays, increasing concentrations of α2M* were added to triplicate wells and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. An ELISA procedure was used to calculate the amount of bound ligand to Grp 78. This procedure involves the construction of calibration curves in 96-well culture plates coated with α2M* as described above and then titration with a specific rabbit anti-α2M*-IgG followed by detection with a secondary anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Values from this curve were used to determine the amount of α2M* bound to immobilized Grp 78. Binding of LRP and Grp 78 from cell lysates to immobilized α2M* was carried out by an ELISA on 96-well culture plates. Plates were first coated with α2M* (5 μg/ml) in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.3, 0.01% sodium azide. The plates were rinsed with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, containing 0.15 m sodium chloride and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 (PBS-Tween) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS-Tween to block nonspecific sites, followed by three more rinses in PBS-Tween to remove excess reagents. The plates were then dried at room temperature and stored at 4 °C until further use. Binding of LRP from cell lysates was performed by incubating the plates with increasing concentrations of the lysate at 37 °C for 90 min. The plates were then rinsed with PBS-Tween and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with 200 μl of a solution containing an anti-LRP mouse IgG (1 μg/ml) in PBS-Tween. The plates are then rinsed with PBS-Tween and incubated with 200 μl of a solution containing the alkaline phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 m/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm zinc chloride. The absorbance was monitored at a wavelength of 405 nm with an Anthos Labtec plate reader, and the LRP bound was expressed asΔA405 nm. Binding of Grp 78 was also assessed on the same lysates by incubating the α2M* plates with a rabbit anti-Grp 78 IgG after reaction with the lysate and by using an anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The amount of Grp 78 bound was monitored as described above and also expressed as ΔA 405 nm. 1-LN cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 35 nm human insulin. Cells were detached by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS containing 4 mm EDTA and then pelleted. Cells were washed once with PBS before being resuspended in ice-cold staining buffer (Phenol Red-free Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3 mg/ml rabbit gamma globulins, 0.4 mg/ml goat IgG Fc fragments, 0.01% NaN3) at a concentration of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Aliquots (100 μl) of these cell suspensions were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with an appropriate dilution of goat polyclonal anti-Grp 78 or normal goat IgG (control). Cells were washed three times with ice-cold staining buffer, pelleted, and resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold staining buffer. These cell suspensions were then incubated in the dark with a FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG, F(ab′)2 for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold staining buffer, resuspended in ice-cold 1% paraformaldehyde, and stored in the dark at 4 °C until analysis by flow cytometry. The mean relative fluorescence after excitation at 495 nm was determined for each sample on a FACS Vantage S.E. flow cytometer, and data was analyzed using CellQuest® software (BD Pharmingen). Changes in [Ca2+]i were measured in macrophages and 1-LN prostate cancer cells preloaded with Fura-2/AM by digital imaging microscopy as previously described (2Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V.

For some studies, either bacitracin (3 mg/ml) or anti Grp 78 (5 μg/ml) was added 20 min prior to α2M* (100 pm) and determination of [Ca2+]i. The chemical synthesis of dsRNA homologous to the target LRP gene amino acid sequence 146–152 nucleotide base sequence 5′AAAACATGTAAGGACTTTGAT3′ (Swiss-Prot, LRP primary accession number Q0754) was performed by Ambion sequence ID 285, Austin, TX. For making dsRNA, the sense (5′AACAUGUAAGGACUUUGAUtt3′) and antisense (5′AUCAAAGUCCUUACAUGUUtt3′) oligonucleotides were annealed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Throughout the entire period of experimentation handling of reagents was performed in an RNase-free environment. Briefly, equal amounts of sense and antisense oligonucleotides were mixed and heated at 90 °C for 1 min and then for 1 h at 37 °C in an incubator. The dsRNA preparation was stored at −20 °C before use. This procedure has been described in detail elsewhere (16Misra U.K. Akabani G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36509-36520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In brief, thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal (1 × 106cells/well in a 6-well plate) were lavaged as above and allowed to adhere for 2 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, penicillin (12.5 units/ml), streptomycin (6.5 μg/ml), and 2 mmglutamine at 37 °C in a CO2 (5%) humidified incubator at 37 °C. The non-adherent cells were aspirated, monolayers were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution containing HEPES (HHBSS), 2 ml of DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and above antibiotics added, and cells incubated as above for 16 h. For each transfection, 2 μg of dsRNA was diluted into 100 μl of serum-free DMEM in a tube. In another tube, 10 μl of LipofectAMINE was diluted into 100 μl of serum-free medium. The two solutions were combined, mixed gently, and incubated for 45 min at room temperature followed by the addition of 800 μl of serum-free and antibiotic-free medium to each tube. The monolayers were washed twice with serum-free DMEM medium, layered in each well with 1 ml of LipofectAMINE-DMEM (10 μl/ml) or lipid-dsRNA mixtures, dsRNA (26 μg), gently mixed, and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO2incubator. At the end of the incubation, 1 ml of antibiotic-free DMEM containing 10% FBS was added to each well and cells were incubated for 16 h as above. Microscopic observation of the monolayers did not show obvious evidence of toxicity. The cells did not take up Trypan Blue, and their morphology was not altered by the procedure (data not shown). The medium was replaced with DMEM medium containing antibiotics and 10% FBS 24 h after the start of transfection. The monolayers were washed with the above DMEM medium once, and Western blotting of LRP and Grp 78 in cell lysates was performed. Equal amounts of proteins from both groups of lysates were electrophoresed and transferred to membranes. LRP and Grp 78 were detected by ELISA as described above. The quantification of [3H]inositol (1, 4, 5)trisphosphate [3H]IP3 formed from [3H]myoinositol-labeled, dsRNA-transfected macrophages upon stimulation with α2M* (100 pm) was performed as described earlier (2Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12541-12547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-h adhered macrophages in 6-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) were transfected with dsRNA homologous in sequence to target the LRP gene as above. The transfected cells in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics were incubated with [3H]myoinositol (10 μCi/ml) overnight. The cells were washed with HHBSS containing 10 mm LiCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 thrice. A volume of the wash buffer was added and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min for temperature equilibration. The cells were stimulated with α2M* (100 pm) for varying periods of time. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium and adding a volume of 6.25% HClO4. The cells were scraped into respective glass tubes, 1 ml of freon:octylamine (1:1, v/v) was added, and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The aqueous phase was applied onto a 1 ml Dowex resin (AG 1-X8-formate), and an inositol phosphates batch was eluted as described previously (6Misra U.K. Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Gawdi G. Pizzo S.V. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The untransfected cells were processed similarly and were the controls. In experiments where the effect of pertussis toxin was studied on the formation of [3H]IP3 upon stimulation with α2M, the cells were incubated with pertussis-toxin (1 μg/ml/12h) 24 h after initial transfection. Other details of quantification were the same as above. LRP has been purified from a variety of cells; however, isolation from 1-LN human prostate cancer cells has not been reported. These cells were chosen because insulin-treated 1-LN cells signal briskly when exposed to α2M* while expressing very little LRP (13Asplin I.R. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In these cells the predominant α2M* binding site demonstrates a K d of ∼100 pm (13Asplin I.R. Misra U.K. Gawdi G. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Following affinity chromatography of solubilized cell membrane preparations, LRP was found in low yield, but the predominant protein isolated demonstrated a molecular weight of ∼80 kDa (Fig. 1 A). NH2-terminal sequence analysis yielded NH2-EEEDKKEDVGT-, identical to that of Grp 78 as identified in the Swiss-Prot data base. When macrophage membranes were employed for purification, as expected (19Wu S. Pizzo S.V. Coleman R.W. Hirsch J. Narder V.J. Clowes A.W. George J.N. Hemostatis and Thrombosis: Basic Principles and Clinical Practice. 4th Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 367-386Google Scholar), the majority of the protein obtained was LRP, and only a trace of Grp 78 could be identified by immunoblotting with anti-Grp 78 (data not shown). The association of Grp 78 with LRP was demonstrated by experiments in which antibody to Grp 78 was used to immunoprecipitate the protein from solubilized membranes of both 1-LN cells and macrophages (Fig. 1 A). In these studies, LRP heavy and light chains were co-precipitated with Grp 78. Ligand blot analysis of solubilized membranes from either 1-LN cells or macrophages immunoprecipitated with anti Grp 78 showed α2M* binding to Grp 78 and the heavy, but not light, chain of LRP (Fig. 1 B). The latter result is expected because α2M* binds only to the heavy chain of LRP (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that Grp 78 is a co-receptor with MHC class I histocompatibility antigens (17Triantafilou M. Fradelizi D. Triantafilou K. Hum. Immunol. 2001; 62: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate that the Grp 78 immunoprecipitate from murine membranes also contained MHC class I ∼45-kDa protein (Fig. 1 C) consistent with this report (17Triantafilou M. Fradelizi D. Triantafilou K. Hum. Immunol. 2001; 62: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we next determined whether Grp 78 is expressed on the surface of 1-LN cells. After staining the cells with an antibody against Grp 78, cell-surface expression was confirmed by flow cytometry (Fig.2 A). In light of these observations, we then purified Grp 78 free of LRP from 1-LN cell membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” α2M* binding to the purified preparation was detected by ELISA. The data fit a simple hyperbolic curve, indicating a single clas"

Parasite resistance to current drugs used in the treatment of malaria has lead investigators to seek out new drug targets. Among those targets are proteins and enzymes, which are necessary for cellular division and differentiation. Such targets include the protein prenyltransferases, which are necessary for the post-translational modification of proteins involved in the signal transduction pathways and in regulation of DNA replication and cell cycling (1Maltese W.A.

Several candidate compounds show great promise as antitumor drugs and are currently being tested in clinical trials. The potential for the application of such drugs to inhibit malarial parasite division and differentiation motivates one to examine the properties of the protozoan enzyme with the goal of identifying unique features of this enzyme that would make it a target for the development of parasite-specific drugs.A variety of proteins including small G-proteins, such as Ras, Rac, Rap, Rho, Rab (6Takai Y.

The C20-modified proteins have a variety of cellular functions including intracellular vesicular trafficking. The attachment of the farnesyl or geranylgeranyl groups to these proteins generally promotes membrane association.

Our description of the strong inhibition of P. falciparum PFT (PfPFT) by peptidomimetics illustrated the potential of targeting these enzymes in developing drug therapy for malaria. We describe here the prenylation of P. falciparumproteins in culture from exogenously supplied prenols and inhibition of this process with peptidomimetics. Ohkanda et al. (32Ohkanda J. Lockman J.W.

These findings clearly present PFT as a target for the development of antimalarial drugs. The results presented here provide the first description of PfPFT substrate specificity, further focus the target for inhibitors on competitors of peptide binding, and identify specific P. falciparumproteins for further characterization as natural substrates for prenylation.DISCUSSIONDespite the fact that P. falciparum do not biosynthesize cholesterol (47Mbaya B.

The latter finding is intriguing as mevalonic acid-dependent synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate is yet to be established in the malaria parasite.Our earlier attempts to radiolabel prenylated proteins in P. falciparum with [3H]mevalonic acid were not successful. This could be either attributed to the difficulty of transporting enough mevalonic acid through both the cellular membranes of the erythrocyte and the parasite to sufficiently label the isoprenoid pool, or to an alternative possibility that mevalonic acid is not an intermediate in the synthetic pathway of prenyl diphosphates used in protein prenylation, but the methyl erythritol phosphate biosynthetic pathway is used (50Flesch G. Rohmer M. Eur. J. Biochen. 1988; 175: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 51Arigoni D. Sagner S. Latzel C. Eisenreich W. Bacher A. Zenk H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10600-10605Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Recently, two key enzymes of this pathway, 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, have been identified in Plasmodium (52Jomaa H. Wiesner J. Sanderbrand S. Altincicek B. Weidemeyer C. Hintz M. Turbachova I. Eberl M. Zeidler J. Lichtenthaler H-K. Soldati D. Beck E. Science. 1999; 285: 1573-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Consequently, metabolic labeling of prenylated proteins with radiolabeled prenols was used. Studies with mammalian cells have shown that both [3H]farnesol and [3H]geranylgeraniol can be used to label proteins (53Crick D.C. Waechter C.J. Andres D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 54Crick D.C. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ability of these prenols to serve as prenylation agents, based on our current state of knowledge, requires the conversion of the prenols to their diphosphate derivatives. Enzymes involved in these phosphorylations have been described and are reviewed (55Crick D.C. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Radiolabeled proteins were observed in asynchronous cultures ofP. falciparum-infected erythrocytes incubated with either [3H]farnesol or [3H]geranylgeraniol. A 50-kDa protein was shown to be metabolically labeled with [3H]farnesol but not with [3H]geranylgeraniol. Analysis of the mode of prenylation showed farnesylation. Although proteins of 22–28 kDa were labeled with either [3H]farnesol or [3H] geranylgeraniol, analysis of their mode of prenylation showed almost exclusively geranylgeranylation. It is apparent then that both [3H]farnesol and [3H]geranylgeraniol are phosphorylated to their diphosphates and used for prenylation. Furthermore, some of the [3H]farnesyl diphosphate must be elongated to [3H]geranylgeranyl diphosphate to account for the appearance of [3H]geranylgeranyl groups in 22–28-kDa proteins isolated from cells labeled with [3H]farnesol.Crick et al. (54Crick D.C. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) were able to demonstrate protein farnesylation in C6 glioma cells using [3H]farnesol, but no protein geranylgeranylation was seen. They raised the possibility of differential compartmentalization of the enzymes of isoprenoid metabolism. Our ability to demonstrate protein geranylgeranylation using [3H]farnesol as a precursor, although different from the results of Crick et al. (54Crick D.C. Andres D.A. Waechter C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), also suggests that compartmentalization of prenol metabolism and protein prenylation may be a possibility. This is particularly evident when noting that radiolabeling of the proteins in the 22–28-kDa range was inhibited by the prenyltransferase inhibitors that are specific for PFT and PGGT-I and not the Rab PGGT (42McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, although Rab proteins have been described in P. falciparum (56de Castro F.A. Ward G.E. Jambou R. Attal G. Mayau V. Jaureguiberry G. Braun-Breton C. Chakrabarti D. Langsley G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 80: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the labeled 22–28-kDa proteins are apparently not those Rabs. The ability of PFT inhibitors to inhibit geranylgeranylation at low micromolar concentrations is also not readily explainable. We have reported the presence of PGGT-I inP. falciparum (31Chakrabarti D. Azam T. Del Vecchio C. Qiu L. Park Y.-I. Allen C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but our inability to isolate a stable PGGT-I activity from P. falciparum extracts has prevented a determination of the sensitivity of PGGT-I to PFT and PGGT-I inhibitors.Prenylated proteins labeled with [3H]farnesol are observed in both the 50- and 22–28-kDa ranges during the trophozoite to schizont and schizont to ring stages of differentiation, whereas few prenylated proteins are observed in the ring to trophozoite stage. Our previous studies (31Chakrabarti D. Azam T. Del Vecchio C. Qiu L. Park Y.-I. Allen C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) demonstrated PFT and PGGT-I activity in each of these stages, therefore this suggests that the marked decrease in protein prenylation during the ring to trophozoite transition is because of a decrease in the production of suitable protein substrates for prenylation. It is noteworthy that peptidomimetic L-745,631, a PFT inhibitor, had no effect on the transition of schizont to early trophozoite (31Chakrabarti D. Azam T. Del Vecchio C. Qiu L. Park Y.-I. Allen C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have also shown here that another PFT inhibitor, FTI-277, blocks maturation of the parasite during the trophozoite stage.The indirect immunofluorescence experiment provides evidence for the presence of prenylated proteins in all stages of P. falciparum intraerythrocytic differentiation at distinct subcellular foci. In the segmenter stage, the prenylated proteins show punctated distribution around chromosomes that are being organized into individual nuclei. Interestingly, although we detected insignificant prenylation activity in the ring stage while labeling with prenol precursor, indirect immunofluorescence indicated the presence of prenylated proteins in rings. This suggests the possibility of a low turnover rate of pre-existing prenylated proteins. Treatment of ring stage parasites with both PFT and PGGT inhibitors inhibited prenylation in trophozoites and schizonts. It is to be noted that at the IC50 concentration of 5 μm FTI-277 or GGTI-298 (panels II and IV, Fig. 6), separation of chromosomes into individual nuclei is affected and the whole chromosomal structure appears to be in the form of an unsegregated mass. Therefore, both metabolic labeling and immunofluorescence studies suggest that proteins made during the early to late trophozoite stages may be critical for the trophozoite to schizont transition and the viability of the parasite.Earlier studies reported cell-cycle or differentiation dependent protein prenylation in synchronized HepG2 cells (57Sepp-Lorenzino L. Azrolan H. Coleman P.S. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in the seminiferous epithelium of rats at different stages of spermatogenesis (40Dugan J.M. Allen C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 958-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The studies in HepG2 cells led the authors to suggest that protein prenylation could constitute an obligatory step leading to the duplication of the cellular genome. Several other studies have now shown that one of the main effects of prenyltransferase inhibitors is to alter the progression of cell cycle. PFT inhibitors such as FTI-277 have variable effects on cell cycle progression, causing either a G0/G1 or G2/M block, depending on the cell line. On the other hand, PGGT-I inhibitors such as GGTI-298 invariably induce inhibition of G0/G1 (5Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Oncogene. 2000; 27: 6584-6593Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 58Tamanoi F. Kato-Stankiewicz J. Jiang C. Machado I. Thapar N. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 2001; 37: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recently, FTI-2153 has been shown to inhibit formation of bipolar spindle formation and chromosome alignment (59Crespo N.C. Ohkanda J. Yen T.J. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16161-16167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Another PFT inhibitor, SCH66336, inhibits microtubule association of farnesylated kinetochore proteins CENP-E (60Ashar H.R. James L. Gray K. Carr D. Black S. Armstrong L. Bishop W.R. Kirschmeier P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30451-30457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Our results with FTI-277 may represent a situation analogous to the mammalian cells where bipolar spindle formation is inhibited following PFT inhibitors.The appearance of distinctive prenylated proteins during specific stages of P. falciparum differentiation is a novel observation for parasites. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to understand the role of prenylated proteins in cell cycle progression in malaria. Proteins in the 50-kDa range are found predominately in the trophozoite stage and appear to be of the same molecular weight but different charge as assessed by two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis. The migratory differences could be attributed to differences in phosphorylation or glycosylation. Phosphorylation seems more likely because there is little difference in the molecular weights of these proteins. Earlier studies on protein prenylation in murine lymphoma cells (61Sepp-Lorenzino L. Rao S. Coleman P.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in rat seminiferous epithelium (40Dugan J.M. Allen C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 958-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) also described multiple prenylated proteins of the same molecular weight that appeared to be phosphorylated. Prenylated proteins of different charge and molecular weight were also observed in the 22–28-kDa range from parasites at both the trophozoite and schizont stages. Although several proteins appear to be common to the two stages judging from their position of migration, there is differential labeling with some and at least one protein is labeled specifically at the schizont stage.The specificity of PfPFT for the amino acid at the carboxyl terminus is similar to the mammalian PFT (13Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M. Marshall M.S. Pompliano D.L. Gibbs J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14603-14610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Reiss Y.

The specificity of PfPFT is more similar to that reported for the PFTs of the parasites T. brucei (28Buckner F.S. Yokoyama K. Nguyen L. Grewal A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strickland C.L.

It is difficult, however, to draw firm conclusions about PFT specificity among different species when different short peptides are used in the studies. As noted by Buckner et al. (28Buckner F.S. Yokoyama K. Nguyen L. Grewal A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Strickland C.L. Xiao L. Van Voorhis W.C. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

Azam T. Del Vecchio C. Qiu L. Park Y.-I. Allen C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 94: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and inhibiting labeling of P. falciparum proteins in culture with farnesol and geranylgeraniol. This unusual characteristic of PfPFT implies the potential for development of PFT inhibitors with specificity for the malarial parasite. An in depth analysis of protein prenylation inP. falciparum will provide us with a better understanding of the role of these proteins in malarial cell cycle progression. Malaria continues to be a major disease in tropical areas of the world. Parasite resistance to current drugs used in the treatment of malaria has lead investigators to seek out new drug targets. Among those targets are proteins and enzymes, which are necessary for cellular division and differentiation. Such targets include the protein prenyltransferases, which are necessary for the post-translational modification of proteins involved in the signal transduction pathways and in regulation of DNA replication and cell cycling (1Maltese W.A. Sheridan K.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 2Sinensky M. Logel J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3257-3261"

We investigated how much single photon responses of mammalian rods fluctuate and what mechanisms control these fluctuations. Mammalian rods, like those of toads, generated responses to single photons with trial-to-trial fluctuations 3–4 times smaller than other familiar signals produced by single molecules. We used the properties of the measured fluctuations to constrain models for how the single photon responses are regulated. Neither feedback control of rhodopsin's activity nor saturation within the transduction cascade were consistent with experiment. The measured responses, however, could be explained by multistep shutoff of rhodopsin or a combination of multistep shutoff and saturation."

G protein-coupled receptor cyan fluorescent protein fluorescence resonance energy transfer guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein transmembrane wild type yellow fluorescent protein γ-aminobutyric acid, type B endoplasmic reticulum green fluorescent protein G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 constitute the largest class of transmembrane receptors in multicellular organisms. GPCRs mediate the actions of an enormous array of peptides, hormones, bioactive lipids, neurotransmitters, and sensory stimuli, and they are the targets of many drugs used in clinical medicine. Members of this class of receptor have a similar structural architecture consisting of an N-terminal extracellular domain, followed by a bundle of seven transmembrane α-helices connected by intracellular and extracellular loops, and terminated with a cytoplasmic tail. Therefore, many aspects of GPCR structure, function, signaling, and regulation are conserved.

Whether GPCRs generally form dimers or higher order oligomers is not clear, although a recent study (17Ayoub M.A. Couturier C. Lucas-Meunier E. Angers S. Fossier P. Bouvier M. Jockers R. J. Biol.

Defining the mechanisms that direct the formation of GPCR dimers/oligomers is required to understand how GPCRs activate G proteins and to suggest which GPCRs preferentially form homodimers/oligomers versus those that also interact as heterodimers/oligomers with other GPCRs. Studies of chimeric receptors and computational methods (evolutionary trace and correlated mutations) have suggested that dimerization/oligomerization may occur by exchange of one or more complementary TM domains between receptor subunits (e.g. TM1 and -2 of one receptor are reciprocally exchanged for their counterparts in the second receptor (19Maggio R.

Rice S.Q. Babbs A.J. Hirst W.D. Boyfield I. Wood M.D. Russell R.B. Price G.W. Couve A. Moss S.J. Pangalos M.N. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1203-1210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Pagano A. Rovelli G.

Whether GPCRs generally dimerize in the endoplasmic reticulum is unknown, although this would seem likely. We have used the α-factor receptor (STE2 gene product) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system to investigate the mechanisms of GPCR oligomerization. We have shown previously that this receptor constitutively forms homo-oligomers, as detected in living yeast cells by performing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments between CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors (42Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). α-Factor receptor oligomers can also be detected by showing that GFP-tagged endocytosis-defective receptors interact with untagged wild type receptors to be recruited into the endocytic pathway (42Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 43Yesilaltay A. Jenness D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Analysis of dominant-negative mutants of the α-factor receptor suggests that oligomerization may be important for signal transduction (42Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). To elucidate mechanisms of α-factor receptor oligomerization, we have characterized intracellular compartments where oligomerization occurs and identified receptor domains that mediate oligomerization in living cells. The results implicate which domains of α-factor receptors are involved in oligomerization, address whether α-factor receptors interact by monomer-monomer contact or by exchange of complementary TM domains (domain swapping), and suggest whether α-factor receptors and certain mammalian GPCRs oligomerize by employing similar mechanisms. The S. cerevisiaestrain used in this study was KBY58 (MATa ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his3Δ-1 trp1 ste2Δ) (44Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which carries a complete deletion of the α-factor receptor structural gene (STE2) that allows various combinations of receptor mutants to be expressed from plasmids. Unless stated otherwise, all receptor constructs used in this study lacked sequences encoding the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, which is dispensable for agonist binding and signaling but which is required for receptor internalization and desensitization (45Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Use of receptors lacking their C-terminal domain is necessary to detect FRET between CFP- and YFP-tagged α-factor receptors (42Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), because FRET is exquisitely sensitive to interfluorophore distance, orientation, and mobility. Because preliminary experiments indicated that deletions removing various transmembrane domains of the α-factor caused significant expression defects, it was necessary to express deletion mutants from theSTE2 promoter on high copy plasmids. To generate these overexpression plasmids, we cloned BamHI fragments containing the STE2 promoter and coding region for Ste2Δtail-YFP and -CFP fusions (42Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) into theBamHI sites of the high copy plasmids pRS423 and pRS424, yielding pRS423STE2Δtail-YFP and pRS424STE2Δtail-CFP. The following method was used to delete coding sequences for various transmembrane domains. First, pRS423STE2Δtail-YFP and pRS424STE2Δtail-CFP were subjected to two separate rounds of site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene QuikChangeTMmutagenesis kit) to create a series of constructs with all possible pairwise combinations of in-frame SphI sites that introduced either a 6-bp insertion or substitution encoding an Ala-Cys dipeptide at the following positions within theSTE2-coding region (Fig. 1): bp 4–9 (substitution of amino acids Ser-2 and Asp-3); bp 137–142 (substitution of Ser-47 and Thr-48 immediately preceding TM1); bp 236–241 (insertion between Pro-79 and Ile-80 in intracellular loop 1); bp 341–346 (insertion between Thr-114 and Gly-115 in extracellular loop 1); bp 485–490 (insertion between Thr-155 and Glu-156 in intracellular loop 2); bp 593–598 (insertion between Ala-198 and Thr-199 in extracellular loop 2); bp 707–712 (insertion between Leu-236 and Gly-237 intracellular loop 3); bp 818–823 (insertion between Gly-273 and Thr-274 in extracellular loop 3); bp 897–902 (substitution of Ala-297 and Ala-298 immediately following TM7). Introduction of the Ala-Cys substitution or insertion encoded by the SphI sites at these positions preserved receptor function as indicated by quantitative assays of agonist-induced growth arrest (data not shown). These constructs were then digested with SphI and ligated to generate deletion mutations (Fig. 1), all of which were non-functional, as expected. Subcellular fractionation of yeast cell lysates was performed as described previously by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation (46Stefan C.J. Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 885-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in selective medium to a density of 107 cells/ml and were killed by addition of 10 mm NaN3 and 10 mm KF. Cells were harvested and washed once with 25 ml of sorbitol buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm NaN3, 10 mm KF, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0), once with 1 ml of sorbitol buffer, once with 1 ml of sucrose buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% (w/v) sucrose), and suspended in 1 ml of sucrose buffer containing protease inhibitors 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 20 μmtosylphenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 5 μmpepstatin A, 5 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester. Cells were lysed by mechanical disruption and cleared by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min. The supernatant fraction was mixed with 0.5 ml of 50% (w/v) sucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and layered on top of a 4-ml, 35–60% linear sucrose gradient prepared in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA. Gradients were centrifuged at 150,000 × g in an SW50.1 rotor at 4 °C for 20 h. Fractions (350 μl) were collected from the top of the gradient. Aliquots (150 μl) were assayed in FRET experiments as described below. Aliquots (50 μl) of gradient fractions were diluted 1:2 with 2× Laemmli sample buffer containing 8m urea for use in immunoblotting analysis with antibodies directed against tagged receptors and markers of various organelles (Vph1 (vacuole), Gda1 (Golgi), Dpm1 (ER), and Pma1 (plasma membrane)). Scanning fluorometry of intact yeast cells or subcellular fractions co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged α-factor receptors was used to detect FRET between oligomerized receptors in vivo andin vitro as described previously (42Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In each FRET experiment, fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from four samples that contained the same number of cells (or membrane protein for in vitro experiments) as follows: (a) control cells that do not express tagged receptors; (b) cells that express only CFP-tagged receptors; (c) cells that express only YFP-tagged receptors; and (d) cells that co-express CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors. Fluorescence emission due to FRET between CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors was detected by employing the following three-step procedure. Briefly, this involved irradiation of cells at the optimized λmax for excitation of CFP, recording emission spectra, and subtracting the components of the emission spectra due to cell autofluorescence, CFP emission, and YPF emission due to direct excitation; this resulted in the YFP emission spectrum due only to FRET. Step 1 involved data acquisition and correction for cell autofluorescence. Control cells and cells that co-express CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors were irradiated at 425 nm, near the λmax for excitation of CFP, which gives reduced direct excitation of YFP. The emission spectrum obtained from control cells (no tagged receptors expressed) was subtracted from that obtained with an equivalent number of cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors, resulting in the CFP + YFP emission spectrum. This emission spectrum is a composite of CFP emission, YFP emission due to direct excitation, and YFP emission due to FRET. Step 2 involved subtraction of CFP emission from the CFP + YFP emission spectrum. Cells expressing only CFP-tagged receptors were irradiated at the optimized λmax for excitation of CFP (425 nm). This spectrum was normalized to give a CFP emission peak value identical to the CFP emission peak value of the CFP + YFP spectrum obtained from the preceding step. After normalization, the CFP spectrum was subtracted from the CFP + YPF emission spectrum. This resulted in a YFP emission spectrum composed of a FRET component and a direct excitation of YFP component. Step 3 involved obtaining the YFP emission spectrum due to FRET. To obtain the YFP emission spectrum due only to FRET, it was necessary to subtract the component of the total YFP emission that was due to direct excitation of YFP. To accomplish this, the YFP emission spectra of cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged receptorsversus cells expressing only YFP-tagged receptors were normalized for small differences in YFP expression level. This was achieved by irradiating these two types of cells at the λmax for YFP (510 nm) and recording their respective YFP emission spectra. Because CFP was not excited at this wavelength, these emission spectra quantify only the level of YFP-tagged receptors. The ratio of the YFP emission peak heights of these two spectra was then used as a scaling factor to normalize the emission spectrum obtained when cells expressing YFP-tagged receptors were irradiated at 425 nm, near the λmax for CFP. This normalized emission spectrum was then subtracted from the total YFP emission spectrum obtained in step 2 from cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors. The result was a YFP emission spectrum due solely to FRET. To calculate the apparent efficiency of FRET, we used the following two spectra obtained during the process of generating the FRET emission spectrum described above: the YFP emission spectrum due specifically to FRET, and the YFP emission spectrum obtained by irradiating cells co-expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors at the λmaxfor YFP. Apparent FRET efficiency was calculated by dividing the integrated area of the FRET spectrum by the integrated area of the YFP emission spectrum obtained by excitation at the λmax for YFP. Fluorescence and Nomarski images of cells expressing wild type and various receptor fragments tagged with YFP were captured by using a DAGE cooled CCD camera mounted on an Olympus BH-2 microscope equipped with a DPlanApo100UV 100× objective, as described previously (44Stefan C.J. Blumer K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1835-1841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Endocytosis assays were performed as described previously (42Overton M.C. Blumer K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells co-expressing full-length untagged wild type receptors overexpressed from thePGK1 promoter on the high copy plasmid pPGK (47Kang Y. Kane J. Kurjan J. Stadel J.M. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and various tailless receptor fragments tagged with YFP expressed from theSTE2 promoter on high copy plasmids were treated with agonist (5 μm α-factor). Images were collected before and at the indicated times after agonist treatment. To identify domains of the yeast α-factor receptor involved in oligomerization, we used deletion mutagenesis to identify receptor fragments that could oligomerize as indicated by FRET. Deletion mutants rather than chimeric receptors were used to map oligomerization domains because α-factor receptors from sufficiently closely related species of yeast have not yet been cloned. The utility of deletion mutants was suggested by studies of Dumont and colleagues (48Martin N.P. Leavitt L.M. Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 682-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which indicated that a functional receptor can be generated by co-expressing complementary receptor fragments (e.g. TM1 expressed from one plasmid and TM2–7 expressed from another in the same cell). These findings and similar studies of mammalian GPCRs suggested that receptor fragments can be expressed in a relatively native form (34Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 49Kobilka B.K. Kobilka T.S. Daniel K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J.

A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, synthetic peptides corresponding to certain individual transmembrane segments of the α-factor receptor adopt α-helical conformations when reconstituted in lipid vesicles (51Xie H. Ding F.X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 52Ding F.X. Xie H. Arshava B. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8945-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We generated deletions that removed sequences encoding the N-terminal extracellular domain or various transmembrane domains to produce all possible receptor fragments that allow a CFP or YFP tag appended at the C terminus of the molecule to be located intracellularly (Fig.1). With the exception of deletions removing TM1 or TM7, deletions of single TM domains could not be analyzed because they would disrupt the topology of the receptor. To analyze receptor mutants by FRET, all of the mutant receptors lacked a C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (which is dispensable for signaling but is required for endocytosis (45Reneke J.E. Blumer K.J. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Cell. 1988; 55: 221-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar)) to bring CFP and YFP within sufficient proximity. Each mutant receptor tagged at the C terminus of its last TM with CFP or YFP was expressed from its normal promoter on a high copy vector, which was necessary to express receptor fragments at levels similar to that of wild type receptors (Fig.2 and data not shown). As expected, when expressed alone none of these fragments produced a functional receptor (data not shown). To determine whether receptor fragments could be useful to identify domains involved in α-factor receptor oligomerization, we determined whether FRET could detect association between pairs of complementary receptor fragments that are known to reconstitute a functional receptor (48Martin N.P. Leavitt L.M. Sommers C.M. Dumont M.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 682-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we analyzed cells that co-expressed a YFP-tagged receptor fragment containing the N terminus and TM1–5 with a CFP-tagged receptor fragment containing TM6–7 (Fig. 1), or that co-expressed a YFP-tagged receptor fragment containing the N-terminal domain and TM1–3 with a CFP-tagged receptor fragment containing TM4–7 (Fig. 1). Cells were excited at 440 nm (CFP excitation maximum), and fluorescence emission spectra were recorded. After correcting spectra for differences in protein expression levels, we subtracted the emission spectra obtained with control cells (expressing only the CFP- or YFP-tagged receptor fragment fusion) from the spectrum obtained upon co-expressing the relevant pair of receptor fragments. This procedure yielded the fluorescence emission spectrum due to FRET (indicated by the solid curve in all"

In vascular cells, agents that release NO and donate nitrosonium cation (NO+), such as S-nitrosoglutathione, are potent inducers of the antioxidant protein heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) (Foresti, R., Clark, J. E., Green, C. J., and Motterlini, R. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 18411–18417; Motterlini, R., Foresti, R., Bassi, R., Calabrese, V., Clark, J. E., and Green, C. J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 13613–13620). Here, we report that Angeli's salt (AS) (0.25–2 mm), a compound that releases nitroxyl anion (NO−) at physiological pH, induces HO-1 mRNA and protein expression in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, resulting in increased heme oxygenase activity in rat H9c2 cells. A time course analysis revealed that NO−-mediated HO-1 expression is transient and gradually disappears within 24 h, in accordance with the short half-life of AS at 37 °C (t12=2.3min). Interestingly, multiple additions of AS at lower concentrations (50 or 100 μm) over a period of time still promoted a significant increase in heme oxygenase activity. Experiments performed using a NO scavenger and the NO electrode confirmed that NO−, not NO, is the species involved in HO-1 induction by AS; however, the effect on heme oxygenase activity can be amplified by accelerating the rate of NO− oxidation.N-Acetylcysteine almost completely abolished AS-mediated induction of HO-1, whereas a glutathione synthesis inhibitor (buthionine sulfoximine) significantly decreased heme oxygenase activation by AS, indicating that sulfydryl groups are crucial targets in the regulation of HO-1 expression by NO−. We conclude that NO−, in analogy with other reactive nitrogen species, is a potent inducer of heme oxygenase activity and HO-1 protein expression. These findings indicate that heme oxygenase can act both as a sensor to and target of redox-based mechanisms involving NO and extend our knowledge on the biological function of HO-1 in response to nitrosative stress.

Although the molecular mechanism(s) leading to HO-1 induction by these and other conditions remains to be fully elucidated, a common denominator that characterizes the prompt stimulation of HO-1 under most circumstances is the transient decrease in cellular glutathione levels and a drastic change in the redox status of the intracellular milieu (15Motterlini R. Foresti R. Bassi R. Calabrese V. Clark J.E. Green C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13613-13620Google Scholar, 19Lautier D. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M.

It is not surprising, therefore, that conditions associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) favor the activation of the HO-1/CO/bilirubin pathway, which is now regarded as an important cellular stratagem to counteract and resist different stress insults (3Maines M.D. Annu.

NO has been implicated in a wide range of processes critical to normal functions in the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems; the cytotoxic nature of NO has also been extensively emphasized when excessive production of this gas is triggered under certain pathological conditions (25Darley-Usmar V.

The conception that HO-1 might function to counteract the potential toxic effects evoked by NO first emerged from the discovery that certain NO-releasing agents can stimulate an increase in HO-1 transcript and heme oxygenase activity, resulting in protection against oxidative stress (26Kim Y.M. Bergonia H.A. Muller C. Pitt B.R. Watkins W.D. Lancaster Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5710-5713Google Scholar, 27Kim Y.M. Bergonia H. Lancaster Jr., J.R.

Subsequent reports have confirmed these findings (24Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Google Scholar,29Hara E. Takahashi K. Tominaga T. Kumabe T.

Physiol. 1997; 273: L980-L988Google Scholar), and more recent works have established that NO-related species (such as peroxynitrite and S-nitrosoglutathione) as well as endogenously generated NO and S-nitrosothiols are also capable of HO-1 activation (15Motterlini R. Foresti R. Bassi R. Calabrese V. Clark J.E. Green C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13613-13620Google Scholar, 32Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 729-736Google Scholar). In light of the rather complex and diverse chemistry of the NO group, which enables it to exist in a variety of interrelated redox-activated forms, investigations are now required to explore which additional NO congeners might trigger HO-1 expression. In fact, the biological response(s) mediated by NO cannot be confined solely to the ability of this free radical to interact with important intracellular targets but must be extended to the reactivity of the nitrosonium cation (NO+) and the nitroxyl anion (NO−), 2After the submission of this manuscript, a report by Shafirovich and Lymar (61Shafirovich V. Lymar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7340-7345Google Scholar) revealed that the species generated by Angeli's salt in aqueous solutions at neutral pH is HNO rather than NO−. Although we are aware of these new findings, throughout the text we will refer to the species released by Angeli's salt still as NO− to simplify the terminology of the distinct redox-activated forms of NO. 2After the submission of this manuscript, a report by Shafirovich and Lymar (61Shafirovich V.

Although we are aware of these new findings, throughout the text we will refer to the species released by Angeli's salt still as NO− to simplify the terminology of the distinct redox-activated forms of NO.respectively, the one-electron oxidation and reduction products of NO (33Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar). Each of these redox forms can evoke a variety of biological responses depending upon their concentration and location, the presence of thiols, and the composition of the cellular microenvironment (33Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar,34Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar). In the present study, we utilized rat H9c2 cells to examine the effect of a NO− generator (Angeli's salt) on HO-1 protein expression as well as heme oxygenase activity in an attempt to discern the contribution of NO and its redox forms in the cellular adaptation to the stress inflicted by nitrosative reactions (i.e.nitrosative stress).DISCUSSIONNumerous reports point to a crucial role for the free radical NO in regulating physiological processes; however, scientists are becoming aware that the effects elicited by the NO group can be better appreciated by recognizing the complexity of NO chemistry when applied to biological systems. The reactivity of the NO group is dictated by the oxidation state of the nitrogen atom, which enables this diatomic molecule to exist in different redox-activated forms (33Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar). Therefore, in contrast to NO, which contains one unpaired electron in the outer orbital, NO+ and NO− are charged molecules being, respectively, the one-electron oxidation and reduction products of NO (Equation 1). NO+←−e−NO→+e−NO−Equation 1 These chemical congeners of NO can be generated either exogenously or endogenously and may provoke different effects depending on their concentrations and composition of the surrounding cellular microenvironment (33Stamler J.S. Singel D.J. Loscalzo J. Science. 1992; 258: 1898-1902Google Scholar). For instance, persuasive evidence demonstrated that post-translational modifications by reversible transfer of NO+ to critical sulfhydryl residues (S-nitrosylation) is a ubiquitous signaling mechanism in the control of protein activity, underlying the importance of redox-based nitrosative reactions in cellular function (44Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Google Scholar, 45Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Google Scholar). On the other hand, excessive or uncontrolled nitrosylation can lead to impaired NO metabolism resulting in nitrosative stress and development of disease states (46Hausladen A. Privalle C.T. Keng T. Deangelo J. Stamler J.S. Cell. 1996; 86: 719-729Google Scholar, 47Eu J.P. Liu L.M. Zeng M. Stamler J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1040-1047Google Scholar, 48Patel R.P. Moellering D.

Considerable attention has also been directed toward the nitrosative chemistry of NO−, although its contribution in modulating specific biological activities remains controversial (40Hughes M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Google Scholar). Different proteins and enzymes including mammalian and bacterial hemoglobins (49Gow A.J. Stamler J.S.

Hofmann H. Schindler U. Shutenko Z.S. Cunningham D.D. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14492-14497Google Scholar), as well as decomposition of S-nitrosothiols (34Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 279-285Google Scholar), may give rise to NO−. The fate of NO− within the cellular system is unknown, but this unstable species has been reported to react readily with thiols (41Wong P.S.Y. Hyun J. Fukuto J.M. Shirota F.N. DeMaster E.G. Shoeman D.W. Nagasawa H.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5362-5371Google Scholar, 42Shoeman D.W. Shirota F.N. DeMaster E.G. Nagasawa H.T. Alcohol. 2000; 20: 55-59Google Scholar), and in the presence of molecular oxygen or other oxidants, it can generate other RNS with specific reactivity toward cellular targets (54Patel R.P.

In the presence of hydrogen peroxide and transition metals, NO− but not NO appears to cause loss of cell viability by site-specific DNA damage (56Chazotte-Aubert L. Oikawa S. Gilibert I. Bianchini F. Kawanishi S. Ohshima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20909-20915Google Scholar). Recent reports using donors of nitroxyl revealed opposite effects by showing either NO−-mediated exacerbation of post-ischemic myocardial injury (43Ma X.L. Cao F. Liu G.L. Lopez B.L. Christopher T.A. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. Feelisch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14617-14622Google Scholar) or cytoprotection against neuronal damage (57Kim W.K. Choi Y.B. Rayudu P.V. Das P. Asaad W. Arnelle D.R. Stamler J.S. Lipton S.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 461-469Google Scholar). In another study, the positive inotropic effects of NO− and its beneficial cardiovascular activities have been reported (58Paolocci N. Saavedra W.F. Miranda K.M. Martignani C. Isoda T. Hare J.M. Espey M.G. Fukuto J.M. Feelisch M. Wink D.A. Kass D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10463-10468Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which nitroxyl anion manifests these divergent effects is currently under intense investigation, the possible involvement of this reduced form of NO in the expression of stress inducible genes has not been previously examined. Here, we show for the first time that NO−, generated from the spontaneous degradation of AS, directly promotes an induction of the HO-1 pathway leading to a marked increase in heme oxygenase activity in H9c2 cells. These findings, together with our previous reports on the high inducibility of vascular HO-1 by NO and NO-related species (8Sammut I.A. Foresti R. Clark J.E. Exon D.J. Vesely M.J.J. Sarathchandra P.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 403-406Google Scholar), extend our knowledge on the versatile biochemical features of HO-1 as a redox-sensitive protein and reinforce our view on a possible role for the heme oxygenase pathway in the cellular adaptation to nitrosative chemistry (15Motterlini R. Foresti R. Bassi R. Calabrese V. Clark J.E. Green C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13613-13620Google Scholar, 22Foresti R. Motterlini R.

Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H107-H114Google Scholar). Our study emphasizes that the rate of NO production and the conversion of NO to its redox-activated forms by cellular components might be important factors in determining how the expression of cytoprotective enzymes, including HO-1, is regulated and to what extent these defense systems could counteract the damaging effects mediated by RNS.Of particular interest are the findings that multiple additions of AS at concentrations of 50 and 100 μm over a period of time still induced high heme oxygenase activity levels. This suggests that a limiting factor in HO-1 induction by AS is the short half-life of the NO− generator and that, by mimicking more closely a physiological/pathophysiological scenario of continuous NO− production, it is possible to maintain and prolong the signaling activities involved in AS-mediated heme oxygenase activation. At this stage we do not know whether the concentrations of AS used in our experiments are biologically relevant because sensitive methodologies for the measurements of NO− generatedin vivo still need to be developed. That NO−, not AS, is the chemical entity promoting this response is corroborated by the observations that: 1) decomposed AS does not affect the basal levels of heme oxygenase in H9c2 cells and 2) the thiol donor, NAC, significantly prevents AS-mediated increase in heme oxygenase activity. This is in keeping with the notion that thiols, possibly through the formation of endogenous S-nitrosothiols, are important modulators of HO-1 expression by NO and NO-related species (15Motterlini R. Foresti R. Bassi R. Calabrese V. Clark J.E. Green C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13613-13620Google Scholar, 24Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Google Scholar,59Sawle P. Foresti R. Green C.J. Motterlini R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 403-406Google Scholar). This concept is further emphasized by the fact that BSO, a glutathione synthesis inhibitor, reduced heme oxygenase activation by AS, implicating endogenous glutathione in the preservation of NO− bioactivity and signaling properties. Moreover, our results are indicative of a direct involvement of redox NO species in the transcriptional activation of the HO-1 gene (23Motterlini R. Green C.J. Foresti R. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 615-624Google Scholar). Notably, the effect of NO− appears to be independent of NO but can be amplified by accelerating the rate of NO− oxidation. The discrimination between these two species was possible by comparing the effect of AS with the one elicited by DEA/NO as these agents release either NO− or NO, respectively, with very similar half-lives ( t12=2.3min for AS and t12=2min for DEA/NO). By using a sensitive NO electrode, we verified that in DMEM, 0.5 mm AS generates the same amount of NO as 20 μm DEA/NO; however, at these concentrations, only AS was capable of significantly increasing heme oxygenase activity. Accordingly, the NO scavenger, C-PTIO, did not affect heme oxygenase activation by AS. Of interest is the finding that AS in DPBS releases considerably less NO (4-fold) compared with AS in complete medium; because the increase in heme oxygenase activity mediated by AS is more pronounced in cells cultured with DMEM than those cultured with DPBS, collectively these data indicate that NO− can directly stimulate HO-1 induction, but at the same time transformation of NO− to NO (and eventually other RNS) by cell culture components can amplify the increase in heme oxygenase activity. This is confirmed by the observation that CuSO4, which catalyzes the oxidation of NO− to NO, potentiates HO-1 expression in the presence of AS. Although the exact mechanism of NO−-mediated increase in heme oxygenase activity needs to be fully elucidated, it appears to involve transcriptional activation of the HO-1 gene because both increases in HO-1 mRNA expression and heme oxygenase activity are completely suppressed by actinomycin D. It is plausible that nitrosation of selective targets (possibly thiol groups) localized in transcription proteins are responsible for activation of inducible genes (60Marshall H.E. Merchant K. Stamler J.S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1889-1900Google Scholar) and may account for the pronounced overexpression of HO-1 observed in this and our previous studies (23Motterlini R. Green C.J. Foresti R. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 615-624Google Scholar). It cannot be excluded that formation of other NO intermediates such as peroxynitrite may contribute to HO-1 transcriptional activation because this powerful oxidant can be generated from NO− at physiological pH (55Miranda K.M. Espey M.G. Yamada K. Krishna M. Ludwick N. Kim S. Jourd'heuil D. Grisham M.B. Feelisch M. Fukuto J.M. Wink D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1720-1727Google Scholar, 61Shafirovich V. Lymar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7340-7345Google Scholar) and has been shown to increase endothelial HO-1 protein and heme oxygenase activity in vitro (24Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Google Scholar, 32Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 729-736Google Scholar). The specific transcription factor(s) sensitive to nitrosative reactions that regulate HO-1 induction remains, however, to be identified.When comparing the degree and duration of heme oxygenase activation by NO− with the effect elicited by NO, it is important to assess the way cells adapt to the stress inflicted by these nitrosative species. The use of specific NO-releasing compounds that have the ability to liberate NO at different rates allows us to examine the relative potency of NO in causing the nitrosative stress response. Our data show that DETA/NO, which releases NO at a slow rate generating an amount of ∼0.03 μm × s (see table in Fig. 9), is significantly less effective than DEA/NO (amount of NO release = 10.1 μm × s) at stimulating an early increase HO-1 expression and heme oxygenase activity. This is in line with and partially explained by previous findings showing that, compared with treatment with slow NO releasers, a burst of NO considerably extends the half-life of HO-1 mRNA in human fibroblasts, suggesting that translation-independent mRNA stability could be an important mechanism by which cells sense the NO challenge (62Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Google Scholar). Notably, our data seem to indicate that NO− is less harmful than NO because exposure of cells to AS did not result in any detectable reduction in cell metabolism, whereas DEA/NO, which has a half-life similar to that of AS, caused a significant decline in this parameter. Despite this observation, no increase in apoptosis was detected in cells treated with AS or DEA/NO, indicating that the reduction in cell metabolism by NO could be a reversible process. Although these findings appear to be in contrast with previous reports showing cytotoxicity for NO−, it needs to be pointed out that in those studies higher concentrations of AS were used (2–5 mm) (63Wink D.A. Feelisch N. Fukuto J. Chistodoulou D. Jourdheuil D. Grisham M.B. Vodovotz Y. Cook J.A. Krishna M. DeGraff W.G. Kim S. Gamson J. Mitchell J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 66-74Google Scholar), and exacerbation of cellular damage was observed only when AS was combined with hydrogen peroxide (56Chazotte-Aubert L. Oikawa S. Gilibert I. Bianchini F. Kawanishi S. Ohshima H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20909-20915Google Scholar). Of interest, and in agreement with results using NO donors (62Bouton C. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32688-32693Google Scholar), we also found that NO−-mediated HO-1 expression is transient and gradually disappears once the spontaneous generation of NO− ceases. This may have important implications in the design of agents that are capable of amplifying the induction of anti-nitrosative systems without causing a major threat to the cellular components.In analogy with previous reports showing increased heme oxygenase activity in vascular cells challenged with NO releasers (22Foresti R. Motterlini R. Free Radical Res. 1999; 31: 459-475Google Scholar, 28Motterlini R. Foresti R. Intaglietta M. Winslow R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H107-H114Google Scholar) or nitrosating agents (NO+ donors) such asS-nitrosoglutathione andS-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (15Motterlini R. Foresti R. Bassi R. Calabrese V. Clark J.E. Green C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13613-13620Google Scholar, 24Foresti R. Clark J.E. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Google Scholar, 59Sawle P. Foresti R. Green C.J. Motterlini R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 403-406Google Scholar), we demonstrate in the present study that NO− induces HO-1 mRNA/protein expression and enhances heme oxygenase activity in H9c2 cells. Our findings corroborate the concept that HO-1 is not only highly sensitive to oxidant challenges but can be finely modulated by redox reactions involving nitrosative chemistry. Heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting step in heme degradation to CO and bilirubin, exists in inducible (HO-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HO-1, heme oxygenase 1; RNS, reactive nitrogen species; NO−, nitroxyl anion; NO+, nitrosonium cation; AS, Ang"

The appearance of up to five substitutions (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) in the viral reverse transcriptase promotes resistance to these drugs, and reduces efficiency of the antiretroviral chemotherapy.

Discrimination results from a selective decrease of the catalytic rate constant k pol: 18-fold (from 7 to 0.3 s−1), 13-fold (from 1.9 to 0.14 s−1), and 12-fold (from 13 to 1 s−1) in the case of ddATP, ddCTP, and 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine 5′-triphosphate (AZTTP), respectively.

AZT is a nucleoside analogue acting on viral replication. It is metabolically activated by cellular kinases of the host cell to its corresponding triphosphate form AZTTP before reaching its target, reverse transcriptase (RT). RT is an essential viral DNA polymerase responsible for viral DNA synthesis. AZTTP is a poor substrate for cellular DNA polymerases, but is incorporated into the nascent viral DNA strand by RT with the same efficiency as its natural nucleotide counterpart dTTP. Because AZT lacks a 3′-hydroxyl group (3′-OH) on its ribose moiety, AZTMP is incorporated into DNA and viral DNA synthesis is terminated. The prolonged use of AZT as the sole drug in the clinic has resulted in the emergence of AZT-resistant viruses (1Larder B.A. Darby G. Richman D.D. Science. 1989; 243: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). A set of six specific substitutions on RT (M41L, D67N, K70R, T215Y or F, L210W, and K219E or Q) gives rise to high level AZT resistance (2Larder B.A. Kemp S.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar), the appearance of T215F or Y being the most important substitution. A long awaited mechanism of AZT resistance because of these mutations has been proposed, based on biochemical studies using purified reverse transcriptase: AZT-resistant RT is able to catalyze a primer-unblocking reaction related to pyrophosphorolysis (3Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 4Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M., So, A.G. Scott W.A. Mol.

This “repair” reaction allows the RT to resume elongation of the primer DNA. To circumvent limitations because of resistance and to increase the efficacy of antiretroviral regimens, several other nucleoside analogues such as 2′,3′-dideoxynucleosides (ddNs) have been developed and used in the clinic. Unfortunately, combination therapies using a mixture of AZT and ddNs often give rise to multiple dideoxynucleoside-resistant viruses that are no longer sensitive to either AZT or dideoxynucleosides (5Shirasaka T.

A. 1995; 92: 2398-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Multidrug-resistant RTs isolated from these viruses carry another set of five mutations (A62V, V75I, F77L, F116Y, and Q151M) that were shown to significantly reduce sensitivity to AZT, ddI, ddC, and d4T in vivo (6Maeda Y. Venzon D.J. Mitsuya H. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1207-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Kosalaraksa P. Kavlick M.F. Maroun V., Le, R. Mitsuya H. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5356-5363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Q151M is a key mutation in this type of multiple dideoxynucleoside resistance (8Iversen A.K. Shafer R.W. Wehrly K. Winters M.A. Mullins J.I.

Virol. 2000; 74: 9339-9346Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Q151M appears first during combination therapy with a concomitant increase in the virus load of infected patients. Multidrug resistance and viral fitness are increased further with the sequential appearance of up to four additional amino acid substitutions mentioned above. Q151M-based reverse transcriptase variants have been studied at the biochemical level (10Lennerstrand J. Hertogs K. Stammers D.K. Larder B.A. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 7202-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Ueno T. Mitsuya H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1092-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics of single nucleotide incorporation showed that resistance levels of A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M RT (here referred to as Q151Mcomplex RT) had risen up to 10-fold for ddATP and 14-fold for AZTTP. These results suggested that multidrug resistance is because of an altered recognition of the incoming nucleotide analogue, as opposed to the resistance induced by the repair reaction described previously in the case of AZT. Discrimination of the 5′-triphosphate analogue at the RT active site has been described as a mechanism of nucleoside drug resistance. The incorporation efficiency of an analogue into DNA, and hence its DNA termination potency, depends on two factors. First, the nucleotide analogue has to compete for binding to the RT active site with its natural nucleotide counterpart. This binding competition is reflected in the comparison of the analogue dissociation constant (K d) with that of its natural nucleotide competitor. Second, once the nucleotide analogue is bound to the RT active site, it has to be incorporated into DNA with a favorable catalytic rate constant k pol. The overall efficiency of incorporation of a given analogue is thus the ratiok pol/K d. This ratio offers a precise comparison between the chain termination properties of the analogues. Knowledge of the intracellular nucleotide analogue concentrations in the target cell allows one to predict the average number of chain termination events during viral DNA replication (12Reardon J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4473-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The resistance of Q151M and Q151Mcomplex RT toward various analogues has been studied using purified RT, but steady-state kinetics do not give access to the dissociation and catalytic rate constantsK d and k pol, respectively. Therefore, the precise mechanism by which Q151M and related substitutions confer nucleotide resistance to RT remains to be detailed. We have previously described nucleotide analogues that are modified on their α-phosphate by a borano (BH 3−) group (13Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The R p diastereoisomer of these α-boranophosphate (BH3-dNTPs) analogues acts as a substrate for the RT, and as a chain terminator when it is devoid of a 3′-OH group. Recently, we have determined the precise basis of dideoxynucleotide analogue resistance promoted by the K65R substitution in RT (14Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48466-48472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). K65R RT is responsible for a decrease in the rate of incorporation of the nucleotide analogues specifically. We have also shown that this resistance can be suppressed by the presence of the BH3 group at the α-position of ddNTPs. Indeed, the presence of the BH3 group does not influence the binding of the analogue to the RT active site, but greatly enhances the catalytic rate constant, k pol, of incorporation of the dideoxy analogue specifically. This suppression of drug resistance provides mechanistic proof for the involvement of the catalytic step, but is also an elegant way to overcome resistance in vitro. These results allowed us to propose that these analogues could be similarly useful with other RTs showing nucleotide analogue resistance by a related mechanism. In addition to an ill defined resistance mechanism, the incorporation properties of BH3-dNTP analogues are not known for these clinically important Q151M variants. In this study, we show that a decrease in the rate constant of the phosphodiester bond formation is critical in the mechanism of multidrug resistance by Q151M and Q151Mcomplex RT. Based on this result, we make use of BH3-nucleotide analogues to overcome resistance and recover sensitivity to these nucleotide analogue inhibitors. The wild-type RT gene construct p66RTB served as a template for directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene, to obtain both Q151M and the Q151Mcomplex RT. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The recombinant RTs were co-expressed with HIV-1 protease in Escherichia coli to get p66/p51 heterodimers, which were later purified using affinity chromatography as described (15Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All enzymes were quantified by active-site titration before biochemical studies. DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). γ-32P-Labeled adenosine 5′-triphosphate was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The synthesis and purification of α-boranophosphate nucleotide analogues (R pdiastereoisomer) has been described (Ref. 14Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48466-48472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and references therein). Pre-steady state kinetics were performed using dATP, dTTP, dCTP, ddATP, AZTTP, ddCTP, BH3-ddATP, and BH3-AZTTP in conjunction with wild-type, Q151M, and Q151Mcomplex RT. Rapid quench experiments were performed with a Kintek Instruments model RQF-3 using reaction times ranging from 10 ms to 30 s. All indicated concentrations are final. The primer DNA/DNA oligonucleotides used for the rapid reaction were a 5′-labeled 21-mer primer (5′-ATACTTTAACCATATGTATCC-3′) annealed to a 31-mer template 31T-RT (5′-TTTTTTTTTAGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) for the incorporation of dTTP/AZTTP, a 31A-RT (5′-AAAAAAAAATGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) for the incorporation of dATP/ddATP, or a 31C-RT primer (5′-TTTTTTTTTGGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) for the incorporation of dCTP/ddCTP. For the incorporation of natural nucleotides, the reaction was performed by mixing a solution containing 50 nm (active sites) of HIV-1 RT bound to 100 nm primer/template in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100), and a variable concentration of dNTP in 6 mm MgCl2. Reactions involving nucleotide analogue inhibitors were conducted with excess concentrations of enzyme (200 nm) over the primer/template duplex (100 nm). These conditions were chosen to eliminate the influence of the enzyme turnover rate (k ss), which interferes in the measurements of low incorporation rates (16Brandis J.W. Edwards S.G. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2189-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The products of reactions were analyzed using sequencing gel electrophoresis (14% acrylamide, 8 m urea in TBE buffer), and quantified using photostimulated plates and FujiImager. The formation of product (P) over time was fitted with a burst equation, (P)=A×(1­exp(−kapp×t))+kss×tEquation 1 where A is the amplitude of the burst,k app is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond, and k ss is the enzyme turnover rate, i.e. the kinetic constant of the steady-state linear phase. The dependence ofk app on dNTP concentration is described by the hyperbolic equation, kapp=kpol×[dNTP]/(Kd+[dNTP])Equation 2 where K d and k pol are the equilibrium constant and the catalytic rate constant of the dNTP for RT, respectively. K d andk pol were determined from curve-fitting using Kaleidagraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). For both pyrophosphorolysis and ATP-mediated unblocking assays, the 5′-32P-labeled 21-mer DNA primer was annealed to a 35-mer (5′-GGTCCGTTGCATGCGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) DNA template at a 50 nm DNA concentration. DNA polymerization was initiated by the addition of wild-type, Q151M, or Q151Mcomplex RT (100 nm) and nucleotides (5 μm AZTTP, and 25 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP) for 15 min at 37 °C in RT buffer supplemented with 6 mm MgCl2. The unblocking reaction was started by adding dTTP to reach a final concentration of 25 μm in the presence of either pyrophosphate (PPi) or ATP. In this manner, unblocking is performed in the presence of the next correct nucleotide binding on top of the terminated primer, under conditions approximating those found in the infected cell. Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and products were analyzed using denaturing gel electrophoresis. The % of unblocked primer is the ratio of extension products larger than 25 nucleotides over those larger than 24 nucleotides, multiplied by 100. Modeling was based on the 3.2-Å crystal structure of the complex of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with a DNA template/primer and a deoxynucleoside triphosphate (17Huang H. Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1RTD). Structures were displayed, modified, and analyzed using the graphic program TURBO (18Roussel A. Cambillau C. Graphics S. Silicon Graphics Directory. Silico Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 97Google Scholar). Mutations were manually built and the whole structure was subsequently submitted to several rounds of minimization of the energy function, in which the crystallographic contribution has been removed, using the program crystallography NMR software (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). Preliminary validation of the method was performed on the deposited coordinates of the complex using an identical protocol for minimization. The substitutions A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M have been described to confer resistance to various nucleoside analogues such as AZT, ddI, ddC, and d4T (5Shirasaka T. Kavlick M.F. Ueno T. Gao W.Y.

Infect. Dis. 1994; 169: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the clinic, this resistance pattern is selected in 3 to 16% of viruses isolated from patients treated with AZT and ddI or ddC. Enhanced nucleotide selectivity has been implicated as the mechanism of Q151M-based resistance (23Ueno T. Shirasaka T. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23605-23611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), as in the case of the single amino acid substitutions M184V (resistance to 3TC (24Feng J.Y. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9440-9448Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar)) and K65R (resistance to ddI and ddC (14Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48466-48472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar)). However, it is not known how discrimination is achieved at the Q151Mcomplex RT active site. In other words, it is not known whether nucleotide analogues are poorly bound to the resistant RT nucleotide binding site relative to their natural counterparts, or are bound to resistant RT with the same affinity as their natural counterparts but poorly incorporated into DNA at the catalytic step, as it is the case for K65R RT and ddNTPs (14Selmi B. Boretto J. Sarfati S.R. Guerreiro C. Canard B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48466-48472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it has been shown that AZT-resistant RT (bearing also multiple substitutions such as D67N/K70R/T215F or Y or K219E or Q) is acting through a primer rescue (or unblocking) mechanism preferentially using NTP as pyrophosphate donors (4Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M., So, A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). It was thus of interest to determine whether the substitutions A62V/V75I/F77L/F116Y/Q151M would increase the natural ability of wild-type RT to unblock the analogue-terminated primer. We tested the efficiency of pyrophosphorolytic- and ATP-mediated repair of an AZTMP-terminated DNA primer by RT. A 5′-32P-labeled 21-mer primer annealed to a specific 35-mer template is extended using RT and a mixture of nucleotides in which dTTP is replaced by AZTTP (Fig.1 A, step ❶). For the rescue reaction, the AZTMP-terminated 25-mer is incubated at various times in the presence of dTTP and ATP or PPi. ATP or PPiunblocks the primer, allowing RT to use dTTP now present in the reaction mixture and resume elongation up to a 35-mer (Fig.1 A, step ❷). In the case of ATP as the pyrophosphate donor, the unblocking activity exhibited by wild-type and Q151M RT are comparable (Fig. 1, B and C). The Q151Mcomplex RT shows a slightly impaired ATP-mediated ability to unblock the primer, relative to wild-type. Similar results are obtained for pyrophosphorolysis using PPi as the unblocking agent (Fig. 1, B and C). None of the substituted RT seems to have any improved primer unblocking ability that could account for resistance to AZTTP under various experimental conditions (not shown). We conclude that primer rescue is not involved in multinucleoside drug resistance exhibited by RT bearing Q151M-type substitutions. This finding is consistent with the results detailed below showing that discrimination of nucleotide analogues at the active site can account for drug resistance. Using pre-steady state kinetics with a single nucleotide incorporation, we tested the possibility that either K d or k pol are different between wild-type RT and Q151M-based mutants. Fig.2 shows a typical data set of rapid incorporation of a saturating concentration of dTTP or AZTTP by Q151M RT, with constant values reported in TableI. K d, the nucleotide affinity, is calculated as the nucleotide concentration that gives half of the maximum incorporation rate k pol (Fig. 2). The incorporation efficiency (k pol/K d) is used to calculate the selectivity factor: (k pol/K d)dNTP/(k pol/K d)analogue. A selectivity factor greater than 1 means that the enzyme discriminates the analogue over the natural nucleotide. Finally, the resistance of the RT to the inhibitor is the ratio between the selectivity of the mutant and the selectivity of the wild-type enzyme. The enzyme affinity for dTTP (K d = 14 μm) is very similar to that for AZTTP (K d = 18 μm). However, the k pol (AZTTP) value drops from 17 s−1 for dTTP to 4.3 s−1. This means that the rate of a step before or at the creation of the phosphodiester bond decreases 4-fold when AZTMP is incorporated in comparison with its natural counterpart dTTP.Table IPre-steady state kinetic constants of WT RT, Q151M RT, and Q151Mcomplex RT mutants for DNA templatesAdTTP/AZTTPNucleotideWT RTQ151M RTQ151Mcomplex RTdTTPAZTTPdTTPAZTTPdTTPAZTTPK d(μm)aKd andk pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.17bValue from Selmi et al.(24).7.114189.79.9k pol(s−1)aKd andk pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.13bValue from Selmi et al.(24).13174.37.61.1k pol/K d (s−1μm−1)0.751.81.20.240.790.11SelectivitycSelectivity and resistance were determined as described under “Results.” The selectivity is the ratio of [k pol/K d (nucleotide analogue)]/k pol/K d(nucleotide)].0.4X5X7.2XResistancecSelectivity and resistance were determined as described under “Results.” The selectivity is the ratio of [k pol/K d (nucleotide analogue)]/k pol/K d(nucleotide)].12X17XBdATP/ddATPNucleotideWT RTQ151M RTQ151Mcomplex RTdATPddATPdATPddATPdATPddATPK d(μm)aKd andk pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.7.5bValue from Selmi et al.(24).8.0153.94111k pol(s−1)aKd andk pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.50bValue from Selmi et al.(24).7.2500.69990.38k pol/K d (s−1μm−1)6.70.913.20.172.30.036SelectivitycSelectivity and resistance were determined as described under “Results.” The selectivity is the ratio of [k pol/K d (nucleotide analogue)]/k pol/K d(nucleotide)].7.4 X18 X66 XResistancecSelectivity and resistance were determined as described under “Results.” The selectivity is the ratio of [k pol/K d (nucleotide analogue)]/k pol/K d(nucleotide)].2.4X9XCdCTP/ddCTPNucleotideWT RTQ151M RTQ151Mcomplex RTdCTPddCTPdCTPddCTPdCTPddCTPK d(μm)aKd andk pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.7.9bValue from Selmi et al.(24).5.4124.614.22.1k pol(s−1)aKd andk pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.7.3bValue from Selmi et al.(24).1.98.60.516.00.14k pol/K d (s−1μm−1)0.930.340.690.110.420.066SelectivitycSelectivity and resistance were determined as described under “Results.” The selectivity is the ratio of [k pol/K d (nucleotide analogue)]/k pol/K d(nucleotide)].2.7X6.3X6.4XResistancecSelectivity and resistance were determined as described under “Results.” The selectivity is the ratio of [k pol/K d (nucleotide analogue)]/k pol/K d(nucleotide)].2.3X2.4XThe resistance is determined by the ratio of selectivityWT RT/selectivitymutant.a Kd andk pol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Standard deviations were <20%.b Value from Selmi et al.(24Feng J.Y.

Open table in a new tab The resistance is determined by the ratio of selectivityWT RT/selectivitymutant. Wild-type RT does not discriminate AZTTP relative to dTTP (Table I, part A). Catalytic rate constants for both substrates are the same (13 s−1). However, the nucleotide affinity is better for AZTTP than dTTP. Wild-type RT has a slightly higher overall incorporation efficiency (k pol/K d) for AZTTP (1.8 s−1 μm−1) than for dTTP (0.7 s−1 μm−1). Q151M RT, as shown above (Fig. 2), does not alter nucleotide affinity significantly but induces a drop in k pol from 17 s−1for dTTP to 4.3 s−1 for AZTTP, decreasing the incorporation efficiency 5-fold. Comparison of incorporation efficiencies of wild-type and Q151M RT leads to a 12-fold resistance mainly provided by a k pol effect. When the four other mutations (A62V, V75I, F77L, and F116Y) are added to the Q151M background, the k pol constant further decreases 7-fold from 7.7 s−1 for dTTP to 1.1 s−1 for AZTTP. On the other hand, the affinity for the Q151Mcomplex RT is unchanged (K d = 10 μm). Taken together, these constants bring the AZTTP incorporation efficiency down to 0.11 s−1μm−1, which is responsible for a 7.2-fold discrimination, and a 17-fold resistance. We conclude that resistance to AZTTP is observed with the Q151M mutation on reverse transcriptase at the catalytic step, and this resistance is further increased in the case of the Q151Mcomplex RT. Same single nucleotide incorporation assays were performed to study resistance to ddATP (TableI, part B). As observed previously, wild-type RT discriminates ddATP against dATP. Unlike dTTP/AZTTP incorporation data, the affinity of wild-type RT for dATP (K d = 7.5 μm) is very similar to that of ddATP (K d = 8 μm). However, the catalytic rate constantk pol(ddATP) is 7-fold lower thank pol(dATP). This decrease brings the catalytic efficiency k pol/K d (ddATP) down to 0.91 s−1 μm−1, and is responsible for a 7.4-fold discrimination. Pre-steady state constants of dATP incorporation by Q151M RT are very similar to those measured using wild-type RT. However, k pol decreases 73-fold from 50 s−1 for dATP to 0.69 s−1 for ddATP, resulting in an incorporation efficiency of 0.17 s−1 μm−1. A 18-fold discrimination of ddATP by Q151M RT is obtained, resulting in an overall 2.4-fold resistance relative to wild-type RT. In the case of the Q151Mcomplex RT, the incorporation rate is even lower (k pol(ddATP) = 0.38 s−1), inducing a 66-fold discrimination and a 9-fold resistance. Resistance to ddCTP was analyzed in a similar fashion (Table I, part C). We noticed that like ddATP, wild-type RT originally discriminates ddCTP from dCTP, with a 3-fold lower catalytic efficiency (0.93 s−1 μm−1 for dCTP to 0.34 s−1 μm−1 for ddCTP) originating from a decrease in thek pol value. The Q151M substitution increases this discrimination further: k poldecreases from 1.9 s−1 to 0.5 s−1 yielding in a 2.3-fold resistance to ddCTP. The affinity for the nucleotide analogue remains unchanged. The Q151Mcomplex RT displays a very low incorporation rate down to 0.14 s−1, a 43-fold decrease relative to k pol(dATP). However, because of a higher affinity to ddCTP, the overall resistance of Q151Mcomplex RT to ddCTP remains in the vicinity to that of Q151M RT. We conclude that, as it is the case for AZTTP, resistance to ddATP and ddCTP is observed with Q151M RT at the catalytic step, and this resistance is further increased with Q151McomplexRT. Fig. 3 summarizes the evolution of RT-mediated resistance by discrimination of AZTTP and ddNTPs. Resistance is mostly acquired by the Q151M substitution in the case of AZTTP (12-fold), and ddCTP (2.3-fold). On the other hand, the addition of the other four mutations is required to reach high ddATP resistance levels (9-fold), whereas Q151M alone is responsible for only a 2.5-fold increase. The affinity constant K d does not play any significant role in the discrimination process. Table Ishows that there is no drop in affinity for ddATP, ddCTP, nor AZTTP upon the appearance of resistance substitutions. Instead, there is a direct dependence of Q151M-based resistance to AZTTP and ddNTPs upon the catalytic constant k pol (Fig. 3,A and B). 90% of the initialk pol(ddATP) value drops as a result of the sole methionine substitution"

Immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting, as well as immunocytochemical and cell surface biotinylation measurements, showed that incubation of both stably transduced (HeLa) and endogenous CFTR expressing (16HBE14o-, Calu-3, and mouse tracheal epithelial) cells with 100 μm diethylenetriamine NONOate (DETA NONOate) for 24–96 h decreased both intracellular and apical CFTR levels.

Exposure of Calu-3 cells to nitric oxide donors resulted in the nitration of a number of proteins including CFTR. Nitration was augmented by proteasome inhibition, suggesting a role for the proteasome in the degradation of nitrated proteins. Our studies demonstrate that levels of nitric oxide that are likely to be encountered in the vicinity of airway cells during inflammation may nitrate CFTR resulting in enhanced degradation and decreased function.

The biological effects of NO depend on its concentration, the chemical nature of the target, and the presence of other radicals (12Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J.

RONS have been shown to nitrate tyrosine residues in several proteinsin vitro and in vivo that may result in their accelerated degradation or loss of function. For example, co-incubation of surfactant protein A (SP-A) with ONOO− or tetranitromethane leads to selective nitration of two tyrosines in its carbohydrate-recognition domain and decreases the ability of surfactant protein A to facilitate binding and uptake of Pneumocystis carinii by rat alveolar macrophages (15Greis K.D.

In the lungs, airway obstruction by viscous secretions results in chronic inflammation, with acute exacerbations, followed by secondary colonization withPseudonomas aeruginosa (25Pilewski J.M. Frizzell R.A. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S215-S255Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The resultant bronchiectasis and pneumonia leads to pulmonary insufficiency and premature death in more than 90% of CF patients (26Davis P.B. Drumm M. Konstan M.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1996; 154: 1229-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar).Interestingly, CF-like symptoms (thickened airway secretions and bronchiectasis) are often seen in patients with lung inflammatory diseases. Previously we have shown that NO, generated by chemical donors, or by fibroblasts stably transfected with iNOS, decreases CFTR expression in transfected LLC-PK1 cells (27Jilling T. Haddad I.Y. Cheng S.H. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L89-L96PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that post-translational damage to CFTR by RONS may contribute to development of CF-like symptoms in patients with chronic inflammatory disease of the lung without mutations in the CFTR gene. However, the mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Furthermore, it was unclear if physiological levels of NO and RONS decrease CFTR expression and function in CFTR-expressing airway epithelial cells.In the present study, we show that NO and RONS decrease wild type CFTR protein levels in airway epithelial cell monolayers, and that this is accompanied by a loss of CFTR function resulting in reduced cAMP-activated Cl− currents. The concentration of NO used in our studies was in or below the range measured in vivoduring pathologic conditions (3Zhu S. Ware L.B. Geiser T. Matthay M.A. Matalon S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Wizemann T.M. Gardner C.R. Laskin J.D. Quinones S. Durham S.K. Goller N.L. Ohnishi S.T. Laskin D.L. J.

Decreased CFTR expression results at least in part from nitration of nascent CFTR, and its subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Our results provide the first evidence that NO and RONS can significantly decrease CFTR protein levels and function in epithelial cells.DISCUSSIONSeveral studies have provided evidence that nitration reactions occur in vivo during inflammatory processes. 3-Nitrotyrosine residues, products of the addition of a nitro group (NO2) to the ortho position of the hydroxyl group of tyrosine, are stable end products which therefore, serve as footprints of RONS action. They are readily detectable by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or high pressure liquid chromatography (40Beckman J.S., Ye, Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M.A. Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and are commonly detected in tissues infiltrated by neutrophils and monocytes during infectious and inflammatory processes (1Haddad I.Y.

In vitro, proteins can be nitrated either by ONOO− or by reactive intermediates generated by the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed reaction of reactive species released from activated neutrophils (41Beckman J.S.

Physiol. 2000; 278: L961-L967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also reported the presence of nitrated ceruloplasmin, transferrin, α1-protease inhibitor, α1-anti-chymotrypsin, and β-chain fibrinogen in the plasma of patients with ALI/ARDS. Using quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and high pressure liquid chromatography, we detected levels of protein-associated nitrotyrosine in the epithelial lining fluid of patients with acute lung injury and hydrostatic edema (3Zhu S. Ware L.B. Geiser T. Matthay M.A. Matalon S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) that were at least an order of magnitude higher than those found in proteins in normal human BAL fluid (28 pmol/mg of protein) (45de Andrade J.A. Crow J.P. Viera L. Bruce A.C. Randall Y.K. McGiffin D.C. Zorn G.L. Zhu S. Matalon S. Jackson R.M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 2035-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).It is well accepted that under inflammatory conditions, both infiltrating cells (granulocytes, macrophages) and respiratory epithelial cells produce high levels of NO. Conditions necessary for the formation of the reactive species and nitration or oxidation of respiratory epithelial cell proteins are therefore present in the inflamed lung (12Beckman J.S. Koppenol W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1424-C1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our experiments support the hypothesis that wild type CFTR levels and function can be decreased by reactive speciesin vivo. We used a highly controlled system (human lung epithelial cell monolayers cultured in vitro) exposed to chemical NO donors liberating NO at a concentration that can easily be reached in vivo (∼500 nm) to investigate the mechanism by which NO and reactive species modify CFTR. We found that NO donor treatment causes a significant decrease in CFTR protein levels in endogenous CFTR expressing human epithelial cells without causing either significant changes in total protein concentrations or cell toxicity. Decreased protein levels were accompanied by reduced CFTR function as judged by cAMP-activated Cl− current measurements in Ussing chambers. Moreover, whereas 24 h of treatment with NO donors was sufficient to cause a significant decrease in CFTR expression in 16HBE14o- cells (which express low levels of CFTR representative of those in airway surface epithelium), a longer period (3–4 days) of NO treatment was necessary to induce a significant decrease in CFTR expression and function in Calu-3 cells (a human lung, submucosal serous gland cell line that express very high levels of CFTR). These results suggest that the severity of damage to CFTRin vivo caused by the reactive species may differ between cells in the airway epithelium (16HBE14o-) and those in submucosal glands (Calu-3). It is important to note that in neither case did exposure to RONS result in general cytotoxicity because the integrity of the monolayers and the morphology of the cells tested did not change as a result of NO donor treatment.There are several mechanisms by which RONS may modulate expression and function of CFTR in the respiratory epithelium. Our experiments, in which proteins in cell lysates were directly nitrated using authentic ONOO− (Fig. 9), indicate that CFTR is very effectively nitrated. Furthermore, the effects of RONS are not cell line or expression system specific. This is an important finding because while prior studies have demonstrated a significant effect of NO and reactive species on transgene expression after gene transfer (27Jilling T. Haddad I.Y. Cheng S.H. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L89-L96PubMed Google Scholar), similar effects on endogenous CFTR Cl− channel function have not been described to date.One possible mechanism by which RONS decrease the steady state levels of CFTR is by inhibition of CFTR maturation. Although we have not performed pulse-chase studies in airway cells, previous studies have shown that exposure of HeLa cells, stably transduced with CFTR to 50–100 μm DETA NONOate for 4 h resulted in maturation inhibition of CFTR (46Bebok Z. Sorscher E.J. Matalon S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 163 (abstr.): A842Google Scholar). Whether long term exposure of airway cells to DETA NONOate also leads to maturation inhibition will need to be addressed in future studies. Because RONS simultaneously increased the level of nitrated proteins, including CFTR, in these cells, inhibition of CFTR maturation may be a direct consequence of nitration and degradation of CFTR. This hypothesis is supported by our finding of a further increase in levels of nitrated CFTR in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor, an observation confirmed by immunocytochemistry. This finding indicates that like nitrated α-synuclein, nitrated CFTR may be degraded by the proteasome (38Paxinou E. Chen Q. Weisse M. Giasson B.I. Norris E.H. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Ischiropoulos H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8053-8061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeONOO− was found to be more potent than hydrogen peroxide in oxidizing thiols, inducing heat shock proteins (Hsp70), and enhancing ubiquitination of proteins (47Buchczyk D.P. Briviba K. Hartl F.U. Sies H. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because Hsp70 facilitates endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of CFTR in yeast, this mechanism could also account for the decreased CFTR levels we see in our studies (48Zhang Y. Nijbroek G. Sullivan M.L. McCracken A.A. Watkins S.C. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that inhibition of CFTR maturation is at least partly a consequence of nitration of chaperone proteins themselves. In Escherichia coli, nitration of the Hsp70 co-chaperone DnaJ (47Buchczyk D.P. Briviba K. Hartl F.U. Sies H. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) results in DnaJ misfolding and loss of function. Because the Hdj-2/Hsc70 chaperone pair is necessary for CFTR biogenesis (49Meacham G.C., Lu, Z. King S. Sorscher E. Tousson A. Cyr D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1492-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), it is possible that nitration and loss of function of co-chaperone proteins may also inhibit CFTR biogenesis.It is important to stress that our data do not imply that nitration is the only mechanism responsible for the decrease in CFTR levels and function. In several systems, the biological effects of NO on transport proteins have been associated with the formation of nitrosothiols (50Gupta S. Moreland R.B. Munarriz R. Daley J. Goldstein I. Saenz de Tejada I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 51Lipton S.A. Choi Y.B. Pan Z.H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.S. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar, 52Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A.

Although it should be stressed that the direct reaction of NO with thiols is unfavorable, the presence of strong electron acceptors, such as Fe3+ and oxygen, in biological systems facilitates this reaction through the formation of the nitrosonium ion (NO+) intermediate. Once formed, nitrosothiol adducts stabilize NO and may decrease its cytotoxic potential while maintaining or promoting its bioactivity. This appears to be the instance in neurons where NO donors generating NO+, but not NOper se, resulted in an S-nitrosylation of critical thiols at the receptor for theN-methyl-d-aspartic acid redox modulatory site. This subsequently prevents excess Ca2+ entry into cells and reduced the neurotoxcity associated with NO (51Lipton S.A. Choi Y.B. Pan Z.H. Lei S.Z. Chen H.S. Sucher N.J. Loscalzo J. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1993; 364: 626-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). In contrast, formation of S-nitrosoglutathione in the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle stabilizes the bioactivity of NO resulting in an up-regulation of the Na,K-ATPase activity and subsequent muscle relaxation (50Gupta S. Moreland R.B. Munarriz R. Daley J. Goldstein I. Saenz de Tejada I. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2201-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).There is convincing evidence that NO can also modulate cation channel activity by increasing cGMP. Light et al. (54Light D.B. Corbin J.D. Stanton B.A. Nature. 1990; 344: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a 28-picosiemen cation channel in rat renal inner-medullary collecting duct cells, the activity of which was modulated both by cGMP per se and via PKG-induced phosphorylation. Subsequent studies on cultured collecting duct cells demonstrated that NO released from endothelial cells specifically inhibited the apical membrane Na+ conductance in permeabilized monolayers (55Stoos B.A. Carretero O.A. Garvin J.L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 4: 1855-1860PubMed Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with a NO-mediated inhibition of Na+ reabsorption leading to an increased urinary Na+ excretion (54Light D.B. Corbin J.D. Stanton B.A. Nature. 1990; 344: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 55Stoos B.A. Carretero O.A. Garvin J.L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 4: 1855-1860PubMed Google Scholar). More recently Jain et al. (56Jain L. Chen X.J. Brown L.A. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L475-L484PubMed Google Scholar) reported that NO suppressed the activity of a cation channel in the apical membrane of freshly isolated alveolar type II cells through a cGMP-dependent protein kinase pathway. Furthermore, NO donors (either spermine or PAPA NONOate) added into the apical compartment of Ussing chambers, containing cultured alveolar type II cells grown into confluent monolayers, also inhibited vectorial Na+ transport by inhibiting both apical Na+ entry pathways and Na,K-ATPase (57Guo Y. Duvall M.D. Crow J.P. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L369-L377PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this case the effect of NO was cGMP-independent. Finally, intratracheally instillation of DETA NONOate into the alveolar space of rabbits decreased amiloride-sensitive fluid clearance (58Nielsen V.G. Baird M.S. Chen L. Matalon S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Because of these findings we investigated whether the effects of NO on CFTR expression and function were mediated by cGMP. We found that incubation of Calu-3 cells with cGMP for 96 h did not alter cAMP-stimulated Cl− currents or CFTR function. Similarly, when cells were treated with ODQ (a specific blocker of guanylate cyclase) and DETA NONOate, steady state CFTR levels decreased to the same extent as in cells treated with DETA NONOate alone, indicating that guanylate cyclase activity was not necessary to decrease CFTR levels. These findings are in agreement with our previous report that⋅NO impairs the heterologous expression of CFTR in epithelial cells at the protein level via cGMP-independent mechanisms (27Jilling T. Haddad I.Y. Cheng S.H. Matalon S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: L89-L96PubMed Google Scholar).Taken together, our experiments provide the first evidence that CFTR expression and function can be affected by RONS in vitro, indicating that a similar process may take place in vivounder inflammatory conditions. These negative effects on CFTR function could potentially contribute to CF-like symptoms in a variety of inflammatory airway diseases. Our results provide support for studies investigating CFTR function in inflammatory lung diseases other than cystic fibrosis. The contribution of reactive oxygen nitrogen species (RONS)1 to the development of pathological conditions has been demonstrated for a variety of pulmonary diseases including acute lung injury, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1Haddad I.Y.

RONS have been shown to nitrate tyrosine residues in several proteinsin vitro and in vivo that may result in their accelerated degradation or loss of function. For example, co-incubation of surfactant protein A (SP-A) with ONOO− or tetranitromethane leads to selective nitration of two tyrosines in its carbohydrate-recognition domain and decreases the ability of surfactant protein A to facilitate binding and uptake of Pneumocystis carinii by rat alveolar macrophages (15Greis K.D.

We now show that TMT reaches the external face of the plasma membrane when MCs are induced to degranulate. Analysis of purified recombinant TMT revealed that it is a two-chain neutral protease. Thus, TMT is the only MC protease identified so far which retains its 18-residue propeptide when proteolytically activated. The genes that encode TMT and tryptase βI reside on human chromosome 16p13.3. However, substrate specificity studies revealed that TMT and tryptase βI are functionally distinct even though they are ∼50% identical. Although TMT is rapidly inactivated by the human plasma serpin α1-antitrypsin in vitro, administration of recombinant TMT (but not recombinant tryptase βI) into the trachea of mice leads to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and increased expression of interleukin (IL) 13. T cells also increase their expression of IL-13 mRNA when exposed to TMT in vitro. TMT is therefore a novel exocytosed surface mediator that can stimulate those cell types that are in close proximity. TMT induces AHR in normal mice but not in transgenic mice that lack signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 6 or the α-chain of the cytokine receptor that recognizes both IL-4 and IL-13. Based on these data, we conclude that TMT is an exocytosed MC neutral protease that induces AHR in lungs primarily by activating an IL-13/IL-4Rα/STAT6-dependent pathway.

Nevertheless, these effector cells also have been implicated in asthma and other pathologic conditions. The physiologic changes (e.g.vasodilation, edema, smooth muscle contraction, and leukocyte recruitment) that occur in humans and animals when their MCs are activated are caused by the release of different combinations of preformed and newly synthesized mediators. Neutral proteases are the major constituents of the secretory granules of MC, and granule proteases generally account for >25% of the total protein of a mature MC (6Lagunoff D. Pritzl P. Arch.

Nevertheless, human MCs (including those in the lung) express TMT, and tryptases α, βI, βII, and βIII. Although human MCs probably express more tryptases than mouse MCs, interleukin (IL) 3-developed mouse MCs express the mouse ortholog of human TMT. Mouse TMT is 74% identical to human TMT (17Wong G.W.

Human and mouse TMT differ from the other MC granule tryptases in that each contains a membrane-spanning domain at its C terminus (17Wong G.W. Tang Y. Feyfant E. Šali A., Li, L., Li, Y. Huang C.

Nevertheless, because recombinant tryptases were not used in most of these earlier studies, it remains to be determined what are the physiologic substrates of the varied MC-derived neutral proteases. The pathologic roles of these tryptases in MC-mediated diseases such as asthma also have not been deduced. Tryptases have similar structural properties that hinder their separation in varied purification procedures. Allelic variants of these serine proteases also have been identified (18Caughey G.H.

Even though the primary amino acid sequences of tryptase α and βII are 93% identical (10Miller J.S. Westin E.H. Schwartz L.B. J. Clin.

These technological advances have begun to provide the amounts of pure enzyme needed to address the specificity, physiologic function, and potential pathologic roles of the different members of the chromosome 16p13.3 family of human serine proteasesin vivo. For example, administration of small amounts of recombinant, mature human tryptase βI (but not protryptase βI or mature human tryptase α) into the trachea of MC-deficientW/Wv mice confers protective immunity during aKlebsiella pneumoniae infection of the lung without inducing airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) (5Huang C., De Sanctis G.T.

This beneficial effect is mediated, in part, by the ability of tryptase βI to induce the selective extravasation of large numbers of neutrophils into the bacteria-infected lung.

Although it remains to be determined whether or not TMT is a functional protease, this newly identified granule constituent possesses a membrane-spanning domain at its C terminus analogous to the prohormone tryptic-like convertase furin. It therefore has been speculated that TMT might be a furin/Kex2-like convertase that participates in the post-translational processing of the proteins that are stored in the secretory granules of MCs. We now report that TMT reaches the external face of the plasma membrane of activated MCs where it can cleave and/or interact with proteins/peptides residing in the extracellular matrix and on the surface of those cells that MC contact. TMT, therefore, functions outside of activated MCs. Using recombinant material, we show that TMT is an enzymatically active protease that induces T cells to increase their expression of IL-13. Although TMT can be inactivated by human α1-antitrypsin (A1AT; also known as α1-proteinase inhibitor and serpin A1), this neutral protease is a potent inducer of AHR in mice because of its ability to activate an IL-13/IL-4Rα/STAT6- dependent pathway in the lung. Umbilical cord blood was obtained from normal donors on the day of delivery of full term, newborn infants. Peripheral blood also was collected from patients with asthma. Approval for the study was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committees at St. George Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital. Blood was collected in heparinized tubes (Greiner Labortechnik, Germany). The tubes were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the leukocyte-enriched buffy coats were removed and resuspended in erythrocyte lysis buffer (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The nonlysed cells were washed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in minimal Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, and 100 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin. The resulting cell suspensions were seeded at a density of 106cells/ml and cultured in 50% (v/v) human bone marrow-derived mastocytosis (HBM-M) cell-conditioned medium supplemented with 50 ng/ml recombinant c-kit ligand (KL)/stem cell factor (Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, CA) in 25-cm2 flasks for up to 3 weeks, as described previously (43Li L.

Every 3–4 days, half of the conditioned medium was replaced by fresh medium. Human MCs also were generated by culturing cord blood progenitors from normal individuals for 6 weeks in medium supplemented with KL, IL-6, and IL-10, as described previously (45Ochi H. Hirani W.M.

Slides containing cytocentrifugation preparations of cultured human MCs were placed sequentially in Carnoy's fixative, 0.3% H2O2 in methanol, and normal sheep serum diluted 1:5 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 15, 10, and 10 min, respectively. The cells were washed and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in TBS containing affinity-purified rabbit anti-TMT antibody (Ab) (∼5 μg/ml in TBS) (17Wong G.W. Tang Y. Feyfant E. Šali A., Li, L., Li, Y.

They were then exposed to sheep anti-rabbit Ab conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1.3 μg/ml) in TBS for 1 h at room temperature, followed by a freshly prepared 3,3′-diaminobenzidine solution. For double immunostaining, anti-TMT Ab-treated cells also were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml of an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse monoclonal Ab (designated here as anti-tryptase α/β Ab; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). This Ab recognizes all known human MC tryptases effectively except TMT. These cells were then placed for 20 min in a freshly prepared solution containing 0.2 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml Fast Red TR, and levamisole in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.2). In these immunohistochemical analyses, TMT+/tryptase α/β− cells stain brown, TMT−/tryptase α/β+ cells stain pink, and TMT+/tryptase α/β+ cells stain pink and brown depending on where the respective antigen resides. KL/IL-6/IL-10-developed human MCs also were evaluated for their intracellular and surface expression of TMT by FACS analysis before and after a 15- or 30-min exposure to culture medium containing 0.5 μm calcium ionophore and 5 μg/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma). Calcium ionophore and PMA were used to induce degranulation of the cultured MCs rather than human IgE followed by rabbit anti-IgE Ab because the latter reagent cannot be used with rabbit anti-TMT Ab in the FACS analysis to demonstrate surface expression of the protease. Calcium ionophore and PMA also were used to optimize degranulation and to determine whether or not TMT is rapidly shed from the surface of an activated MC. In these analyses, 5% paraformaldehyde-fixed MCs were incubated (before and after a 1% saponin permeabilization step) on ice for 45 min with affinity-purified, rabbit anti-TMT Ab or an irrelevant rabbit Ab directed against a mouse MC protease in FACS buffer (Hanks' balanced saline solution containing 2% fetal calf serum and 0.1% normal human serum). The resulting cells were washed extensively with FACS buffer, incubated at 4 °C with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit Ab (Jackson ImmnoResearch), and then analyzed using a Becton-Dickinson FACSort, as described previously for chemokine receptor expression (45Ochi H.

In this way, recombinant pro-TMT could be proteolytically activated by EK (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) after its purification from the insect cell-conditioned medium. Naturally occurring TMT contains a 40-mer, membrane-spanning domain at its C terminus (17Wong G.W. Tang Y. Feyfant E. Šali A., Li, L., Li, Y. Huang C. Friend D.S. Krilis S.A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30784-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Protein modeling studies revealed that this C-terminal domain is not part of the 240-residue catalytic domain of the protease (17Wong G.W. Tang Y. Feyfant E. Šali A., Li, L., Li, Y. Huang C. Friend D.S. Krilis S.A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30784-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As noted under “Results,” TMT normally is a membrane-bound protease even after MCs are induced to degranulate. Recombinant TMT cannot be purified easily if it contains its C-terminal membrane-spanning domain. More important, no in vivo experiment can be carried out with the natural product because the protease would simply insert into the plasma membrane of any cell it touches. To overcome these technical limitations, residues 245–284 in human TMT were replaced by the 8-residue FLAG peptide Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys. The FLAG peptide was added because this short peptide does not appear to influence the substrate specificities of other tryptases. The epitope also enables the rapid purification of recombinant pro-TMT from the insect cell-conditioned medium using an anti-FLAG immunoaffinity column. Recombinant human tryptase βI was used as a control in the TMT experiments; it also has the FLAG peptide at its C terminus. Recombinant TMT was generated sterilely in High Five™ insect cells cultured in protein-free medium. Because all proteins in the conditioned medium are derived from the TMT-expressing insect cells in the cultures, the recombinant tryptase zymogen can be purified relatively easily. Another advantage of this expression system over a typical mammalian cell expression system is that one does not have to be concerned about biologically active factors (e.g. serpins that inactivate TMT) in the fetal calf serum routinely used in the latter culture systems. TMT was not generated in Escherichia coli because of the obvious concern of lipopolysaccharide contamination with this expression system, which would adversely impact the interpretation of the in vivo data. High Five insect cells, infected with a low titer of baculovirus encoding pro-TMT (∼ 8 million recombinant virus particles/6 million insect cells), were cultured in protein-free X-press medium for 6–7 days. Typically ∼750 ml of conditioned medium was loaded at 4 °C onto a 1-ml column containing anti-FLAG M2 Ab (Sigma). After the column was washed with 250 ml of TBS (pH 7.0), 0.1 m glycine HCl buffer (pH 3.5) was added to elute the bound recombinant pro-TMT. Nine to ten 1-ml fractions were collected into tubes containing 20–40 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Samples of the eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of Coomassie Blue+ proteins and for immunoreactive TMT using either anti-FLAG Ab or anti-TMT Ab (17Wong G.W. Tang Y. Feyfant E. Šali A., Li, L., Li, Y. Huang C. Friend D.S. Krilis S.A. Stevens R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30784-30793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Those column fractions that contained recombinant pro-TMT were pooled; the final protein concentration was estimated using the micro-BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). As assessed by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate endotoxin assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), the level of lipopolysaccharide was below detection (<0.06 enzyme units) in various 5-μg preparations of recombinant TMT used in this study. Comparison of the primary amino acids of the zymogen forms of human TMT, tryptase α, tryptase βI, and tryptase βII revealed that pro-TMT has 10 Cys residues, whereas all other MC tryptases have only 8. The 2 extra Cys residues are located at positions −12 in TMT propeptide and +108 in its catalytic domain. Because these findings raised the possibility of an additional intramolecular disulfide bond linking the propeptide and catalytic domain, ∼5 μg of recombinant pro-TMT was digested with 0.013 units of EK at 37 °C for 2 h in 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 5.5). Half of the sample was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol; the other half was boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer lacking the reducing reagent. After electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Each protein blot was exposed to 15 ml of TBS containing 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% goat serum, and 4 μg/ml mouse anti-FLAG Ab (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. The treated blot was washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. It was then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 15 ml of TBS containing 5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% goat serum, and a 1,000-fold dilution of a stock solution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ab (Bio-Rad). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Geno Technologies, St. Louis, MO) and BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) is often used to radiolabel the catalytic triad Ser in enzymatically active serine proteases. Thus, recombinant pro-TMT and mature TMT (∼15 μg) were suspended in 50 μl of 0.5m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing ∼ 8 μCi of [3H]DFP (4 Ci/nmol; 1 Ci = 37 gigabecquerels;Amersham Biosciences).

In the present study, we used an LRP1B minireceptor (mLRP1B4), which mimics the function and trafficking of LRP1B, to explore the roles of LRP1B on the plasminogen activation system. We found that mLRP1B4 and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) form immunoprecipitable complexes on the cell surface in the presence of complexes of uPA and its inhibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). However, compared with cells expressing the analogous LRP minireceptor (mLRP4), cells expressing mLRP1B4 display a substantially slower rate of uPA·PAI-1 complex internalization. Expression of mLRP1B4, or an mLRP4 mutant deficient in endocytosis, leads to an accumulation of uPAR at the cell surface and increased cell-associated uPA and PAI-1 when compared with cells expressing mLRP4. In addition, we found that expression of mLRP1B or the mLRP4 endocytosis mutant impairs the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR on the cell surface and that this correlates with a diminished rate of cell migration.

When the regulation of this system is disrupted, as occurs in the pathogenesis of cancer, malignant cells are able to invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to distant body regions (1Andreasen P.A.

Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)1 catalyzes the formation of plasmin from its inactive precursor, plasminogen. The activity of uPA is regulated by two proteins, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked uPA receptor (uPAR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). The binding of uPA to uPAR at the cell surface greatly increases its catalytic rate. In contrast, uPA is inactivated by binding to PAI-1. When active uPA is bound to uPAR, it is not internalized but remains at the cell surface. However, when receptor-bound uPA is complexed to its inhibitor, PAI-1, the complex is rapidly internalized and degraded. The mechanism by which this occurs was unknown until it was determined that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is responsible for this process (4Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B.

The regeneration of unoccupied uPAR at the cell surface is thus critical for the maintenance of plasminogen activation and for regulation of cellular migration and invasion (8Zhang J.C. Sakthivel R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The LDLR family previously contained two large members, LRP (LRP1), a dimer of 515- and 85-kDa subunits, and its closely related homolog, megalin (LRP2), a single species of ∼600 kDa. LRP1B is more closely related to LRP (59% identity at the amino acid level) than to megalin (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Protein domain structure comparison of LRP and LRP1B reveals that the overall organization of the two proteins is almost identical, except for the fragments encoded by the two extra exons in LRP1B (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similar to LRP, LRP1B contains four putative ligand-binding domains (I, II, III, and IV from the N terminus) which consist of 2, 8, 10, and 12 cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats, respectively. The one additional ligand-binding repeat in domain IV of LRP1B is encoded by one of its extra exons. Like LRP, LRP1B contains a furin endopeptidase processing site between its fourth ligand binding domain and transmembrane region. Once cleaved by furin in the Golgi, LRP1B exists as a noncovalently associated heterodimer, consisting of a large extracellular subunit and a smaller transmembrane subunit (12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similar to that of LRP, the cytoplasmic tail of LRP1B contains five potential endocytosis motifs: two NPXY motifs, two dileucine motifs, and one YXXL motif. However, between the two NPXY motifs, LRP1B contains a unique insertion of a 33-amino acid sequence (encoded by the other extra exon), which is not present in LRP (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar,12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY sequences of LRP, serves as the dominant signal for receptor-mediated endocytosis (13Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).In a previous study, we demonstrated that LRP1B can bind and internalize single chain urokinase (scuPA) and PAI-1, two components of the plasminogen activation system (12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further explore the role of LRP1B in modulation of the plasminogen activation system. By using an LRP1B minireceptor, which mimics the function and trafficking of LRP1B, we show that the expression of LRP1B impairs the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR on the cell surface and diminishes the rate of cell migration.DISCUSSIONThe structural similarity between LRP and LRP1B suggests that those two giant receptors may bind similar sets of ligands and display overlapping functions. In support of this, we found that at the cell surface, LRP1B, like LRP, forms immunoprecipitable complexes with uPAR in the presence of uPA·PAI-1 complexes and that LRP1B can also mediate the delivery of uPA·PAI-1 to the lysosome for degradation (data not shown). On the other hand, the unique sequences in LRP1B suggest that it may also have functions distinct from those of LRP. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of mLRP4 enhances unoccupied uPAR regeneration on the cell surface, whereas expression of mLRP1B4, as well as an mLRP4 endocytosis-defective mutant, causes the accumulation of cell surface uPAR and cell-associated uPA and PAI-1, impairs unoccupied uPAR regeneration on the cell surface, and diminishes cell migration.mLRP1B4, like the mLRP4 endocytosis mutant, displays a substantially slower rate of uPA·PAI-1 internalization when compared with mLRP4. The cytoplasmic tails of LRP1B and LRP contain the same five potential endocytosis motifs, including two NPXY motifs, two dileucine motifs, and one YXXL motif. However, the tail of LRP1B has a unique insertion of 33 amino acid residues that is not present in the tail of LRP (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This insert may be responsible for the slower internalization rate of LRP1B by binding cytosolic adapter proteins and masking the neighboring endocytosis signal(s). This slower endocytosis mediated by LRP1B may allow for more sustained signal transduction upon ligand binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent studies have revealed new roles for several members of the LDLR family as obligate components of signal transduction pathways (23Li Y. Cam J. Bu G. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 23: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The 33-amino acid insert in the tail of LRP1B may itself, or together with a common motif in the LRP tail, also interact with some cytosolic proteins that participate in signal transduction. Future studies similar to those that have dissected the signals within the cytoplasmic tails of LRP and apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (24Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J.

This process allows for the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR, immobilization of fresh uPA in the form of its zymogen, pro-uPA, and the eventual re-expression of active uPA at the cell surface (8Zhang J.C.

Failure to remove uPA·PAI-1complexes from the cell surface may diminish the cellular capacity for plasminogen activation and may impair cell migration/invasion mediated by uPAR (8Zhang J.C.

CHO cells bearing mLRP1B4 display approximately a 90% reduction in ligand endocytosis when compared with CHO cells expressing mLRP4. The physiological significance of this may be that LRP1B acts in a dominant-negative fashion to limit the effectiveness of LRP- or caveolae-mediated uPA·PAI-1·uPAR clearance. If cells co-express LRP and LRP1B, the net result of uPAR regeneration likely depends on the relative expression of the two receptors. For example, if the expression level of LRP1B in a given cell type exceeds that of LRP, LRP1B may function as a dominant-negative regulator for the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR at the cell surface and therefore inhibit uPAR-mediated cell migration. A model depicting this hypothesis is shown in Fig. 6. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that expression of mLRP1B4 in CHO cells impairs the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR on the cell surface and reduces cell migration. Although our previous studies with LRP minireceptors have clearly demonstrated that these receptors traffic and function similarly to their endogenous full-length receptor (13Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,20Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is important to realize that the use of minireceptors may abolish or diminish the functional differences between full-length LRP and LRP1B. Future studies with endogenous LRP1B should help us to fully understand the biological functions of this receptor.In addition to regulating plasminogen activation at the cell surface, recent studies indicate that uPAR possesses other cellular activities, including an ability to generate intracellular signal transduction, to regulate integrin function, and to directly bind vitronectin (27Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Simon D.I. Waltz D.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Stockinger H. Binder B.R. Thromb.

Thus, it is possible that LRP1B expression also mediates uPAR interaction with integrin subunits and uPAR/integrin-mediated signaling.Two lines of evidence strongly support an important and apparently causal role for the plasminogen activation system in cancer metastasis: the results from experimental model systems with animal tumor metastasis and the finding that high levels of uPA, PAI-1, and uPAR in many tumor types predict poor patient prognoses (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). The discovery that LRP mediates the internalization of uPA·PAI-1·uPAR complexes has generated interest in the role of LRP in malignant transformed cells. Although the role of LRP in tumor progression remains unclear at present, several studies show a correlation between LRP expression and human cancer cell invasion and metastasis (9Li Y. Wood N.

LRP1B was originally discovered as a putative tumor suppressor gene and is frequently inactivated in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar) and in high grade of urothelial cancer (37Langbein S. Szakacs O. Wilhelm M. Sukosd F. Weber S. Jauch A. Lopez Beltran A. Alken P. Kalble T. Kovacs G. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Therefore, our present results warrant further studies on the potential role of LRP1B as a tumor suppressor and in inhibition of tumor metastasis.In summary, using an LRP1B minireceptor, we have demonstrated that expression of LRP1B impairs unoccupied uPAR regeneration on the cell surface and diminishes cell migration. These results suggest that LRP1B mimics an LRP endocytosis mutant and negatively regulates uPAR regeneration and function. The plasminogen activation system consists of a cascade of enzymes and plays a central role in many physiological processes requiring the degradation of basement membrane and components of the extracellular matrix. When the regulation of this system is disrupted, as occurs in the pathogenesis of cancer, malignant cells are able to invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to distant body regions (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar, 2Collen D. Thromb.

Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)1 catalyzes the formation of plasmin from its inactive precursor, plasminogen. The activity of uPA is regulated by two proteins, the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked uPA receptor (uPAR) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). The binding of uPA to uPAR at the cell surface greatly increases its catalytic rate. In contrast, uPA is inactivated by binding to PAI-1. When active uPA is bound to uPAR, it is not internalized but remains at the cell surface. However, when receptor-bound uPA is complexed to its inhibitor, PAI-1, the complex is rapidly internalized and degraded. The mechanism by which this occurs was unknown until it was determined that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is responsible for this process (4Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following the internalization, uPAR and LRP recycle back to the cell surface, while uPA and PAI-1 are degraded in lysosomes (4Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L.

The regeneration of unoccupied uPAR at the cell surface is thus critical for the maintenance of plasminogen activation and for regulation of cellular migration and invasion (8Zhang J.C. Sakthivel R.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). LRP1B is a recently discovered member of the LDLR family (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The LDLR family previously contained two large members, LRP (LRP1), a dimer of 515- and 85-kDa subunits, and its closely related homolog, megalin (LRP2), a single species of ∼600 kDa. LRP1B is more closely related to LRP (59% identity at the amino acid level) than to megalin (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar). Protein domain structure comparison of LRP and LRP1B reveals that the overall organization of the two proteins is almost identical, except for the fragments encoded by the two extra exons in LRP1B (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similar to LRP, LRP1B contains four putative ligand-binding domains (I, II, III, and IV from the N terminus) which consist of 2, 8, 10, and 12 cysteine-rich ligand-binding repeats, respectively. The one additional ligand-binding repeat in domain IV of LRP1B is encoded by one of its extra exons. Like LRP, LRP1B contains a furin endopeptidase processing site between its fourth ligand binding domain and transmembrane region. Once cleaved by furin in the Golgi, LRP1B exists as a noncovalently associated heterodimer, consisting of a large extracellular subunit and a smaller transmembrane subunit (12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similar to that of LRP, the cytoplasmic tail of LRP1B contains five potential endocytosis motifs: two NPXY motifs, two dileucine motifs, and one YXXL motif. However, between the two NPXY motifs, LRP1B contains a unique insertion of a 33-amino acid sequence (encoded by the other extra exon), which is not present in LRP (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar,12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY sequences of LRP, serves as the dominant signal for receptor-mediated endocytosis (13Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated that LRP1B can bind and internalize single chain urokinase (scuPA) and PAI-1, two components of the plasminogen activation system (12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further explore the role of LRP1B in modulation of the plasminogen activation system. By using an LRP1B minireceptor, which mimics the function and trafficking of LRP1B, we show that the expression of LRP1B impairs the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR on the cell surface and diminishes the rate of cell migration. DISCUSSIONThe structural similarity between LRP and LRP1B suggests that those two giant receptors may bind similar sets of ligands and display overlapping functions. In support of this, we found that at the cell surface, LRP1B, like LRP, forms immunoprecipitable complexes with uPAR in the presence of uPA·PAI-1 complexes and that LRP1B can also mediate the delivery of uPA·PAI-1 to the lysosome for degradation (data not shown). On the other hand, the unique sequences in LRP1B suggest that it may also have functions distinct from those of LRP. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of mLRP4 enhances unoccupied uPAR regeneration on the cell surface, whereas expression of mLRP1B4, as well as an mLRP4 endocytosis-defective mutant, causes the accumulation of cell surface uPAR and cell-associated uPA and PAI-1, impairs unoccupied uPAR regeneration on the cell surface, and diminishes cell migration.mLRP1B4, like the mLRP4 endocytosis mutant, displays a substantially slower rate of uPA·PAI-1 internalization when compared with mLRP4. The cytoplasmic tails of LRP1B and LRP contain the same five potential endocytosis motifs, including two NPXY motifs, two dileucine motifs, and one YXXL motif. However, the tail of LRP1B has a unique insertion of 33 amino acid residues that is not present in the tail of LRP (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Lisitsyn N.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1961-1967PubMed Google Scholar, 12Liu C.X., Li, Y. Obermoeller-McCormick L.M. Schwartz A.L. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28889-28896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This insert may be responsible for the slower internalization rate of LRP1B by binding cytosolic adapter proteins and masking the neighboring endocytosis signal(s). This slower endocytosis mediated by LRP1B may allow for more sustained signal transduction upon ligand binding. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent studies have revealed new roles for several members of the LDLR family as obligate components of signal transduction pathways (23Li Y. Cam J. Bu G. Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 23: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The 33-amino acid insert in the tail of LRP1B may itself, or together with a common motif in the LRP tail, also interact with some cytosolic proteins that participate in signal transduction. Future studies similar to those that have dissected the signals within the cytoplasmic tails of LRP and apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (24Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J.

LRP-mediated internalization of uPA·PAI-1·uPAR complexes results in the lysosomal degradation of uPA and PAI-1 and recycling of uPAR to the cell surface (4Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Conese M.

This process allows for the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR, immobilization of fresh uPA in the form of its zymogen, pro-uPA, and the eventual re-expression of active uPA at the cell surface (8Zhang J.C.

Failure to remove uPA·PAI-1complexes from the cell surface may diminish the cellular capacity for plasminogen activation and may impair cell migration/invasion mediated by uPAR (8Zhang J.C.

CHO cells bearing mLRP1B4 display approximately a 90% reduction in ligand endocytosis when compared with CHO cells expressing mLRP4. The physiological significance of this may be that LRP1B acts in a dominant-negative fashion to limit the effectiveness of LRP- or caveolae-mediated uPA·PAI-1·uPAR clearance. If cells co-express LRP and LRP1B, the net result of uPAR regeneration likely depends on the relative expression of the two receptors. For example, if the expression level of LRP1B in a given cell type exceeds that of LRP, LRP1B may function as a dominant-negative regulator for the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR at the cell surface and therefore inhibit uPAR-mediated cell migration. A model depicting this hypothesis is shown in Fig. 6. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that expression of mLRP1B4 in CHO cells impairs the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR on the cell surface and reduces cell migration. Although our previous studies with LRP minireceptors have clearly demonstrated that these receptors traffic and function similarly to their endogenous full-length receptor (13Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,20Li Y. Lu W. Marzolo M.P. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is important to realize that the use of minireceptors may abolish or diminish the functional differences between full-length LRP and LRP1B. Future studies with endogenous LRP1B should help us to fully understand the biological functions of this receptor.In addition to regulating plasminogen activation at the cell surface, recent studies indicate that uPAR possesses other cellular activities, including an ability to generate intracellular signal transduction, to regulate integrin function, and to directly bind vitronectin (27Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Simon D.I. Waltz D.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Stockinger H. Binder B.R. Thromb.

Thus, it is possible that LRP1B expression also mediates uPAR interaction with integrin subunits and uPAR/integrin-mediated signaling.Two lines of evidence strongly support an important and apparently causal role for the plasminogen activation system in cancer metastasis: the results from experimental model systems with animal tumor metastasis and the finding that high levels of uPA, PAI-1, and uPAR in many tumor types predict poor patient prognoses (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). The discovery that LRP mediates the internalization of uPA·PAI-1·uPAR complexes has generated interest in the role of LRP in malignant transformed cells.

CHO cells bearing mLRP1B4 display approximately a 90% reduction in ligand endocytosis when compared with CHO cells expressing mLRP4. The physiological significance of this may be that LRP1B acts in a dominant-negative fashion to limit the effectiveness of LRP- or caveolae-mediated uPA·PAI-1·uPAR clearance. If cells co-express LRP and LRP1B, the net result of uPAR regeneration likely depends on the relative expression of the two receptors. For example, if the expression level of LRP1B in a given cell type exceeds that of LRP, LRP1B may function as a dominant-negative regulator for the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR at the cell surface and therefore inhibit uPAR-mediated cell migration. A model depicting this hypothesis is shown in Fig. 6. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have demonstrated that expression of mLRP1B4 in CHO cells impairs the regeneration of unoccupied uPAR on the cell surface and reduces cell migration. Although our previous studies with LRP minireceptors have clearly demonstrated that these receptors traffic and function similarly to their endogenous full-length receptor (13Li Y.

Chem. 2001; 276: 18000-18006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is important to realize that the use of minireceptors may abolish or diminish the functional differences between full-length LRP and LRP1B. Future studies with endogenous LRP1B should help us to fully understand the biological functions of this receptor. In addition to regulating plasminogen activation at the cell surface, recent studies indicate that uPAR possesses other cellular activities, including an ability to generate intracellular signal transduction, to regulate integrin function, and to directly bind vitronectin (27Chapman H.A. Wei Y. Simon D.I. Waltz D.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 291-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Koshelnick Y. Ehart M. Stockinger H. Binder B.R. Thromb.

Thus, it is possible that LRP1B expression also mediates uPAR interaction with integrin subunits and uPAR/integrin-mediated signaling. Two lines of evidence strongly support an important and apparently causal role for the plasminogen activation system in cancer metastasis: the results from experimental model systems with animal tumor metastasis and the finding that high levels of uPA, PAI-1, and uPAR in many tumor types predict poor patient prognoses (1Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1439) Google Scholar). The discovery that LRP mediates the internalization of uPA·PAI-1·uPAR complexes has generated interest in the role of LRP in malignant transformed cells. Although the role of LRP in tumor progression remains unclear at present, several studies show a correlation between LRP expression and human cancer cell invasion and metastasis (9Li Y. Wood N.

LRP1B was originally discovered as a putative tumor suppressor gene and is frequently inactivated in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines (11Liu C.X. Musco S. Lisitsina N.M. Forgacs E. Minna J.D.

Therefore, our present results warrant further studies on the potential role of LRP1B as a tumor suppressor and in inhibition of tumor metastasis. In summary, using an LRP1B minireceptor, we have demonstrated that expression of LRP1B impairs unoccupied uPAR regeneration on the cell surface and diminishes cell migration. These results suggest that LRP1B mimics an LRP endocytosis mutant and negatively regulates uPAR regeneration and function."
https://openalex.org/W2005415901,"The small GTPase Ras family regulates a variety of cell functions including proliferation and differentiation. Here we have identified novel Ras members, human Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2, belonging to a distinct branch of the GTPase family. Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2 specifically expressed in heart and brain share 30–40% overall identity with other members of Ras family, however, they have the following characteristic substitutions at highly conserved regions among the Ras family. 1) Thr-63 and Ser-65 in Di-Ras are substituted for Ala-59 and Gln-61 positions in Ha-Ras, respectively, that are known to be critical for GTP hydrolysis. 2) Within the effector domains, Di-Ras has Ile at a position corresponding to Asp-33 in Ha-Ras, which is important for its interaction with the downstream effector Raf. As predicted by these substitutions, Di-Ras has only a quite low level of GTPase activity and exists predominantly as a GTP-bound form upon its expression in living cells. Moreover, Di-Ras fails to interact with the Ras-binding domain of Raf, resulting in no stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Interestingly, introduction of Di-Ras into HEK293T cells induces large cellular vacuolation. These findings raise the possibility that Di-Ras might regulate cell morphogenesis in a manner distinct from other members of Ras family.

Interestingly, introduction of Di-Ras into HEK293T cells induces large cellular vacuolation. These findings raise the possibility that Di-Ras might regulate cell morphogenesis in a manner distinct from other members of Ras family. The small GTPase Ras family acts as a molecular switch that regulates a wide range of cell functions including proliferation and differentiation (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Cancer. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Google Scholar, 3Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Google Scholar). Ras is activated in response to a variety of extracellular signals, resulting in stimulation of tyrosine kinases either directly or indirectly. The small GTPase, which cycles between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states, is activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors that enhance the exchange of bound GDP for GTP and is deactivated by GTPase-activating proteins that increase the intrinsic rate of hydrolysis of bound GTP. The GTP-bound form of Ras associates with several effector molecules, most notably members of the Raf family, the RalGDS family and phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Amino acid residues 32–40 of Ras are important for its interaction with effector molecules and designated as the “effector domain” (4Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Google Scholar). The biological consequences of their interactions depend greatly on the cell type and on the context of other signaling events. The members of Ras family, at least 13 at present, are characterized by extensive similarities in their effector domains (5Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6776-6782Google Scholar). Besides three Ras proteins (Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras, and N-Ras), there are four Rap proteins (Rap1A, Rap1B, Rap2A, and Rap2B), two Ral proteins (RalA and RalB), R-Ras, TC21, R-Ras3/M-Ras, and Rheb in the Ras family. Although many Ras members can interact with the same effector molecules as the three Ras proteins, the physiological roles of most Ras-like GTPases are not fully understood. More recently, some members of the Ras family have begun to be analyzed. For example, Rap1, the closest relative of Ras, has attracted much attention because of the possibility that it functions independently or coordinately with Ras-mediated signaling (6Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Google Scholar). Rap1 was originally discovered as a suppressor of Ki-Ras-induced transformation, and it has been considered to function as an antagonist of Ras signaling by trapping Ras effectors, particularly the Ser/Thr kinase Raf (7Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Google Scholar). However, recent studies show that Rap1 is activated by extracellular signals through several regulatory proteins, and raise the possibility that it may function in diverse biological processes, ranging from modulation of cell growth and differentiation to secretion, integrin-mediated cell adhesion, and morphogenesis. It is thus expected that further studies on other members of Ras-like GTPases would also reveal novel signaling pathways involved in a variety of cell functions. In the present study, we report two novel members, Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2, belonging to a distinct branch of the Ras GTPase family. Although clearly related in sequence, Di-Ras proteins possess different biochemical and functional properties from other members of the Ras family. It is expected that Di-Ras may be involved in novel cellular functions distinct from other Ras-related GTPases. Data base searches using Entrez (NCBIs search and retrieval system) were performed to find novel Ras-related GTPases. Among the many candidate genes in the retrieval results was a cosmid clone (accession numberAC006538) that contains a hypothetical Ras-related gene, which we designated Di-Ras1. Sequence data from the open reading frame of the cosmid were used to design specific primers to amplify the cDNA fragment of Di-Ras1. Primers used wereDi-Ras1F, 5′-ATGCCGGAACAGAGTAACGAT-3′, andDi-Ras1R, 5′-TCACATGAGGGTGCATTTGCC-3′. PCR amplification was performed using human whole brain cDNA (Clontech) and KOD polymerase for 30 cycles (15 s at 98 °C, 2 s at 65 °C, 30 s at 74 °C). The obtained PCR products were sequenced and used to screen a human brain λ ZAPII cDNA library. Of 8.6 × 106 plaques screened, eight positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Four of the eight positive clones were identified as Di-Ras1 cDNA, and the residual four positive clones were overlapping cDNA clones homologues to Di-Ras1 cDNA (thus designatedDi-Ras2). The 5′-cDNA fragments of Di-Ras1were amplified using human brain Marathon Ready cDNA and Advantage cDNA PCR Kits (Clontech) according to the manufacturers instructions. DNA-sequencing reactions were performed using the DYEnamic ET Terminator Cycle Sequencing Premix Kit (AmershamBiosciences). Samples were electrophoresed on an ABI 373 DNA Sequencer and analyzed by ABI Prism model version 2.1.1 software (PE Applied Biosystems). Multiple alignment of Di-Ras proteins to related protein sequences was carried out using CLUSTALW and viewed in GeneDoc. An unrooted phylogenetic tree was prepared using CLUSTALW and viewed in TREEVIEW. Expression patterns ofDi-Ras1 and Di-Ras2 mRNAs were analyzed using human multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech). Hybridization was carried out in the ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech) in the presence of the [32P]cDNA probe according to the manufacturers instructions. Hybridized blots were washed twice with 2× SSC (1× = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS, twice with 0.5× SSC and 0.1% SDS, and once with 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 68 °C. Filters were exposed to x-ray film (Fuji film) at −80 °C for 2−3 days with an intensifying screen. Di-Ras1 and Ha-RascDNAs corresponding to the 1–194 and 1–180 amino acids, respectively, were cloned in pGEX-4T-1 vector to express GST fusion proteins. Overnight culture of Escherichia coliBL21-CodonPlus DE3 (Stratagene) containing the expression vector was diluted 1:50 with a 2× YT medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C for ∼2 h (A 600 = ∼0.5), followed by induction with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 20 °C for 14 h. The cells (250 ml of culture) were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 20 ml of buffer A consisting of 50 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmDTT, 1The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; UTR, untranslated region. 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The suspension was sonicated 10 times for 2 s in ice-cold water and mixed with 0.1 volumes of 10% (w/v) CHAPS. The suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 4 °C, 1 h), the clear supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (0.8-ml bed) that had been equilibrated with 5 ml of buffer B consisting of 20 mmNa-Hepes (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.7% (w/v) CHAPS. After washing the column with the same buffer, proteins were eluted from the column with 5 ml of buffer C consisting of 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmglutathione, and 0.7% (w/v) CHAPS. The eluted proteins were then applied to a gel filtration column (Sephadex G-25, 9.1-ml bed) that had been equilibrated with 30 ml of buffer D consisting of 50 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.7% (w/v) CHAPS, and the fractions containing GST fusion proteins were collected and stocked at −80 °C until use. [35S]GTPγS binding to the purified proteins was performed as follows. Purified proteins (2 μg) were incubated at 30 °C with different concentrations of the radiolabeled nucleotides (∼3,000 cpm/pmol) in a total volume of 40 μl of buffer E consisting of 40 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mmEDTA, 11 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.3% (w/v) CHAPS. After incubation for various periods, samples were diluted with 400 μl of an ice-cold wash buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl) and filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45-μm pore size, Advantech). The membrane was washed three times with 2 ml of the ice-cold wash buffer and dried at 40 °C. Radioactivity retained on the membrane was determined by a liquid scintillation counter. For nucleotide dissociation assays, purified proteins were preloaded with the radiolabeled nucleotides in a total volume of 280 μl as described above. A 10-fold excess of unlabeled nucleotides was added, and aliquots (40 μl) of the reaction mixture were withdrawn at the indicated times after the incubation at 30 °C. They were immediately diluted with the wash buffer and subjected to the membrane binding assay as described above. The steady-state rate of GTP hydrolysis was performed as follows. Purified proteins (4.5 μg) were incubated at 30 °C with 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (3,000 cpm/pmol) in a total volume of 350 μl of buffer B containing various concentrations of EDTA and MgCl2. The free Mg2+ concentration was calculated as described previously (8Iyengar R. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5179-5183Google Scholar). After incubation of the indicated times, aliquots (50 μl) of the reaction mixture were withdrawn and mixed with 750 μl of ice-cold 5% (w/v) Norit SX-Plus in 50 mm NaH2PO4. The mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (300 μl) was analyzed for the amounts of 32Pireleased during the incubation. HeLa, HEK293, and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transfected with 1 or 3 μg (for 35-mm or 60-mm dish) of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000. For ERK kinase assay, the cells were cultured for 24 h after transfection and starved for an additional 12-h incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). PCR cloning was used to insert the Di-Ras and Ha-Rascoding sequences into a modified pCMV5 vector (pMyc-CMV5) that places the Myc tag at its amino terminus. Expression of the Myc-tagged proteins was confirmed by transfection of HeLa or HEK293 cells followed by immunoblotting with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. Guanine nucleotides bound to the GTP-binding proteins were analyzed essentially as described previously (9Satoh T. Endo M. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 185-189Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells, which had been cultured in 60-mm dishes for ∼36 h after transfection, were labeled for 4 h with 32Pi (1.85 MBq/dish) in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The labeled cells (∼3 × 106 cells) were lysed with 1 ml of an ice-cold solubilizing buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgC2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mmPefabloc SC) and clarified, and the precleared lysates were incubated with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (5 μg) and protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing of the immunocomplexes, associated nucleotides were separated by thin-layer chromatography and quantitated with a BAS-1800 image analyzer (Fuji Film). A yeast two-hybrid assay was performed according to the method described previously (10Saito K. Murai J. Kajiho H. Kontani K. Kurosu H. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3412-3418Google Scholar).Di-Ras1, Di-Ras2, and Ha-Ras cDNAs corresponding to the 1–194, 1–195, and 1–180 amino acids, respectively, were cloned in pGBT9 vector. Ras-binding domains (RBD) of Raf-1 and B-Raf corresponding to the 48–131 and 146–226 amino acids, respectively, were cloned in pGAD424 vector. Yeast strain Y190 was double transformed with the pGBT9- and pGAD424-derived vectors. Transformants were grown on a synthetic medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Colonies were picked 3 days after plating and tested for β-galactosidase activity. For detection of phosphorylated ERK, the cells were washed once with an ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of a gel-loading buffer (10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol). Cell lysates were sonicated briefly and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. To determine the phosphorylation of endogenous ERK, immunoblot analysis was conducted using an antibody that specifically recognizes Thr-202/Tyr-204-phosphorylated MAP kinase (Cell Signaling Technology). The bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent for the development of immunoblots using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody according to the manufacturers instructions (Pierce). cDNAs of Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2were cloned into pEGFP vector (Clontech) for expression of EGFP fusion proteins. HEK293T cells were transfected with 1 μg (for 35-mm dish) of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE 2000. After a 2-day culture, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-EGFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech). For fluorescence microscopy, the cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips mounted at the bottom of a 35-mm dish with a 12-mm hole (IWAKI) and transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA as described above. After 40–48 h, the cells were viewed with a Carl Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope. We identified novel members of the Ras GTPase family, termed Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2. Di-Ras stands for a distinct subgroup of theRas family. Di-Ras1 was identified in searching the genome data base for new Ras-related GTPases as follows. We found that a cosmid clone derived from the chromosome 19.q13.1 locus contains an open reading frame, which encodes a putative Ras-related protein. To confirm the actual transcription of the gene, PCR analysis was performed using human brain cDNA library. We obtained a PCR product with the expected molecular weight, of which the nucleotide sequence matched the coding region within the cosmid DNA. The resulting PCR product was then used to screen a human brain λ ZAPII cDNA library (Stratagene). Eight positive colonies were isolated from 8.6 × 106 clones, and their inserts were sequenced. Comparison with genomic sequence revealed that four of the eight colonies were derived from the Di-Ras1 gene. The combined nucleotide sequence of the four clones revealed a 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of 68 bp, a coding sequence of 594 bp, and 3′-UTR of 1.1 kilobase pairs. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments identified further a 5′-UTR sequence, which included a termination codon upstream of the predicted ATG translation initiation site. The predicted protein was designated as Di-Ras1. The remaining four of the eight colonies were overlapping clones similar to Di-Ras1cDNA. The combined nucleotide sequence revealed a 5′-UTR region of 32 bp with a termination codon upstream of the predicted ATG translation initiation site, a coding sequence of 597 bp, and 3′-UTR of 1.8 kilobase pairs. The predicted sequence encoded a protein highly related to Di-Ras1 (79% identity, 88% similarity), thus we designated it as Di-Ras2. There are some unpublished DNA sequences in the EMBL data base, of which coding sequences are identical to Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2. Fig.1 A shows amino acid alignment of human Di-Ras and other members of the Ras family. Di-Ras1 (Di-Ras2) shares 40% (41%) amino acid identity with Rap2A, 36% (39%) with Rap1A, and 32% (32%) with Ha-Ras. Besides these Ras members, Di-Ras proteins share 40% identities with ARHI, a recently identified tumor suppressor gene product (11Yu Y.H., Xu, F.J. Peng H.Q. Fang X.J. Zhao S.L., Li, Y. Cuevas B. Kuo W.L. Gray J.W. Siciliano M. Mills G.B. Bast R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 214-219Google Scholar). An unrooted phylogenetic tree of Di-Ras and other members of the Ras family indicates that Di-Ras1, Di-Ras2, and ARHI can be classified into a distinct subgroup of the Ras family (Fig. 1 B). We found several overlapping clones of mouse- and rat-expressed sequence tags whose sequences are highly homologous to human Di-Ras1 (data not shown). In addition, BLAST search of the protein data base revealed that Di-Ras proteins share significant homologies with two predicted gene products of Caenorhabditis elegans C54A12.4 and Drosophila melanogaster CG8500 (Fig. 2). However, we could not find any homologue of human Di-Ras in budding yeast, fission yeast,Arabidopsis, and Dictyostelium.Figure 2Alignment of human, D. melanogaster and C. elegansDi-Ras proteins. Deduced amino acid sequences from the indicated genes were aligned using CLUSTALW. Amino acid residues conserved among all proteins are shaded in black, and those with 50–99% are inlight gray. Accession numbers of D. melanogasterCG8500 and C. elegans C54A12.4 are AAF54453 and AAA68305, respectively, in the NCBI Entrez Protein data base.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Motif searches of the predicted Di-Ras sequences revealed that they contain a highly conserved GTP-binding domain, a putative effector domain (corresponding to the amino acid sequence 32–40 of Ha-Ras), and the membrane localizing CAAX motif (where C is Cys,A is an aliphatic amino acid, and X is any amino acid) at the carboxyl terminus. However, Thr-63 and Ser-65 in Di-Ras are substituted for Ala-59 and Gln-61, positions that are known to be critical for GTP hydrolysis in the Ras family. These positions in Ras, when substituted with a variety of amino acids, confer oncogenicity by rendering Ras defective for GTP hydrolysis and resistance to the stimulation by GTPase-activation proteins, thereby causing Ras to be maintained as an activated state (12John J. Frech M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11792-11799Google Scholar, 13Trahey M. McCormick F. Science. 1987; 238: 542-545Google Scholar). Moreover, within the core effector domain, Di-Ras differs from most Ras members in that Ile-37 (both Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2) and Val-40 (Di-Ras2) are substituted for Asp-33 and Ile-36 in Ha-Ras. Di-Ras cDNAs could be detected in the oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library, indicating that Di-RasmRNA can be essentially classified into the poly(A)+ class. To determine the expression pattern ofDi-Ras mRNAs, Northern blotting analysis was performed using a human multitissue Northern blot. Di-Ras1 mRNA (4.0 kb) was detected in brain and heart, whereas Di-Ras2mRNA (4.4 kb) was expressed specifically in brain (Fig.3 A). Other tissues expressed quite low or undetectable levels of both transcripts. Closer examination of the expressions in human brain revealed that theDi-Ras1 mRNA was expressed at a high level in the cerebral cortex, the occipital pole, and the frontal and temporal lobes (Fig. 3 B). The expression level was quite low in both medulla and spinal cord. The expression pattern of Di-Ras2was similar to that of Di-Ras1 except that its expression was high in the cerebellum. To examine the biochemical properties of Di-Ras1, we expressed it in bacteria as a GST fusion protein and purified it using a glutathione-Sepharose column. Fig.4 A shows the time course of GTPγS binding to the purified GST-Di-Ras1 in the presence of 10 mm Mg2+. More than 15 pmol of GTPγS bound to 40 pmol of GST-Di-Ras1, indicating that about 40% of the purified protein is properly folded and binds the nucleotide. The nucleotide binding to Di-Ras1 required millimolar order concentrations of Mg2+, because the maximum binding reached at 100 nm Mg2+ was about 30% of that observed at 10 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). The binding properties of Di-Ras1 were also investigated under the various concentrations of GTPγS (Fig. 4 B). Scatchard analysis indicated that the apparent dissociation constant (K d) for GTPγS was ∼1 μm. Nucleotide specificity was next estimated by competition of various nucleotides with [35S]GTPγS binding (Fig.4 C). GTP and GDP competed for GTPγS (1 μm) binding with half-maximal inhibition being observed at 0.5 and 2 μm, respectively, indicating that the affinity of Di-Ras1 for GTP is higher than that for GDP. In contrast, ATP did not compete for the binding even at a concentration as high as 100 μm. Thus, Di-Ras1 appears to specifically bind guanine nucleotides. Fig. 5 A shows the dissociation of GTPγS from Di-Ras1 in a comparison with that from Ha-Ras. GST-Di-Ras1 and GST-Ha-Ras were first loaded with [35S]GTPγS, and dissociation of the bound nucleotide was measured in the presence of 100 μm nonlabeled GTPγS. The radiolabeled GTPγS was rapidly released from GST-Di-Ras1, whereas it was tightly retained on GST-Ha-Ras under the same conditions, indicating that Di-Ras1 exchanges GTPγS extremely faster than Ha-Ras. We next assayed the steady-state rates of GTP hydrolysis catalyzed by GST-Di-Ras1 and GST-Ha-Ras (Fig.5 B). GST-Ha-Ras catalyzed GTP hydrolysis at a low concentration of Mg2+. In contrast, GTPase activity of GST-Di-Ras1 was quite low under the conditions of both high and low Mg2+. A thrombin-cleaved form of Di-Ras1 that lacks the GST portion exhibited the same biochemical properties as those of GST-fused Di-Ras1 (data not shown). We next examined the nucleotide form associated with Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2 in living cells. For the analysis, epitope-tagged proteins were expressed in HeLa and HEK293 cells, and the proteins were purified by means of immunoprecipitation. Expression of the transfected constructs was confirmed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The guanine nucleotides associated with the immunocomplex were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. Fig. 6 shows that wild-type Ha-Ras existed predominantly as a GDP-bound form, whereas about 80% of Ha-Ras/G12V was a GTP-bound form in HeLa cells. In contrast, 78 and 54% of wild-type Di-Ras1 and Di-Ras2, respectively, existed as GTP-bound forms in the cells. A high ratio of the Di-Ras GTP-bound form was also observed in HEK293 cells. These results indicate that Di-Ras proteins are predominantly GTP-bound forms in living cells. Growing evidence has suggested that members of the Ras family exert their biological effects through the activation of several divergent downstream pathways (4Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Google Scholar, 14Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Google Scholar). One of the major pathways activated by Ras is a Raf-dependent MAPK signaling cascade, which involves the sequential phosphorylation of protein kinases. As an initial attempt to unravel the biological function of Di-Ras, we examined the ability of Di-Ras to stimulate the MAPK pathway. HEK293 cells transfected with Myc-tagged Ras or Di-Ras were serum-starved, and the total cell lysates were collected. The activation of ERK in these cells was determined by immunoblotting of the cell lysates using an antibody that specifically recognizes Thr-202/Tyr-204-phosphorylated MAP kinase. As shown in Fig.7 A, overexpression of oncogenic Ras/G12V-stimulated MAP kinase activity in HEK293 cells, however, neither wild-type Di-Ras1 nor its mutant (Di-Ras1/G16V) activated the MAPK pathway. Overexpression of Di-Ras2 also had no effect on the kinase activity. We thus addressed whether the observed inability of Di-Ras to activate the MAPK pathway is correlated with its inefficiency to bind Raf. The interaction between Di-Ras1 (or Di-Ras2) and Raf was investigated using a yeast two-hybrid system. We constructed a pGBT9 vector containing the cDNA fragment of Di-Ras1 that lacks of COOH terminus CAAX motif to optimize targeting to the yeast nuclear compartment. As a positive control, a similar construct was generated with a Ha-Ras/G12V cDNA that has been shown to bind strongly to RBD of the Raf family (21Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L. Zhang X.F. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Google Scholar). RBDs of Raf-1 and B-Raf corresponding to the 48–131 and 146–226 amino acids, respectively, were cloned in pGAD424 vector. Fig. 7 B shows that binding of Ha-Ras/G12V to each Raf-RBD was clearly demonstrated by the stimulation of transcriptional activity of the lacZ reporter gene. In contrast, neither Di-Ras1 nor Di-Ras2 binds RBD of each Raf. We conclude from these results that the inability of Di-Ras to activate the MAPK pathway is because of its inefficiency to bind Raf. We also investigated whether Di-Ras activates other Ras-effector molecules, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase. However, expression of Di-Ras in HEK293 cells did not induce Akt activation, which is a downstream target of the lipid kinase (data not shown). It thus appears that Di-Ras does not interact with the Ras-binding domain (RA domain) of phosphoinositide 3-kinase unlike Ha-Ras. To examine the subcellular localization of Di-Ras proteins and their functions in living cells, HEK293T cells were transfected with pEGFP vectors containing various forms of Di-Ras at the COOH terminus of EGFP. When lysates of the transfected cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis with an anti-EGFP polyclonal antibody, only a single band of ∼48 kDa was observed (Fig.8), showing that the EGFP signal detected in the transfected cells represented the intact EGFP-Di-Ras fusion proteins. Interestingly, high level expression of EGFP-Di-Ras1 or EGFP-Di-Ras2 induced large intracellular vacuolation, and the proteins were localized to the vacuole membranes as well as the plasma membrane, whereas the proteins were mainly associated with plasma membranes in the cells where their expression levels were low (Fig.9, D and F). The large vacuolar formation was also observed when Myc-tagged Di-Ras proteins were expressed in HEK293T or HEK293 cells (data not shown). In contrast, expression of a control empty vector or the mutant EGFP-Di-Ras1, which lacked the COOH-terminal membrane-anchoring signal sequence, CAAX, caused diffuse, widespread signals and did not induce cellular vacuolation even at high expression levels (Fig. 9,B and H). As the presence of the CAAXmotif is crucial for normal plasma membrane localization and biological functions of Ras family proteins, the importance of this motif is also likely to be true of Di-Ras proteins. We compared the Di-Ras-induced vacuolar formation with action of Ha-Ras, because oncogenic Ha-Ras/G12V has also been reported to induce cellular vacuolation in some cell lines (15Chi S.J. Kitanaka C. Noguchi K. Mochizuki T. Nagashima Y. Shirouzu M. Fujita H. Yoshida M. Chen W.B. Asai A. Himeno M. Yokoyama S. Kuchino Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2281-2290Google Scholar). However, the vacuolation induced by Ha-Ras/G12V was modest and morphologically different from the Di-Ras-induced effect at least in HEK293T cells (data not shown). The expression of EGFP-Di-Ras1 also induced a significant change in the morphology of HeLa cells (data not shown), indicating that the effect of Di-Ras is not specific to HEK293 cells.Figure 9Detection by confocal microscopy of the EGFP-Di-Ras fusion proteins in HEK293T cells.

The activation process requires multimolecular complex formation involving pro-MMP-2, membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2). Because calcium is an important regulator of keratinocyte function, we evaluated the effect of calcium on MMP regulation in an oral squamous cell carcinoma line (SCC25). Increasing extracellular calcium (0.09–1.2 mm) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in MT1-MMP-dependent pro-MMP-2 activation. Despite the requirement for MT1-MMP in the activation process, no changes in MT1-MMP expression, cell surface localization, or endocytosis were apparent. However, increased generation of the catalytically inactive 43-kDa MT1-MMP autolysis product and decline in the TIMP-2 levels in conditioned media were observed. The decrease in TIMP-2 levels in the conditioned media was prevented by a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, suggesting that calcium promotes recruitment of TIMP-2 to MT1-MMP on the cell surface. Despite the decline in soluble TIMP-2, no accumulation of TIMP-2 in cell lysates was seen. Blocking TIMP-2 degradation with bafilomycin A1 significantly increased cell-associated TIMP-2 levels in the presence of high calcium. These data suggest that the decline in TIMP-2 is because of increased calcium-mediated MT1-MMP-dependent degradation of TIMP-2. In functional studies, increasing calcium enhanced MMP-dependent cellular migration on laminin-5-rich matrix using an in vitro colony dispersion assay. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in extracellular calcium can regulate post-translational MMP dynamics and thus affect the cellular behavior of oral squamous cell carcinoma.

Furthermore, increased expression of MMP-2 is associated with decreased staining of extracellular matrix in OSCC, suggesting that MMP-2 promotes matrix breakdown (3Kurahara S. Shinohara M. Ikebe T.

MMP-2 is secreted from cells as a zymogen (pro-MMP-2) and is activated post-translationally by a trans-membrane MMP designated as membrane type 1-MMP (MT1-MMP) (9Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J.

Pro-MT1-MMP is synthesized as a 63–66-kDa zymogen and is activated intracellularly to a 55-kDa species by the serine proteinase furin, a member of the proprotein convertase family (12Sato H.

Thus, at low TIMP-2 concentration, an adjacent TIMP-2-free MT1-MMP can effectively process the cell surface-bound pro-MMP-2 to a 68-kDa intermediate species, which undergoes autolytic processing to the mature 62-kDa active species.

Of the many agents that are known to affect keratinocyte behavior, calcium is one of the key factors (24Hennings H. Michael D. Cheng C. Steinert P. Holbrook K. Yuspa S.H.

Grayson S. Elias P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 508-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 29Menon G.K. Price L.F. Bommannan B. Elias P.M. Feingold K.R. J. Invest.

Moreover, altering extracellular calcium has been used to effectively model in vitro physiologic changes in keratinocytes that occur within the epidermis as cells migrate from the basal to the uppermost layers. Interestingly, recent studies (31Kobayashi T. Hattori S. Nagai Y. Tajima S. Nishikawa T. Dermatology. 1998; 197: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32Kobayashi T. Hattori S. Nagai Y.

Because calcium is an important regulator of keratinocyte function, we evaluated the effect of calcium on MMP regulation in an oral squamous cell carcinoma line (SCC25). Increasing extracellular calcium resulted in a dose-dependent increase in pro-MMP-2 activation, accompanied by enhanced MT1-MMP autolytic processing and a decline in the levels of soluble TIMP-2. The decrease in TIMP-2 levels in the conditioned media was prevented by a broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, suggesting that calcium promotes recruitment of TIMP-2 to MT1-MMP on the cell surface. Despite the decline in soluble TIMP-2, no accumulation of TIMP-2 in cell lysates was seen. However, blocking TIMP-2 degradation with bafilomycin A1 significantly increased cell-associated TIMP-2 levels in the presence of high calcium. These data suggest that the decline in TIMP-2 is due to increased calcium-mediated MT1-MMP-dependent degradation of TIMP-2. Moreover, calcium enhanced MMP-dependent cellular migration on laminin-5-rich matrix. These results suggest that changes in extracellular calcium can regulate post-translational MMP dynamics and thus affect the cellular behavior of OSCC.

Three-dimensional collagen gels were prepared by diluting acid-solubilized type I collagen to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in cold DMEM (calcium-free), neutralizing with sodium hydroxide, and then allowing to gel (700 μl in 12-well plates) for 30 min at 37 °C prior to plating cells. Human MT1-MMP cDNA (a kind gift from Duanqing Pei, University of Minnesota) was cloned into pCR3.1-Uni (Invitrogen) mammalian expression vector. SCC25 cells were stably transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell clones resistant to 0.8 mg/ml G418 were chosen and screened for MMP-2 activation by zymography as described below and for MT1-MMP expression by Western blotting using antibody directed against the hinge region. Six different clones with high levels of MT1-MMP expression were selected for subsequent experiments. The cells were then maintained in DMEM/Ham's F12 media = 1:1 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.65 mg/ml G418. Gelatinase activities in 24-h serum-free conditioned media were determined using SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography as described previously (34Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-PAGE gels (9% acrylamide) were co-polymerized with 0.1% gelatin, and samples were electrophoresed without reduction or boiling using 5× Laemmli sample buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). SDS was removed through a 30-min incubation in 2.5% Triton X-100, and gels were incubated in 20 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2 at 37 °C for 24–36 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize zones of gelatinolytic activity. The conditioned media were concentrated 15–20-fold using Microcon 10 microconcentrators, boiled in Laemmli sample dilution buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), analyzed for TIMP-2 by SDS-PAGE (15% gels), and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibody (Chemicon). Levels of TIMP-2 protein in the cell lysates were quantified by ELISA (Oncogene Research Products) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Total RNA was isolated from SCC25 and SCC25-MT cells using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following digestion with RQ1 DNase for 30 min at 37 °C, the total RNA concentration was determined by spectrophotometric measurement. Primer pairs for human MT1-MMP, human TIMP-2, and human GAPDH were as follows: forward primer 5′-GCCCATTGGCCAGTTCTGGCGGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCTCGTCCACCTCAATGATGATC-3′ for MT1-MMP; forward primer 5′-GGCGTTTTGCAATGCAGATGTAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CACAGGAGCCGTCACTTCTCTTG-3′ for TIMP-2; and forward primer 5′-CGGAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGTAT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGCCTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGAC-3′ for GAPDH (36Wong H. Muzik H. Groft L.L. Lafleur M.A. Matouk C. Forsyth P.A. Schultz G.A. Wall S.J. Edwards D.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 151: 305-320PubMed Google Scholar). The length of the MT1-MMP, TIMP-2, and GAPDH amplicons were 530, 497, and 307 bp, respectively. RT-PCR was performed using the One-step RT-PCR kit where reverse transcription and DNA amplification occur in the same reaction. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was used as template in a reaction that included the appropriate primers in the presence of both reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase. The mixture was incubated at 45 °C for 30 min and cycled 30 times at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min. Appropriate negative controls of amplification included reactions without reverse transcriptase. PCR products were visualized by UV transillumination of 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. To label cell surface proteins, SCC25-MT cells were grown to confluence in a 6-well plate, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml cell-impermeable Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin in ice-cold PBS, followed by washing with 100 mm glycine to quench free biotin. Cells were detached by scraping, lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS) with proteinase inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm leupeptin), and clarified by centrifugation. To isolate biotinylated cell surface proteins, equal amounts of protein from each sample were incubated with streptavidin beads at 4 °C for 14 h, followed by centrifugation. After boiling in Laemmli sample dilution buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) to dissociate streptavidin bead-biotin complexes, the biotin-labeled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gels) and immunoblotted for MT1-MMP. To determine whether calcium affects MT1-MMP endocytosis, SCC25-MT cells grown to confluence in a 6-cm dish were washed with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with cleavable cell-impermeable sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (1 mg/ml) for 20 min in an ice bath. Biotinylation was stopped by washing with ice-cold PBS followed by 100 mm glycine in PBS to quench free biotin. Cells were then incubated with DMEM containing either 0.09 mm or 1.2 mm calcium at 37 °C for 40 min to initiate endocytosis. Endocytosis of cell surface proteins was then stopped by placing the cells on ice and washing them with ice-cold PBS. Biotin was then cleaved off the exposed cell surface by incubating the cells with membrane-impermeable reducing agent MESNA (100 mm) for 30 min at 4 °C (37Neuhaus E.M. Soldati T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1013-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer with proteinase inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μmpepstatin, and 10 μm leupeptin) and clarified by centrifugation. To isolate biotinylated proteins (representing endocytosed surface-labeled species), equal amounts of protein from each of the samples were incubated with streptavidin beads at 4 °C for 14 h, followed by centrifugation. After boiling in Laemmli sample dilution buffer (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) to dissociate streptavidin bead-biotin complexes, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gels) and immunoblotted for MT1-MMP. In control experiments to determine the efficiency of surface stripping with MESNA, cells were maintained on ice for the duration of the experiment and were not induced to undergo endocytosis via a temperature shift. In additional control experiments, the MESNA stripping step was omitted such that total labeled protein (endocytosed and the cell surface pool) was analyzed. The extracellular matrix deposited by SCC25 cells was generated as described previously (34Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 38Gospodarowicz D. Barnes D.W. Sirbasku D.A. Stao G.H. Methods for Preparation of Media Supplements and Substrata. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1984: 275-293Google Scholar). Briefly, SCC25 cells were grown in 12-well plates to 48–72 h post-confluence prior to treatment for 7 min with 20 mm ammonium hydroxide to remove cells. After 3 rapid washes each in sterile distilled water and PBS, the laminin-5-enriched matrix was then used for in vitromigration assays. The effect of calcium on laminin-5-induced migration was assessed using a cell dispersion assay as described previously (39Gilles C. Polette M. Coraux C. Tournier J.M. Meneguzzi G. Munaut C. Volders L. Rousselle P. Birembaut P. Foidart J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, SCC25 and SCC25-MT cells (3 × 104) were plated in DMEM (0.09 mm calcium) inside a cloning cylinder placed in the middle of a 12-well plate coated with laminin-5-enriched matrix. After the cells have attached and spread, the cloning cylinder was removed, and the cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 0.09 mm calcium and serum-starved for an additional 3 h. The media were then switched to DMEM containing either 0.09 or 1.2 mm calcium supplemented with 20 ng/ml EGF. In selected experiments, the proteinase dependence of migration was determined by adding the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (10 μm). To quantify the relative motility, the migratory front was photographed every 12 h for 48 h, and the percentage of cells crossing a line designated “migratory max” was enumerated. MMP activity is subject to complex post-translational regulation by a number of processes including zymogen activation, enzyme-inhibitor binding, endocytosis, and shedding (4Werb Z.

As keratinocytes are subjected to fluctuations in extracellular calcium in the epidermal milieu, the effect of calcium on MMP activation was evaluated in SCC25 cells. The predominant soluble MMP expressed by SCC25 cells is MMP-2, with low level expression of MMP-9. SCC25 cells were plated in low calcium media (0.09 mm), serum-starved, and incubated with fresh serum-free media containing increasing calcium. Conditioned media were collected at 24 h and analyzed for MMP activity by gelatin zymography. Whereas cells cultured in 0.09 mm calcium concentration expressed pro-MMP-2 (Fig. 1 A, 1st lane), increasing calcium concentration resulted in a dose-dependent MMP-2 activation (Fig. 1 A, 2nd to4th lanes). There was no change in MMP-9 expression with increasing calcium concentration in these cells (data not shown). Because collagen has been shown to affect MMP-2 expression and/or processing (42Azzam H.S. Thompson E.W. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 4540-4544PubMed Google Scholar, 43Seltzer J.L. Lee A.Y. Akers K.T.

https://openalex.org/W1984941150,"Chondrocyte proliferation is important for skeletal development and growth, but the mechanisms regulating it are not completely clear. Previously, we showed that syndecan-3, a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is expressed by proliferating chondrocytes in vivo and that proliferation of cultured chondrocytes in vitro is sensitive to heparitinase treatment. To further establish the link between syndecan-3 and chondrocyte proliferation, additional studies were carried out in vivo and in vitro. We found that the topographical location of proliferating chondrocytes in developing chick long bones changes with increasing embryonic age and that syndecan-3 gene expression changes in a comparable manner. For in vitroanalysis, mitotically quiescent chondrocytes were exposed to increasing amounts of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Proliferation was stimulated by as much as 8–10-fold within 24 h; strikingly, this stimulation was significantly prevented when the cells were treated with both fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and antibodies against syndecan-3 core protein. This neutralizing effect was dose-dependent and elicited a maximum of 50–60% inhibition. To establish specificity of neutralizing effect, cultured chondrocytes were exposed to FGF-2, insulin-like growth factor-1, or parathyroid hormone, all known mitogens for chondrocytes. The syndecan-3 antibodies interfered only with FGF-2 mitogenic action, but not that of insulin-like growth factor-1 or parathyroid hormone. Protein cross-linking experiments indicated that syndecan-3 is present in monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric forms on the chondrocyte surface. In addition, molecular modeling indicated that contiguous syndecan-3 molecules might form stable complexes by parallel pairing of β-sheet segments within the ectodomain of the core protein. In conclusion, the results suggest that syndecan-3 is a direct and selective regulator of the mitotic behavior of chondrocytes and its role may involve formation of dimeric/oligomeric structures on their cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2007064472,"Deactivation of G-protein-coupled receptors relies on a timely blockade by arrestin. However, under dim light conditions, virtually all arrestin is in the rod inner segment, and the splice variant p44 (Arr1–370A) is the stop protein responsible for receptor deactivation. Using size exclusion chromatography and biophysical assays for membrane-bound protein-protein interaction, membrane binding, and G-protein activation, we have investigated the interactions of Arr1–370A and proteolytically truncated Arr3–367 with rhodopsin. We find that these short arrestins do not only interact with the phosphorylated active receptor but also with inactive phosphorylated rhodopsin or opsin in membranes or solution. Because of the latter interaction they are not soluble (like arrestin) but membrane-bound in the dark. Upon photoexcitation, Arr3–367 and Arr1–370A interact with prephosphorylated rhodopsin faster than arrestin and start to quench Gt activation on a subsecond time scale. The data indicate that in the course of rhodopsin deactivation, Arr1–370A is handed over from inactive to active phosphorylated rhodopsin. This mechanism could provide a new aspect of receptor shutoff in the single photon operating range of the rod cell.

Arrestins are involved in the regulation of numerous signal transduction pathways through G-protein 1The abbreviations used are: G-protein, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; Arr, arrestin; BTP, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane; Gt, retinal G-protein, transducin; LS, light scattering; MI, metarhodopsin I; MII, metarhodopsin II; pR, prephosphorylated rhodopsin; pR*, phosphorylated active rhodopsin; R*, nonphosphorylated active rhodopsin -coupled receptors. Arrestins bind tightly to the receptors when they are activated by chemical (e.g. diffusible ligands such as hormones) or physical (such as light) stimuli and phosphorylated through G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (1Sokal I. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 578-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Catalytic interaction with the G-protein, the primary transduction event, is thereby terminated. Signal transduction in vertebrate rod cells (2Pugh Jr., E.N. Lamb T.D. Biochim. Biophys.

In its GTP-bound form, Gtα activates its effector cGMP phosphodiesterase, which in turn hydrolyzes cGMP to 5′-GMP, leading to the closure of the cGMP-gated cation channels in the plasma membrane (4Molday R.S.

The specific R* conformation that is required for the interaction with Gt can only develop when the photoproduct MII is formed before. The MII state arises in turn from the replacement, by light-induced isomerization, of rhodopsins covalently attached antagonist 11-cis-retinal with all-trans-retinal, and subsequent relaxation and proton transfer reactions. There are analogies between the MII state and the high affinity states known from other G-protein-coupled receptors (6Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem.

The subsequent binding of arrestin deactivates the transduction cascade by direct competition with the G-protein (11Wilden U. Hall S.W. Kühn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed β-arrestins, visual arrestins are exclusively expressed in rod and cone photoreceptor cells of the vertebrate retina. Evidence has been presented that proper termination of the light signal depends crucially on a conformational switch in arrestin (7Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P.

This mechanism may enhance the specificity and strength of interaction, but even more importantly, it serves to avoid interference of arrestin with G-protein activation before rhodopsin kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of the active receptor has occurred. It thus leaves a time window for fast undisturbed Gt activation, in which arrestin cannot interfere with the G-protein because it has very low if any affinity to nonphosphorylated rhodopsin. In view of this well established and sensible mechanism, it is surprising that short variants of arrestin are present in the rod cell which interact with both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of R* (pR* and R*, respectively (17Pulvermüller A.

Bovine rods express a splice variant of arrestin, p44 (Arr1–370A), in which the last 35 amino acids are replaced by a single alanine (20Smith W.C. Milam A.H. Dugger D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other variants may arise from proteolytic truncation, such as the protein resulting from calpain proteolysis in vitro (21Azarian S.M. King A.J. Hallett M.A. Williams D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24375-24384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The splice variant (Arr1–370A) is present at 10% the amount of the full-length arrestin and thus at 1% of rhodopsin. Arr1–370A is partially preactivated, and has even some affinity to membranes that contain the inactive prephosphorylated receptor (pR). The activation-phosphorylation scheme of interaction does therefore not apply, and the conformational switch appears to be lacking in Arr1–370A. Intriguingly however, available evidence argues for Arr1–370A, and not for full-length arrestin, as the actual stop protein that terminates signal transduction at low levels of light excitation, i.e. in the actual working range of the rod cell. Langlois and co-workers (22Langlois G. Chen C.K. Palczewski K. Hurley J.B. Vuong T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4677-4682Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) performed time-resolved measurements of effector activity in a calorimetric phosphodiesterase assay. Pulses of phosphodiesterase activity evoked by small flashes of light were shortened by both arrestin and Arr1–370A, but Arr1–370A was five times more efficient than full-length arrestin. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we have investigated Arr1–370A further, in comparison with full-length arrestin, on purified preparations. We also draw on proteolytic forms of arrestin, which are available in quantity and were identified by mass spectroscopic analysis as Arr3–382 and Arr3–367, respectively (19Palczewski K. Buczylko J.

Arr3–382interacts like native arrestin only with pR*, whereas Arr3–367 and Arr1–370A interact with both R* and pR*. Moreover, Arr3–367 binds like Arr1–370A to phosphorylated membranes regardless of the bleaching status (19Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Kaplan M.W. Johnson R.S.

Using size exclusion chromatography, centrifugation, kinetic light scattering, and extra-MII experiments, we will specifically analyze membrane binding, receptor interactions, and influence on catalytic Gt activation of these arrestins. The results are relevant for the mechanism of receptor interaction and give a more precise pattern of the binding interactions in the different modes of signal transduction in the rod cell. We will substantiate the notion put forward by others (19Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Kaplan M.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A.

Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin was prepared by removing the soluble and membrane-associated proteins from the disc membrane by repetitive washes with a low ionic strength buffer (24Kühn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated opsin was prepared from washed disc membranes as described previously by Wilden and Kühn (25Wilden U. Kühn H. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To remove retinaloxime from the membrane-bound phosphorylated opsin, the membranes were treated with urea and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (26Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An average stoichiometry of ∼1.5 phosphates/opsin was determined using radioactive [γ-32P]ATP as a tracer. Phosphorylated rhodopsin was prepared by regeneration of phosphorylated opsin with 11-cis-retinal (27Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated opsin was suspended in 10 mm BTP (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl. A 3-fold molar excess of 11-cis-retinal was added in the dark to the sample, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C. After regeneration, phosphorylated membranes were centrifuged (45,000 ×g for 20 min) and washed four times with 10 mmBTP (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl to remove excess 11-cis-retinal. The concentration of rhodopsin and phosphorylated rhodopsin was determined spectrophotometrically at 498 nm (17Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The membranes, containing rhodopsin and phosphorylated rhodopsin, were stored at −80 °C until use. Solubilized rhodopsin and opsin in their phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms were prepared by solubilizing the respective membranes with dodecyl maltoside (3% w/v, final concentration) and purified by affinity chromatography using concanavalin A (28König B. Welte W. Hofmann K.P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Arrestin was purified from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas as described (29Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Imami N.R. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15334-15339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified arrestin was determined spectrophotometrically at 278 nm, assuming a molar absorption coefficient of E 1cm0.1% = 0.638 (31Palczewski K. Riazance-Lawrence J.H. Johnson Jr, W.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and a molecular mass of 45,300 Da. Arr1–370A was isolated under dim red light from bovine rod outer segments as described (17Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Purified Arr1–370A was quantified as described above for arrestin purification. Proteolytic forms of arrestin, Arr3–382, and Arr3–367 were isolated and quantified as described by Palczewski et al. (19Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Kaplan M.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Arrestin was diluted in 100 mm BTP (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol and digested with trypsin (200:1, 20–21 °C) for 10 min. Proteolysis was stopped with 10-fold excess of trypsin inhibitor to added trypsin, and the arrestin fragments were applied onto a TSK-heparin steel column (Tosohaas; 0.75 × 7.5 cm, 10-μm particle size, 5-ml bed volume, equilibrated with 10 mm BTP (pH 8.4), flow 0.1 ml/min) and incubated on the column for 6 h. The column was washed with 10 mm BTP (pH 8.4) before being eluted with an NaCl gradient (0–1 m) in the same buffer. Concentrations of the fragments were determined as described for the arrestin purification. Purity of the preparations of all arrestin variants was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2 A). Transducin was purified from frozen dark-adapted bovine retinas (32Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Purified transducin (Gt) concentration was determined using the Bradford method (33Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217055) Google Scholar). The binding of arrestin, Arr1–370A (p44) and the proteolytic form Arr3–367 to membrane suspensions of opsin, p-opsin, rhodopsin, and p-rhodopsin was determined using a centrifugation assay (34Pulvermüller A. Giessl A. Heck M. Wottrich R. Schmitt A. Ernst O.P. Choe H.W. Hofmann K.P. Wolfrum U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2194-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Samples (2 μm arrestins and 5 μm receptors) were incubated in 10 mm BTP (pH 7.0) containing 130 mm NaCl and 1 mm MgCl2. 100-μl aliquots of these samples were either kept in the dark or illuminated with a 150-watt fiberoptic light source filtered through a heat filter (Schott KG2) and a 495-nm long pass filter for 20 min on ice and pelleted by ultracentrifugation (45 min; 84,400 × g; 4 °C). After removal of the supernatant, the pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer. The amount of arrestin and Arr3–367either bound to the membrane pellet or present in the supernatant was analyzed by densitometry on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE. All pellet samples were heated to 95 °C for 10 min in the presence of SDS to aggregate most of rhodopsin. Size exclusion chromatography was used to characterize membrane-independent, direct complex formation between the different forms of the solubilized receptor (opsin, p-opsin, rhodopsin, and p-rhodopsin) and arrestin and its proteolytic form Arr3–367. 10 or 5 μg of each arrestin and 10 μg of each rhodopsin or opsin (freshly prepared) were incubated in buffer containing 10 mm BTP (pH 7.0) containing 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.02% dodecyl maltoside for 5 min at room temperature. As controls, all samples (arrestin, Arr3–367, opsin, p-opsin, rhodopsin, and p-rhodopsin) were incubated alone. The reaction mixtures were loaded on a Superose TM 12 column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with buffer, and analyzed on a Smart System (Amersham Biosciences; flow rate, 40 μl/min), monitoring the elution by the absorbance at 280 nm. Formation of the photoproduct MII (λmax = 380 nm) was assayed using the two-wavelength technique (7Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 35Pulvermüller A. Schröder K. Fischer T. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37679-37685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This technique minimizes scattering artifacts by comparing the flash-induced changes in the absorbance at 380 and 417 nm. The absorbance change at 417 nm (MI isosbestic to MII) serves as a reference for determining the level of MII. The two-wavelength spectrophotometer (UV 3000, Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc., Kyoto, Japan; 2-nm slit width) is equipped with thermostated cuvettes (2-mm path), temperature regulation (Circulator G/D8, Haake GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany), and a green photoflash (filtered to 500 ± 20 nm). When photolyzed rhodopsin in its native disc membrane is cooled to temperatures at which the equilibrium is on the MI side (below 5 °C and pH 8.0) (36Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), any specific binding of protein or peptide to MII causes enhanced formation of MII (extra MII). Extra MII provides a kinetic and stoichiometric measure for the complex between photoactivated rhodopsin and the interactive polypeptide (37Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 810: 278-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Hamm H.E. Deretic D. Arendt A. Hargrave P.A. König B. Hofmann K.P. Science. 1988; 241: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The gain or loss of membrane-bound protein mass can be measured readily by light scattering (LS) changes using a setup described in detail by Heck et al. (30Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All measurements were performed in 10-mm path cuvettes with 300-μl volumes in hypotonic buffer (20 mm BTP (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) at 20 °C. Reactions were triggered by flash photolysis of rhodopsin with a green (500 ± 20 nm) flash, attenuated by appropriate neutral density filters. The flash intensity is quantified photometrically by the amount of rhodopsin bleached and expressed as the mol fraction of photoexcited rhodopsin (R*/R). LS binding signals (R*/R = 32%) were corrected by a reference signal (N signal) measured on a sample without added protein as described by Pulvermüller et al. (9Pulvermüller A. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14082-14088Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). LS dissociation signals (R*/R = 0.5%) were recorded with a 0.5–5 ms dwell time of the A/D converter (Nicolet 400, Madison, WI). To suppress base-line activation, 2.5 mmNH2OH was added to the sample. The LS binding signal is interpreted as a gain of protein mass bound to the disc membranes and the LS dissociation signal as loss of protein mass from the disc vesicle (30Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding signals are large changes of LS, reflecting the binding of a protein from solution; small additional binding signals (see Fig.2 B, c and d) are likely to reflect the transition from the membrane binding sites to the receptor; LS signals can indeed arise from membrane-bound reactions, as was demonstrated for the binding of Gt to its effector phosphodiesterase (32Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To fit the experimental data of Gt activation, the time course of Gt in its activated, GTP-binding form (Gt*) was simulated by a model comprising Reactions 1–4. R*+Gt⇋R*GtR*Gt⇋R*+Gt*Gt*⇋GtR*+Arr3–367⇋R*Arr3–367REACTIONS 1-4 All simulations assume the same Gt* activation and inactivation rates (39Kahlert M. Hofmann K.P. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 375-386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Antonny B. Otto Bruc A. Chabre M. Vuong T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8646-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Heck M. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10000-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the same temperature-corrected rate constants of Reaction 4 (k on = 5 × 10−5 nm−1 s−1,k off = 10−3 s−1; extra MII measurements), and the same total concentration of R* and Gt. The Ksim software was applied for numerical integration of the rate equations, provided by Helmut Gutfreund. The biophysical assays separate receptor interaction and membrane binding of the arrestins from each other. The spectrophotometric “extra MII” assay is specific for the receptor interaction step in that it follows the time-dependent generation of the MII intermediate that is formed at the expense of the tautomeric MI. Arrestin, Arr3–382, Arr3–367, and Arr1–370A (p44) all enhance the formation of MII in prephosphorylated membranes (Fig.1 A). However, Arr3–382, like the full-length protein, does not show this effect for native nonphosphorylated rhodopsin (Fig. 1 B,a and b traces). It can be concluded that both proteins are sensitive to the presence of the phosphate groups at the C terminus of rhodopsin. This shows that the last 22 and the first 2 residues of arrestin (which are truncated in Arr3–382) are not essential for the normal phosphate-dependent interaction. The observation is different for Arr3–367,i.e. when an additional 15 amino acids are clipped off from the C terminus of arrestin. Arr3–367 enhances the formation of MII for both pre- and nonphosphorylated membranes. For Arr1–370A the same result was obtained (Fig. 1,c and d traces; (17Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar)), indicating that it is indeed the lack of the C-terminal stretch and not of the N-terminal residues, which makes the protein-protein interaction insensitive to receptor phosphorylation. A centrifugation assay was used to characterize qualitatively the binding of arrestin, Arr1–370A (p44), or Arr3–367 to disc membranes containing opsin, rhodopsin, or their prephosphorylated forms. As shown in Fig.2 B, Arr1–370A and Arr3–367 (but not the full-length arrestin) bind to both p-opsin or pR in the dark and after illumination. The same line of experiments with arrestin shows that membrane binding is only observed with pR*. LS binding signals provide a more quantitative assay of membrane binding. They arise from flashes of light that generate photoactivated rhodopsin. One can distinguish between direct and indirect mechanisms that generate such signals. A protein can bind directly from solution or when binding sites at the membrane become available after transition of a protein from membrane sites to the receptor. In the present study, the binding signals are used as a tool to determine the state of membrane binding (prior to the flash) of a protein. The shift of protein mass from solution to the membrane becomes the larger the less of the protein that is bound to the membrane before receptor activation (30Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Schleicher A. Hofmann K.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1987; 95: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). No binding signal will be seen when the protein is completely bound to the membrane. The experimental data are shown in Fig. 2, C andD. With both arrestin and Arr3–382, flash excitation of rhodopsin leads to large binding signals; a second flash (data not shown) produces only a small residual signal arising from excess arrestin or Arr3–382 that was not bound to the active rhodopsin formed by the first flash. Consistent with previous analyses (17Pulvermüller A. Maretzki D. Rudnicka Nawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), this is interpreted as a stoichiometric, light-induced binding of arrestin or Arr3–382 to the phosphorylated rhodopsin, which leads to the observed shift of protein mass to the membrane. We can also conclude that the truncation per sedoes not disturb the binding signal and that the lack of the extreme C terminus of arrestin leaves membrane binding and (in agreement with Fig. 1) interaction with pR* undisturbed. In sharp contrast to Arr3–382, both Arr1–370A and Arr3–367 show only a very small, if any, binding signal (Fig. 2 C, c and d traces). We know from the results shown in Fig. 1 that Arr1–370A and Arr3–367 interact vigorously with phosphorylated rhodopsin after photoactivation. In agreement with the analyses through centrifugation assays (see above and Ref. 19Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Kaplan M.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we interpret the absence of the binding signal as membrane binding in the dark. Observations of the time it takes until this stable equilibrium is reached (in the order of 200 s, in which time binding signals of decreasing amplitude are seen; data not shown) allow estimation of the time it takes to form the pR·Arr1–370A complex from solution. A lower limit for this parameter arises from the binding signal itself (which reflects formation of pR*·Arr1–370A); this would yield a reaction time in the order of 10 s. When the protocol in Fig. 2 C is repeated with nonphosphorylated rhodopsin, the binding signal is absent with arrestin or Arr3–382, but a large, although slower signal is seen with Arr1–370A and Arr3–367 (Fig. 2 D, c and d traces). This “mirror image” of the behavior of phosphorylated membranes can be readily understood by the simple assumption that membrane binding in the dark does occur exclusively when the rhodopsin is prephosphorylated. Evidence that this occurs by direct interaction of Arr1–370A and Arr3–367with inactive but phosphorylated rhodo"
https://openalex.org/W2090137967,"The glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors (GR and MR) share considerable structural and functional homology and bind as homodimers to hormone-response elements. We have shown previously that MR and GR can form heterodimers that inhibit transcription from a glucocorticoid (GC)-responsive gene and that this inhibition was mediated by the N-terminal domain (NTD) of MR. In this report, we examined the effect of NTD-MR on GC-induced apoptosis in the GC-sensitive pre-B lymphoma cell line, 697. In GC-treated 697 cells, we demonstrated that stable expression of NTD-MR blocks apoptosis and inhibits proteolytic processing of pro-caspases-3, -8, and -9 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Importantly, gel shift and immunoprecipitation analyses revealed a direct association between the GR and amino acids 203–603 of NTD-MR. We observed down-regulation of c-Myc and of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bfl-1 as well as high levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bid. Conversely, cells stably expressing NTD-MR exhibited increased expression of Bcl-2 and Bfl-1 and diminished levels of Bid and Bax. These data provide a potential mechanism for the observed inhibition of cytochromec and Smac release from the mitochondria of NTD-MR cells and resultant resistance to GC-induced apoptosis. Thus, NTD-MR may mediate GC effects through heterodimerization with GR and ensuing inhibition of GC-regulated gene transcription.

Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). These receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that control various aspects of metabolic homeostasis, embryonic development, and physiological stress by binding to specific hormone-response elements in the regulatory regions of target genes (2Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 391-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In vitro, both the GR and the MR bind to and are activated by the physiological glucocorticoid (GC), cortisol. Although both receptors, when activated, can bind and transactivate glucocorticoid-response elements (GREs) in the promoters of target genes, each has distinct transcriptional activities (3Arriza J.L. Simerly R.B. Swanson L.W. Evans R.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 887-900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 4Alnemri E.S. Maksymowych A.B. Robertson N.M. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18072-18081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For instance, the GR, but not the MR, self-synergizes at multimerized hormone-response elements (5Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12480-12484Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 6Rupprecht R. Arriza J.L. Spengler D. Reul J.M. Evans R.M. Holsboer F. Damm K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and only the GR can inhibit induction of AP-1-dependent genes by Fos-Jun heterodimers (7Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In addition, the ability to mediate apoptosis in susceptible cells is exclusive to the GR (8Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4138) Google Scholar).Induction of apoptosis by GCs occurs in numerous cell types including immature lymphocytes and various malignancies of lymphoid origin (9Thompson E.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,10Evans-Storms R.B. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 53: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Evidence that the GR is essential for this process has been provided by studies using GR antagonists, such as RU486, that completely block GC-induced cell death and by experiments involving GR knockout mice (11Thompson E.B. Thulasi R. Saeed M.F. Johnson B.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 761: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 12Caron-Leslie L.A. Cidlowski J.A. Mol.

Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The effects of mutations in the GR on its ability to cause apoptosis vary among cell lines. In human CEM and Jurkat lymphoid cells, the DNA binding domain and the ligand binding domain of the GR are essential for GC-induced cell death. Specifically, mutations that deleted either of the zinc fingers of the DNA binding domain or substituted amino acids in critical sites within the N-terminal zinc finger completely blocked the lethal response (14Harbour D.V. Chambon P. Thompson E.B. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 35: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Ligand binding domain mutations also inhibited cell death demonstrating a requirement for hormone binding (15Nazareth L.V. Harbour D.V. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12976-12980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GR mutants lacking the N-terminal transactivation domain did not prevent apoptosis in these cell lines; however, in S49 mouse lymphoma cells, this region was essential for steroid-induced lethality (16Dieken E.S. Meisfeld R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Differences in the transcriptional activities of the GR and the MR, including the ability to mediate apoptosis, may be attributed to structural variability within the N-terminal domain (NTD). This region contains a transactivation function, AF-1, which is involved in the transcriptional transactivation of genes, in receptor heterodimerization, and in binding to other transcription factors (17Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of a ligand binding domain, this region is constitutively active. The NTDs of GR and MR share only 15% sequence homology and have been shown to have opposite transactivation properties (1Arriza J.L. Weinberger C. Cerelli G. Glaser T.M. Handelin B.L. Housman D.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1987; 237: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). Specifically, chimeric receptor analyses demonstrated that this region of the MR is inhibitory for GR-mediated regulation of the Na/K-ATPase β1 gene promoter when MR and GR are coexpressed (18Derfoul A. Robertson N.M. Hall D.J. Litwack G. Endocrine. 2000; 13: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In addition, several laboratories (5Liu W. Wang J. Sauter N.K. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Moreover, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, there is evidence that MR activation can protect neurons against acute GR ligand-mediated apoptosis (25Hassan A.H. von Rosenstiel P. Patchev V.K. Holsboer F. Almeida O.F. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 140: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A recent study has also demonstrated that heterodimerization of MR and GR mediates direct corticosteroid-induced transrepression of the 5-HT1A receptor promoter (20Ou X.M. Storring J.M. Kushwaha N. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14299-14307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These studies have prompted us to examine whether the MR can mediate or abrogate apoptotic cell death in the GC-sensitive pre-B lymphoma cell line, 697.RESULTSWe have demonstrated previously (18Derfoul A. Robertson N.M. Hall D.J. Litwack G. Endocrine. 2000; 13: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Derfoul A. Robertson N.M. Lingrel J.B. Hall D.J. Litwack G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20702-20711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that the NTD of MR is inhibitory for GR-mediated gene transcriptional regulation. To examine the ability of this region to modulate GR-induced apoptosis, the NTD of MR (NTD-MR) composed of amino acids 1–516, or the NTD of GR (NTD-GR), encompassing amino acids 1–421, was stably expressed in 697 cells. These cells provide a model system for this study because we have shown previously (30Robertson N.M. Zangrilli J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Friesen P.D. Litwack G. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 43-47PubMed Google Scholar, 31Alnemri E.S. Fernandes T.F. Haldar S. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 491-495PubMed Google Scholar) that they express GR, and that they are exquisitely sensitive to GC-induced cell death. More importantly, immunoblot and RT-PCR analyses of 697 whole cell extracts and of RNA, respectively, have demonstrated that these cells do not express MR (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, expression of the NTD-MR/c-Myc or NTD-GR/c-Myc fusion proteins was evaluated by Western blot analysis using a c-Myc mAb (Fig. 1). The predicted 59-kDa recombinant NTD-MR protein was detected in 5 of 6 clones examined (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–6), although no c-Myc-tagged NTD-MR was expressed in the cells transfected with the control vector (lane 7). Expression of the 51-kDa recombinant NTD-GR protein was also detected in stably transfected cells (Fig.1 C, lanes 1–6). Following evidence of expression, the clones with the highest level of NTD-MR (MR-H7 or -A2) or NTD-GR (GR-D6) were used for further experimentation.NTD-MR Inhibits Glucocorticoid-induced Apoptosis in 697 CellsTo examine the effects of NTD-MR or NTD-GR on the kinetics of GC-induced cell death, cells were treated with 1 μm TA for a 48-h time course. Fig. 1 D shows that 697 cells with vector and NTD-GR cells exhibit declining viability within the first 24 h of treatment, with complete cell death occurring by 48 h. Importantly, stable transfection of the NTD-MR in these cells resulted in a strong inhibition of GC-induced cell death (Fig.1 B). To confirm that overexpression of the MR N terminus protects 697 cells from GC-induced apoptosis, DNA isolated from cells at the indicated time points following treatment with 1 μm TA (0, 24, and 48 h) was examined for nuclear fragmentation using the TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig.2, 697 cells with vector, treated with TA for 24 h, exhibited the typical morphologic changes associated with apoptosis such as shrinkage and nuclear blebbing, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Moreover, the nuclei of these cells exhibited fluorescence indicating the presence of the labeled 3′-OH ends characteristic of apoptotic cells. In contrast, cells stably expressing NTD-MR, which had been treated with TA for the same time period, retained their viability (Fig. 2, C andD).Figure 2Stable expression of NTD-MR inhibits GC-induced apoptosis in 697 cells. 697 cells with vector or NTD-MR (MR-H7) were incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm TA. At the 24-h time point, aliquots of cell suspensions were processed using the TUNEL assay (green) and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue) to detect changes in nuclear morphology.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)NTD-MR Does Not Affect GR Expression or Nuclear TranslocationTo explore the mechanism of inhibition of GC-induced apoptosis by NTD-MR at the receptor level, we first examined GR protein levels by Western blot and GR subcellular localization by immunofluorescence. To compare GR protein levels in 697 and MR-H7 cells, whole cell extracts were prepared from cells harvested at 0, 3, 8, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 h of treatment with 1 μmTA. As shown in Fig. 3 A, overexpression of NTD-MR did not alter endogenous levels of GR protein, which remained steady over the 48-h time course and comparable with those levels detected in 697 cells. Immunocytochemical analysis in Fig.3 B revealed that endogenous GR expression in cells stably transfected with NTD-MR (MR-H7) is cytoplasmic. Following treatment of cells with 1 μm TA for 1 h, the GR was detected primarily in the nucleus. These data suggest that the expression of NTD-MR in 697 cells does not prevent translocation of the GR into the nucleus upon hormone binding.Figure 3Subcellular localization and expression levels of endogenous GR in MR-H7 cells treated with GC. A, 697 cells with vector or NTD-MR were treated with 1 μm TA over a 48-h time course, harvested at designated time points, and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with a GR pAb. Accuracy of protein loading and transfer was confirmed by stripping and reprobing with a β-actin pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).B, untreated MR-H7 cells (T 0) or cells treated with 1 μm TA for 1 h (T 1) were processed for immunofluorescence using a GR pAb and confocal microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)NTD-MR Does Not Affect the Ability of GR to Bind DNATo determine whether the expression of NTD-MR interferes with the ability of GR to bind DNA, EMSA was performed using a GR/MR-specific response element as a probe and nuclear extracts from 697 cells with vector or MR-H7 cells treated for an hour with 1 μm TA. In extracts of 697 cells, we detected protein binding to the β1 MRE/GRE corresponding to endogenous GR (Fig.4 A, lane 1). This binding was reduced when a GR antibody was included in the gel shift reaction (Fig. 4 A, lane 2) and was unaffected in the presence of nonspecific serum (Fig. 4 A,lane 3) or c-Myc mAb (Fig. 4 A,lane 4). In extracts of MR-H7 cells, binding of endogenous GR to the β1 MRE/GRE was similar to that seen for 697 cells (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1 and 2). To determine whether the protein-DNA complexes contained the N-terminal MR, we used two different c-Myc mAbs and MR pAbs. In all cases, the protein-DNA complexes were either ablated or shifted to a higher position when these antibodies were used (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–6) but remained unchanged when a preimmune serum was included in the reaction (Fig.4 B,lane 7). These results indicate that the N terminus of MR is present with the GR in the protein-DNA complex, suggesting the possibility of MR-GR heterodimer formation.Figure 4NTD-MR physically associates with endogenous GR. EMSA was performed using a GR/MR-specific response element as a probe and nuclear extracts from 697 cells with vector or NTD-MR (MR-H7) treated with 1 μm TA for 1 h. A,GR pAb (α GR) or c-Myc mAb (αmyc) was incubated with nuclear extracts 10 min prior to the addition of probe (lanes 2 and 4, respectively).

Cellular lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with c-Myc mAb and analyzed by Western blot using a GR pAb (top) or a c-Myc mAb (bottom) as a control for the amount of immunoprecipitated protein.

To determine whether the inhibitory effects of NTD-MR on GR function are the result of a direct interaction with the GR, we performed immunoprecipitation analysis. 697 cells stably expressing NTD-MR (MR-H7) or NTD derivatives (1–103, 1–203, 1–303, 1–403, and 1–603) (Fig. 4 C) were treated with 1 μm TA for 3 h. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using a c-Myc mAb. As shown in Fig. 4 D(top), Western blot analysis with a GR pAb demonstrated that endogenous GR physically associates with the NTD of the MR. Specifically, this interaction occurred within the N-terminal region encompassing amino acids 203–603 (lanes 5–9), because no binding was detected with the deletion derivative 1–103 (lane 4). As a control for the amount of immunoprecipitated protein, the membrane was stripped and successively reprobed with a c-Myc mAb (bottom).Effect of NTD-MR on GR Transcriptional ActivityTo test the effect of GR/NTD-MR heterodimers on GR transcriptional activity in 697 and MR-H7 cells, we evaluated the effect of TA on GR-mediated regulation of the endogenous c-myc gene. Suppression of c-Myc mRNA has been reported previously (31Alnemri E.S. Fernandes T.F. Haldar S. Croce C.M. Litwack G. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 491-495PubMed Google Scholar) when GR-sensitive cells were treated with GC. To examine the expression of c-Myc at the mRNA level, 697 cells with vector or NTD-MR were cultured in the presence of 1 μm TA for 48 h, and RNA was prepared from cells harvested at time 0, 4, 16, 24, and 48 h. As determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, treatment of 697 cells with GC caused a 7-fold repression of c-Myc transcription by 24 h as compared with untreated cells (time 0) (Fig.5 A). This repression was blocked by NTD-MR in MR-H7 cells as shown in Fig. 5 A. GAPDH levels were unaffected by TA treatment in both cell lines. These data were confirmed by Northern blot analysis using a c-Myc-specific cDNA probe in Fig. 5 B, which shows that expression of c-Myc mRNA was dramatically reduced in 697 cells treated with TA after 4 h. Within the period of the experiment, the level of the c-Myc mRNA reached its lowest point at 24 h after TA treatment. However, in the MR-H7 cells, c-Myc mRNA levels remained constant throughout the time course.Figure 5Effect of TA on the expression of c-Myc mRNA in 697 and MR-H7 cells.

Equal amounts of RNA (15 μg/lane) were fractionated on an agarose-formaldehyde gel (top) and transferred by blotting onto Hybond-N nylon membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The c-Myc mRNA was identified by hybridization using a 1-kb 32P-labeled human c-Myc probe (bottom).

To determine whether NTD-MR expression inhibits caspase activation in 697 cells, enzymatic cleavage of endogenous caspases during GC-induced apoptosis was assessed. 697 cells stably expressing NTD-MR (MR-H7) or vector alone were cultured in the presence or absence of 1 μm TA during a 48-h time course, and whole cell lysates were examined by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.6 A, proteolytic processing of the proform of the apical caspases-8 (55 kDa) and -9 (46 kDa) and the downstream effector caspase-3 (32 kDa) was observed in 697 cells treated with TA. In contrast, in MR-H7 cells treated with TA, the inactive proenzyme forms of caspases-8, -9, and -3 remained intact, revealing that GC-induced caspase cleavage was abolished. Further evidence of this inhibition was seen when a downstream target of activated caspase-3, PARP, was examined for enzymatic degradation. Immunoblot analysis in Fig. 6 B shows that following treatment of 697 cells with TA, the “death substrate” PARP (116 kDa) was proteolyzed with generation of its signature 85-kDa cleavage product, although in MR-H7 cells, PARP cleavage was inhibited.Figure 6Stable expression of NTD-MR inhibits caspase activation and PARP cleavage during GC-induced apoptosis.

To address potential mechanisms involved in N-terminal MR inhibition of GC-induced apoptosis, we evaluated the expression levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bfl-1. As determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, treatment of 697 cells with 1 μm TA caused an 18-fold repression of Bcl-2 transcription by 16 h; however, in MR-H7 cells, Bcl-2 mRNA levels increased nearly 2-fold over the 48-h time course (Fig. 7 A). We also observed a 6-fold down-regulation of Bfl-1 mRNA in 697 cells within 4 h of treatment, whereas Bfl-1 mRNA expression in MR-H7 cells was up-regulated 8-fold (Fig. 7 A). These results were corroborated by Western blot analyses of cytosolic and mitochondrial extracts. Following GC treatment of 697 cells, mitochondrial levels of Bcl-2 were decreased, although cytosolic levels increased slightly (Fig. 7 B). In contrast, mitochondrial Bcl-2 levels were dramatically increased in MR-H7 cells (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, mitochondrial and cytosolic Bfl-1 expression levels were non-detectable in 697 cells following GC treatment, whereas in MR-H7 cells, the expression levels of Bfl-1 in the mitochondrial fraction increased slightly at 24 h and in the cytosolic fraction were increased at 48 h (Fig. 7 B).Figure 7Effect of GC on Bcl-2 and Bfl-1 mRNA expression and protein levels in 697 and MR-H7 cells.

Thus, we examined the localization and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid and Bax in 697 and MR-H7 cells treated with 1 μm TA. Western blot analysis in Fig. 8 A shows that in 697 cells, both cytosolic and mitochondrial levels of Bid were dramatically higher than in MR-H7 cells. Moreover, in MR-H7 cells, Bid was located primarily within the mitochondria, whereas in 697 cells it was detected in the cytosol as well. Bax protein levels did not seem to be significantly different between the two cell lines; however, Bax was only faintly detectable in the cytosol of MR-H7 cells at 48 h (Fig. 8 A).Figure 8A, localization of Bid, Bax, Cyt c, and Smac in GC-treated 697 and MR-H7 cells.

In HIV-1, the existence of intricate interactions between tRNA 3Lys and the genomic RNA was initially demonstrated in vitro, using chemical and enzymatic probing (13Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Isel C. Lanchy J.M., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These data allowed us to propose a secondary structure model of the initiation complex for HIV-1 Mal (13Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). In this model, in addition to the interaction between the 3′ part of tRNA 3Lys with the PBS (helix 7F in Fig.1), parts of the anticodon stem-loop and of the variable loop of tRNA 3Lys interact with viral sequences upstream of the PBS (forming helices 6C, 5D, and 3E in Fig.1). The same interactions were observed when the primer-template complex was formed by heat annealing or with the nucleocapsid protein (38Brulé F. Marquet R. Rong L. Wainberg M.A. Roques B.P., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. RNA. 2002; 8: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, an alternative interaction was proposed for HIV-1 HXB2 between the sequence involved in the 5′ strand of helix 1 in our model and 5′ part of the TΨC stem-loop of tRNA 3Lys (39Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Probing of the ribose-phosphate backbone of the tRNA 3Lys-viral RNA (vRNA) complex and enzymatic footprinting of RT on this complex allowed us to build a three-dimensional model of the tRNA 3Lys-vRNA:RT complex (16Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This model suggested that HIV-1 RT directly interacts with helices 7F, 1, and 8 and with the three-nucleotide junction between helices 7F and 2. Modeling also indicated that helix 2 is in close proximity to the finger and thumb subdomains of RT and could contribute to binding of the polymerase. Importantly, we observed no interaction between RT and the intermolecular helices 6C, 5D, and 3E, whose importance for viral replication has been demonstrated (26Wakefield J.K. Kang S.-M. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 966-975Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kang S.M. Zhang Z.J. Morrow C.D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 207-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Zhang Z.J. Kang S.M., Li, Y. Morrow C.D.

Kang S.M. LeBlanc A. Hajduk S.L. Morrow C.D. Virology. 1996; 226: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These helices likely play an indirect role by preventing steric clashes between the primer-template complex and RT and/or by imposing a correct orientation of the structural elements directly interacting with the polymerase (16Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used the three-dimensional tRNA 3Lys-vRNA:RT model to design a series of deletion and substitution mutants of the vRNA, to compare the importance of the RNA structural elements on the early steps of reverse transcription. When required, we used chemical probing to check the structure of the tRNA 3Lys-mutant vRNA complexes, and for each of them, we measured the binding affinity of RT and the kinetics of initial extension of tRNA 3Lys and of synthesis of the (−) strand strong stop DNA ((−) ssDNA). Unexpectedly, our results indicated that perturbing the global folding of the initiation complex was more detrimental than deleting individual structural elements involved in RT binding. They also identified structural elements that constitute promising targets for anti-initiation-specific drugs. Natural tRNA 3Lys was purified from beef liver as described (41Bénas P. Bec G. Keith G. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Dumas P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). It was internally labeled at its ultimate 3′ phosphate or at its 5′ end according to published procedures (16Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Wild type and S162–167 RNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription of plasmids pJCB (42Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pICA1 (18Skripkin E. Isel C. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 509-514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively, linearized with RsaI. RNA 123–217 was obtained by in vitro transcription of the PCR product obtained by amplification of nucleotides 123–217 of pJCB using primers 5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCTCTGGTAACTAGAGATCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGGCCCTGTTACTTTCACTTTAAAGTCCC-3′ (antisense). To obtain the other RNA templates, plasmid pJCB was mutated with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the protocols provided by the supplier, and the mutant vRNAs were obtained as described above. All of the RNAs were purified as described previously (43Marquet R. Baudin F. Gabus C. Darlix J.L. Mougel M. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Wild type HIV-1 RT was purified essentially as described (44Le Grice S.F. Cameron C.E. Benkovic S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 130-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) Viral RNA (4 pmol) and purified natural tRNA 3Lys were incubated in water for 2 min at 90 °C, cooled on ice, and incubated at 70 °C for 20 min in sodium cacodylate (pH 7.5) 50 mm, 300 mmKCl. After hybridization, the samples were incubated at 20 °C for 15 min in the same buffer supplemented with 5 mmMgCl2. After addition of 1 μg of yeast total tRNA, 1 μl of 10-fold diluted DMS was added and allowed to react for 5 or 10 min. RNA modification was stopped with 200 μl of ethanol and 50 μl of sodium acetate 0.3 m (pH 5.3) containing 1 μg of glycogen. A DMS reaction was conducted in parallel on the free vRNA. Modified bases were detected by primer extension with reverse transcriptase as described previously (45Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). In a standard experiment, vRNA (final concentration, 30 nm) was annealed with 32P-labeled tRNA 3Lys(final concentration, 10 nm) as described above and preincubated for 4 min with 25 nm RT in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol. Reverse transcription was initiated by adding a mixture of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (50 μm each) in the same buffer. Formamide containing 50 mm EDTA was added to aliquots of the reaction mixture at times ranging from 15 s to 30 min, and the reaction products were analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified with a BioImager BAS 2000 (Fuji) using the MacBas software. To determine the equilibrium dissociation constant of the wild type and mutant vRNA-tRNA 3Lys:RT complexes, ∼5 nm32P-labeled tRNA 3Lys-vRNA complex were preincubated for 4 min with increasing concentrations of RT (0 to 400 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithioerythritol. The addition of 500 μm dCTP, together with poly(rA)·(dT)15 at a final concentration of 1 μm (dT)15 allowed the extension of the primer by one nucleotide in the preformed ternary complexes, while preventing recycling of RT. Prior to addition to the reaction mixture, poly(rA) and (dT)15 at a 10:1 (w/w) ratio were annealed for 20 min at 70 °C. The extension reaction was stopped after 15 s, and the reaction products were separated and quantified as described above. The efficiency of poly(rA)·(dT)15 in trapping free RT was controlled by checking that primer extension did not significantly increase when the reaction time was increased from 15 s to 15 min. The wild type RNA template used in this study encompassed nucleotides 1–311 of the HIV-1 Mal isolate. It served as a reference, because the structural studies conducted on the tRNA 3Lys-vRNA and tRNA 3Lys-vRNA:RT complexes were performed using this isolate (13–16,32), and structural probing data for the HXB2 strain (39Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 46Beerens N. Klaver B. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2227-2238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 47Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) concern only the free RNA. During formation of the tRNA 3Lys-vRNA complex, most of the structural rearrangements were observed between nucleotides 123 and 217 of the vRNA, and previous structural studies showed that a template encompassing these nucleotides formed the same primer-template complex as RNA 1–311 (14Isel C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 16Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Therefore, we tested whether RNA 123–217 contains all of the elements required for efficient initiation of reverse transcription. To test the importance of helices 1 and 8, we constructed a template corresponding to nucleotides 131–196 that lacks these two helices and mutants corresponding to deletion of nucleotides 123–130 and 208–217 (ΔHx 1) and 200–208 (ΔHx8), in the context of RNA 123–217. All other mutations were introduced in the context of RNA 1–311. To test the function of helix 2, we first substituted nucleotides 132–139 by AUCUCUAG, a copy of the 3′ strand of this helix (Fig. 1, mutant S132–139). We then restored this helix by further substituting nucleotides 168–175 by the original 5′ strand of helix 2, generating the compensatory mutant CompCG (Fig. 1). To evaluate the influence of the sequence and stability of helix 2 on reverse transcription, we substituted the third base pair of the CompCG helix2 (a C-G base pair) by a U-A base pair (CompUA). To study the importance of the intermolecular tRNA 3Lys-vRNA interactions (helices 6C, 5D, and 3E in Fig. 1), we used mutant S162–167, in which the wild type sequence GUAAAA is replaced by CUAUG. A previous structural study of this mutant showed that not only helix 6C but also helices 5D and 3E were disrupted in the corresponding binary complex (14Isel C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because the intermolecular interactions require the post-transcriptional modifications of natural tRNA 3Lys to be stable (13Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 15Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25269-25272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was not possible to use compensatory mutations in the primer to restore helix 6C. To test whether nucleotides 140–167 could hinder reverse transcription by producing steric clashes with RT when not engaged in intermolecular helices, we compared mutants S162–167 and Δ140–167, in which these nucleotides were replaced by a UUCG tetraloop. A mutant further deleted from helix 2 was also constructed (mutant Δ132–175). The last series of mutants was designed to test the importance of the junction between helices 2 and 7F, which imposes strong structural constraints to the tRNA 3Lys-vRNA complex (16Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This junction, which is three nucleotides in length in the wild type complex, was entirely deleted (mutant J0), shortened to one nucleotide (mutant J1), or extended to five nucleotides (mutant J5). Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to ensure that the heat-annealing protocol we used allowed quantitative (> 95%) hybridization of tRNA 3Lys to all RNA templates (data not shown). Conducting a complete structural study on all of the mutant complexes was beyond the scope of this work. Nevertheless, we wanted to check whether the mutations induced unexpected rearrangements of the tRNA-vRNA complexes. In particular, because the intermolecular interactions were previously shown to affect reverse transcription (32Isel C. Lanchy J.M., Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we tested their existence in the mutants not designed to disrupt them. Probing of the template RNA with DMS, which modifies single-stranded As and Cs at one of their Watson-Crick positions (48Ehresmann C. Baudin F. Mougel M. Romby P. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 9109-9128Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), was particularly useful in this respect. We tested the conformation of mutants S132–139, CompCG, and CompUA, either free or engaged in the primer-template complex (Fig.2). The main signature of the intermolecular interactions was the partial protection of A164–167 upon formation of the wild type binary complex, with A165 and A166 being more efficiently protected than A164 and A167, whereas A168, which was engaged in helix 2, was not modified (Fig. 2). In addition, formation of the wild type complex was accompanied by an increased reactivity of C176, A157, and A150 that reflected rearrangement of the vRNA (Figs. 1 and 2). Probing experiments clearly indicated that, in addition to disrupting helix 2, the substitution introduced in mutant S132–139 also prevented formation of the intermolecular interactions 3E, 5D, and 6C. Modification of A132, C134, C136, and A138 indicated that the substituted sequence was single-stranded. In addition, A164–167 remained equally modified by DMS upon formation of the primer-template complex, and reactivity of C176 and A157 did not increase (Fig. 2). However, a structural rearrangement involving nucleotides 145–150 took place, reflecting formation of stem-loop 4. Analysis of mutant CompCG was consistent with the restoration of helix 2, as indicated by the absence of modification of A132, C134, C136, and A138 (Fig. 2). It also indicated that the intermolecular interactions were restored, as judged by the reactivity of C176, A164–167, A157, and A150 (Fig. 2). Expectedly, mutant CompUA yielded the same DMS modification pattern (Fig. 2), indicating that both compensatory mutants adopted the same structure. Structural probing of mutants J0, J1, and J5 showed that the complexes formed by these mutant templates all adopt the wild type structure (Fig. 2). The decreased reactivity of A164–167 and the increased reactivity of A157 and A150 supported the existence of the intermolecular interactions and helix 4. Furthermore, the absence of reactivity of nucleotides 132–139 was in agreement with formation of helix 2. The only significant difference we observed among those mutants concerned A164, which was as reactive as A167 in mutant J0 but less reactive in J1 and J5. This difference might reflect increased structural stress when deleting the entire junction. Determination of the equilibrium dissociation constant of RT to wild type and mutant template-primer complexes required distinguishing between bound and free enzyme. This distinction was possible by using a trap that bound to the free enzyme while allowing primer extension by RT bound to the tRNA 3Lys-vRNA complexes (33Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C., Le Grice S.F.J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9740-9747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Such methodology requires extension of tRNA 3Lys to be faster than dissociation of the bound enzyme or at least of the same order of magnitude. Thus, to maximize the sensitivity of this assay, we used a high dCTP concentration (500 μm). Indeed, we found theK d of dCTP for the natural tRNA 3Lys-wild type vRNA to be ∼250 μm, 2M. Rigourd, unpublished results. i.e. more than 1 order of magnitude lower than when using a synthetic RNA primer (36Thrall S.H. Krebs R. Wohrl B.M. Cellai L. Goody R.S. Restle T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13349-13358Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This method for K ddetermination took only productively bound RT into account. This was especially important because our large template-primer complexes might contain unspecific RT-binding sites. Examples of binding curves are shown in Fig.3, and the data obtained with all of the mutant templates are summarized in TableI. For most templates, the maximal fraction of extended primer was about 0.7 (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Noticeable exceptions were RNAs 131–196, J0 (Fig. 3), J5, and to a lesser extent ΔHx1 (not shown). In these experiments, an increased dissociation rate and/or a decreased polymerization rate result in a decreased primer extension. The extension of the primer can be further reduced if a significant amount of the primer-template complex adopts a conformation to which RT cannot bind.Table ISummary of the binding and kinetic parameters of the WT and mutant tRNA 3Lys /vRNA complexesTemplateK dk fastA fastrelative (−) ssDNA synthesisnms−1%%1–31121 ± 40.08 ± 0.00682 ± 2100123–21762 ± 70.03 ± 0.00458 ± 577131–19694 ± 130.02 ± 0.00637 ± 631ΔHx193 ± 180.02 ± 0.00445 ± 437ΔHx837 ± 40.04 ± 0.0140 ± 549S132–13956 ± 90.03 ± 0.00466 ± 573CompCG12 ± 20.06 ± 0.00683 ± 386CompUA12 ± 10.06 ± 0.00391 ± 2104S162–16763 ± 60.003 ± 0.00162 ± 28Δ140–16777 ± 100.05 ± 0.00965 ± 628Δ132–17590 ± 120.08 ± 0.00866 ± 231J014 ± 30.004 ± 0.00144 ± 710J19 ± 20.04 ± 0.00374 ± 357J551 ± 70.03 ± 0.00426 ±"

Lactate dehydrogenase activity, lactate production, and growth in the medium without glucose indicate that these cells shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. Electron microscopic observations revealed abnormal mitochondria with unique cristae structures. Staining with MitoTracker dye showed that the mitochondrial transmembrane potential was reduced by 30–40% from the parent cell levels. These cells were markedly susceptible to H2O2 and died apparently by a necrotic mechanism, a process blocked by deferoxamine in the parent cells but not ρ-0 cells. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry revealed an approximately 3-fold accumulation of iron in the ρ-0 cells at confluence (n = 4–6, three clones, *p < 0.05). Iron and four other metals were all elevated in the cells of one of the ρ-0 clones and were similar to control levels in the control cybrid cells, which were replenished with normal mitochondrial DNA. Their sensitivity to H2O2 was also similar to that of the parent cells. These results indicate that a newly established neuronal related ρ-0 cell line is highly susceptible to active oxygen species and that these toxicity effects appear to be related to an accumulation of transition metals, which probably occurs through the respiratory impairment.

These cells were markedly susceptible to H2O2 and died apparently by a necrotic mechanism, a process blocked by deferoxamine in the parent cells but not ρ-0 cells. Analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry revealed an approximately 3-fold accumulation of iron in the ρ-0 cells at confluence (n = 4–6, three clones, *p < 0.05). Iron and four other metals were all elevated in the cells of one of the ρ-0 clones and were similar to control levels in the control cybrid cells, which were replenished with normal mitochondrial DNA. Their sensitivity to H2O2 was also similar to that of the parent cells. These results indicate that a newly established neuronal related ρ-0 cell line is highly susceptible to active oxygen species and that these toxicity effects appear to be related to an accumulation of transition metals, which probably occurs through the respiratory impairment.

In the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, iron and other metals also appear to accumulate (8Bartzokis G. Tishler T.A. Cell. Mol.

More direct evidence of mitochondrial and iron association in neurodegenerative disorders comes from an increase in mitochondrial iron in the fibroblasts of patients with Friedreich's ataxia, whose responsible gene is the mitochondrial frataxin (3Delatycki M.B.

It would also be intriguing to uncover an association of mitochondrial respiratory deficiency and cell death with an accumulation of metals because a new, pivotal, regulatory role for mitochondria in cell survival and death has emerged from a growing body of evidence (for a review, see Ref. 22Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We considered mtDNA-depleted ρ (rho)-0 cells (23King M.P. Attardi G.

Alcolado J.C. Clin. Sci. 1999; 97: 207-213Crossref Google Scholar). Generation of such ρ-0 cell types that have a neuronal background appears difficult because neuronal and glial cells are susceptible to respiratory crisis, and only one human neuroblastoma-derived ρ-0 line is available (SH-SY5Y origin (31Miller S.W. Trimmer P.A. Davis Parker W. Davis R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar)). In this report, first we established a novel ρ-0 line from a human neuroblastoma line, characterized it, and discovered that its phenotype might be relevant to mitochondrial and neurodegenerative disorders. We then examined whether these cells are vulnerable to oxidative stress through a metal-mediated mechanism. The present results strongly suggest that chronic deficiency in the mitochondrial respiration of cells produces an accumulation of iron and other metals, rendering them highly susceptible to oxidative stress. The SILA cell line was initially isolated from a child's neuroblastoma by Matsumura et al. (32Matsumura T. Sugimoto T. Horii Y. Kuroda H. Saida T. Hosoi H. Michihata T. Hino T. Kawakatsu H. Sawada T. Inazawa J. Abe T. Hum. Cell. 1989; 2: 206-207PubMed Google Scholar) at our university. These cells produced neuronal and epithelial subtypesin vitro, but we employed a neuronal type 2B4 subline in this study (provided by Dr. Matsumura). SILA cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, 4.5 g/liter, Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For establishing ρ-0 cells, pyruvate and uridine were also added to the medium at the reported concentrations (31Miller S.W. Trimmer P.A. Davis Parker W. Davis R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Initially, cells were treated with EtBr (Bio-Rad) at different concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 10 μg/ml, and those concentrations, at which cells showed no morphological response or immediate death, were excluded from the subsequent experiment. When most of the SILA cells remaining in the culture started to grow continuously after a few months of EtBr treatment, we subcloned them either by limiting dilution or cloning rings. Cloned cells were maintained in the culture medium supplemented with pyruvate, uridine, and 1 μg/ml EtBr for the next month. We monitored respiration of cells periodically as described below. After ∼10 passages, EtBr-resistant and respiration-deficient cells were used for subsequent experiments. Cells at confluence in a 10-cm diameter dish were detached and suspended in 10 ml of Tyrode's solution (+), which consisted of 0.134 m NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 3 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 12 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EGTA, and 3.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 6.5. Then, the cells were collected, and a certain number of them, ∼4 −10 × 106, were resuspended in 1.2 ml of Tyrode's solution (−), pH 7.4, which omitted EGTA from Tyrode's solution (+). Cells were then transferred to the chamber of the device (Oxigraph type 9, Central Science, Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), which was equipped with the Clarke-type electrode to measure the rate of O2 consumption polarographically, and O2 consumption was calculated using the following formula: rate of O2 consumption (in fmol/min/cell) = (the rate of O2 consumption of cells (in mg/liter/min) − the rate of decrease of O2concentration of Tyrode's solution (−) (in mg/liter/min)) × 1.2 (ml) × 10−15 (fmol)/32 (g)/cell number, where the volume of the chamber is 1.2 ml and the molecular weight of O2 is 32. A portion of the D-loop region of mtDNA was amplified using serially diluted DNA samples isolated from the parent and three representative ρ-0 clones. The intensities of these amplified bands in gel visualized with EtBr were compared with those of the nuclear DNA-encoded β-actin gene. The primer sequences listed below were derived from those reported previously (33Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H.L. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P.

Lactate concentrations in the culture media were measured with a commercially available kit (l-Lactic acid, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and the rate of the production, which was expressed in μg/h/mg of protein, was calculated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular LDH activity and the GSH level were also determined with commercially available kits (LDH-D, Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo; BIOTECH GSH-400 OXIS, International, Inc., Portland, OR) and expressed in units/mg and nmol/mg, respectively. The ATP level was measured by a chemiluminescent reaction-based method using a kit (Compactlumi VS501, Yamato Science, Tokyo), and the luminescence was detected using a luminometer (Gene-Light55, Microtech Nichion, Tokyo). ATP levels were calculated and expressed in pmol/mg. All values were normalized with the total protein as above, which was determined using bicinchoninic acid reagent (BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit, Pierce Chemical Co.). To confirm the dependence of their growth on the supplementation of pyruvate and uridine, cell growth was monitored by the trypan blue exclusion method over 5 days in culture with or without these substrates. The dependence of energy metabolism on glucose was evaluated by counting cells in 3-cm diameter dishes for 24 h in galactose-substituted (for glucose) medium and by comparing cellular ATP and lactate production (as described above). Cells cultured in wells of a 24-well plate in which glass coverslips were placed were labeled with MitoTracker dye (CMTMRos, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 100 nm for 15 min, postfixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution (0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), and observed using a fluorescent microscope (ECLIPS E1000, Nikon, Kyoto) with a red filter for interference (≥ 590 nm). Fluorescent intensities in the unit area of the cytoplasm and nucleus of SILA and Sρ-0 cells were measured densitometrically, and from these values, the intensity of the glass slide was subtracted as a background. The fluorescent intensity of the nucleus was used to normalize intercellular and interexperimental differences in MitoTracker staining. Products obtained by dividing the intensity of cytoplasmic fluorescence with that of nucleic fluorescence were calculated (n = 10–12 cells) and statistically compared. We observed three clones of the Sρ-0 line, clone 1-6, 4-2, and 6H10, under electron microscopy. Cells at confluence in a T75 flask were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and collected from the flask with a scraper. They were postfixed with 1% OsO4 and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were stained with uranic acetate and lead and observed with a H7000 electron microscope (Hitachi Co. Ltd., Tokyo). For this experiment, we used the clone 4-2 from three Sρ-0 lines because its ATP level was similar to that of the parent cells. Cells grown in 3-cm diameter dishes were incubated with H2O2 (analytical grade for atomic absorption, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Kyoto) at various concentrations with or without deferoxamine mesylate (DFX, Wako) for 24 h. 10 μl of culture medium from each dish was then incubated with substrate solution for determining LDH activity released from cells with the above described kit (LDH-D). Meanwhile, cells in the dish were lysed with lysis buffer (5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 20 mm EDTA, and the total DNA was extracted with phenol. DNA precipitated with ethanol and dissolved in Tris/EDTA buffer was incubated with RNase A (Sigma) at 100 μg/ml for 1 h, extracted again with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and electrophoresed in 2.2% agarose gel. To measure the total cellular metals, control and ρ-0 cells grown in and confluent at 10-cm diameter dishes were detached with trypsin, washed twice with phosphate buffer that included mannitol at 0.25 m, and then were completely reduced to ash by treatment with nitric acid (for poisonous metal determination, Wako), hydrogen peroxide (for atomic absorption spectrochemical analysis, Wako), and perchloric acid (for poisonous metal determination, Wako) under heat (8Bartzokis G. Tishler T.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2000; 46: 821-833PubMed Google Scholar, 35Nakayama A. Fukuda H. Masaaki E. Hamasaki H. Nakajima K. Sakurai H. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cellular ashes were dissolved with 10 ml of 6% nitric acid and then analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) using a Shimadzu ICPS-8500 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). We first measured the iron content (m/z 57) in three representative Sρ-0 clones to confirm that an accumulation of iron in this cell type was general. Then, we established a control cybrid line (see below) and measured the levels of four other metals, aluminum (m/z 27), manganese (m/z 55), copper (m/z 63), and zinc (m/z 66) together with iron, in the parent SILA, Sρ-0, and the control cybrid cells. We selected these metals because they are the major transition metals within cells. Contamination from tubes and other sources was avoided for these metals. The concentration of cellular metals was calculated according to a linearly regressed curve prepared for each metal using a standard solution (Multielement Standard Solution BM, Wako). Values of a serially diluted multielement standard solution showed linear regression with a line in the range from 5 to 1,000 ng/ml for aluminum, iron, and zinc and from 0.5 to 100 ng/ml for copper and manganese, respectively. The measurement was performed at least twice (n = 3–4) to verify the results. To clarify whether an elevation of metal contents in Sρ-0 cells is mtDNA-dependent, we produced a cybrid cell line replenished with normal mtDNA by fusing ρ-0 cells with platelets from a normal volunteer (23-year-old Japanese female) by the standard protocol (24Chomyn A. Lai S.T. Shakeley R. Bresoiln N. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1994; 54: 966-974PubMed Google Scholar, 25Trimmer P.A. Swerdlow R.H. Parks J.K. Keeney P. Bennett J.P. Miller S.W. Davis R.E. Davis Parker W. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 162: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The mtDNA level and the metabolic shift were evaluated by the PCR procedure and by lactate production as described above, respectively. We succeeded in producing the control cybrids from Sρ-0 clones 1-6 and 6H10 and used Sρ-0/1-6 and its corresponding control cybrid cells for determination of the five metals. To assess the sensitivity of parent, Sρ-0/1-6, and the control cybrid cells to oxidative stress, the cells were incubated individually with H2O2 at 0.5 mm for 24 h because the results obtained in the earlier experiment (see above) indicated that this concentration of H2O2 was critical for evaluating its effect. The LDH activity released to culture media from cells thus treated was measured as discussed previously. Using an appropriate computer program (Win Stat, version 1.2, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA), we compared two groups and multigroups with the unpaired t test and ANOVA with Bonferroni's multiple comparison, respectively. Significance was set at p < 0.05. In initial experiments, we determined the range of appropriate concentrations of EtBr in the medium to be from 1 to 10 μg/ml, as reported previously (31Miller S.W. Trimmer P.A. Davis Parker W. Davis R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). SILA cells were markedly resistant to EtBr toxicity and were able to grow even at the highest concentration. Subsequently, more than 10 clones were isolated, termed Sρ-0, and we used three Sρ-0 clones for subsequent analysis. The rate of O2 consumption of the parent line was 0.56 ± 0.18 fmol/min/cell (n = 3), whereas that of the Sρ-0 cells was immeasurable (TableI). Targeting 3 ng and 30 pg (corresponding to 1 and 10−2 in Fig.1) of the total DNA isolated from SILA cells, portions of both the D-loop region of mtDNA and β-actin gene were amplified by PCR. When the lowest quantity of the genomic DNA, 0.3 pg (10−4), was used, the fragment of the D-loop region still was produced, but the β-actin fragment was not (Fig. 1, SILA). The sensitivity of this determination was therefore calculated as a few copies of a gene, given that the DNA quantity of a single cell comprises 6 pg (2 (diploid) × 3 × 109(bp/haploid of a human genome) × 600 (molecular weight/bp)/6 × 1023). While using DNA samples isolated from Sρ-0 clones, regardless of the quantities, no D-loop region-derived bands were detectable (Fig. 1, e.g. Sρ-0 clones 1-6 and 4-2). We examined all other clones in the same way, and we periodically performed PCR using DNA samples as 10 ng (see also production of control cybrids).Table IBiochemical characterizationO2LDHLactateATPGSHfmol/min/cellunits/mgμg/h/mgpmol/mgnmol/mgSILA0.56 ± 0.183.63 ± 0.2989.6 ± 12.343.6 ± 5.473.5 ± 22Sρ-0/1–6ND4.92 ± 0.64224 ± 9.5***68.3 ± 5.270.4 ± 2.5Sρ-0/4–2ND4.51 ± 0.34204 ± 8.1***34.2 ± 4.492.7 ± 12Sρ-0/6H10ND12.2 ± 3.46***272 ± 67.3***111 ± 39.1***82.4 ± 19O2 consumption, LDH activity, lactate production, ATP level, and total GSH level of SILA and three representative clones of Sρ-0 lines 1–6, 4–2, and 6H10 (mean ± S.D., n = 3–4) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” *** indicates significance at p < 0.001 in ANOVA with Bonferroni's correction.

ND, not detected. The LDH activity of two clones of Sρ-0 cells (Table I; Sρ-0/1-6 and Sρ-0/4-2) were increased slightly, whereas that of the other clone (Sρ-0/6H10) was increased significantly (n = 3–4, ***,p < 0.0001) compared with parent SILA cells. Lactate release of all three Sρ-0 clones was significantly higher than that of the parent cells (***, p < 0.001). The ATP levels of clones 1-6 and 4-2 were not decreased significantly from those of SILA cells, and those of clone 6H10 were increased 60% (***,p < 0.0001). The levels of GSH in three Sρ-0 clones were all similar to the level of the parent cells. Replacement of glucose with galactose in the culture medium significantly reduced the cell number, lactate production, and the level of ATP of ρ-0 cells (Fig. 2,n = 3, *, p < 0.05, ***,p < 0.0001). Without pyruvate and uridine in the culture medium, Sρ-0 cells did not grow (Fig. 2, cell growth, open circles, n = 3) and were dead by 1 week (data not shown). When pyruvate and uridine were added, the cells grew constantly over 5 days (Fig. 2, closed circles,n = 3). All three Sρ-0 clones showed similar results. SILA cells contained normal mitochondria with an electron-dense matrix and regular cristae structure (Fig. 3 A), whereas all Sρ-0 cells contained only swollen mitochondria with a translucent matrix, which were not observed in parent cells (Fig. 3,B–D). The morphology of cristae was markedly varied, short, extended, and circular. Occasionally, mitochondria with onion-shaped, concentric multilamellae cristae (Fig. 3 D,arrows) were observed regardless of Sρ-0 clones. The mitochondrial structure in SILA cells was clearly stained with CMTMRos (Fig. 4 A), whereas in Sρ-0 cells the amorphous structure was only stained weakly (Fig.4 B). Determination of the red fluorescent intensity of CMTMRos incorporated into mitochondria of SILA and two clones of Sρ-0 cells demonstrated a 30–40% reduction in ρ-0 cells compared with controls (Fig. 4 C, n = 10–12 cells, ***,p < 0.0001). Parent cells were affected when treated with H2O2 in a dose-dependent manner as evidenced by an elevation of LDH activity in the medium (Fig.5 A, SILA, n = 3, ***, p < 0.0001, versus without H2O2 treatment, open bar). The electrophoresed DNA of SILA cells showed a ladder pattern in a corresponding way (Fig. 5 B, left half). The LDH release from Sρ-0/4-2 cells into the culture medium occurred by the addition of H2O2 even at 0.25 mmand had already reached the maximum at 0.5 mm (Fig.5 A, Sρ-0, n = 3). DNA isolated from the Sρ-0/4-2 cells treated with H2O2 showed a smear in gel in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 B, right half). When SILA cells were treated with DFX, an iron/copper chelator (43Schwartzkopff B. Frenzel H. Breithardt G. Deckert M. Lösse B. Toyka K.V. Borggrefe M. Hort W. J. Am. Col. Cardiol. 1988; 12: 1522-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), together with H2O2, both the LDH release (Fig. 5 C, SILA, n = 3, ***, p < 0.0001 and **,p < 0.001, versus without H2O2 treatment, open bar) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5 D, left half) were completely abolished in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, the DFX treatment up to 500 μm had no inhibitory effect on either the LDH release from Sρ-0/4-2 cells (Fig.5 C, Sρ-0, n = 3) or the smear DNA pattern (Fig. 5 D, right half). ICP-MS revealed the concentration of iron in SILA and three Sρ-0 clones, 1-6, 4-2, and 6H10, to be 124 ± 24, 395 ± 126, 359 ± 94, and 356 ± 23 ng/mg, respectively (Fig. 6,n = 4–5, *, p < 0.05). We could establish a normal and control cybrid line using Sρ-0/1-6 cells as a recipient by fusing them with platelets from a healthy volunteer. Replenishment of the mtDNA in the ρ-0 cells was evidenced by PCR (Fig.7 A, cybrid clones 1 and 2). Correspondingly, the lactate production by control cybrid clones 1 and 2 was similar to that of the parent cells, which was significantly lower than that of Sρ-0 cells (Fig. 7 B, n= 3, ***, p < 0.0001). The levels of five metals, aluminum, iron, zinc, manganese, and copper were all found to be elevated significantly in Sρ-0 clone 1-6 cells compared with the parent cells (Fig.8, A and B). With the exception of the zinc levels, the other four metals in control cybrid cells were similar to those in parent cells. The levels of zinc in the cybrids also showed a decreasing trend. LDH release from parent, ρ-0, and control cybrid cells (Fig. 8 C, LDH,n = 3, ***, p < 0.001) and their morphologies (Fig. 8, D–F) after treatment with H2O2 at 0.5 mm for 24 h indicated that the sensitivity of the control cybrids to this treatment was similar to that of the parent cells, with Sρ-0/1-6 cells being more sensitive than the other two cell types. Given the considerable phenotypic differences among lines and because only one human neuroblastoma-derived ρ-0 cell line (SH-SY5Y origin) is currently available (31Miller S.W. Trimmer P.A. Davis Parker W. Davis R.E. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 1897-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it becomes necessary to isolate additional ρ-0 lines from nervous tissue for comparison. We established Sρ-0 lines from human neuroblastoma-derived SILA cells to determine whether a deficiency in mitochondrial respiration renders cells susceptible to metal-mediated, oxidative stress. It is expected, a priori, that ρ-0 cells shift their energy metabolism from aerobic to anaerobic. That cybrid cells replenished with normal mtDNA produced lactate at the same level as the parent cells indicates that a glycolytic shift of ρ-0 cells had taken place and that it is respiration state-dependent and reversible. These results are consistent with those reported by Vaillant et al. (36Vaillant F. Loveland B.E. Nagley P. Linnane A.W. Biochem. Int. 1991; 23: 571-580PubMed Google Scholar). It is not surprising that the ATP level of these respiration-lacking cells was at least not reduced compared with that of the parent cells when glycolysis was highly up-regulated to overcome the reduction of the cellular ATP. Cells of a glial nature, such as astrocytes and Schwann cells, are known to up-regulate glycolysis under ischemic conditions (37Stewart M.A. Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. J. Neurochem. 1965; 12: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 38Marrif H. Juurlink B.H.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 57: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is necessary to establish more ρ-0 lines with neuronal or glial origin and compare them with each other to elucidate mechanisms by which cells adapt to the respiration-deficient state. Electron microscopic observation of Sρ-0 cells revealed swollen mitochondria with translucent matrix and quite irregular cristae structure, which were seen regardless of the clones.

However, little is known regarding the mechanism used to transport substrates or the tertiary structure of the protein. Through the analysis of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line deficient in folate uptake, we have identified a single residue in TM10 (Arg-373) of RFC that appears to play a critical role in the translocation of substrate. Replacement of this position with various amino acids (KHQNA) diminished the rate of translocation by 16–50-fold, although substrate binding, protein stability, and localization were unaffected. Furthermore, the translocation capabilities of an R373C mutant in a cysteine-less form of the reduced folate carrier were enhanced 2.5-fold by the positively charged methanethiosulfonate reagent, confirming the essential role of a positive charge at this position. When considering the membrane-impermeable nature of this reagent, the data further suggest that the Arg-373 residue is located within the substrate translocation pathway of the RFC protein. Moreover, cross-linking analysis of the Arg-373 residue demonstrates that it is within 6 Å of residue Glu-394 (TM11), providing the first definitive tertiary structural information for this protein.

J. 2001; 358: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) providing some insight regarding the tertiary structure. Overall, however, there is limited information available on the folding of the RFC protein or the mechanism of transporting folates.In this report, we examined the RFC protein encoded by a folate transport-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) line. The protein has a single point mutation in the predicted TM10, resulting in the substitution of arginine for histidine (R373H). Functional analysis of modified proteins with amino acid replacements for Arg-373 indicates that this residue plays a critical role in substrate translocation and may form part of the translocation pathway. Furthermore, the Arg-373 (TM10) residue and another (Glu-394; TM11) are shown to be within close proximity of each other, presenting the first definitive tertiary structural information for the RFC protein.DISCUSSIONA number of functionally disruptive mutations have been identified and characterized within the RFC protein, and yet the mechanism of substrate transport has remained undefined. In this study, a charged residue (Arg-373) that appears to have a key role in the efficiency of substrate translocation has been identified. Furthermore, this residue was demonstrated to be in close proximity to one located 21 residues downstream, providing the first delineation of the RFC protein tertiary structure.The Mtx-resistant phenotype of the MtxRII 4-5 cell line is the combined result of the loss of one rfc allele, possibly during the initial mutagenesis procedure, and the presence of a mutation in the remaining allele. This point mutation resulted in the substitution of histidine for arginine at position 373. As this amino acid is conserved within the RFC protein throughout eukaryotic organisms including theCaenorhabditis elegans homologue, it is likely to play a pivotal role in defining protein structure or function. Biochemical and functional analysis of an array of amino acids substituted into this position indicated that there are strict requirements to allow any degree of substrate transport. First, the amino acid at position 373 appears to require the ability to form hydrogen bonds, as the frequency of functional transfectants diminishes as the polar tendencies of the residues decline (Arg ∼ Lys > His > Gln > Ala). Second, the amino acid needs to be of a certain size, as exemplified by the transfection frequency of the R373Q and R373N mutant proteins. Although the asparagine residue differs by only a single carbon in length, the transfection frequency is significantly reduced from that of R373Q. However, the alanine substitution was also slightly better tolerated than the asparagine, suggesting that the ability to form hydrogen bonds can be detrimental if the residue is too small due to destabilizing polar interactions within the local environment.The transfection frequencies are drastically reduced for most of the alterations at aa 373 with the exception of lysine, a residue similar in size and charge to arginine. However, most of the other replacements (R373H, R373Q and R373A) yield cell lines similar to the wild-type in folinic acid requirements and Mtx sensitivity; this seems to be the result of increased EGFP fusion protein expression (3–6-fold) over Arg-373-EGFP lines. The low folinic acid growth conditions select for cells with a high level of protein expression, which can compensate for the decreased rate of substrate transport. Thus, in some cases in which clones were not selected for functionality but merely for G418 resistance carried by the plasmid, the protein expression levels are lower (i.e. R373N-EGFP). The low level of R373N-EGFP expression as compared with the other 373 mutant cell lines is reflected in the folinic acid requirements and Mtx sensitivity.Based on algorithms, epitope mapping (5Ferguson P.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16269-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and cysteine scanning,2 the RFC protein is consistent with a 12-TM topology with aa 373 predicted to be in the 10th transmembrane domain. It appears that the presence of this charged amino acid in the hydrophobic membrane environment may be tolerated as a result of accessibility to the extracellular environment, perhaps as part of the translocation pathway. The kinetic parameters of Mtx uptake demonstrate that any alteration to the Arg-373 residue leads to a 16–50-fold reduction in the efficiency of substrate translocation (V max), indicating that this residue has a vital role in the structure or function of the protein. As evaluated by protein stability, cellular distribution, and the portion of total molecules at the plasma membrane, the amino acid at position 373 does not significantly affect the folding or localization of RFC. However, the addition of the positively charged MTSET reagent to cells expressing an R373C-EGFP gene product led to a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of Mtx drug accumulation as compared with nontreated cells, confirming the functional importance of the positive charge at 373.The 373 residue is predicted to be located within a membrane-spanning segment of the RFC protein and thus should not be accessible to the extracellular environment. Preliminary experiments indicate that this is the case, as a cysteine at this position cannot be labeled by the membrane-impermeable biotin maleimide compound (data not shown). However, although the MTSET reagent is also membrane-impermeable, its small size enables the molecule to permeate protein pores. Taken together with the functional role of this amino acid in substrate transport, it appears the Arg-373 residue forms part of the translocation pathway.It is difficult to determine conclusively whether the Arg-373 residue interacts with another amino acid based on functional analyses of an array of mutant proteins. It is only with the replacement of Asp-86 or Glu-394 with alanines in combination with R373A to limit potential secondary effects that there is a positive influence on protein function. When transfected into the RFC-deficient cell line, each combination demonstrates an increased transfection frequency as compared with R373A-EGFP alone (3–13-fold), although it is still less than for Arg-373-EGFP. Furthermore, the Mtx uptake kinetics of the cell lines expressing the D86A,R373A-EFGP mutant indicate that this protein has a 5-fold better rate of translocation compared with R373A-EGFP alone. This is suggestive of an interaction between these two residues, although secondary structural effects may also play a role. In contrast, it appears that combining the E394A alteration with R373A has little functional effect on the rate of substrate translocation.The potential interactions between Arg-373 and the Asp-86 or Glu-394 residues were further examined using a technique previously utilized for the elucidation of membrane protein helix packing (30Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11959-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Kim Y.M., Ye, L. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cysteines replaced the residues of interest in a cysteine-less RFC backbone, and a protease site inserted between them was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the cross-linking agents. Previous work has indicated that removal of the cysteines has little effect on functionality of the RFC and thus, should not interfere with helix packing.2 Based on these data, it is clear that E394 is within 6 Å of the Arg-373 residue in the tertiary structure of the RFC protein. However, there was no apparent cross-linking between the D86C and R373C residues after the addition of the o-PDM cross-linker or under oxidative conditions.The demonstration that Glu-394 (TM11) is within 6 Å of Arg-373 (TM10) is highly significant, as it provides the first evidence for a tertiary structure for this protein. Furthermore, it reflects studies on the bacterial lactose permease protein, where TM10 and TM11 are also located adjacent to each other (33Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M., Wu, J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The two proteins are structurally similar in many respects, in that they are both polytopic 12-TM domain proteins with a large cytoplasmic loop between TM6 and TM7. As the helix packing of very few polytopic proteins has been documented, it is not clear whether there are common tertiary structural characteristics. A recent report of a potential charge-pair interaction in the human RFC protein (20Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) implicated the residues corresponding to Asp-86 and Arg-131 in the hamster protein. In an attempt to confirm these observations in the hamster system, the same alterations were made (D86V,R131L). However, neither this, nor a double alanine mutant (D86A,R131A) was able to complement the MtxRII 5-3 cell line under restricted folinic acid growth conditions (data not shown). Based on these two opposing results, it appears that there may be differences in tertiary folding of the RFC protein between the human and hamster species. This is somewhat surprising, as there is a high degree of amino acid similarity (∼60%) between the two species as well as similar folate transport properties.The 373 position has strict charge and size requirements such that none of the amino acids tested was able to provide comparable substrate translocation efficiency. The data presented here suggest that the Arg-373 residue is accessible to the extracellular space and may directly interact with the substrate, although it does not appear to be part of the substrate-binding site. Furthermore, the close proximity of this residue to TM11 and the slight stabilizing effect of the D86A alteration suggest that Arg-373 may also have a structural role in defining the translocation pathway. As the structural nature of the arginine residue allows multiple and simultaneous interactions, it is not improbable that the Arg-373 position in RFC may have many different roles. Folates are essential compounds required by mammalian organisms for numerous biosynthetic pathways, including the synthesis of pyrimidines, purines and several essential amino acids (1Lucock M. Mol.

Furthermore, the Mtx uptake kinetics of the cell lines expressing the D86A,R373A-EFGP mutant indicate that this protein has a 5-fold better rate of translocation compared with R373A-EGFP alone. This is suggestive of an interaction between these two residues, although secondary structural effects may also play a role. In contrast, it appears that combining the E394A alteration with R373A has little functional effect on the rate of substrate translocation.The potential interactions between Arg-373 and the Asp-86 or Glu-394 residues were further examined using a technique previously utilized for the elucidation of membrane protein helix packing (30Sun J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11959-11965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 31Kim Y.M., Ye, L. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Cysteines replaced the residues of interest in a cysteine-less RFC backbone, and a protease site inserted between them was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the cross-linking agents. Previous work has indicated that removal of the cysteines has little effect on functionality of the RFC and thus, should not interfere with helix packing.2 Based on these data, it is clear that E394 is within 6 Å of the Arg-373 residue in the tertiary structure of the RFC protein. However, there was no apparent cross-linking between the D86C and R373C residues after the addition of the o-PDM cross-linker or under oxidative conditions.The demonstration that Glu-394 (TM11) is within 6 Å of Arg-373 (TM10) is highly significant, as it provides the first evidence for a tertiary structure for this protein. Furthermore, it reflects studies on the bacterial lactose permease protein, where TM10 and TM11 are also located adjacent to each other (33Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M., Wu, J. Kaback H.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1281-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The two proteins are structurally similar in many respects, in that they are both polytopic 12-TM domain proteins with a large cytoplasmic loop between TM6 and TM7. As the helix packing of very few polytopic proteins has been documented, it is not clear whether there are common tertiary structural characteristics. A recent report of a potential charge-pair interaction in the human RFC protein (20Liu X.Y. Matherly L.H. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) implicated the residues corresponding to Asp-86 and Arg-131 in the hamster protein. In an attempt to confirm these observations in the hamster system, the same alterations were made (D86V,R131L). However, neither this, nor a double alanine mutant (D86A,R131A) was able to complement the MtxRII 5-3 cell line under restricted folinic acid growth conditions (data not shown). Based on these two opposing results, it appears that there may be differences in tertiary folding of the RFC protein between the human and hamster species. This is somewhat surprising, as there is a high degree of amino acid similarity (∼60%) between the two species as well as similar folate transport properties.The 373 position has strict charge and size requirements such that none of the amino acids tested was able to provide comparable substrate translocation efficiency. The data presented here suggest that the Arg-373 residue is accessible to the extracellular space and may directly interact with the substrate, although it does not appear to be part of the substrate-binding site. Furthermore, the close proximity of this residue to TM11 and the slight stabilizing effect of the D86A alteration suggest that Arg-373 may also have a structural role in defining the translocation pathway. As the structural nature of the arginine residue allows multiple and simultaneous interactions, it is not improbable that the Arg-373 position in RFC may have many different roles. A number of functionally disruptive mutations have been identified and characterized within the RFC protein, and yet the mechanism of substrate transport has remained undefined. In this study, a charged residue (Arg-373) that appears to have a key role in the efficiency of substrate translocation has been identified. Furthermore, this residue was demonstrated to be in close proximity to one located 21 residues downstream, providing the first delineation of the RFC protein tertiary structure. The Mtx-resistant phenotype of the MtxRII 4-5 cell line is the combined result of the loss of one rfc allele, possibly during the initial mutagenesis procedure, and the presence of a mutation in the remaining allele. This point mutation resulted in the substitution of histidine for arginine at position 373. As this amino acid is conserved within the RFC protein throughout eukaryotic organisms including theCaenorhabditis elegans homologue, it is likely to play a pivotal role in defining protein structure or function. Biochemical and functional analysis of an array of amino acids substituted into this position indicated that there are strict requirements to allow any degree of substrate transport. First, the amino acid at position 373 appears to require the ability to form hydrogen bonds, as the frequency of functional transfectants diminishes as the polar tendencies of the residues decline (Arg ∼ Lys > His > Gln > Ala). Second, the amino acid needs to be of a certain size, as exemplified by the transfection frequency of the R373Q and R373N mutant proteins. Although the asparagine residue differs by only a single carbon in length, the transfection frequency is significantly reduced from that of R373Q. However, the alanine substitution was also slightly better tolerated than the asparagine, suggesting that the ability to form hydrogen bonds can be detrimental if the residue is too small due to destabilizing polar interactions within the local environment. The transfection frequencies are drastically reduced for most of the alterations at aa 373 with the exception of lysine, a residue similar in size and charge to arginine. However, most of the other replacements (R373H, R373Q and R373A) yield cell lines similar to the wild-type in folinic acid requirements and Mtx sensitivity; this seems to be the result of increased EGFP fusion protein expression (3–6-fold) over Arg-373-EGFP lines. The low folinic acid growth conditions select for cells with a high level of protein expression, which can compensate for the decreased rate of substrate transport. Thus, in some cases in which clones were not selected for functionality but merely for G418 resistance carried by the plasmid, the protein expression levels are lower (i.e. R373N-EGFP). The low level of R373N-EGFP expression as compared with the other 373 mutant cell lines is reflected in the folinic acid requirements and Mtx sensitivity. Based on algorithms, epitope mapping (5Ferguson P.L. Flintoff W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16269-16278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and cysteine scanning,2 the RFC protein is consistent with a 12-TM topology with aa 373 predicted to be in the 10th transmembrane domain. It appears that the presence of this charged amino acid in the hydrophobic membrane environment may be tolerated as a result of accessibility to the extracellular environment, perhaps as part of the translocation pathway. The kinetic parameters of Mtx uptake demonstrate that any alteration to the Arg-373 residue leads to a 16–50-fold reduction in the efficiency of substrate translocation (V max), indicating that this residue has a vital role in the structure or function of the protein. As evaluated by protein stability, cellular distribution, and the portion of total molecules at the plasma membrane, the amino acid at position 373 does not significantly affect the folding or localization of RFC. However, the addition of the positively charged MTSET reagent to cells expressing an R373C-EGFP gene product led to a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of Mtx drug accumulation as compared with nontreated cells, confirming the functional importance of the positive charge at 373. The 373 residue is predicted to be located within a membrane-spanning segment of the RFC protein and thus should not be accessible to the extracellular environment. Preliminary experiments indicate that this is the case, as a cysteine at this position cannot be labeled by the membrane-impermeable biotin maleimide compound (data not shown). However, although the MTSET reagent is also membrane-impermeable, its small size enables the molecule to permeate protein pores. Taken together with the functional role of this amino acid in substrate transport, it appears the Arg-373 residue forms part of the translocation pathway. It is difficult to determine conclusively whether the Arg-373 residue interacts with another amino acid based on functional analyses of an array of mutant proteins. It is only with the replacement of Asp-86 or Glu-394 with alanines in combination with R373A to limit potential secondary effects that there is a positive influence on protein function. When transfected into the RFC-deficient cell line, each combination demonstrates an increased transfection frequency as compared with R373A-EGFP alone (3–13-fold), although it is still less than for Arg-373-EGFP. Furthermore, the Mtx uptake kinetics of the cell lines expressing the D86A,R373A-EFGP mutant indicate that this protein has a 5-fold better rate of translocation compared with R373A-EGFP alone. This is suggestive of an interaction between these two residues, although secondary structural effects may also play a role. In contrast, it appears that combining the E394A alteration with R373A has little functional effect on the rate of substrate translocation.

Although the synapses transmit graded potentials, transmission depresses rapidly and completely so that a synapse only transmits when the presynaptic terminal depolarizes rapidly. The rate at which a presynaptic neuron depolarizes determines the rate at which a postsynaptic neuron hyperpolarizes, and neurotransmitter is only released during a fixed 2 ms long period. Consequently, the amplitude of a postsynaptic potential depends on the rate rather than the amplitude of a presynaptic depolarization. Following a postsynaptic potential, a synapse recovers from depression over about a second. The synapse recovers from depression even if the presynaptic terminal is held depolarized."
https://openalex.org/W2146422579,"The folding of a collagen triple helix usually requires the presence of additional sequences that contribute to the association and correct alignment of the collagen chains. We recently reported that the C-terminal neck and lectin domains of a collagenous C-type lectin, rat pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D), are sufficient to drive the trimerization of a heterologous type IIA procollagen amino propeptide sequence. However, the conformation of the resulting trimeric IIA propeptide and the specific contributions of the SP-D sequence to trimerization were not elucidated. In the present study, we show that trimerization of the fusion protein is associated with correct folding of the collagen helix within the IIA propeptide domain (as assessed by circular dichroism) and that the constituent chains are hydroxylated. Chemical cross-linking and analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the IIA amino-propeptide retains its trimeric configuration even after proteolytic removal of the SP-D domains. By contrast, IIA amino-propeptides synthesized without fusion to the neck or lectin domains are assembled exclusively as monomers. To localize the trimerization sequence, mutant chimeric cDNA constructs were designed containing premature termination codons within the coiled-coil neck domain. A short, 14-amino acid sequence corresponding to the first two heptad repeats of the neck domain was sufficient to drive the trimeric association of the IIA amino-propeptide α-chains. However, deletion of the collagen domain resulted in the secretion of monomers. These studies demonstrate that two heptad repeats are sufficient for trimeric association of the propeptide but indicate that cooperative interactions between the coiled-coil and collagen domains are required for the formation of a stable helix.

The type IIA NH2-propeptide is encoded by eight exons; the translated protein consists of a short globular domain, a 69-amino acid von Willebrand factor type C cysteine-rich domain, a minor collagen triple-helical domain containing 26 GXY repeats, and a short telopeptide domain, which links the minor collagen domain to the major collagen triple helix (1Ryan M.C.

Functions proposed for procollagen NH2-propeptides include the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis (8Fleischmajer R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 553-554Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and a feedback control of net collagen biosynthesis (9Wu C.H. Donovan C.B. Wu G.Y. J. Biol.

Trimeric assembly of fibrillar NH2-propeptides affects protein valency and stability, which appear important for function in vivo. This emphasizes the importance of a procollagen COOH-propeptide, or indeed other protein domains with similar function, to drive this trimerization process.

Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Google Scholar, 15Crouch E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 278-289Google Scholar). Each SP-D subunit contains an N-terminal cross-linking domain, an uninterrupted triple-helical collagen domain consisting of 59 GXY repeats, a trimeric coiled-coil neck domain, and a C-type lectin carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Trimerization of SP-D subunits and subsequent oligomerization of these trimeric subunits to form higher order multimers results in increased valency of the CRD, an essential prerequisite for high affinity ligand binding (16Crouch E. Respir. Res. 2001; 1: 93-108Google Scholar). The neck domain of SP-D is the unit responsible for driving the trimerization of the three polypeptide chains of SP-D. It was demonstrated that a 35-amino acid sequence containing the human neck sequence was sufficient to form stable, non-covalent, trimeric complexes in vitro (17Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Google Scholar). The same sequence was found to be important for the association of the three CRDs of human SP-D; CRDs synthesized in prokaryotic cells without this neck domain were assembled as monomers (18Kishore U. Wang J.Y. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 505-511Google Scholar). The sequence of coiled-coil domains is characterized by a 7-residue (heptad) repeat commonly denoted (abcdefg)n in which positions a andd are primarily occupied by hydrophobic residues, positionse and g are primarily occupied by charged residues, and positions b, c and f are primarily occupied by polar or charged residues (19McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the neck and lectin domain of human SP-D has been solved, and the coiled-coil region was visualized as a stretch of greater than 28 amino acids (Arg208–Pro235) consisting of ∼8 helical turns (20Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure. 1999; 7: 255-264Google Scholar). Based on the earlier work of Harbury et al. (21Harbury P.B. Zhang T. Kim P.S. Alber T. Science. 1993; 262: 1401-1407Google Scholar), Reid and co-workers (17Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 191-195Google Scholar) suggested that the presence of valine at thed positions favors the trimeric assembly of human SP-D. It was further suggested that the unusual fourth heptad, which contains Phe225 and Tyr228 in the a andd positions, respectively, might serve to initiate trimerization (20Hakansson K. Lim N.K. Hoppe H.J. Reid K.B. Structure. 1999; 7: 255-264Google Scholar). However, no valine residues are found in the neck of rat SP-D. In addition, we observed that deletion of the conserved fourth heptad repeat does not prevent trimerization of recombinant rat SP-D secreted by mammalian cells (22Zhang P. McAlinden A., Li, S. Schumacher T. Wang H., Hu, S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Google Scholar). On the other hand, internal deletions of residues 207–214 or 214–221 within the neck domain were found to block trimerization and indicated that sequences N-terminal to Phe225 were required for trimerization. These studies also demonstrated that trimeric assembly of the NH2-propeptide of type IIA procollagen could be initiated by the C-terminal neck and lectin domains of SP-D. In doing so, the chain association function of the type IIA procollagen COOH-propeptide was replaced by these SP-D domains. However, the conformation of the resulting trimeric IIA complex and the specific contributions of the C-terminal SP-D sequence to trimerization were not elucidated. The present study describes the molecular structure of the resulting IIA NH2-propeptide and establishes, for the first time, that a short, amphipathic helical sequence derived from the rat SP-D neck domain can also drive the trimerization of a fibrillar collagen NH2-propeptide. This sequence consists of the first two heptad repeats of the neck domain, which is in agreement with our previous deletional mutagenesis studies showing that N-terminal regions of the neck domain are important for initiating trimerization (22Zhang P. McAlinden A., Li, S. Schumacher T. Wang H., Hu, S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Google Scholar). There have been only a few reports on the use of oligomerization domains to trimerize heterologous collagenous sequences (23Frank S. Kammerer R.A. Mechling D. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Bann J. Guo Y. Lustig A. Bachinger H.P. Engel J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1081-1089Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this is by far the shortest sequence found to permit trimerization of a collagenous molecule and the first to demonstrate the use of a heterologous trimerization cassette to support the normal folding of a procollagen propeptide domain. High levels of a correctly folded IIA NH2-propeptide were produced using this system, which will enable us to study its biological function in vitro. Establishing a minimum sequence of the SP-D neck domain that can drive trimerization without inclusion of the functional SP-D lectin domain will allow us to study the function of the trimeric IIA propeptide in vivo. Knowledge gained from these findings may be applied to produce other procollagen propeptides or indeed other collagenous proteins for functional studies. A chimeric construct was synthesized by linking the cDNA encoding the NH2-propeptide of type IIA procollagen (see Fig. 1) to the cDNA encoding the neck + CRD of rat SP-D (see Fig. 2). This chimeric construct and the resulting fusion protein was named IIA/SP-D. The cDNA encoding exons 1–8 of human type IIA procollagen NH2-propeptide were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR from RNA that had been isolated from articular chondrocytes in culture. Specific upstream and downstream primers were designed from the pro-α1 type II collagen complete coding sequence (GenBankTM accession number:L10347). The IIA/SP-D chimeric construct was made by overlap extension PCR. Briefly, the complete coding sequence of the IIA NH2-propeptide (using oligomer A, ggtacgaattcatgattcgcctcggg; this primer sequence contains extra bases and the EcoRI site at the 5′ end, shown in bold) and a 3′ sequence homologous to a region of the neck domain of rat SP-D (using oligomer B, cagcactgtccattggtccttgcat) was amplified by PCR for 25 cycles at an annealing temperature of 52 °C. The same conditions were used to amplify the neck + CRD of rat SP-D containing a 5′ sequence homologous to a region of the IIA cDNA (using oligomer C, aggaccaatggacagtgctgctctg) and a 3′-EcoRI site (using a T7-specific downstream oligonucleotide). cDNA products from the two PCR amplifications were combined, and overlap extension PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at an annealing temperature of 55 °C using oligomers A and T7. The resulting chimeric construct was digested withEcoRI and subcloned into pGEM-3Z, and the orientation of the subcloned insert was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing.Figure 2Production of IIA/SP-D chimeric construct and predicted structure of the recombinant fusion protein.cDNA encoding the collagenous domain of SP-D was replaced with cDNA encoding the type IIA NH2-propeptide, the eight exons of which are represented by numbers. n = trimerizing coiled-coil neck domain.

Chem. 1990; 265: 5755-5760Google Scholar), or rabbit anti-rat SP-D antibody (27Persson A. Chang D. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5755-5760Google Scholar). Immunopositive proteins labeled with rabbit-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using SuperSignal® chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Clones expressing the IIA/SP-D fusion protein were selected and cultured further by exposure to 50–100 μm methionine sulfoxamine, and the resulting conditioned medium was dialyzed against Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm EDTA. CaCl2 (20 mm) was added to the dialyzed medium, and IIA/SP-D was subsequently purified by maltosyl-agarose chromatography (25Crouch E. Chang D. Rust K. Persson A. Heuser J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15808-15813Google Scholar). Because the interaction of the CRD with maltose is calcium-dependent (27Persson A. Chang D. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5755-5760Google Scholar), IIA/SP-D was eluted from the column with Tris-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, silver staining, and Western blotting. Bacterial collagenase was purified by gel filtration chromatography using crude collagenase as the starting material (Worthington Biochemical Corp.) (28Peterkofsky B. Diegelmann R. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 988-994Google Scholar). IIA/SP-D or rat SP-D (30 μg) in Tris-buffered saline, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, was digested with purified bacterial collagenase (1 μg) containing CaCl2 (20 mm) and N-ethylmaleimide (5 mm) overnight at 37 °C. Fresh collagenase (1 μg) was added for a further 3 h at 37 °C followed by EDTA (4 mm) to stop the reaction. An aliquot (5 μg) of digested and undigested IIA/SP-D or rat SP-D was electrophoresed through a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel to confirm collagenase digestion. The major collagenase-resistant products were detected by Coomassie Blue staining and subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Collagenase-digested IIA/SP-D or SP-D was transferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), stained with Coomassie Blue, excised, and sequenced on an ABI 473A protein sequencer equipped with model 610A data analysis software. Approximately 100 μg of wild-type IIA/SP-D fusion protein was digested overnight at 37 °C with human recombinant MMP-9 (gift from Dr. R. Senior, Pulmonary and Critical Care Division, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO) at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100. MMP-9 cleaves within the telopeptide domain of the IIA propeptide on either side of Gln157 and Met174 (27Persson A. Chang D. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5755-5760Google Scholar). Since MMP-9 has two cleavage sites within the telopeptide and cleavage is not always 100% efficient, we proceeded to synthesize a mutant IIA/SP-D chimeric construct containing an enterokinase cleavage site in the exon 8-encoded telopeptide. Using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), oligonucleotide primers were designed to change the DNA sequence encoding amino acids 161–165 in exon 8 of the wild-type IIA NH2-propeptide (161GFDEK165) to one that encodes the EK cleavage site (161DDDDK165). Stable CHO cell lines producing this mutant fusion protein (IIA/EK/SP-D) were produced as described above. Approximately 0.001% w/w of enterokinase (New England Biolabs) was added to purified IIA/EK/SP-D protein overnight at room temperature. Cleavage by MMP-9 or enterokinase was confirmed by gel electrophoresis, silver staining, and immunoblotting using antibodies specific for the IIA (exon 2) domain or the CRD of SP-D. CaCI2 was added to the cleaved products before applying to a maltosyl-agarose column to separate the IIA NH2-propeptide (present in the flow-through) from the neck/CRD of SP-D (present in the EDTA eluate). Covalent cross-linking was performed using bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce). Increasing amounts of BS3 (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 2 mm final concentration) prepared in 5 mm sodium citrate, pH 5, were added to each recombinant protein for 1 h at room temperature. Addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing Tris-HCl (0.5 m) inhibited the reaction. Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE, which was carried out in the absence of sulfhydryl reduction. Cross-linked proteins were identified by silver staining or immunolocalization using anti-IIA (exon 2) polyclonal antisera. Approximately 50 μg of the IIA NH2-propeptide (0.2 mg/ml in PBS, pH 7.5), purified by cleavage of the mutant IIA/EK/SP-D fusion protein containing the enterokinase cleavage site, was analyzed by CD spectroscopy. A Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter with a thermostated quartz cell and a path length of 0.1 cm was used, and the spectrum was recorded at 5 °C between 180 and 260 nm. To determine the melting temperature of the IIA NH2-propeptide, the spectrum was monitored at 225 nm from 5 to 70 °C. Equilibrium sedimentation experiments were performed using a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using a six-channel centerpiece in an AN-60 Ti rotor. The IIA NH2-propeptide, purified from enterokinase cleavage of the IIA/EK/SP-D mutant protein in PBS (pH 7.5), was analyzed at three concentrations: 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg/ml. Experiments were performed at two speeds (20,000 and 28,000 rpm) at a temperature of 20 °C and wavelength of 280 nm. Data were fitted using WinNonlin V1.035 (www.ucc.uconn.edu/∼wwwbiotc/UAF.html), and a partial specific volume of 0.73 cm3/g was used for determining the molecular weight. To determine the minimum sequence that can function as a trimerizing unit, mutant constructs were designed containing termination codons at specific locations within the heptad repeats of the coiled-coil. Using IIA/SP-D cDNA in pGEM-3Z as a substrate, four mutant constructs were synthesized using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequence of the mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Mutant IIA/SP-D cDNA constructs were excised from pGEM-3Z by EcoRI digestion and subcloned into pEE14. Correct orientation of the mutant cDNA insert in pEE14 was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion (HindIII andBglII) and agarose gel electrophoresis. CHO cells were transiently transfected with each mutant construct using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were precipitated from the conditioned medium overnight at 4 °C with 33% ammonium sulfate. Precipitated proteins were washed three times in saturated ammonium sulfate, resuspended in PBS, and dialyzed overnight in cold PBS. Chemical cross-linking of each mutant protein was carried out as described above. Proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and immunolocalization of Western blots using the anti-IIA polyclonal antibody. To determine whether the minor collagen domain of the IIA NH2-propeptide contributes to the stability of the truncated fusion protein, we generated a related truncation mutant with an associated deletion of the collagen sequence (see Fig. 8,mIIA-218). One pair of oligonucleotide primers was designed to amplify exons 1 and 2 of the IIA NH2-propeptide (upstream oligomer A, ggtacgaattcatgattcgcctcggggct; downstream oligomer B, taaggatccaactttgctgcccag). Another pair was designed to amplify exon 8 to the 3′ CRD region of SP-D (upstream oligomer C, aatggatccaactttgctgcccag; downstream oligomer D, gtaccgaattctcagaactcacag). The BamHI site is shown in bold. Two separate PCRs were done using the mutant chimeric cDNA construct containing a premature stop codon at the end of the second heptad repeat of SP-D (see Fig. 8, mIIA-218) as a substrate. A cDNA fragment (∼300 bp) was amplified using oligomers A and B for 30 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s), and another cDNA fragment (∼650 bp) was amplified using oligomers C and D for 30 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 1 min, 30 s). Each DNA fragment was digested with BamHI, ligated together, and another round of PCR was done, using oligomers A and D, for 30 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 2 min) to amplify the ligated fragment. The resulting cDNA fragment devoid of exons 3–7 encoding the collagen domain of the IIA NH2-propeptide was cloned into pEE14. Orientation of the cloned insert was confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. CHO cells were transiently transfected with the collagen deletion mutant construct using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were precipitated from the conditioned medium overnight at 4 °C with 33% ammonium sulfate. Precipitated proteins were washed three times in saturated ammonium sulfate, resuspended in PBS, and dialyzed overnight in cold PBS. The collagen deletion mutant protein (mIIA-coll-218) was cross-linked using BS3 and detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the anti-IIA polyclonal antibody. A chimeric gene construct was synthesized consisting of cDNA encoding the full-length type IIA NH2-propeptide (exons 1–8; Fig.1) fused to the cDNA encoding the neck domain and lectin domain of SP-D. The cDNA of SP-D, the chimeric construct, and the predicted structure of the resulting fusion protein, named IIA/SP-D, are shown in Fig.2. IIA/SP-D was efficiently purified from all other contaminating proteins present in the conditioned medium of stably transfected CHO cells after maltosyl-agarose chromatography (Fig. 3 A). The monomer protein showed an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa in the absence of sulfhydryl reduction when compared with globular protein standards used in this gel system. Interestingly, a small population of stable trimers of IIA/SP-D, resistant to SDS treatment and boiling prior to gel electrophoresis, was also visualized. Similar stable trimers of the type I procollagen NH2-propeptide have been detected from bone (29Fisher L.W. Robey P.G. Tuross N. Otsuka A.S. Tepen D.A. Esch F.S. Shimasaki S. Termine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13457-13463Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of the EDTA-eluted protein with anti-IIA, anti-IIE3–8, or anti-SPD polyclonal antisera confirmed identification of IIA/SP-D. Results were identical with all three antibodies, and Fig.3 B shows the immunopositive IIA/SP-D bands after detection with the anti-Exon3–8 antibody. The fusion protein migrated more slowly after sulfhydryl reduction due to unfolding of the looped structure created by the formation of the two intrachain disulfide bonds present within the lectin domain of SP-D. Although the type IIA NH2-propeptide domain is predicted to contain five intrachain disulfide bonds, the loops are comparatively small, and disruption of these bonds did not alter the electrophoretic migration of the protein (results not shown). However, disruption of the cysteine pairs within the IIA NH2-propeptide altered the structure of the exon 2-encoded domain such that recognition of the epitope by the anti-IIA antibody was affected (results not shown). All 10 cysteine residues in this domain are paired because reaction of IIA/SP-D with Ellman's reagent (Pierce) showed no quantifiable yellow-colored product as would be expected in the presence of free sulfhydryl groups. This suggests the presence of a very intricately folded domain since the 10 cysteine residues within the type IIA NH2-propeptide are arranged in close proximity to each other (Fig. 1). To investigate the structure of the recombinant IIA NH2-propeptide, IIA/SP-D fusion protein was digested with purified bacterial collagenase, and the major collagenase-resistant bands were characterized by N-terminal sequencing. SP-D, which contains its own collagen domain, was included as a control. As shown in Fig.4 A (protein bands 1–3), most of the GXY collagen domain in IIA/SP-D and SP-D was digested (Fig. 4 B). In addition, amino acid analysis of IIA/SP-D showed that there were 8 hydroxyproline residues in the collagen domain of the IIA NH2-propeptide. There are 11 potential sites for proline hydroxylation (GXP), but it is not known what percentage of prolines is hydroxylated in the native type II propeptide. To further determine the trimeric configuration of the IIA NH2-propeptide, we chose to purify the propeptide from the neck/CRD of SP-D. This was done by cleavage of the wild-type IIA/SP-D protein with MMP-9 or by digestion of the mutant fusion protein (IIA/EK/SP-D) synthesized with an enterokinase cleavage site within the exon 8-encoded telopeptide domain (Fig.5 A). After cleavage, the digested protein fragments were applied to a maltosyl-agarose column, which binds to the trimeric neck/CRD fragments. The IIA NH2-propeptide was present in the flow-through, and the SP-D fragments were then eluted with EDTA (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Purification of the IIA-NH2-propeptide by MMP-9 or enterokinase digestion and maltosyl-agarose chromatography.

https://openalex.org/W2017108089,"Guinea pig phospholipase B (GPPLB) is a glycosylated ectoenzyme of intestinal brush border membrane. It displays a broad substrate specificity and is activated by trypsin cleavage. The primary sequence contains four tandem repeat domains (I to IV) and several serines in lipase consensus sequences. We used site-directed mutagenesis to demonstrate that only the serine 399 present in repeat II is responsible for the various enzymatic activities of GPPLB. Furthermore, we characterized for the first time the retinyl esterase activity of the enzyme. We also constructed and expressed in COS-7 cells, an NH2-terminal repeat I deletion mutant which was detected at a very low level by immunoblot. However, confocal microscopy study showed a strong intracellular accumulation with a weak membrane expression of the mutated protein, indicating a role of the NH2-terminal repeat I in the processing of GPPLB. Nevertheless, the Western blot-detected protein presented a glycosylation and trypsin sensitivity patterns similar to wild type PLB. The mutant is also fully active without trypsin treatment, in contrast to native enzyme. Thus, we propose a structural model for GPPLB, in which the repeat I constitutes a lid covering the active site and impairing enzymatic activity, its removal by trypsin leading to an active protein.

Phospholipases B (PLB) 1The abbreviations used are: PLB, phospholipase B; GPPLB, guinea pig phospholipase B; PLA2, phospholipase A2; ER, endoplasmic reticulum are a heterogeneous group of enzymes that share the ability to hydrolyze both sn-1 and sn-2 acyl ester bonds of glycerophospholipids and then display both phospholipase A1or phospholipase A2 and lysophospholipase activities. PLB activity has been reported in microorganisms such are Penicillium notatumand Saccharomyces cerevisae (1Ghannoum M.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 122-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), in plants (2Kim D.K. Lee H.J. Lee Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 343: 213-218Google Scholar,3Matsuda H. Hirayama O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 27: 155-165Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as well as in guinea pig (4Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9470-9475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rabbit (5Boll W. Schmid-Chanda T. Semenza G. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12901-12911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat (6Tojo H. Ichida T. Okamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2214-2221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) brush border membranes. The mammalian enzymes also display a lipase activity (7Gassama-Diagne A. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Willson M. Klaebe A. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13418-13424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite this broad substrate specificity, we previously reported that guinea pig intestinal PLB (GPPLB) releases first in a calcium-independent manner the fatty acid in the sn-2position of phospholipids (7Gassama-Diagne A. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Willson M. Klaebe A. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13418-13424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, these PLB were considered as calcium-independent PLA2 (iPLA2) (8Ackermann E.J. Denis E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and new ectomembrane phospholipases B (9Chaminade B., Le Balle F. Fourcade O. Nauze M. Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Simon M.F. Fauvel J. Chap H. Lipids. 1999; 34: S49-S55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that digestion of lipids in the gastrointestinal tract requires hydrolysis reactions by the secretory enzymes originated from lingual, gastric, and pancreatic glands (10Shen H. Howles P. Tso P. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 50: S103-S125Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, our previous data indicated that phospholipid hydrolysis and absorption could be observed in vivo, in the absence of the secretory enzymes mentioned above, and could be due to intestinal PLB (11Diagne A. Mitjavila S. Fauvel J. Chap H. Douste-Blazy L. Lipids. 1987; 22: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover, the bile salt-dependent retinyl esterase activity, intrinsically located in the brush border membranes, was suggested to be due to PLB (12Rigtrup K.M. Kakkad B. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a recent review proposed the involvement of intestinal PLB in digestion of dietary vitamin A (13Harrison E.H. Hussain MM. J. Nutr. 2001; 131: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, our previous data supported the view that PLB was expressed as a function of enterocyte differentiation, displaying the highest level in mature enterocytes of jejunum and ileum, which are the most implicated in lipid digestion (14Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama A. Collet X. Nauze M. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggested that intestinal PLB could play a key role in hydrolysis of lipids and vitamin A from the diet in the lumen. PLB thus belongs to the group of brush border hydrolases such as lactase and sucrase isomaltase involved in terminal digestion of nutriments. A comparative study of PLB and sucrase isomaltase genes suggested a common structure for promoters and regulating transcription factors (15Taylor J.K. Boll W. Levy T. Suh E. Siang S. Mantei N. Traber P.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 1419-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar,16Boudreau F. Zhu Y. Traber P.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) indicated that it is homologous to rabbit AdRab-B (5Boll W. Schmid-Chanda T. Semenza G. Mantei N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12901-12911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat phospholipase B/lipase (18Takemori H. Zolotaryov F.N. Ting L. Urbain T. Komatsubara T. Hatano O. Okamoto M. Tojo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2222-2231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sequence corresponded to a 170–180-kDa ectophospholipase with a short cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain, stalked in the membrane by a hydrophobic segment connected to the larger, heavily glycosylated globular domain. The latter contains four tandem repeat domains and several lipase and phospholipase consensus sequences,i.e. the GXSXG, similar to a classic lipase motif found in α/β-hydrolases (19Schrag J.D. Cygler M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and the GDSL (20Upton C. Buckley J.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 178-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It was shown that a unique serine was involved in rabbit PLB catalytic activity (21Wacker H. Keller P. von Balthazar A.K. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3336-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, in that study, PLB activity was analyzed toward water-soluble substrates. That could hamper the results, since our data indicated that the 170-kDa form of GPPLB was inactive against long chain phospholipids (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, recent studies indicated that only the second repeat of rat PLB contained the three essential residues involved in the catalytic triad responsible for all the PLB activities (22Lu T. Ito M. Tchoua U. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Tojo H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7133-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although both proteins are expected to display structures and properties very similar to GPPLB, analysis of the three species PLB sequences indicated that there were some differences concerning the number and the localization of the lipase consensus sequences (see Fig. 1 A). Moreover, the third repeat of the guinea pig enzyme also contains all the residues of the catalytic triad. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to clearly demonstrate that only the serine 399 residue is responsible for GPPLB activity. We thus demonstrated for the first time the retinyl esterase activity of GPPLB. Our precedent observation (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) indicated that native GPPLB needs limited proteolysis by trypsin to acquire its full enzymatic activity. This trypsin treatment induced an important reduction in the protein size and probably corresponds to removal of one repeat domain. In this study, we used a deletion mutant of PLB to demonstrate that this domain corresponds to the NH2-terminal repeat I, which constitutes a proregion involved in the regulation of PLB cellular localization and enzymatic activity. 1-Acyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-[3H]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were from Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH. Non-labeled 1-acyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, retinyl palmitate, and phospholipase C (from Bacillus cereus) were from Sigma. The experiments were achieved by PCR using QuikChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene as indicated in the instruction manual. The mutagenesis reaction was performed using constructions containing small fragments (1.4–1.6 kbp) as template instead of full-length cDNA of PLB to decrease potential for random mutations during the thermal cycles. The cDNA corresponding to the first 1.5 kbp of PLB sequence, cloned in pGEMT-Easy vector (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), was used for the mutations of the serine residues 399 and 454, respectively, in the consensus GDSL and GX S XG (Fig.1 A). Two other constructions of the pBluescript SK vector containing 1.4- and 1.6-kpb fragments obtained by XhoI andXbaI digestions of PLB cDNA were used for the mutations of the serine residues 746 (GDSL) and 1155 (GX S XG), respectively (Fig.1 A). For each mutation, two complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed, and the target serine in the sequence was replaced with an alanine by one nucleotide change. The resulting mutated plasmids were sequenced. For each of them, the insert was excised by digestion with restriction enzymes and ligated in pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) containing the full-length PLB cDNA (pcDNA3-PLB) deleted from the corresponding domain. Briefly, mutants for serines 399 and 454 were cut with a single EcoRI digestion, whereas mutants of serines 746 and 1155 were digested withEcoRV and XbaI or XbaI andApaI, respectively, to obtain the different pcDNA3 constructions with full-length mutated PLB. They were named GDSL1, GXI, GDSL2, and GXII, respectively, for the serine 399, 454, 746, and 1155 mutants. To obtain GDSL3, mutagenesis reaction was directly performed on pcDNA3-PLB by replacing serine 1102 with alanine without any subcloning and using QuikChangeTM XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene as indicated in the instruction manual. The mutation was verified by sequencing. The PLB cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 313–1463 was amplified by PCR using 5′ sense primer incorporating aBamH1 restriction site, the Kozak and the signal sequences, nucleotides 1081–1104 of GPPLB coding sequence, and the antisense primer incorporating the nucleotides 4414–4428 fragment in-frame with a HindIII restriction site (Fig. 1 B) to get a protein fused to the histidine and Myc tag of pcDNA3.1/myc-his C vector. The amplified fragment was first cloned in pGEMT-Easy vector (Promega), sequenced, digested byBamHI/HindIII and then subcloned in pcDNA3.1/myc-his C previously digested with the same enzymes to generate del PLB-Myc. This construction was used to obtain the non-tagged deleted form of PLB (del PLB). Briefly, del PLB-Myc was digested with BamHI and SacII, and the obtained fragment was inserted in pcDNA3 containing PLB full-length cDNA (PLB4) previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells were transfected with the different cDNA constructions obtained as described above, using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were rinsed twice and scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline, sonicated, and used for protein and enzymatic activities determination. For immunoblotting, cells were directly collected in Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min. COS-7 cells were grown on sterile glass coverslips and transfected with cDNAs of del PLB and PLB4 for 48 h. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed for 15 min with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized (or not) for 2 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, and saturated for 30 min with 0.2% gelatin. After 60 min of incubation with the anti-PLB antibody, immunostaining was performed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 antibody (Immunotech). The coverslips were examined after mounting using a Carl Zeiss, LSM 510, axiovert 100, confocal microscope with a 63× Plan-Apochromat objective (1.4 oil). An argon laser at 488 nm was used to detect fluorescein fluorochrome. Transfected COS cell homogenates were treated with trypsin (50 μg/ml) for the indicated time at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of two volumes of soybean trypsin inhibitor (30 μg/ml) as described previously (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for determination of enzymatic activities or by adding Laemmli buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) for immunoblotting. Homogenates from COS cells, transfected with full-length PLB or NH2-terminal-deleted mutant (del PLB) were treated with N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H, as described by manufacturer (Biolabs, Ozyme). The cDNA coding for full-length PLB was digested with XbaI and XhoI, and the obtained fragment (amino acid residues 353–532) corresponding to a part of the second repeat was inserted into pGEX-KG vector (a gift of Dr. J. E. Dixon, University of Michigan, Medical School). This construction was introduced into anEscherichia coli strain (XL1-blue), and production of the fusion protein was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and used to produce a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216204) Google Scholar), and samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes according to standard protocol (25Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5912) Google Scholar). These were achieved using 1-acyl-2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-[3H]palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine as substrates, respectively, as described previously (4Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9470-9475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diacylglycerol was obtained as described previously (7Gassama-Diagne A. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Willson M. Klaebe A. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13418-13424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, 1-acyl 2-[14C]linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was converted to diacylglycerol by treatment with B. cereusphospholipase C. The obtained 1-acyl 2-[14C]linoleoyl glycerol was dispersed by sonication in 0.1 ml of 0.2 mTris-HCl (pH 8.5) containing 0.5%(w/v) arabic gum and 12 mm sodium deoxycholate. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under shaking after addition of 5–15 μl of homogenate. At the end of the reaction, 1.95 ml of chloroform, methanol, heptan (12/14/10, v/v/v), and 0.63 ml of 0.1 mcarbonate borate (pH 10.5) were added. The mixture was vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, and the radioactivity corresponding to free fatty acids was determined in the upper phase. Retinyl palmitate was taken to dryness from ethanol and dispersed by sonication as described for phosphatidylcholine. The reaction was started by addition of transfected cell homogenates. Incubation was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min under shaking and terminated by addition of 1 volume of ethanol and hexane. The free retinol formed was then extracted, analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, and quantified by comparison of their integrate peak areas to calibrate areas from pure retinyl acetate standard as described previously (26De Leenheer A.P., De Bevere V.O., De Ruyter M.G. Claeys A.E. J. Chromatogr. 1979; 162: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As represented in Fig. 1, the guinea pig PLB cDNA (GPPLB) sequence displays three serines in the consensus sequence GDSL (GDSL1, GDSL2, and GDSL3, respectively, for serines 399, 746, and 1102) and two serines in the consensus sequence GX S XG (GXI and GXII for serine 454 and 1155, respectively). To determine the involvement of these different serines in the catalytic activity of PLB, they were individually mutated to alanine, and COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the corresponding cDNAs. Analysis of cell homogenates by immunoblotting (Fig.2) indicated that all mutated proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells as a 170-kDa polypeptide (lanes 3–7), which corresponds to the size of the wild type cDNA (PLB4, lane 2). Nevertheless, with identical transfection conditions (about 40% efficiency), a lower expression level was observed for GDSL1 and GDSL3 mutants, suggesting that these mutations could affect the proper folding of the protein. No expression was observed in cells transfected with the vector alone used as negative control (pcDNA3, lane 1). The different enzymatic activities of PLB were assayed with different mutated proteins expressed in COS-7 cells and activated by trypsin treatment (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). We first investigated for PLA2 activity, and as presented in Fig.3 A, serine mutants 454, 746, 1102, and 1155 (GXI, GDSL2, GDSL3 and GXII, respectively) retained the catalytic activity. The enzymatic activity expressed according to the protein expression level is similar to that obtained with the wild type enzyme (PLB4). Conversely, mutation of the serine 399 (GDSL1) completely abolished the enzymatic activity. No activity was also detected in cells transfected with the vector alone used as negative control. Identical results were obtained for determinations of lysophospholipase (Fig. 3 B), diacylglycerol lipase (Fig. 3 C), and retinyl esterase (Fig. 3 D) activities. These data clearly indicated that only the serine 399 is necessary for the enzymatic activity of guinea pig PLB. A plasmid containing a cDNA corresponding to the deleted NH2-terminal repeat I of GPPLB cDNA was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and used for transfection of COS-7 cells. After 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 72 h, the expressed protein (del PLB) was analyzed by Western blot, quantified, and compared with the expression of full-length PLB (PLB4) detected in the same experimental conditions. Data revealed marked difference in the expression level of these two proteins as indicated in Fig.4 A. PLB4 (170 kDa) expression level sharply increased at 36 h and continued to increase up to 72 h. By contrast, del PLB was expressed as a faint band of 140 kDa corresponding to the size of both brush border membrane PLB (14Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama A. Collet X. Nauze M. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the trypsin-cleaved form of the recombinant protein (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The kinetic study indicated only a slight increase in del PLB expression. Densitometry analysis of the Western blot revealed about 5-fold increase of PLB4 expression compared with del PLB (Fig. 4 B). This variation suggested that the NH2-terminal repeat I is necessary for proper expression of GPPLB. As in the same tranfection conditions, del PLB was expressed at a very low level compared with PLB4, we sought to determine for a role of the repeat I in the processing of GPPLB. Thus, we analyzed the cellular localization of del PLB by confocal microscopy. This was achieved on transfected COS cells and using an anti PLB antibody. Concerning del PLB, cells permeabilized with Triton X-100 displayed an intense intracellular staining around the nucleus, which seems to correspond to aggregates of misfolded proteins in the ER (Fig. 5 A). Despite this strong intracellular localization, a few number of transfected cells revealed faint staining at the cell surface of non-permeabilized cells (Fig.5 B). These data indicated that only a small proportion of del PLB was correctly folded and transported to the membrane and could correspond to the low level of protein detected by immunoblot. On the contrary, an important membrane localization (Fig. 5 D) and a faint intracellular signal (Fig. 5 C) were observed for wild type PLB as expected. Taken together, these observations led us to conclude that deletion of the repeat I strongly impaired the processing of GPPLB. Phospholipase B is a highlyN-glycosylated protein. Several roles such as involvement in protein folding, polarized sorting, and optimal expression have been described so far for glycosylation (27Helenius A. Aebi M. Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). We then decided to analyze theN-glycosylation pattern of del PLB compared with PLB4. Transfected COS-7 cell homogenates were treated with endoglycosidase H, which cleaves mannose-rich N-linked oligosaccharides, and with N-glycanase, which cleaves the complex type. As represented in Fig. 6 A, PLB4 and the NH2-terminal repeat I-deleted mutant (del PLB) were cleaved by endoglycosidase H. However the mutant is more sensitive to endoglycosidase H treatment than PLB4. Furthermore,N-glycanase cleaved the total protein for PLB4 as well as for del PLB (Fig. 6 B). For the latter, the molecular mass shifted from 140 to 108 kDa as previously observed with brush border GPPLB (14Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama A. Collet X. Nauze M. Chap H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1303: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), suggesting that the weakly expressed repeat I-deleted mutant is correctly glycosylated and could correspond to the membrane expressed form observed in Fig. 5 B. Native GPPLB is a proenzyme that needs limited proteolysis by trypsin to acquire its full enzymatic activity. This trypsin treatment induced an important reduction in the protein size that could probably correspond to removal of one repeat domain (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To check for this hypothesis, we first analyzed the effect of trypsin treatment on the molecular weight of PLB4 and del PLB to determine its major cleavage sites. COS-7 cells were transfected for 48 h with the two cDNAs. The homogenates were submitted to trypsin treatment for different times and immunoblotted (Fig.7). Within 5 min of trypsin treatment, the 170-kDa band of PLB4 disappeared, whereas a major 140-kDa form appeared remaining at the same intensity until 30 min of digestion. A product of 97 kDa was then observed until 60 min. Here again, as observed in Fig. 4, a lower expression was obtained for the mutant expressed as a 140-kDa protein, corresponding to the first cleavage product of PLB4 and indicating that the NH2-terminal repeat I could be the proregion deleted by trypsin treatment. A faint band of 97-kDa protein appeared after 30 min of trypsin treatment, suggesting a proper folding and processing of del PLB despite its low expression level. The 140-kDa band was essentially present in the membrane fraction but could be observed in soluble fraction, whereas the 97-kDa protein only appeared in the soluble fraction (data not shown). These data indicated the presence of two major trypsin cleavage sites in GPPLB. Transfected COS-7 cell homogenates described above were submitted or not to trypsin treatment for 15 min and assayed for different enzymatic activities. As expected, the wild type PLB was enzymatically active toward phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and diacylglycerol only upon trypsin treatment (Fig.8). However, del PLB was fully active on the different substrates without any trypsin addition (Fig. 8), indicating that the NH2-terminal repeat I could be the proregion inhibiting PLB enzymatic activity in the native form. The different data obtained in this study, those obtained from GPPLB purification (4Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9470-9475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and molecular cloning (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13407-13414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), have revealed the main structural features and the proteolytic cleavage sites of GPPLB as depicted in Fig.9. The GPPLB is synthesized as an inactive precursor of 170 kDa with a short cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal domain, a hydrophobic stretch that spans once the lipid bilayer and anchors the protein in the membrane. The large, highly glycosylated ectodomain contained four homologous domains. The catalytic serine (serine 399) is localized in the repeat II hidden beneath the proregion constituted by repeat I. Removal of this proregion by trypsin cleavage exposes the active site leading to a mature membrane protein of 140 kDa. A longer proteolysis leads to a cleavage between domain III and IV and generated a 97-kDa soluble form. In this study, we demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis that only the serine 399 in a GDSL consensus sequence is necessary for all the enzymatic activities of GPPLB. These data confirmed our previous finding, which indicated a same inhibition pattern for the PLA2, lysophospholipase, and lipase activities of purified GPPLB by 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), diisopropyl fluorophosphate, and N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting the involvement of both serine and cysteine residues in a unique catalytic site responsible of all the activities (7Gassama-Diagne A. Rogalle P. Fauvel J. Willson M. Klaebe A. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13418-13424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concerning the role of the cysteine residue, we can hypothesize that an intramolecular disulfide bond necessary for the enzymatic function is present. Nevertheless, the serine esterase property of GPPLB was clearly demonstrated in this study in agreement with data obtained for rabbit (21Wacker H. Keller P. von Balthazar A.K. Semenza G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3336-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and rat intestinal PLB (22Lu T. Ito M. Tchoua U. Takemori H. Okamoto M. Tojo H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7133-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This latter study indicated that the catalytic serine is part of a catalytic triad associating aspartate and histidine residues in the second repeat. By contrast, GPPLB contained such triad residues in both repeats II and IV, whereas the histidine of the triad in repeat IV is in the consensus EDCLH instead of the conserved stretch PDCFH, thus lacking the proline. However, only mutation of serine 399 in the GDSL consensus of repeat II completely abolished the enzymatic function and markedly affected the protein expression level. The change of the serine 1102 in repeat IV did not affect the enzymatic activity. Nevertheless, a low expression level was observed for both serine 399 (GDSL1) and serine 1102 (GDSL3) mutants, suggesting that they might be important for maintaining the three-dimensional structure. Earlier studies strongly suggested that intestinal PLB is probably the intestinal bile salt-dependent long chain retinyl ester hydrolase (12Rigtrup K.M. Kakkad B. Ong D.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2661-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we clearly demonstrated for the first time that GPPLB has a retinyl esterase activity, associated to the unique catalytic site involving serine 399. Our present data emphasized the broad substrate specificity and the important role of intestinal brush border GPPLB in digestion of dietary lipids and vitamin A. As described for lactase, another brush border hydrolase with structural characteristics similar to PLB (28Naim H.Y. Jacob R. Naim H. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26933-26943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), folding of a large multidomain protein as PLB is expected to be a complex process that implicates the proregion. The role of prosequences in modulating folding of proteins is largely described in a wide range of proteins like zymogens (29Waite M. Waite M. Handbook of Lipid Rresearch: The Phospholipases. 5. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1987: 155-190Google Scholar), proteases (30Yabuta Y. Takagi H. Inouye M. Shinde U. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 350: 71-76Crossref Google Scholar, 35Jacob R. Peters K. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8217-8225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and lipase (36Beer H.D. Wohlfahrt G. Schmid R.D. McCarthy J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Their cleavage was associated in many cases with biological activation of the final mature form of the protein. In this study, we sought to determine the role of the NH2-terminal repeat I as a proregion involved in the regulation of intracellular processing and enzymatic activity of GPPLB. The repeat I-deleted mutant was poorly detected by Western blot, compared with the wild type PLB. However confocal microscopy study indicated a low proportion reaching the membrane and a strong intracellular accumulation of the mutant around the nucleus. This could correspond to the presence in the ER of aggregates of mutated protein as high molecular weight complexes that could not be detected in our SDS-PAGE conditions. In fact, these aggregates range in size from dimers to large granules of several million daltons (37Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). This microscopy study indicated an important role of the repeat I in the folding of GPPLB in the ER or for its transport from ER to the Golgi apparatus. In fact, the conformational status of newly synthesized polypeptides is monitored in the lumen of the ER by an efficient quality control mechanism. Proteins that fail to acquire a correct three-dimensional structure are retained in the ER and ultimately degraded (37Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 38Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3600) Google Scholar). Some proteins exit the ER but are blocked in a pre-Golgi compartment instead of further transport to their final destination (39Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Moolenaar C.E. Ouwendijk J. Wittpoth M. Wisselaar H.A. Hauri H.P. Ginsel L.A. Naim H.Y. Fransen J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 557-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, due to the presence of a complex glycosylated form of mutant, we can conclude that correct folding occurs in the absence of the proregion, but at a very much low rate compared with wild type protein. GPPLB is synthesized as a proenzyme activated by trypsin. In this work, the kinetic study of trypsin treatment indicated the presence of different cleavage sites in GPPLB leading to the two main enzymatic active forms. The first is a 140-kDa membrane protein that corresponds to the molecular weight of the brush border membrane enzyme and to that of the deleted mutant, strongly suggesting that the proregion consists of the NH2-terminal repeat I. The second is a 97-kDa soluble form, as previously obtained after papain treatment of brush border membrane (4Gassama-Diagne A. Fauvel J. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9470-9475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trypsin treatment of the NH2-terminal-deleted mutant generated the 97-kDa form and thus suggested a proper folding of the immunoblot detected protein. These data also suggested that in some pathophysiological conditions associated with an increase of protease secretion, PLB can be released and acts as a soluble enzyme. These observations can be taken into account to investigate physiological function of PLB. In this context, an activation of PLB was already observed in WBN/Kob rats with pancreatic insufficiency (41Tchoua U. Ito M. Okamoto M. Tojo H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated that the repeat I-deleted protein displays the same enzymatic activities as the wild type, without trypsin treatment. These results underlined an important function of the repeat I in enzymatic activity of GPPLB. Thus, we proposed a structural model, indicating that PLB is synthesized as a proenzyme in which the large NH2-terminal repeat I constitutes a lid covering the catalytic site and inhibiting the enzyme by blocking access of the substrate. Proteolytic treatment removes the lid to produce a mature active enzyme. In the gastrointestinal tract, this cleavage could be achieved by pancreatic trypsin secreted in post-prandial periods. We do not know yet what is happening to the cleaved proregion. We can rule out its covalent association with another repeat by an intramolecular disulfide bound as described for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (42Weissman J.S. Kim P.S. Cell. 1992; 71: 841-851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), because no change was observed in the molecular weight of trypsin-treated GPPLB in the presence or not of reducing agent (data not shown). The presence of a lid covering the active site is described for lipoprotein lipase (43Dugi K.A. Dichek H.L. Talley G.D. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25086-25091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cPLA2 (44Dessen A. Tang J. Schmidt H. Stahl M. Clark J.D. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 349-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). However, this concerns a flexible and smaller structure that must move to allow substrate access to the active site. In conclusion, this work supplied new data for understanding the structure and function relationship of GPPLB. However, this enzyme is also present in epididymis, and we suggested a role in sperm maturation (17Delagebeaudeuf C. Gassama-Diagne A. Nauze M. Ragab A., Li, R.Y. Capdevielle J. Ferrara P. Fauvel J.
