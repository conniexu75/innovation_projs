https://openalex.org/W2067415049,"Ethylene influences a number of developmental processes and responses to stress in higher plants. The molecular basis for the action of ethylene was investigated in mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana that have altered responses to ethylene. One mutant line, which has a dominant mutation at a locus designated etr, lacks a number of responses to ethylene that are present in the wild-type plant. These include inhibition of cell elongation, promotion of seed germination, enhancement of peroxidase activity, acceleration of leaf senescence, and feedback suppression of ethylene synthesis by ethylene. These diverse responses, which occur in different tissues of Arabidopsis, appear to share some common element in their transduction pathways-for example, a single receptor for ethylene. Results of ethylene binding experiments in vivo indicate that this receptor may be affected by the etr mutation."
https://openalex.org/W1988628049,"Changes in the frequency, phase, and amplitude of the Mariner IV radio signal, caused by passage through the atmosphere and ionosphere of Mars, were observed immediately before and after occultation by the planet. Preliminary analysis of these effects has yielded estimates of the refractivity and density of the atmosphere near the surface, the scale height in the atmosphere, and the electron density profile of the Martian ionosphere. The atmospheric density, temperature, and scale height are lower than previously predicted, as are the maximum density, temperature, scale height, and altitude of the ionosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2005930950,"During the encounter between Mariner IV and Mars on 14-15 July, no magnetic effect that could be definitely associated with the planet was evident in the magnetometer data. This observation implies that the Martian magnetic dipole moment is, at most, 3 x 10(-4) times that of the earth."
https://openalex.org/W1990871988,"Measurements of the yield strength of SiO(2) glass to pressures as high as 81 gigapascals at room temperature show that the strength of amorphous silica decreases significantly as it is compressed to denser strctures with higher coordination. Above 27 gigapascals, as the silicon in amorphous SiO(2) is continuously transformed from fourfold to sixfold coordination, the strength of the glass decrases by more than an order of magnitude. These data confirm theoretical predictions that the mechanical properties of polymerized amorphous silicates are sensitive to pressure-induced structural transformations and suggest that the viscosity of silica-rich liquids decreases significantly at high pressures. Such a change in melt rheology could enhance the processes of chemical differentiation with depth in the Earth's mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2018809117,"The Mariner IV spacecraft on 14-15 July 1965 passed within 9850 kilometers of Mars, carrying a solid-state charged-particle telescope which could detect electrons greater than 40 kiloelectron volts and protons greater than 1 million electron volts. The trajectory could have passed through a bow shock, a transition region, and a magnetospheric boundary where particles could be stably trapped for a wide range of Martian magnetic moments. No evidence of charged-particle radiation was found in any of these regions. In view of these results, an upper limit is established for the Martian magnetic moment provided it is assumed that the same physical processes leading to acceleration and trapping of electrons in Earth's magnetic field would be found in a Martian magnetic field. On this basis, the upper limit for the Martian magnetic moment is 0.1 percent that of Earth for a wide range of postulated orientations with respect to the rotational axis of Mars. The implications of these results for the physical and biological environment of Mars are briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1994310391,"A system of sensitive particle detectors on Mariner IV showed the presence of electrons of energy (E(e)) less than 40 kiloelectron volts out to a radial distance of 165,000 kilometers in the morning fringe of the earth's magnetosphere but failed to detect any such electrons during the close encounter with Mars on 14-15 July 1965, at the time when the minimum areocentric radial distance was 13,200 kilometers. This result can mean that the ratio of the magnetic dipole moment of Mars to that of the earth (M(M)/M(E)) is surely less than 0.001 and probably is less than 0.0005. The corresponding upper limits on the equatorial magnetic field at the surface of Mars are 200 and 100 gammas, respectively. It appears possible that the solar wind interacts directly with the Martian atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2048587417,"Diuresis in insects is controlled by two antagonistic hormone groups: diuretic hormones, which promote water loss, and antidiuretic hormones, which inhibit it. All known antidiuretic factors act solely to promote fluid reabsorption by the hindgut and do not affect secretion by the Malpighian tubules. In the house cricket, Acheta domesticus, an antidiuretic hormone was found that inhibits fluid secretion by the Malpighian tubules but has no effect on the hindgut. Correlations were found between the density of neurosecretory granules and the presence of antidiuretic hormone in the corpora cardiaca, suggesting that the hormone is released from specific axons. Its release is triggered by dehydration; the hormone is detectable in the hemolymph of water-deprived crickets. These results imply that an unusual mechanism regulates water balance in these insects."
https://openalex.org/W2084477468,"Data from the Mariner IV dust-particle experiment reveal an increase by a factor of 5 in the flux of interplanetary dust particles as the heliocentric distance from the sun increases. There is a variation in the slope of the cumulative flux-mass distribution, with the steepest slope for the distribution occurring between the planets. No enhancement of the flux in the vicinity of Mars was detected."
https://openalex.org/W1987526212,"Time-resolved multicolor photometric observations of Pluto-Charon mutual events have been used to derive individual colors for these two bodies and to investigate the degree of color differences between their synchronous facing and opposite hemispheres. Pluto is significantly redder than Charon, where direct measurements of the anti-Charon hemisphere of Pluto and the Pluto-facing hemisphere of Charon yield B-V magnitudes of 0.867 +/- 0.008 and 0.700 +/- 0.010, respectively. Both Pluto and Charon are found to have relatively uniform longitudinal color distributions with lsigma upper limits of 2% and 5%, respectively, for any large-scale hemispherical color asymmetries. Thus, a previous suspicion of a significant color asymmetry on Charon is not confirmed. Instead the data may be attributed to a direct detection of polar caps on Pluto."
