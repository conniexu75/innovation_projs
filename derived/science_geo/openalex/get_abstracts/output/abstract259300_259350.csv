https://openalex.org/W1971321176,"We tested the hypothesis that de novo copy number variation (CNV) is associated with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). We performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) on the genomic DNA of patients and unaffected subjects to detect copy number variants not present in their respective parents. Candidate genomic regions were validated by higher-resolution CGH, paternity testing, cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and microsatellite genotyping. Confirmed de novo CNVs were significantly associated with autism ( P = 0.0005). Such CNVs were identified in 12 out of 118 (10%) of patients with sporadic autism, in 2 out of 77 (3%) of patients with an affected first-degree relative, and in 2 out of 196 (1%) of controls. Most de novo CNVs were smaller than microscopic resolution. Affected genomic regions were highly heterogeneous and included mutations of single genes. These findings establish de novo germline mutation as a more significant risk factor for ASD than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2024417959,"Linear trends in arctic sea-ice extent over the period 1979 to 2006 are negative in every month. This ice loss is best viewed as a combination of strong natural variability in the coupled ice-ocean-atmosphere system and a growing radiative forcing associated with rising concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases, the latter supported by evidence of qualitative consistency between observed trends and those simulated by climate models over the same period. Although the large scatter between individual model simulations leads to much uncertainty as to when a seasonally ice-free Arctic Ocean might be realized, this transition to a new arctic state may be rapid once the ice thins to a more vulnerable state. Loss of the ice cover is expected to affect the Arctic's freshwater system and surface energy budget and could be manifested in middle latitudes as altered patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2008955962,"MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules that control expression of target genes. Our previous studies show that mir-21 is overexpressed in tumor tissues compared with the matched normal tissues. Moreover, suppression of mir-21 by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits tumor cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. However, it remains largely unclear as to how mir-21 affects tumor growth, because our understanding of mir-21 targets is limited. In this study, we performed two-dimensional differentiation in-gel electrophoresis of tumors treated with anti-mir-21 and identified the tumor suppressor tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) as a potential mir-21 target. In agreement with this, there is a putative mir-21 binding site at the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of TPM1 variants V1 and V5. Thus, we cloned the 3′-UTR of TPM1 into a luciferase reporter and found that although mir-21 down-regulated the luciferase activity, anti-mir-21 up-regulated it. Moreover, deletion of the mir-21 binding site abolished the effect of mir-21 on the luciferase activity, suggesting that this mir-21 binding site is critical. Western blot with the cloned TPM1-V1 plus the 3′-UTR indicated that TPM1 protein level was also regulated by mir-21, whereas real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed no difference at the mRNA level, suggesting translational regulation. Finally, overexpression of TPM1 in breast cancer MCF-7 cells suppressed anchorage-independent growth. Thus, down-regulation of TPM1 by mir-21 may explain, at least in part, why suppression of mir-21 can inhibit tumor growth, further supporting the notion that mir-21 functions as an oncogene.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) 2The abbreviations used are: miRNA, microRNA; siRNA, short interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription; qRT, quantitative reverse transcription; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; TPM, tropomyosin; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide; 5-aza-dC, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine; UTR, untranslated region; 2-DIGE, two-dimensional differentiation in-gel. are a class of naturally occurring small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or cleavage (1Pillai R.S. RNA. 2005; 11: 1753-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 2Zamore P.D. Haley B. Science. 2005; 309: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). Like protein-coding mRNAs, miRNAs are transcribed as long primary transcripts in the nucleus. However, unlike protein-coding mRNAs, miRNAs are subsequently cleaved to produce stem-loop-structured precursor molecules of ∼70 nucleotides in length (pre-miRNAs) by the nuclear RNase III enzyme Drosha (3Kim V.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). The pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm, where the RNase III enzyme Dicer further processes them into mature miRNAs (∼22 nucleotides). Thus, miRNAs are related to, but distinct from, short inferring RNAs (siRNAs) (4Bartel D.P. Cell. 2004; 116: 281-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29863) Google Scholar, 5Fitzgerald K. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2005; 8: 557-566PubMed Google Scholar). A key difference between siRNAs and miRNAs is that siRNAs require almost identical sequences to targets to exert their silencing function, whereas miRNAs bind through partial sequence homology to the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of target genes. Because of this unique feature, a single miRNA has multiple targets. Thus, miRNAs could regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes, and as high as 30% of all genes could be miRNA targets (6Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9936) Google Scholar). As a new layer of gene regulation mechanism, miRNAs have diverse functions, including the regulation of cellular differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (7Croce C.M. Calin G.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 6-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar, 8Chen C.Z. Li L. Lodish H.F. Bartel D.P. Science. 2004; 303: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). Hence, deregulation of miRNA expression may lead to a variety of disorders. Aberrant expression of miRNAs in cancer has been well documented (7Croce C.M. Calin G.A. Cell. 2005; 122: 6-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). Apparently, miRNAs may function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes by targeting oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (9Chen C.Z. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 353: 1768-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In this regard, tumor-suppressive miRNAs are usually underexpressed in tumors. For instance, let-7 is down-regulated in lung cancer (10Takamizawa J. Konishi H. Yanagisawa K. Tomida S. Osada H. Endoh H. Harano T. Yatabe Y. Nagino M. Nimura Y. Mitsudomi T. Takahashi T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3753-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar, 11Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J. Byrom M. Jarvis R. Cheng A. Labourier E. Reinert K.L. Brown D. Slack F.J. Cell. 2005; 120: 635-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3119) Google Scholar). Furthermore, more than 60% of investigated patients suffering from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) have been reported to show a deletion at chromosome 13q14 where the mir-15 and mir-16 genes are located; these genes are under-represented in many B-CLL patients (12Calin G.A. Dumitru C.D. Shimizu M. Bichi R. Zupo S. Noch E. Aldler H. Rattan S. Keating M. Rai K. Rassenti L. Kipps T. Negrini M. Bullrich F. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15524-15529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4274) Google Scholar). Deregulation of miRNAs has also been reported in many other types of cancers. However, although miRNAs have been the subject of extensive research in recent years, the molecular basis of miRNA-mediated gene regulation and the effect of these genes on tumor growth remain largely unknown because of our limited understanding of miRNA target genes. Identification of miRNA target genes has been a great challenge. Computational algorithms have been the major driving force in predicting miRNA targets (13Stark A. Brennecke J. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: e60Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 14Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4250) Google Scholar, 15Kiriakidou M. Nelson P.T. Kouranov A. Fitziev P. Bouyioukos C. Mourelatos Z. Hatzigeorgiou A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1165-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). The approaches are mainly based on base pairing of miRNA and target gene 3′-UTR, emphasizing the location of miRNA complementary elements in 3′-UTR of target mRNAs, the concentration in the seed (6-8 bp) of continuous Watson-Crick base pairing in the 5′ proximal half of the miRNA, and the phylogenetic conservation of the complementary sequences in 3′-UTRs of orthologous genes. However, evidence suggests that perfect seed pairing may not necessarily be a reliable predictor for miRNA-target interactions (16Didiano D. Hobert O. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 849-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), which may explain why many predicted target sites are nonfunctional. A recent study also suggests that there may be at least three types of miRNA-mRNA interactions in mammals (17Smalheiser N.R. Torvik V.I. Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 342: 115-127PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, with few exceptions, large portion of the physiologic targets for miRNAs remain to be identified or verified experimentally. In this study, we analyzed tumors derived from breast cancer MCF-7 cells treated with antisense mir-21 oligonucleotide (anti-mir-21) or the negative control by two-dimensional differentiation in-gel (2-DIGE) and identified the tumor suppressor tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) as a putative mir-21 target. Subsequent experiments confirmed that mir-21 down-regulated expression of TPM1, whereas anti-mir-21 up-regulated its expression through the mir-21 binding site at the 3′-UTR region. Furthermore, ectopic expression of TPM1 suppressed anchorage-independent growth. Cell Culture—MCF-7 cells (obtained from American Type Cell Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml (Cambrex). MCF10A cells (ATCC) were grown in serum-free mammary epithelial growth medium (from Cambrex) supplemented with 100 ng/ml cholera toxin (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). 293T cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5% CO2. Reagents—Anti-mir-21 (AM17000, ID No. AM10206) and the negative control (AM17010) were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Anti-TPM1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Transfection—Transfection of MCF-7 cells was performed with Optifect reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 30% confluence on the day before transfection. Three μg of TPM1-expressing plasmid or control vector was used for each transfection in antibiotic free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). Transfection of 293T cells was performed using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (18Mo Y.Y. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The negative control oligonucleotide or anti-mir-21 oligonucleotide (both from Ambion) at 50 nm or 3 μg of appropriate plasmid (otherwise indicated) was used for each transfection. Transfection efficiency was monitored by spiking GFP-expressing vector or β-galactosidase-expressing vector when necessary. Detection of Mature mir-21 by TaqMan Real-time PCR— TaqMan miRNA assays (ABI, Forest City, CA) used the stem-loop method (19Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4082) Google Scholar, 20Lao K. Xu N.L. Yeung V. Chen C. Livak K.J. Straus N.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to detect the expression level of mature mir-21. For RT reactions, 10 ng total RNA was used in each reaction (15 μl) and mixed with the RT primer (3 μl). The RT reaction was carried out under the following conditions: 16 °C for 30 min; 42 °C for 30 min; 85 °C for 5 min; and then held on 4 °C. After the RT reaction, the cDNA products were diluted at 150×, and 1.33 μl of the diluted cDNA was used for PCR reaction along with TaqMan primers (2 μl). The PCR reaction was conducted at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s in the ABI 7500 real-time PCR system. The real-time PCR results were analyzed and expressed as relative miRNA expression of CT (threshold cycle) value, which was then converted to fold changes (19Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4082) Google Scholar). The RT primer, PCR primers, and TaqMan probe for mir-21 (19Chen C. Ridzon D.A. Broomer A.J. Zhou Z. Lee D.H. Nguyen J.T. Barbisin M. Xu N.L. Mahuvakar V.R. Andersen M.R. Lao K.Q. Livak K.J. Guegler K.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4082) Google Scholar) were purchased from ABI. U6 or 5S RNA was used for normalization. Detection of TPM1 mRNA—To detect relative levels of TPM1 transcription, qRT-PCR was performed using the Cyber Green method under the following conditions: 94 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 0.5 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 0.5 min. PCR primers were TPM1-5.1, sense, 5′-CTCTCAACGATATGACTTCCA-3′, and TPM1-3.1, antisense, 5′-TTTTTTTAGCTTACACAGTGTT-3′. Both were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (Woodland, TX). Constructs—To construct a plasmid expressing mir-21, we first modified pCMV-Myc (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) by deleting the Myc tag by PCR. We then amplified a 500-bp DNA fragment carrying pre-mir-21 from MCF10A genomic DNA using PCR primers mir-21-5.1, 5′-GAATTCTGATTGAACTTGTTCATTTT-3′ where the EcoRI site is underlined, and mir-21-3.1, 5′-GGTACCAATTAAGACTATCCCCATTTCTCCA-3′, where the KpnI site is underlined. The amplified fragment was first cloned into pCR8 (Invitrogen) and was subsequently cloned into this modified pCMV vector at the EcoRI and KpnI sites. Full-length TPM1 plus 3′-UTR was amplified from MCF-7 cells using primers TPM1-EcoRI-5.1, 5′-GAATTCTGGACGCCATCAAGAAGAAGA-3′, and TPM1-UTR-NotI-3.1, 5′-GCGGCCGCCCTACAATGTGCATTTTATTCC-3′, then cloned into pCR8, and finally subcloned into the original pCMV-Myc. The 250-bp 3′-UTR region of TPM1 was also amplified from MCF-7 cells using primers TPM1-UTR-XbaI-5.1, 5′-TCTAGACTCTCAACGATATGACTTCCA-3′, and TPM1-UTR-XbaI-3.1, 5′-TCTAGATTTTTTTAGCTTACACAGTGTT-3′, using the same approach described above, and was finally cloned into pGL3 control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) at the XbaI site. To construct a plasmid expressing the GFP-TPM1 fusion protein (pEGFP-TPM1+UTR), we also used primers TPM1-R1-5.1 and TPM1-UTR-NotI-3.1 as indicated above. This fragment was finally cloned into pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) at the EcoRI and NotI sites in-frame with the GFP coding region. To clone the 3′-UTR of TPM1 into a GFP reporter, which was different from the GFP fusion construct, we first modified the pEGFP-C3 by introducing a stop codon in the front of the multiple cloning sites by PCR and then cloning the TPM1-UTR fragment into EcoRI site of this modified vector. All PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing before cloning into the final destination vectors. Luciferase Assay—293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected with luciferase reporters using the calcium phosphate method as described above. After transfection, the cells were split into 12-well plates (in duplicates) and harvested for luciferase assays 24 h later using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. β-Galactosidase was used for normalization. Cell Growth Assay—After transfection with vector control or TPM1-expressing vector, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 2500 cell/well. The MTT assay was used to determine relative cell growth as described previously (21Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Oncogene, in press. 2006; Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent Assay—To determine anchorage-independent growth of transfected cells, the cells were grown in soft agar according to a published method (22Finlay T.H. Tamir S. Kadner S.S. Cruz M.R. Yavelow J. Levitz M. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day after transfection with TPM1, cells were harvested and mixed with tissue culture medium containing 0.7% agar to result in a final agar concentration of 0.35%. Then, 1-ml samples of this cell suspension were immediately plated in 12-well plates covered with 0.6% agar in tissue culture medium and cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To assess cell viability before plating in soft agar, cell number was determined by trypan blue staining in Vi-Cell XR (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Western Blot—Total protein was isolated from tumor samples or 293T cells transfected with an appropriate plasmid in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. The membrane was first probed with antibodies against Myc (Applied Biomaterials) or GFP (Clontech), and then with anti-β-actin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies were labeled with either Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye800 (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA). Signals were visualized using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Animal Work—Female nude (nu/nu) mice (4-5 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and were maintained in the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine’s accredited animal facility. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health animal use guidelines and a protocol approved by the Southern Illinois University Animal Care Committee. Exponentially growing MCF-7 cells were harvested, mixed with 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at 15 million cells/ml, and injected (1.5 million cells/spot) into mammary pads of female nude mice. To facilitate tumor growth, a 0.72-mg 17β-estradiol pellet (Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, FL) was implanted beneath the back skin. Tumors usually appeared 1 week after inoculation when anti-mir-21 or negative control oligonucleotide was delivered to tumor sites by injecting 50 μl (50 nm) of the oligonucleotide carrying 12 μl of Optifect. One week later another injection of the same amount was performed. Tumor size was monitored every other day; 4 weeks after inoculation of MCF-7 cells, tumors were harvested, weighed, and frozen immediately in a -80 °C freezer. Proteomic Analysis of Tumor Samples—Tumor samples that were harvested and stored at -80 °C were sent directly for 2-DIGE and mass spectrometry analysis, a service provided by Applied Biomics (Hayward, CA). Total protein was extracted and labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5. Isoelectric focusing in the first dimension was carried out at pH 3-10, and in the second dimension was carried out in 8-14% gradient SDS-PAGE. Differentially expressed proteins were cut out and subjected to trypsin digestion before mass spectrometry analysis. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ±S.E., and p < 0.01 is considered as statistically significant by Student’s t test. Suppression of Tumor Growth by Anti-mir-21—We have previously shown that transient transfection of MCF-7 cells with anti-mir-21 causes tumor growth inhibition in a xenograft carcinoma mouse model (21Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Oncogene, in press. 2006; Google Scholar). Thus, we asked here whether intratumoral delivery of anti-mir-21 has the same effect on tumor growth. Tumors treated with anti-mir-21 grew substantially smaller in size than those treated with the negative control; tumors treated with anti-mir-21 revealed a lower level of Ki-67 staining compared with the vector control (not shown). This is consistent with the previous finding (21Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Oncogene, in press. 2006; Google Scholar), suggesting that suppression of tumor growth likely occurs because of reduced cell proliferation, increased apoptosis, or both as suggested previously (21Si M.L. Zhu S. Wu H. Lu Z. Wu F. Mo Y.Y. Oncogene, in press. 2006; Google Scholar, 23Chan J.A. Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results not only support the notion that mir-21 is an oncogenic miRNA but also imply that anti-mir-21 has a therapeutic potential. TPM1 Is Up-regulated in Anti-mir-21-treated Tumor Samples as Detected by 2-DIGE Analysis—Although mir-21 is overexpressed in many types of tumors, suggesting its role in cancer development, the underlying mechanism of mir-21-mediated tumorigenesis is still unclear largely because of limited knowledge about mir-21 targets. Although various computer-aided algorithms have predicted many putative mir-21 targets, these targets have not been validated experimentally. Because miRNAs are believed to regulate gene expression mainly through translational repression in mammalian cells, we thought to determine the differential expression of proteins from the tumor samples after treatment with anti-mir-21. Protein was extracted from tumors derived from MCF-7 cells treated with either the negative control (labeled with Cy3) or anti-mir-21 (labeled with Cy5). Unlike conventional two-dimensional gels in which two samples are run in separate gels, this method separates two samples labeled with different fluorescent dyes in a single gel, thus eliminating gel-to-gel variation and allowing for easy comparison of relative expression levels. After separating the proteins by isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE, we found that several proteins were either up-regulated or down-regulated as shown by either red or green color, respectively (Fig. 1). This result, in fact, is in agreement with the finding that mir-122 also causes up-regulation or down-regulation of many proteins (24Krutzfeldt J. Rajewsky N. Braich R. Rajeev K.G. Tuschl T. Manoharan M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2005; 438: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar), because some of these differentially expressed proteins may be due to the secondary effect of miRNA regulation. Analysis of another pair of tumor samples harvested from different mice revealed an almost identical pattern to that of Fig. 1, suggesting the reproducibility of this method. We are particularly interested in those proteins up-regulated by anti-mir-21 because they are potential direct targets for mir-21. We picked 10 protein spots that were up-regulated more than 2-fold in the tumor samples treated with anti-mir-21 compared with the negative control; these are circled in Fig. 1B. Mass spectrometry analysis identified seven of them with a good score. Among them, three proteins have been implicated in tumorigenesis: TPM1 (25Cooper H.L. Feuerstein N. Noda M. Bassin R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 972-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), integrin-β4-binding protein (ITGB4BP), (26Sanvito F. Vivoli F. Gambini S. Santambrogio G. Catena M. Viale E. Veglia F. Donadini A. Biffo S. Marchisio P.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 510-516PubMed Google Scholar) and selenium-binding protein-1 (SELENBP1) (27Chen G. Wang H. Miller C.T. Thomas D.G. Gharib T.G. Misek D.E. Giordano T.J. Orringer M.B. Hanash S.M. Beer D.G. J. Pathol. 2004; 202: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested these three genes by cloning their UTRs into a luciferase reporter. Interestingly, Western blot analysis of the tumor samples also indicated that the endogenous TPM1 was increased in the anti-mir-21-treated tumors by almost 2-fold (Fig. 1, C and D). Further characterization identified TPM1 as a direct target for mir-21 as described below. TPM1 Carries a Putative mir-21 Binding Site, Which Is Responsible for Regulation by mir-21—The tropomyosins (TMs or TPMs) are a group of proteins that bind to the sides of actin filaments; there are at least four separate proteins, TPM1, -2, -3, and -4, encoded by different genes (28Lees-Miller J.P. Helfman D.M. BioEssays. 1991; 13: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). TPM1 has seven variants through alternative splicing. Coincidentally, TPM1 variants 1 and 5 carry a putative mir-21 binding site, as predicted by the Sanger miRNA data base target search program (Fig. 2A). Variant 1 differs from variant 5 in a sequence coding for 24 amino acids and also by lacking an additional 48 nucleotides upstream of the 3′-UTR (Fig. 2A). The potential base pairing between mir-21 and TPM1 3′-UTR is shown in Fig. 2B. Thus, we tried to amplify this UTR region of both variants from MCF-7 cells, which, however, appeared to express only TPM1 variant 1. Hence, we cloned this variant 1 3′-UTR into pGL3 control vector. As shown in Fig. 2C, the luciferase activity in 293T cells for Luc-TPM1-V1-UTR was about 20% less than that of pGL3 control vector, suggesting that TPM1 3′-UTR carries a regulatory element(s). To confirm that this regulatory region is mir-21 specific, we transfected 293T cells with the same Luc-TPM1-UTR plasmid along with either the pCMV vector or the mir-21-expressing plasmid. The ectopic expression of mir-21 was confirmed by TaqMan real-time PCR, which revealed about a 4-fold higher mir-21 expression in the mir-21-transfected cells than in vector control (Fig. 3A). In contrast, anti-mir-21 reduced mir-21 by almost 50%, as determined by the same method (Fig. 3B). We then transfected the 293T cells with various amounts of mir-21-expressing vector. As shown in Fig. 3C, reduction of luciferase activity by mir-21 was dose-dependent, suggesting that this regulation is specifically responsive to mir-21. In contrast, mir-21 had no effect on Luc-TPM1-V4-UTR, which is derived from variant 4 and lacks the mir-21 binding site (Fig. 3D). In addition, we tested the effect of anti-mir-21 on the luciferase activity of Luc-TPM1-V1-UTR. As expected, mir-21 suppressed the luciferase activity, whereas anti-mir-21 increased the luciferase activity (Fig. 4E), further suggesting that expression of TPM1 is specifically regulated by mir-21. To determine the role of the mir-21 binding site in regulating its expression, we deleted the mir-21 binding site in variant 1 (Luc-TPM1-V1-UTR-d). As shown in Fig. 3F, neither mir-21 nor anti-mir-21 had any effect on the luciferase activity, highlighting the importance of this mir-21 binding site.FIGURE 4Regulation of TPM1 expression by mir-21 at the translational level. A, expression of TPM1-Myc in 293T cells as determined by Western blot. The same membrane was first probed with anti Myc-antibody and then with anti β-actin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The effect of mir-21 or anti-mir-21 on the protein levels of TPM1-Myc (B and D) or TPM1-d (C and E), in which the mir-21 binding site was deleted, is shown. B and C are representative of at least three separate experiments; D and E are the means of three separate experiments ± S.E. F, mir-21 or anti-mir-21 has no effect on the mRNA levels of TPM1-Myc, as determined by real-time qRT-PCR.

In this case, we cloned TPM1-V1-UTR into the EcoRI site of the modified pEGFP-C3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with the luciferase data, the level of EGFP-TPM1-V1-UTR was reduced by mir-21 but was increased by anti-mir-21, as measured either by Western blot or fluorescence microscopy (not shown). mir-21 Regulates TPM1 at the Translational Level—Translational repression is a major mechanism of miRNAs to regulate gene expression (29Engels B.M. Hutvagner G. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6163-6169Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). To determine whether mir-21 also suppresses TPM1 through translational repression, we cloned the full-length TPM1 plus the 3′-UTR into pCMV-Myc. Expression of Myc-tagged TPM1 was confirmed by anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 4A). Importantly, although ectopic expression of mir-21 significantly reduced TPM1 protein, anti-mir-21 enhanced TPM1 protein (Fig. 4, B and D). To further determine the importance of the mir-21 binding site, we did similar experiments with pCMV-Myc-TPM1+UTR-d in which the mir-21-binding site was deleted. Deletion of this site abolished the effect of mir-21 or anti-mir-21 on TPM1 expression at the protein level (Fig. 4, C and E). However, despite the effect of mir-21 or anti-mir-21 on TPM1 at the protein level, no effect on the TPM1 mRNA level was detected by real-time qRT-PCR for pCMV-Myc-TPM1+UTR (Fig. 4F). Therefore, these results suggest that the mir-21 binding site present in the TPM1-UTR region is critical for mir-21-mediated regulation at the translational level. In addition, we made a GFP fusion construct with the full-length TPM1 plus the 3′-UTR (GPF-TPM1+UTR). We first confirmed its expression of its fusion protein by Western blot (not shown). Fluorescence microscopy clearly showed a distinguished subcellular localization of GFP-TPM1. Although we detected the green protein all over the cell for GFP alone, GFP-TPM1 fusion protein was localized exclusive"

By using mice in which the two kinases that generate S1P were conditionally ablated, we find that plasma S1P is mainly hematopoietic in origin, with erythrocytes a major contributor, whereas lymph S1P is from a distinct radiation-resistant source. Lymphocyte egress from thymus and secondary lymphoid organs was markedly reduced in kinase-deficient mice. Restoration of S1P to plasma rescued egress to blood but not lymph, and the rescue required lymphocyte expression of S1P-receptor-1. Thus, separate sources provide S1P to plasma and lymph to help lymphocytes exit the low-S1P environment of lymphoid organs. Disruption of compartmentalized S1P signaling is a plausible mechanism by which S1P-receptor-1 agonists function as immunosuppressives."

https://openalex.org/W2963469045,"A microscopic system under continuous observation exhibits at random times sudden jumps between its states. The detection of this essential quantum feature requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement repeated many times during the system evolution. Quantum jumps of trapped massive particles (electrons, ions or molecules) have been observed, which is not the case of the jumps of light quanta. Usual photodetectors absorb light and are thus unable to detect the same photon twice. They must be replaced by a transparent counter 'seeing' photons without destroying them3. Moreover, the light has to be stored over a duration much longer than the QND detection time. We have fulfilled these challenging conditions and observed photon number quantum jumps. Microwave photons are stored in a superconducting cavity for times in the second range. They are repeatedly probed by a stream of non-absorbing atoms. An atom interferometer measures the atomic dipole phase shift induced by the non-resonant cavity field, so that the final atom state reveals directly the presence of a single photon in the cavity. Sequences of hundreds of atoms highly correlated in the same state, are interrupted by sudden state-switchings. These telegraphic signals record, for the first time, the birth, life and death of individual photons. Applying a similar QND procedure to mesoscopic fields with tens of photons opens new perspectives for the exploration of the quantum to classical boundary."

https://openalex.org/W2065486396,"Although the tropics harbor greater numbers of species than do temperate zones, it is not known whether the rates of speciation and extinction also follow a latitudinal gradient. By sampling birds and mammals, we found that the distribution of the evolutionary ages of sister species—pairs of species in which each is the other's closest relative—adheres to a latitudinal gradient. The time to divergence for sister species is shorter at high latitudes and longer in the tropics. Birth-death models fitting these data estimate that the highest recent speciation and extinction rates occur at high latitudes and decline toward the tropics. These results conflict with the prevailing view that links high tropical diversity to elevated tropical speciation rates. Instead, our findings suggest that faster turnover at high latitudes contributes to the latitudinal diversity gradient."

To control electron flux, we covalently attached this model and analogs lacking copper and phenol onto self-assembled monolayer–coated gold electrodes. When the electron transfer rate was made rate limiting, both copper and phenol were required to enhance selective reduction of oxygen to water. This finding supports the hypothesis that, during steady-state turnover, the primary role of these redox centers is to rapidly provide all the electrons needed to reduce oxygen by four electrons, thus preventing the release of toxic partially reduced oxygen species."
https://openalex.org/W1968654384,"Notable warming trends have been observed in the Arctic. Although increased human-induced emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases are certainly the main driving factor, air pollutants, such as aerosols and ozone, are also important. Air pollutants are transported to the Arctic, primarily from Eurasia, leading to high concentrations in winter and spring (Arctic haze). Local ship emissions and summertime boreal forest fires may also be important pollution sources. Aerosols and ozone could be perturbing the radiative budget of the Arctic through processes specific to the region: Absorption of solar radiation by aerosols is enhanced by highly reflective snow and ice surfaces; deposition of light-absorbing aerosols on snow or ice can decrease surface albedo; and tropospheric ozone forcing may also be contributing to warming in this region. Future increases in pollutant emissions locally or in mid-latitudes could further accelerate global warming in the Arctic."
https://openalex.org/W2100957654,"The ice-rich south polar layered deposits of Mars were probed with the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding on the Mars Express orbiter. The radar signals penetrate deep into the deposits (more than 3.7 kilometers). For most of the area, a reflection is detected at a time delay that is consistent with an interface between the deposits and the substrate. The reflected power from this interface indicates minimal attenuation of the signal, suggesting a composition of nearly pure water ice. Maps were generated of the topography of the basal interface and the thickness of the layered deposits. A set of buried depressions is seen within 300 kilometers of the pole. The thickness map shows an asymmetric distribution of the deposits and regions of anomalous thickness. The total volume is estimated to be 1.6 x 10(6) cubic kilometers, which is equivalent to a global water layer approximately 11 meters thick."
https://openalex.org/W2002568583,"After a century of polar exploration, the past decade of satellite measurements has painted an altogether new picture of how Earth's ice sheets are changing. As global temperatures have risen, so have rates of snowfall, ice melting, and glacier flow. Although the balance between these opposing processes has varied considerably on a regional scale, data show that Antarctica and Greenland are each losing mass overall. Our best estimate of their combined imbalance is about 125 gigatons per year of ice, enough to raise sea level by 0.35 millimeters per year. This is only a modest contribution to the present rate of sea-level rise of 3.0 millimeters per year. However, much of the loss from Antarctica and Greenland is the result of the flow of ice to the ocean from ice streams and glaciers, which has accelerated over the past decade. In both continents, there are suspected triggers for the accelerated ice discharge—surface and ocean warming, respectively—and, over the course of the 21st century, these processes could rapidly counteract the snowfall gains predicted by present coupled climate models."

https://openalex.org/W1972127223,"This week, two papers from separate groups define a signalling centre in the Drosophila lymph gland that controls maintenance of blood cell precursors. Signals generated in the posterior signalling centre of the lymph gland control the balance of progenitors and differentiating blood cells through JAK/STAT and Notch signalling pathways. Mandal et al. also show that the signalling centre is specified early in embryonic development by the homeotic gene Antennapedia. And Krzemień et al. show that Notch signalling controls Collier, the Drosophila equivalent of mammalian early B cell factor. This work suggests that the Drosophila model for blood development could be an important tool for genetic manipulation. One of two papers that define the region of the posterior signalling centre (PSC) in the Drosophila melanogaster lymph gland that controls maintenance of blood cell precursors. This paper also showed that the PSC is specified early in embryonic development by the homeotic gene Antennapedia. The Drosophila melanogaster lymph gland is a haematopoietic organ1,2,3 in which pluripotent blood cell progenitors proliferate and mature into differentiated haemocytes. Previous work4 has defined three domains, the medullary zone, the cortical zone and the posterior signalling centre (PSC), within the developing third-instar lymph gland. The medullary zone is populated by a core of undifferentiated, slowly cycling progenitor cells, whereas mature haemocytes comprising plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes are peripherally located in the cortical zone. The PSC comprises a third region that was first defined as a small group of cells expressing the Notch ligand Serrate5. Here we show that the PSC is specified early in the embryo by the homeotic gene Antennapedia (Antp) and expresses the signalling molecule Hedgehog. In the absence of the PSC or the Hedgehog signal, the precursor population of the medullary zone is lost because cells differentiate prematurely. We conclude that the PSC functions as a haematopoietic niche that is essential for the maintenance of blood cell precursors in Drosophila. Identification of this system allows the opportunity for genetic manipulation and direct in vivo imaging of a haematopoietic niche interacting with blood precursors."

By applying statistical approaches that account for phylogenetic relationships among viral sequences, we show that viral lineage effects rather than immune escape often explain apparent human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mediated immune-escape mutations defined by older analysis methods. Phylogenetically informed methods identified immune-susceptible locations with greatly improved accuracy, and the associations we identified with these methods were experimentally validated. This approach has practical implications for understanding the impact of host immunity on pathogen evolution and for defining relevant variants for inclusion in vaccine antigens."

https://openalex.org/W2063394028,"14-3-3 proteins are crucial in a wide variety of cellular responses including cell cycle progression, DNA damage checkpoints and apoptosis. One particular 14-3-3 isoform, sigma, is a p53-responsive gene, the function of which is frequently lost in human tumours, including breast and prostate cancers as a result of either hypermethylation of the 14-3-3sigma promoter or induction of an oestrogen-responsive ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets 14-3-3sigma for proteasomal degradation. Loss of 14-3-3sigma protein occurs not only within the tumours themselves but also in the surrounding pre-dysplastic tissue (so-called field cancerization), indicating that 14-3-3sigma might have an important tumour suppressor function that becomes lost early in the process of tumour evolution. The molecular basis for the tumour suppressor function of 14-3-3sigma is unknown. Here we report a previously unknown function for 14-3-3sigma as a regulator of mitotic translation through its direct mitosis-specific binding to a variety of translation/initiation factors, including eukaryotic initiation factor 4B in a stoichiometric manner. Cells lacking 14-3-3sigma, in marked contrast to normal cells, cannot suppress cap-dependent translation and do not stimulate cap-independent translation during and immediately after mitosis. This defective switch in the mechanism of translation results in reduced mitotic-specific expression of the endogenous internal ribosomal entry site (IRES)-dependent form of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk11 (p58 PITSLRE), leading to impaired cytokinesis, loss of Polo-like kinase-1 at the midbody, and the accumulation of binucleate cells. The aberrant mitotic phenotype of 14-3-3sigma-depleted cells can be rescued by forced expression of p58 PITSLRE or by extinguishing cap-dependent translation and increasing cap-independent translation during mitosis by using rapamycin. Our findings show how aberrant mitotic translation in the absence of 14-3-3sigma impairs mitotic exit to generate binucleate cells and provides a potential explanation of how 14-3-3sigma-deficient cells may progress on the path to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2067127913,"The Hydatellaceae are small aquatic plants living modest lives away from the limelight, and conventionally assumed to be monocotyledonous flowering plants related to grasses. Now they have been subjected to the latest molecular techniques, and they turn out to be close relatives of basal angiosperms such as water lilies, increasing their importance immensely. They belong to a previously unrecognized lineage branching near the root of the angiosperms — a radical addition to the three deepest branches discovered in 1999 that rekindled interest amongst molecular biologists in the origin of angiosperms, what Darwin called an “abominable mystery”. Although the relationship of angiosperms to other seed plants remains controversial1, great progress has been made in identifying the earliest extant splits in flowering-plant phylogeny, with the discovery that the New Caledonian shrub Amborella trichopoda, the water lilies (Nymphaeales), and the woody Austrobaileyales constitute a basal grade of lines that diverged before the main radiation in the clade2,3,4,5,6,7,8. By focusing attention on these ancient lines, this finding has re-written our understanding of angiosperm structural and reproductive biology, physiology, ecology and taxonomy9,10,11,12. The discovery of a new basal lineage would lead to further re-evaluation of the initial angiosperm radiation, but would also be unexpected, as nearly all of the ∼460 flowering-plant families have been surveyed in molecular studies10. Here we show that Hydatellaceae, a small family of dwarf aquatics that were formerly interpreted as monocots, are instead a highly modified and previously unrecognized ancient lineage of angiosperms. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of multiple plastid genes and associated noncoding regions from the two genera of Hydatellaceae identify this overlooked family as the sister group of Nymphaeales. This surprising result is further corroborated by evidence from the nuclear gene phytochrome C (PHYC), and by numerous morphological characters. This indicates that water lilies are part of a larger lineage that evolved more extreme and diverse modifications for life in an aquatic habitat than previously recognized."
https://openalex.org/W2034083093,"Green tea consumption is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in some epidemiological studies. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a bioactive polyphenol in green tea, mimics metabolic actions of insulin to inhibit gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Because signaling pathways regulating metabolic and vasodilator actions of insulin are shared in common, we hypothesized that EGCG may also have vasodilator actions to stimulate production of nitric oxide (NO) from endothelial cells. Acute intra-arterial administration of EGCG to mesenteric vascular beds isolated ex vivo from WKY rats caused dose-dependent vasorelaxation. This was inhibitable by l-NAME (NO synthase inhibitor), wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor), or PP2 (Src family kinase inhibitor). Treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) with EGCG (50 μm) acutely stimulated production of NO (assessed with NO-specific fluorescent dye DAF-2) that was inhibitable by l-NAME, wortmannin, or PP2. Stimulation of BAEC with EGCG also resulted in dose- and time-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS that was inhibitable by wortmannin or PP2 (but not by MEK inhibitor PD98059). Specific knockdown of Fyn (but not Src) with small interfering RNA inhibited both EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS as well as production of NO in BAEC.

Synergistic relationships between insulin sensitivity and endothelial function are reinforced because insulin signaling pathways in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and liver promoting metabolic actions of insulin are shared in common with insulin signaling pathways in vascular endothelium promoting vasodilator actions of insulin (1Kim J.A.

Thus, it may be feasible to identify and characterize nutritional supplements and/or functional foods that simultaneously improve both endothelial function and insulin sensitivity to provide safe and effective adjunctive treatment of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a bioactive polyphenol in green tea that makes up one-third of its dry mass (10Yang C.S. Chen L. Lee M.J. Balentine D. Kuo M.C. Schantz S.P. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 1998; 7: 351-354PubMed Google Scholar). EGCG acutely activates specific intracellular signaling pathways regulating metabolic actions of insulin. In hepatocytes, EGCG inhibits gluconeogenesis through activation of PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways (11Waltner-Law M.E. Wang X.L. Law B.K. Hall R.K. Nawano M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In addition, EGCG mediates endothelium-dependent relaxation in aortic rings, whereas inhibitor studies in endothelial cells suggest that EGCG-stimulated activation of eNOS is PI 3-kinase dependent (12Lorenz M.

Thus, we hypothesize that EGCG signaling pathways in endothelium may partly overlap with downstream insulin signaling pathways. However, signaling pathways used by EGCG for vasodilation in intact vessels and EGCG signaling pathways for activation of eNOS upstream of PI 3-kinase are presently unknown (and may be distinct from those used by insulin). We now demonstrate novel contributions of reactive oxygen species and Fyn in the vasodilator actions of EGCG resulting from activation of eNOS in endothelium that are distinct from insulin signaling. Elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying vascular actions of EGCG is important for understanding potential health benefits of green tea consumption in patients with diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases that are characterized by both insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Animal Experiments—All procedures in animals were performed in accordance with Guidelines and Authorization for the Use of Laboratory Animals (Italian Government, Ministry of Health). Male 12-week-old Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats obtained from Harlan Italy (Milan, Italy) were used in all studies. Drugs—Drugs were obtained from the indicated sources: heparin (Pfizer); insulin (Novo Nordisk); and norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine (ACh), EGCG (Sigma). Stock solutions of NE (100 mm) and ACh (10 mm) were prepared with distilled water. Final dilutions of these drugs were prepared in modified Krebs-Henseleit solution immediately before use. Stock solutions of EGCG in Me2SO (10%) were prepared. Evaluation of Vascular Function ex Vivo—Mesenteric vascular beds (MVB) were isolated from rats as described previously (13Potenza M.A. Marasciulo F.L. Chieppa D.M. Brigiani G.S. Formoso G. Quon M.J. Montagnani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H813-H822Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Briefly, MVB mounted in a temperature-controlled moist chamber (type 834/1, Hugo Sachs Elektronik, March-Hungstetten, Germany) were perfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit solution continuously gassed with a mixture of 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.4). A constant flow rate of 5 ml/min through the MVB was maintained using a peristaltic pump (ISM 833; Hugo Sachs Elektronik, March-Hungstetten, Germany). Drug solutions were infused into the perfusate proximal to the arterial cannula using another peristaltic pump. After an equilibration period (30-40 min), changes in perfusion pressure were measured with a Pressure Transducer System (SP 844 Capto, Horten, Norway) and recorded continuously using data acquisition and analysis equipment (PowerLab System, ADInstruments, Castle Hill, Australia). Intact endothelial function was verified by vasodilation induced by infusion of 1 μm ACh. Vasodilator Responses in MVB—A steady-state perfusion pressure (PP) of ∼120 mm Hg was obtained 30-40 min after initial administration of NE and was maintained by continuous NE infusion (10 μm). Dose-response curves measuring vasodilation (decrease in PP) in response to EGCG were obtained by adding increasing concentrations of EGCG (1-100 μm/4 min perfusion) to the perfusate. Data from each dose-response curve were normalized to PP obtained in WKY rats treated with a maximally stimulating dose of ACh (1 μm, 100% representing initial steady-state perfusion pressure and 0% representing maximal reduction in response to ACh). In some experiments, EGCG-induced relaxation was measured before and after treatment with l-NAME (NOS inhibitor; 100 μm, 30 min), wortmannin (PI 3-kinase inhibitor; 100 nm, 30 min), PD98059 (MEK inhibitor; 10 μm, 30 min), or PP2 (Src family kinase inhibitor; 10 μm, 30 min). Cell Culture and Transfection—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) in primary culture were obtained from Cell Applications (San Diego, CA) and maintained in EBM-2 media containing EGM-MV singlequot supplements (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD). All experiments were conducted on BAECs before their fifth passage. For experiments evaluating EGCG treatment, cells were serum-starved overnight and then incubated for 30 min in the absence or presence of various inhibitors prior to EGCG treatment as described in the figure legends. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs; Cell Applications) in primary culture were grown in EGM-2 media containing EGM-2 singlequot supplements (Cambrex). HAECs were transiently transfected with 200 nmol of siRNA duplex oligonucleotides (Csk siRNA sense oligonucleotide 5′-GCGAGUGCCUUAUCCAAGAUU-3′; c-Src Smartpool M-003175-03-0005 and Fyn Smartpool M-003140-03-0010 from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) using Lipofectamine with Plus reagents (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Two days after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 2 h and then treated without or with EGCG as indicated in the figure legends. Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated form HAECs using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed using one-step reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers for amplification of Csk are 5′-GGAGCACTACCGCATCATGT-3′ (forward), and 5′-CAGCATCACGTCTCCGAACT-3′ (reverse); for β-actin, 5′-CTGGCACCCAGCACAATGAAG-3′ (forward), and 5′-TAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACG-3′ (reverse). PCR was performed at 95 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min with 25 cycles. The gene product was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Before lysis, cells were briefly washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.2), 125 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation of samples at 17,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were then boiled with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min and proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies as described in the figures using standard methods. Immunoblots were quantified by scanning densitometry (GE Healthcare). PI 3-Kinase Activity Assays—BAECs were serum-starved overnight and then treated without or with EGCG (50 μm, 15 min). Cell lysates were then prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate, Charlottesville, VA), Cbl (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), or Gab-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) according to standard methods as described (14Kim J.A. Yeh D.C. Ver M. Li Y. Carranza A. Conrads T.P. Veenstra T.D. Harrington M.A. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23173-23183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase activity in the immunoprecipitates was detected as follows: for each sample, 10 μg of sonicated phosphatidylinositol substrate (Sigma) was incubated with 50 μl of PI 3-kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.1 n HCl. Phospholipid was extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). The organic phase was collected and applied to silica gel thin layer chromatography plates (Whatman) pre-activated with 1% potassium oxalate. Thin layer chromatography was performed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:12.3:2). The plates were dried and results were visualized by autoradiography. Quantification was done by PhosphorImager analysis. Measurement of NO Production—Production of NO was assessed using NO-specific fluorescent dye 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as described previously (15Formoso G. Chen H. Kim J.A. Montagnani M. Consoli A. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells were grown to 95% confluence in chamber slides (Lab-Tek, Rochester, NY) and serum-starved overnight. Cells were then loaded with DAF-2 DA (final concentration, 1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, rinsed 3 times with EBM-2 media and kept in the dark. Cells were then treated without or with insulin or EGCG as indicated in the figure legends. In some experiments, wortmannin (100 nm), l-NAME (100 μm), or PP2 (20 μm) were added 30 min before loading cells with DAF-2 DA. After stimulation, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at 4 °C. Fixed cells were visualized using an Olympus IX81 inverted epifluorescent microscope with an attached charge-coupled device camera (Retiga Exi, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada) using appropriate filters with a peak excitation wavelength of 480 nm and a peak emission wavelength of 510 nm. Images were captured using IP Labs Software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA). Measurement of H2O2 Production—Production of intracellular H2O2 was assessed using H2O2-specific fluorescent dye 5-(and-6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCF-DA, Invitrogen) using a method modified from Bae et al. (16Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAECs were plated on chamber slides and incubated in serum- and growth factor-free media overnight. Cells were then washed with Dulbecco’s phosphatebuffered saline containing calcium and magnesium before each experiment. Cells were loaded with CM-H2DCF-DA (5 μm) for 10 min at 37 °C and then washed to remove excess CM-H2DCF-DA. Cells were then treated with EGCG or H2O2 as indicated in the legends to figures followed by washing 3 times with DPBS. Cells were visualized and images were captured as described above for measurement of NO production. Acute Vasodilator Actions of EGCG—To evaluate vasodilator actions of EGCG ex vivo, we isolated MVB from WKY rats. After pre-constriction of MVB with norepinephrine (NE) to a perfusion pressure of ∼120 mm Hg, a supramaximal dose of ACh was administered to elicit vasorelaxation and verify endothelial function and integrity. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of EGCG (1-100 μm) were administered to the MVB resulting in dose-dependent reduction in perfusion pressure (Fig. 1, A-D, left panels). Pre-treatment of MVB with l-NAME (NOS inhibitor) completely inhibited vasodilator actions of EGCG (Fig. 1A). Moreover, pre-treatment of MVB with wortmannin (PI 3-kinase inhibitor) or PP2 (Src family kinase inhibitor) also significantly inhibited vasodilator actions of EGCG (Fig. 1, B and D, right panels, and E), whereas pre-treatment with PD98059 (MEK inhibitor) did not (Fig. 1, C, right panel, and E). Consistent with our previous studies (13Potenza M.A. Marasciulo F.L. Chieppa D.M. Brigiani G.S. Formoso G. Quon M.J. Montagnani M. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: H813-H822Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), Me2SO control alone did not affect vasodilation of our preparation (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG has acute vasodilator actions that are mediated by endothelial production of NO requiring activation of Src family kinases and PI 3-kinase, but not MAP kinase. EGCG Acutely Stimulates Production of NO from Endothelial Cells—Because endothelial-derived NO is an important physiological vasodilator, we next inquired whether acute EGCG treatment can directly stimulate production of NO from vascular endothelial cells in primary culture. Using the NO-specific fluorescent dye DAF-2 DA, we found that both insulin and EGCG acutely stimulated production of NO in BAEC that was inhibitable by l-NAME (Fig. 2A). EGCGstimulated production of NO in BAEC was also inhibited by PP2 and wortmannin (Fig. 2B), but not by PD98059 (Fig. 2C). Thus, consistent with its acute vasodilator actions ex vivo, EGCG has direct actions in vascular endothelial cells to activate eNOS leading to production of NO that requires activation of Src family kinases and PI 3-kinase but not MAP kinase. EGCG-stimulated Phosphorylation of eNOS—Insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS requires phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 by Akt in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (17Montagnani M. Chen H. Barr V.A. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30392-30398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Because EGCG mimics some PI 3-kinase-dependent metabolic actions of insulin (11Waltner-Law M.E. Wang X.L. Law B.K. Hall R.K. Nawano M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34933-34940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), we evaluated the time course and dose dependence for EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179. Stimulation of BAEC with EGCG (50 μm) resulted in a time-dependent increase in phosphorylation of both eNOS and Akt with significant phosphorylation detectable after treatment for 15 min (Fig. 3A). We also observed dose-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS in BAEC after 15 min EGCG treatment with significant phosphorylation occurring at doses of 10 μm or greater (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, EGCG also acutely stimulated phosphorylation of MAP kinase (Fig. 3, C and D, lane 2). As expected, pre-treatment of BAEC with wortmannin inhibited EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, but not MAP kinase. Moreover, PD98059 pretreatment inhibited phosphorylation of MAP kinase in response to EGCG, but not phosphorylation of Akt or eNOS (Fig. 3C). Consistent with the importance of Src family kinases in EGCG-stimulated production of NO identified in Figs. 1 and 2, pre-treatment of BAEC with PP2 inhibited EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS (as well as MAP-kinase) (Fig. 3D). By contrast, insulin-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation was not affected by PP2 treatment (Fig. 3E). In addition, siRNA-mediated reduction of Csk, a negative regulator of Src family kinases, significantly enhanced EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of Src family kinases, Akt, and eNOS (Fig. 3F). However, pre-treatment of BAEC with SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor) did not significantly affect EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS (data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that EGCG-stimulated production of NO involves a Src family kinase. Src Family Kinase Substrates That Bind and Activate PI 3-Kinase in Response to EGCG Treatment—Src family kinases are known to phosphorylate several intracellular substrates including Cbl and Gab-1 on tyrosine residues resulting in the ability of these substrates to bind and activate PI 3-kinase (18Jin Z.G. Wong C. Wu J. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12305-12309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 19Ojaniemi M. Martin S.S. Dolfi F. Olefsky J.M. Vuori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3780-3787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To identify specific Src substrates participating in EGCG-stimulated activation of PI 3-kinase, we treated BAECs without or with EGCG, immunoprecipitated cell lysates with antibodies against phosphotyrosine, Cbl, or Gab-1, and then subjected these immunoprecipitates to a lipid kinase assay using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate (Fig. 4). Increased PI 3-kinase activity associated with phosphotyrosine and Gab-1 containing proteins after treatment of cells with EGCG was inhibited by PP2 pre-treatment. Cbl-associated PI 3-kinase activity was not different after EGCG treatment. Gab-1-associated PI 3-kinase is about 30% of the total phosphotyrosine associated activity. Thus, Gab-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity may contribute to EGCG actions. However, there are likely to be other unidentified Src family kinase substrates that also contribute to this process. Fyn, but Not Src, Is Necessary for EGCG-stimulated Phosphorylation of eNOS and Production of NO—Of the 11 known members of the Src family, only Src, Fyn, and Yes are thought to be ubiquitously expressed (20Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). To identify specific Src family members involved with EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS and production of NO we used siRNA oligonucleotides to specifically reduce expression of Src or Fyn in HAEC in primary culture. In preliminary experiments, fluorescently tagged control oligonucleotides were used to demonstrate that our transfection efficiency for siRNA in HAEC was greater than 90% (data not shown). When compared with control scrambled siRNA, siRNA targeting Src or Fyn specifically and efficiently reduced expression of the targeted proteins in transfected HAEC (Fig. 5A, bottom panels). Importantly, decreasing Fyn expression substantially inhibited EGCG-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, whereas reducing expression of Src did not (Fig. 5A). Consistent with these results, EGCG-stimulated production of NO was abolished by transfecting cells with siRNA against Fyn, but not Src (Fig. 5C). These results strongly suggest that Fyn is the specific Src family member that is required for EGCG-stimulated activation of eNOS and production of NO in endothelial cells. EGCG-stimulated Phosphorylation of eNOS Requires Production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)—H2O2 is an important mediator of intracellular signaling initiated by cell surface receptors (16Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 21Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X.

Moreover, H2O2 is capable of stimulating activation of Akt through a Src family kinase-dependent mechanism in some cell types (24Esposito F. Chirico G. Montesano Gesualdi N. Posadas I. Ammendola R. Russo T. Cirino G. Cimino F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20828-20834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined whether H2O2 plays a role in EGCG-stimulated activation of eNOS in endothelial cells. BAEC loaded with the H2O2-specific fluorescent dye CM-H2DCF-DA were treated with EGCG (50 μm) for 0-15 min. We observed green fluorescence in the cells indicative of H2O2 production that increased from 5 to 15 min after EGCG treatment (Fig. 6A). Increases in intracellular H2O2 in response to treatment of BAEC with either EGCG or H2O2 were abrogated by pre-treatment of cells with the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 6B). Under similar conditions, increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Fyn at Tyr418 (a proxy for Fyn activation) in response to EGCG stimulation was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 6C). Likewise, increased phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS in response to EGCG stimulation was significantly inhibited by pre-treatment of cells with N-acetylcysteine (Fig. 6D). However, N-acetylcysteine treatment did not substantially affect insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt or eNOS (Fig. 6E). These results suggest that EGCG-stimulated production of ROS (including H2O2) in endothelial cells is a part of the intracellular signaling cascade upstream from PI 3-kinase distinct from insulin signaling. Exploration of Putative Upstream Mediators of EGCG Action—The laminin receptor has been implicated as a specific cellsurface receptor for EGCG that mediates some of its biological actions (25Tachibana H. Koga K. Fujimura Y. Yamada K. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 26Fujimura Y. Yamada K. Tachibana H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 674-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). When we overexpressed or reduced expression of laminin receptors in endothelial cells we did not observe any significant effects to alter EGCG-mediated phosphorylation of Akt or eNOS (data not shown). Thus, it seems unlikely that the laminin receptor is mediating vasodilator actions of EGCG in endothelial cells. Because EGCG mimics some vascular actions of insulin (Figs. 1, 2 and 3), we also evaluated the possibility that EGCG may be transactivating the insulin receptor. When we treated BAEC with insulin or EGCG, we only observed tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor in response to insulin, but not EGCG (Fig. 7A). Therefore, it is unlikely that EGCGstimulated production of NO is mediated by transactivation of the insulin receptor. Similarly, to help rule out the possibility that vasodilator actions of EGCG are mediated by the VEGF receptor, we treated BAEC without or with EGCG or VEGF in the absence or presence of the VEGF receptor inhibitor VTI (Fig. 7B). Although both EGCG and VEGF stimulated phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, only the effects of VEGF, but not EGCG, were inhibited by VTI. Thus, EGCG-stimulated production of NO is unlikely to be mediated by transactivation of the VEGF receptor. Metabolic diseases including diabetes and obesity often cluster together with cardiovascular diseases including hypertension and coronary heart disease in a metabolic syndrome that is characterized by both insulin re"

These findings may contribute to further development in cell therapy of heart failure. Loss of cardiomyocytes due to myocardial infarction or hereditary cardiomyopathies may represent causative factors in the progression toward heart failure. In mice, bone marrow-derived stem cells have been found to enhance functional recovery in infarcted hearts (1Orlic D. Kajstura J. Chimenti S. Jakoniuk I. Anderson S.M. Li B. Pickel J. McKay R.

These observations triggered the launch of numerous clinical studies to assess the effect of bone marrow cell injection into human infarcted hearts. However, the initial observations and the scientific underpinning of the human trials have been challenged by a number of studies using mouse bone marrow hematopoietic cells expressing LacZ or green fluorescent protein to enable detection in recipient hearts. In these studies little or no reporter activity could be seen after direct stem cell injection into the damaged heart or continuous cell transfusion into the bloodstream of infarcted mice (3Balsam L.B.

Here, we investigated whether HBR may commit BMhMSCs, DPhMSCs, or FMhMSCs into cardiovascular lineages and/or enhance their potential as trophic mediators and whether, in the affirmative, transplantation of HBR-pretreated hMSCs into infarcted rat hearts may result in enhanced cardiovascular repair.MATERIALS AND METHODSPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS), Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from BioWhittaker Cambrex (Walkersville, MD).

Ficoll-Histopaque, penicillin, streptomycin, amphotericin B, α-sarcomeric actinin primary antibody (clone EA.53), and all the other chemicals were from Sigma.Synthesis of HBR—The glycoconjugate HBR is an ester between the hydroxyl groups of hyaluronan (HA) and the carboxyl groups of both butyric acid (BU) and retinoic acid (RA). The procedure for the synthesis and characterization of HBR and the related chemical structure are reported in detail elsewhere (20Ventura C. Maioli M. Asara Y. Santoni D. Scarlata I. Cantoni S. Perbellini A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23574-23579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The primary hydroxyl group in position 6 of the N-acetyl-d-glucosamine residues in the polysaccharide backbone is the most reactive toward esterification. The degree of substitution (DS) was considered as the number of the esterified OH groups for each repeating unit of hyaluronic acid (Glc-NAc-GlcUA dimer). All the synthesized HBR exhibited a DS with BU (DSBU) ranging between 0.05 and 1.5, whereas the DS with RA (DSRA) was between 0.002 and 0.1. The DSBU/DSRA ratio was at least 6. The average molecular mass of HBR, referred to as the average molecular mass of sodium hyaluronate, was determined by high performance size-exclusion chromatography and ranged between 10,000 and 30,000 daltons (20Ventura C. Maioli M. Asara Y. Santoni D. Scarlata I. Cantoni S. Perbellini A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23574-23579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the HBR used in the present study, DSBU and DSRA were 1.44 and 0.032, respectively.Cell Isolation—According to the policy approved by the local ethical committee, all tissue samples were obtained after informed consent.BMhMSCs—Bone marrow was collected from healthy volunteers in heparinized tubes, diluted 1:3 with PBS, and layered over a Ficoll-Histopaque gradient (1.077 g/ml). The low density mononuclear cells were washed twice in PBS, counted, and plated at 1 × 106/cm2 in culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics (200 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. After 1 week the non-adherent cells were removed by replacing the medium supplemented by 10% FBS. When the cultures were near confluence (after 2–3 weeks), the cells were detached by treatment with 0.08% trypsin, EDTA (Sigma) and maintained and subcultured for up to 6–7 passages.DPhMSCs—Vital human molars were obtained from adult subjects during a routine dental extraction. The tooth was immersed in physiological solution containing antibiotics to eliminate any contamination by the germs present in the oral cavity. Soon after extraction, the dental crown was fractured in several parts by means of pliers (bone forceps) under sterile conditions, and the pulp was uncovered. The tissue fragments were suspended in DMEM in the presence of 25% FBS, antibiotics (200 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. This procedure was followed by incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2, allowing cells to slip down from the explants and expand up to confluence. The cell layer was removed by enzymatic digestion (0.08% trypsin, EDTA) at 37 °C and further expanded in DMEM containing 10% FBS and antibiotics.FMhMSCs—Term placenta obtained from caesarian sections were rapidly rinsed in PBS containing penicillin and streptomycin and used immediately. Pieces from fetal membranes were minced and digested for 10 min in DMEM with 0.25% trypsin, EDTA, 10 units/ml DNase I, and 0.1% collagenase. Tissues were pipetted vigorously up and down, avoiding foam for 5 min; larger pieces of tissue were allowed to settle under gravity for 5 min. Each supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, neutralized with FBS, then spun at 1500 rpm for 10 min. Each pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of DMEM containing 20% FBS, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. FMhMSCs were seeded into 25-cm2 flasks and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Non-adherent cells were removed after 1 week, and medium (with 10% FBS) was changed subsequently every 4 days.Flow Cytometry Analysis—The fibroblast-like cells obtained from bone marrow, dental pulp, and fetal membrane cultures at the same doubling passage were harvested by treatment with 0.08% trypsin, EDTA and incubated with 1 μg/106 cells of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies for 40 min at 4 °C in the dark. The antibodies used were SH2, SH3, SH4, anti-CD166, anti-CD14, anti-CD34, anti-CD44, and anti-CD45. After washing, cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) by collecting 10,000 events, and the data were analyzed using the Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences). Flow cytometry analysis was also exploited to assess the percentage of BMhMSCs, DPhMSCs, and FMhMSCs expressing α-sarcomeric actinin. Cells were harvested by treatment with 0.08% trypsin, EDTA. After a fixation/permeabilization step, hMSCs were incubated with a primary antibody directed against α-sarcomeric actinin (1 μg/106 cells) for 1 h at 4 °C and with 1 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. After washing, cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer (FACSAria, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) by collecting 10,000 events, and the data were analyzed using the FACS Diva software (BD Biosciences).Gene Expression—Total RNA was isolated by the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. For RT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized in a 21-μl reaction volume with 2 μg of total RNA and SuperScript II RT. To assess GATA-4 and Nkx-2.5, 0.2 μg of cDNA were used for real-time RT-PCR performed with a Lightcycler system (Roche Diagnostics) and with the SYBR Green fast start kit (Lightcycler® FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I). Primers used in real-time RT-PCR were as follows: GATA-4 forward 5′-TGGCCTGTCATCTCACTACG-3′ and reverse 5′-TAGCCTTGTGGGGAGAGCTT-3′; Nkx-2.5 forward 5′-CAAGTGTGCGTCTGCCTTT-3′ and reverse 5′-GCGCACAGCTCTTTCTTTTC-3′; VEGF forward 5′-AGAAGGAGGAGGGCAGAATC-3′ and reverse 5′-ACACAGGATGGCTTGAAGATG-3′; KDR forward 5′-CTGCAAATTTGGAAACCTGTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GAGCTCTGGCTACTGGTGATG-3′; HGF forward 5′-ATTTGGCCATGAATTTGACCT-3′ and reverse 5′-ACTCCAGGGCTGACATTTGAT-3′; GAPDH forward 5′-CAGCCTCAAGATCATCAGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCA-3′. The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 4 μl of Master SYBR Green I mix (TaqDNA polymerase, buffer, deoxynucleoside trisphosphate mix, MgCl2, and SYBR Green I dye) and 0.5 μm concentrations of each primer to which 2 μl of cDNA was added. Data were normalized using GAPDH as an index of cDNA content after reverse transcription. Amplification included initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 55–65 °C for 6–10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 10 s, performed at a temperature transition rate of 20 °C/s. Fluorescence was measured at the end of each extension step. Specificity of the product was determined by a melting curve analysis, conducted after completion of the cycling process with the aid of a temperature ramp (from 55–95 °C at 0.1 °C/s) and continuous fluorescence monitoring, confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Samples were run in duplicate, and the average threshold cycle (Ct) value was used for calculations. Relative quantification of mRNA expression was calculated with the comparative Ct method using the “Delta-delta method” for comparing relative expression results between treatments in real time PCR (21Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (24904) Google Scholar).MyoD mRNA was determined by conventional RT-PCR using AmpliTaq under the following conditions; hot start for 10 min at 95 °C, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 56 °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Primers were: forward 5′-CGACGGCATGATGGACTAC-3′ and reverse 5′-AGGCAGTCTAGGCTCGACAC-3′.Isolation of Stem Cell Nuclei and Nuclear Run-off Transcription Assay—Isolation of nuclei and assessment of nuclear purity were performed as detailed elsewhere (20Ventura C. Maioli M. Asara Y. Santoni D. Scarlata I. Cantoni S. Perbellini A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23574-23579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Only freshly isolated nuclei were used in each experiment. Nuclear run-off experiments were carried out as previously described (20Ventura C. Maioli M. Asara Y. Santoni D. Scarlata I. Cantoni S. Perbellini A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23574-23579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear RNA was isolated by using guanidine thiocyanate and acid phenol extraction followed by purification on RNAMATRIX™. Equal counts of 32P-labeled RNA (about 5·106 cpm) were then subjected to a solution hybridization RNase protection assay and were hybridized for 12 h at 55 °C in the presence of unlabeled antisense GATA-4, Nkx-2.5, HGF, and GAPDH mRNA. To generate these cRNA probes, cDNA fragments of human GATA-4 (237 bp), Nkx-2.5 (245 bp), HGF (177 bp), or GAPDH (574 bp) genes were inserted into a pCRII-TOPO vector. Transcription of plasmids linearized with BamHI generated antisense strands of Nkx-2.5 and GAPDH mRNA, whereas transcription of plasmids linearized with XbaI produced an antisense strand of GATA-4 and HGF mRNA. Samples were then incubated with a combination of RNase A and T1 and exposed to proteinase K. The protected fragments were recovered after phenol chloroform extraction and electrophoretically separated in a polyacrylamide non-denaturing gel. Autoradiographic exposure was for 48 h.Assay for Angiogenic and Growth Factors—To investigate whether cell exposure to HBR may affect the production of angiogenic, antiapoptotic, and mitogenic factors, hMSCs were cultured for 14 days in the absence or presence of 2 mg/ml HBR. Then the levels of VEGF and HGF were measured in conditioned medium at defined time intervals by enzyme immunoassay (Quantikine human VEGF and HGF immunoassays, R&D Systems, Inc.).Immunostaining—Immunofluorescence analyses were performed as previously described (22Ventura C. Zinellu E. Maninchedda E. Fadda M. Maioli M. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. After fixation, cells were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 15 min. Aspecific antibody binding sites were blocked by incubating with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C. Then cells were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against MHC (MF20), α-sarcomeric actinin, Cx43, and vWF. Excess primary antibody was removed by 3 washes with PBS, and the cells were stained at 37 °C for 1 h with fluorescein-conjugated goat IgG. Microscopy was performed with a Bio-Rad Microradians confocal microscope.Myocardial Infarction, Stem Cell Implantation, and Functional Evaluation of Myocardial Performance—Protocols were approved by an institutional review board. Myocardial infarction was produced in male Wistar rats at 2 months of age, according to previously described protocols (23Pfeffer M.A. Pfeffer J.M. Fishbein M.C. Fletcher P.J. Spadaro J. Kloner R.A. Braunwald E. Circ. Res. 1979; 44: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). Briefly, under ether anesthesia, the thorax was opened through a thoracotomy performed at the fourth left intercostal space, the heart was rapidly exposed and the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated with 6-0 mononylon thread during continuous subcutaneous electrocardiographic monitoring for ST changes and arrhythmias. After left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion, 1 × 106 culture-expanded hMSCs resuspended in 100 μl of sterile saline solution (PBS) were injected into the viable myocardium bordering the infarct using an insulin syringe with a 30-gauge needle. The ischemic zone was identified by the pale color of the myocardium. Infarcted rats that were injected with 100 μl of PBS, and sham-operated rats in which left anterior descending coronary artery was not occluded were used as controls. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed before thoracotomy and 28 days thereafter in sedated rats with an Esaote Megas equipped with a 7.5-MHz linear transducer. Short and long axis two-dimensional views and M-mode at the level of infarction were analyzed in real-time and recorded on a magnetooptic disk for off-line analysis. Anterior and posterior end-diastolic and endsystolic wall thicknesses and left ventricular (LV) internal dimensions were measured, as recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography (24Sahn D.J. DeMaria A. Kisslo J. Weyman A. Circulation. 1978; 58: 1072-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (7151) Google Scholar, 25Schiller N.B. Shah P.M. Crawford M. DeMaria A. Devereux R. Feigenbaum H. Gutgesell H. Reicheck N. Sahn D. Schnittger I. Silverman N.H. Tajik A.J. J. Am. Soc. Echocardiogr. 1989; 2: 358-367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Systolic ventricular function and global contractility were quantified such as fractional shortening (%) and ejection fraction (%). Fractional shortening was calculated from the composite LV internal, diastolic and LV internal, systolic dimensions from M-mode short-axis views. LV ejection fraction and cardiac output were calculated from a long-axis view.Tissue Immunohistochemistry—Hearts were arrested in diastole and fixed as described (26Kajstura J. Rota M. Whang B. Cascapera S. Hosoda T. Bearzi C. Nurzynska D. Kasahara H. Zias E. Bonafe M. Nadal-Ginard B. Torella D. Nascimbene A. Quaini F. Urbanek K. Leri A. Anversa P. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and then cut into 5-μm sections; the sections were used for immunohistochemical studies to localize the human transplanted cells using the antibodies against human mitochondria protein (27Reubinoff B.E.

Angoulvant D. Wnendt S. Muhs A. Spitkovsky D. Li R.K. Circulation. 2005; 112: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cardiac lineage-committed cells were identified by antibodies directed against Cx43 and TnI. Endothelial lineage-committed cells were identified with an antibody directed against human vWF. Briefly, the sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by a 10-min incubation at room temperature with absolute methanol containing 3% H2O2. Antigen retrieval was performed by immersion of the slides in a jar containing citrate buffer (pH 6) and treatment at 120 °C, 1 atm, for 21 min. After cooling and washing, the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a moist chamber with the antibodies against human mitochondria (1:100, Chemicon), vWF (1:50, Dako Cytomation), Cx43 (1:200, Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and TnI (1:400, Covance). Monoclonal antibody tissue labeling was revealed by using a non-biotin polymeric system (Super Sensitive Polymer HRP IHC Detection Systems; Biogenex, San Ramon, CA). After washing, the slides were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with Super Enhancer reagent, washed in PBS, and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature with super sensitive horseradish peroxidase polymeric complexes. Then the slides were incubated with diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride peroxidase substrate solutions, rinsed in distilled water, and then counterstained with hematoxyline. The samples were dehydrated, mounted, and viewed in a light microscope using the Image Pro Plus®. To demonstrate that the same transplanted human cells were also positive for Cx43 or TnI, we performed a double immunofluorescent staining. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were dewaxed in xylene and then rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. To recover tissue antigenicity, the slides were immersed in citrate buffer (pH 6) and treated at 120 °C, 1 atm, for 21 min. After cooling and washing, the samples were incubated in a blocking solution containing 2% rabbit serum and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room"
https://openalex.org/W2056137624,"The phase transition of Bose-Einstein condensation was studied in the critical regime, where fluctuations extend far beyond the length scale of thermal de Broglie waves. We used matter-wave interference to measure the correlation length of these critical fluctuations as a function of temperature. Observations of the diverging behavior of the correlation length above the critical temperature enabled us to determine the critical exponent of the correlation length for a trapped, weakly interacting Bose gas to be ν = 0.67 ± 0.13. This measurement has direct implications for the understanding of second-order phase transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2050894301,"The current-induced motion of magnetic domain walls confined to nanostructures is of interest for applications in magnetoelectronic devices in which the domain wall serves as the logic gate or memory element. The injection of spin-polarized current below a threshold value through a domain wall confined to a pinning potential results in its precessional motion within the potential well. We show that by using a short train of current pulses, whose length and spacing are tuned to this precession frequency, the domain wall's oscillations can be resonantly amplified. This makes possible the motion of domain walls with much reduced currents, more than five times smaller than in the absence of resonant amplification."

https://openalex.org/W2040024224,"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is a potent inducer of angiogenesis. We now show that VEGF-A-induced adhesion and migration of human endothelial cells are dependent on the integrin α9β1 and that VEGF-A is a direct ligand for this integrin. Adhesion and migration of these cells on the 165 and 121 isoforms of VEGF-A depend on cooperative input from α9β1 and the cognate receptor for VEGF-A, VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2). Unlike α3β1or αvβ3 integrins, α9β1 was also found to bind the 121 isoform of VEGF-A. This interaction appears to be biologically significant, because α9β1-blocking antibody dramatically and specifically inhibited angiogenesis induced by VEGF-A165 or -121.

Following activation by their respective ligands, integrins can also modulate these cell functions through coordinated cross-talk with growth factor receptors, including VEGF receptors (14Zhang X.

Indirect evidence suggests that inhibition of another β1 integrin, α3β1, can inhibit cell adhesion to VEGF-A, suggesting that VEGF-A could serve as an α3 ligand (18Hutchings H. Ortega N. Plouet J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1520-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the integrin α9β1 directly binds to the growth factors, VEGF-C and -D (19Vlahakis N.E. Young B.A. Atakilit A. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4544-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), a finding that may help explain the abnormal lymphatic phenotype of mice expressing a null mutation of the α9 subunit. Because the VEGF homology domain of VEGF-C and -D shares 40% homology with VEGF-A, we hypothesized that VEGF-A might also be a ligand for α9β1 and could potentially modulate VEGF-A-induced angiogenesis.VEGF-A can be synthesized in a variety of forms based on alternative splicing. A previous study has shown that the integrins α3β1 and αvβ3 specifically modulate cellular interactions with the 165-kDa form of VEGF-A but not the 121-kDa form (18Hutchings H. Ortega N. Plouet J.

These results suggest that any association between these integrins and VEGF-A likely does not involve interaction with sequences encoded by exon 6. To determine whether interactions between α9β1 and VEGF-A involved similar sites in VEGF-A, we incorporated both splice variants into our studies.Here we report that α9β1 does bind directly to VEGF-A and does cooperate with VEGF-R2 to modulate in vitro endothelial cell adhesion and migration on both VEGF-A165 and VEGF-A121. We also show that VEGF-A (but not bFGF)-induced angiogenesis in chick CAMs can be inhibited by antibody to α9β1, suggesting that this interaction could have in vivo relevance.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Human VEGF-A165, VEGF-A121, bFGF, and phycoerythin-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody to VEGF-R2 were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Primary adult human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC, Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) were grown in cell-specific growth factor-supplemented nutrient media (Cambrex, EBM-2).Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blot Analysis—For immunoprecipitation of VEGF-R2, HMVEC were grown in 6-well plates with full growth media until 70% confluent and subsequently in basal media with 0.1% BSA for 4 h. Cells were then added to 12-well dishes coated with VEGF-A (23Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Higashiyama S. Murakami I. Obara M. Yamakido M. Shigeto N. Chen J. Sheppard D. J. Biol.

Cells were exposed to VEGF-A or medium alone for 5-30 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline/sodium orthovanadate (NaV 10 mm), and then lysed with buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaV, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Pre-cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibody bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, boiled, resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was blocked in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then probed with anti-VEGF-R2 antibody.For immunoblotting of paxillin pY31, ERKTpY185/187, 4G10, and β-actin, proteins were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on 4 -15% gradient SDS-PAGE, before transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween, probed with the appropriate specific primary antibodies, washed three times with TBST, and subsequently probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Flow Cytometry—Cultured cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies and then appropriate phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody. Phycoerythin-conjugated VEGF-R2 was used to detect VEGF-R2. Fluorescence of labeled cells was determined with a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).Adhesion Assay—Assays were performed as described previously (19Vlahakis N.E. Young B.A. Atakilit A. Sheppard D. J.

After coating 96-well microtiter plates (ICN, Linbro/Titertek, Aurora, OH) with VEGF-A at 4 °C overnight, wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. After trypsinization, cells were incubated with or without relevant antibodies (20 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice, and 5 × 104 cells/well were seeded. Adherent cells were fixed and stained with 1% formaldehyde, 0.5% crystal violet, 20% methanol for 30 min, and the number of adherent cells was evaluated by measuring absorbance at 595 nm in a microplate reader (SpectraMax 190, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).Migration Assay—Assays were performed as described previously (19Vlahakis N.E.

Recombinant VEGF-A (5 μg/ml) was coated on 96-well microtiter plates (Nunc ImmunoPlate, Naperville, IL), and purified α9β1or αvβ6 at various concentrations was added for 2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of α9 blocking antibody or 10 mm EDTA. The extent of α9β1 binding was detected using A9A1 antibody (20 μg/ml, 1 h at 37 °C). Following labeling with horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences), binding was quantified by measuring absorbance at 450 nm with a microplate reader (Molecular Devices).CAM Assay—Chick eggs were maintained in a humidified 39 °C incubator (Lyon Electric, Chula Vista, CA). Pellets containing 0.5% methylcellulose plus recombinant human VEGF-A (50 ng) or bFGF (150 ng) were placed onto the CAM of 10-day-old chick pathogen-free embryos (SPAFAS; Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA). The CAMs were exposed by cutting a small window in the egg shell to facilitate application of the pellet. Relevant antibodies or agonist/antagonist compounds were applied to the site 24 h after stimulation with VEGF protein. CAMs were imaged on day 13, both following fixation and excision or with real time live imaging, using a digital camera (Canon Supershot6) attached to a Zeiss stereomicroscope. Angiogenesis was quantified by counting branch points arising from tertiary vessels from a minimum of 10 specimens from three separate experiments.Statistical Methods—Data are presented as mean values ± S.D. from at least three separate experiments unless otherwise stated.RESULTSIntegrin α9β1 Mediates Cell Adhesion and Migration on VEGF-A—To determine whether cells use integrin α9β1to adhere to VEGF-A, adhesion assays were performed using two different cell lines, α9- and mock-transfected MEF and SW-480 cells (Fig. 1). Flow cytometry with the anti-α9β1 antibody, Y9A2, showed robust expression of α9β1inthe α9-transfected cell types and no expression in mock transfectants (Fig. 1, A and C). α9-Transfected MEF demonstrated concentration-dependent adhesion to VEGF-A (Fig. 1B) that was abolished by the α9β1 blocking antibody Y9A2. In contrast, mock-transfected MEF did not adhere to VEGF-A above background levels of attachment to BSA-coated wells. Because cells have also been shown to adhere to VEGF-A in an α3β1 integrin-dependent manner, we performed assays in a second α9-transfected cell line (SW-480) known to express α3β1 (Fig. 1C). α9β1-dependent adhesion on VEGF-A was also demonstrated in these cells. In mock-transfected cells, blocking α3β1 inhibited cell adhesion, whereas blockade of α9β1 or VEGF-R2, neither of which are expressed in these cells, had no effect (Fig. 1D). In α9, compared with mock-transfected cells, adhesion to VEGF-A in the absence of blocking antibodies was substantially enhanced, as demonstrated by higher absorbance values. In these cells, blockade of α9β1 caused substantial inhibition of adhesion, whereas blocking antibody to α3β1 had no detectable effect (Fig. 1E), perhaps because α9β1 was expressed at substantially higher levels than α3β1 (Fig. 1C). Because these transfected cells do not express VEGF-R2, the cognate receptor for VEGF (25Witmer A.N. Dai J. Weich H.A. Vrensen G.F. Schlingemann R.O. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Jussila L. Alitalo K. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 673-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), these findings suggest that α9β1 might interact directly with VEGF-A.To confirm these findings in a physiologically relevant cell type, separate experiments were performed using HMVEC that express both VEGF-R2 and α9β1 (Fig.2A). Concentration-dependent adhesion of HMVEC to VEGF-A165 was inhibited by antibody to α9β1 (Fig. 2B). Because α3β1 and αvβ3 also interact with VEGF-A (18Hutchings H. Ortega N. Plouet J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1520-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we performed adhesion assays using HMVEC expressing these two integrins and α9β1 (Fig. 2, A and C) in the presence of blocking antibodies to each of the three integrins. Fig. 2D shows that inhibition of any single integrin inhibited adhesion of these cells to VEGF-A, with nearly complete inhibition caused by antibodies to α9β1or αvβ3 and partial inhibition with antibody to α3β1. This was not because of artifactual effects of antibody binding to integrins on these cells, because a nonblocking antibody to α9β1 had no effect.FIGURE 2Endothelial cell adhesion and migration on VEGF-A are α9β1-dependent.

In contrast, the irrelevant integrin, αvβ6, showed no binding to VEGF-A.FIGURE 3VEGF-A165 and -121 isoforms bind directly to integrin α9β1.

In contrast to VEGF-A165, which is missing exon 6, the 121 isoform is missing both exons 6 and 7 (Fig. 3B). Mock-transfected SW-480 cells, which express α3β1 but not α9β1 or VEGF-R2, adhered to VEGF-A121, and this binding was unaffected by antibody to α3β1, confirming previous reports (18Hutchings H. Ortega N. Plouet J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1520-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) that α3β1 specifically mediates adhesion to the 165-kDa splice variant (Fig. 3C, top panel). In contrast, α9-transfected SW-480 cells, which also demonstrated increased adhesion to VEGF-A121, was specifically inhibited by antibody to α9β1 (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). Fig. 3D shows that in physiologically relevant HMVEC, cell adhesion to either VEGF-A165 or -121 isoform was partially α9-dependent.To investigate the relative role of α9β1, α3β1, and αvβ3 integrins in cell migration, we performed HMVEC migration assays on either immobilized VEGF-A165 (Fig. 3E, top panel) or VEGF-A121 (Fig. 3E, bottom panel) in the absence or presence of inhibitory antibodies to either of the three integrins. Consistent with the specialized role of α9β1 in facilitating accelerated cell migration, inhibition of α9 resulted in the greatest reduction in cell migration on VEGF-A165. HMVEC migration on VEGF-A121 was also α9 integrin-dependent and, as expected, not dependent on integrins α3β1or αvβ3. Because VEGF-A121 and VEGF-A165 are physiologically active in a soluble form, we tested whether soluble VEGF-A-induced cell migration was also α9β1-dependent. Fig. 3F (top and bottom panels) shows that both soluble VEGF-A165- and -121-induced endothelial cell migration was inhibited by α9β1 blocking antibody. As for responses to immobilized VEGFA isoforms, inhibition of α3β1 or αvβ3 integrins decreased migration induced by VEGF-A165 (Fig. 3F, top panel) but not VEGF-A121 (bottom panel).These findings taken together with our previous report showing that the homologous proteins VEGF-C and -D also bind to α9β1 (19Vlahakis N.E. Young B.A. Atakilit A. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4544-4552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) suggest that the α9β1 binding domain resides within the VEGF homology domain (exons 1-5). However, a binding site in exon 8, which is present in both VEGF165 and VEGF121, cannot be excluded.α9β1 and VEGF-R2 Act Coordinately to Mediate Endothelial Cell Adhesion and Migration—To assess the relative contribution of VEGF-R2 and α9β1 to HMVEC adhesion and migration on VEGF-A, cells were treated with α9β1 blocking antibody and/or the VEGF-R2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU1498 (27Arbiser J.L.

Inhibition of either α9β1 or VEGF-R2 significantly decreased endothelial cell adhesion to VEGF-A165 (Fig. 4A), and the combination of both inhibitors caused maximal inhibition. Neither inhibitor affected adhesion to the irrelevant ligand, collagen (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of α9β1 or VEGF-R2 also decreased endothelial cell migration on VEGF-A (Fig. 4C), and again inhibition was maximal by the combination of both inhibitors. Inhibition of either α9β1 or VEGF-R2 also decreased endothelial cell migration in response to soluble VEGF-A165 or -121 (Fig. 4D), although in this case the effects of both inhibitors together were not different from the effects of each individual inhibitor. Taken together, these findings suggest that both α9β1 and VEGF-R2 are required for maximal cell adhesion and migration on immobilized VEGF-A and in response to soluble VEGF-A.FIGURE 4α9β1 and VEGF-R2 act coordinately to mediate cell adhesion and migration on VEGF-A.

In the absence of VEGF-A, tyrosine phosphorylation of each protein was minimal. When these cells were plated on immobilized VEGF-A, both ERK1/2 and paxillin (Fig. 5A, top panel) were phosphorylated maximally after 15 min. Phosphorylation of each protein was inhibited by α9β1 blocking antibody at all time points. Following HMVEC binding to immobilized VEGF-A, ERK and paxillin phosphorylation was also inhibited by the VEGF-R2 kinase inhibitor (Fig. 5B). When cells were exposed to soluble VEGF-A (Fig. 5C), paxillin was maximally phosphorylated after 5 min, an effect that was inhibited by either blocking α9β1 or VEGF-R2. However, ERK phosphorylation in response to soluble VEGF-A was not affected by inhibition of α9β1 (data n"

To clarify the major traits controlling these intermingled biological events, we surveyed the genomic modifications occurring during the course of a scratch wound closure of cultured human keratinocytes. Using a DNA microarray approach, we report the identification of 161 new markers of epidermal repair. Expression data, combined with functional analysis performed with specific inhibitors of ERK, p38MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), demonstrate that kinase pathways exert very selective functions by precisely controlling the expression of specific genes. Inhibition of the ERK pathway totally blocks the wound closure and inactivates many early transcription factors and EGF-type growth factors. p38MAPK inhibition only delays “healing,” probably in line with the control of genes involved in the propagation of injury-initiated signaling. In contrast, PI3K inhibition accelerates the scratch closure and potentiates the scratch-dependent stimulation of three genes related to epithelial cell transformation, namely HAS3, HBEGF, and ETS1. Our results define in vitro human keratinocyte wound closure as a repair process resulting from a fine balance between positive signals controlled by ERK and p38MAPK and negative ones triggered by PI3K.

The perturbation of any of these pathways might lead to dysfunction in the healing process, similar to those observed in pathological wounding phenotypes, such as hypertrophic scars or keloids. Epidermal wound healing is a complex physiological process involving multiple cell features, such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation of the keratinocytes situated at the edge of the wound. All of these steps involve a well orchestrated regulation of multiple signaling pathways that control the expression of many genes endowed with diverse crucial functions (growth factors, cytokines, proteases, integrins, cell cycle genes, and extracellular matrix components). Disrupted expression of these molecules or of their signaling pathways can block or accelerate the healing process, thereby leading to chronic wounds or hypertrophic scars or keloids. Transgenic and knock out mice models have largely helped in defining some crucial genes involved in the wound healing response (1Grose R. Werner S. Methods Mol. Med. 2003; 78: 191-216PubMed Google Scholar), but the great majority of the genes involved in skin wound healing remain unidentified. Recently, several global expression studies using DNA microarrays have approached this question in such models and have brought interesting insights in terms of a genomic characterization of wound healing (2Feezor R.J.

Obvious structural differences between murine and human skin limit notably the generalization of such data to the wound healing features occurring in human tissues. Such a biological limitation has justified the development of new experimental approaches using human models. At present, only one transcriptomal study relative to human skin wound healing has been published (5Cole J. Tsou R. Wallace K. Gibran N. Isik F. Wound Repair Regen. 2001; 9: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although in vivo approaches are relevant to embrace globally what happens during skin wound healing, the complexity provided by the coexistence of many cell types makes difficult the identification of mechanisms specific to keratinocytes. This in vivo approach allowed the analysis of events occurring immediately after injury but was unable to address specific questions about later events affecting cell migration, proliferation, or differentiation. Numerous in vitro studies have addressed these questions, quantifying various parameters associated with reepithelialization. For instance, in vitro “wound healing” has been modeled by treating skin cells with soluble factors known to be secreted in vivo after injury, such as TNFα, 4The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NHK, normal human keratinocyte(s); ECM, extracellular matrix; TGF, transforming growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 4The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; NHK, normal human keratinocyte(s); ECM, extracellular matrix; TGF, transforming growth factor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. or by serum addition (6Banno T.

However, these procedures do not take into account either the putative signaling generated by the disruption of the extracellular matrix or the cell to cell interaction, which both play pivotal roles in the healing process. Recently, we have developed an original “wounding” device that creates continuous long scratches within cell cultures. This device increases the number of cells participating in the in vitro “wound” closure (up to 40-50% of the cell layer) when compared with the classical scratch models and allows the detection of a wide spectrum of molecular events stimulated in response to injury (8Turchi L. Chassot A.A. Rezzonico R. Yeow K. Loubat A. Ferrua B. Lenegrate G. Ortonne J.P. Ponzio G. J. Invest.

Interestingly, this system can generate at the same time shear stress signals and soluble derived factors. It thus represents a powerful tool to investigate the global alterations of gene expression occurring throughout the “healing” process of normal human keratinocytes (NHK) in culture. Combining a DNA microarray approach with our “wounding” device, we have 1) performed an accurate analysis of the global gene expression profile in cultured human keratinocytes after scratching, 2) identified molecular signatures of the response to injury, and 3) elucidated the molecular and functional contributions of the ERK, PI3K, and p38MAPK pathways during human keratinocyte wound healing. Cell Culture—Human keratinocytes were isolated from healthy neonatal foreskin as described (10Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Cell. 1975; 6: 331-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3836) Google Scholar). Cell culture keratinocytes were seeded on γ-irradiated 3T3-J2 fibroblast feeder layers (2 × 105 cells/cm2) and grown in Green’s medium (2/3 Dulbecco’s minimal Eagle’s medium, 1/3 Ham’s F-12 medium, 20 mm HEPES, 1000 units/ml penicillin, 1000 units/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.4 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 10 μm cholera toxin, 10 μm recombinant human EGF, 2 μm triiodothyronine, and 18 μm adenine. Antibodies and Western Blotting—Antibodies against phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2, ATF, and AKT were from Cell Signaling Technology and were used at a 1:6000 dilution. After migration on PAGE and transfer onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), the specific proteins were revealed using the Millipore ECL detection system. Scratching Protocol—The cell scratching was performed using a “scarificator,” previously described by Turchi et al. (8Turchi L. Chassot A.A. Rezzonico R. Yeow K. Loubat A. Ferrua B. Lenegrate G. Ortonne J.P. Ponzio G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 56-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In classical conditions, 40-50% of the cell culture was scratched, the width between the “wound edges” being about 300-400 μm. The cultures were stopped by washing with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by a quick freezing to -80 °C, at different times after wounding (1, 3, 6, 15, and 24 h). For each time of the kinetic series, nonscratched cells were used as controls. In experiments performed with U0126, SB203580, and LY294002, the inhibitors were preincubated with the cells, 1 h before scratching at a respective concentration of 10, 20, and 15 μm. RNA Extraction—5-10 × 106 cells were quickly homogenized in 10 ml of a 4 m guanidium thiocyanate solution, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 100 mm 2β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% N-laurylsarcosine, followed by the addition of 1 ml of 2 m sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 8 ml of freshly water-equilibrated phenol, and 2 ml of chloroform. After 15 min on ice, samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 7500 × g. The RNA of the upper aqueous phase was precipitated with one volume of isopropyl alcohol. The sample was incubated 1 h on ice, after which the RNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 7500 × g. The pellet was washed twice with 70% ethanol and then resuspended in RNase-free water. cDNA Microarrays—The DNA microarray analysis concerning the identification of the genes altered in response to cell scratching was performed on three independent experiments, derived from three distinct cell cultures. Results were generated after two independent microarray analyses, meaning that each time point was the result of six independent analyses. The data relative to the effect of U0126, SB203580, and LY294002 on the transcriptomal healing response were obtained from two independent experiments performed using two distinct cell cultures. Results were generated after two independent microarray analyses. The cDNA microarray contained 4200 distinct cDNA probes. It has been previously described in Moreilhon et al. (11Moreilhon C. Gras D. Hologne C. Bajolet O. Cottrez F. Magnone V. Merten M. Groux H. Puchelle E. Barbry P. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 20: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Gene selection was based on relevance to inflammation, infection, differentiation, ion transport, cell signaling, cell migration, proliferation, etc. A large fraction of the probes also corresponded to transcripts encoding membrane proteins. The list of the 4200 probes is available on the World Wide Web at www.microarray.fr/IPMC/cDNA_microarray5k.html, and the microarray is archived in GEO under reference GSE1853. The cDNA probes were PCR-amplified from cDNA derived from Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) by reverse transcription. Probes had the following properties: 1) they have a normalized length of 250 ± 19 bp; 2) they have a normalized GC content of 52 ± 8%; 3) they were specific for a unique human gene; and 4) they were controlled by DNA sequencing. PCR products were purified by using a QIAquick 96 PCR purification kit (Qiagen), resuspended in 3SSC with an average spotting concentration of 200 ng/μl. Microarrays were printed with an SDDC-2 microarrayer (Bio-Rad) on homemade aldehyde-coated glass microscope slides. Data presented in the present work only refer to sequence-verified probes. Each PCR product was spotted four times on each slide (two independent clusters of two spots spatially separated) to reduce positional bias of the fluorescence readout. Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA, Postprocessing, and Hybridization—The CyDye-labeled first-strand cDNAs were generated with the CyScribe First-Strand cDNA labeling kit (RPN 2600; Amersham Biosciences), as described by Moreilhon et al. (11Moreilhon C. Gras D. Hologne C. Bajolet O. Cottrez F. Magnone V. Merten M. Groux H. Puchelle E. Barbry P. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 20: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), using 10 μg of total RNA as template. Unincorporated CyDye nucleotides were removed using the nucleotide removal kit (Qiagen). Data Collection and Analysis—Microarrays were scanned either on GenePix4000B or on a ScanArray5000 microarray scanner (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Both machines provided similar results (not shown). 16-bit TIF images were quantified with the corresponding software (GenePix Pro 5.0 program (Axon Instruments) for the GenePix and Quantarray for the ScanArray). Intensities (either total or background values) were defined as average intensities for each spot. Negative controls were spotted on each slide. They corresponded to nonmammalian mRNA sequences with no significant identity with any human sequences. Such spots were used as controls. Data were normalized using a dye swap method as described by Moreilhon et al. (11Moreilhon C. Gras D. Hologne C. Bajolet O. Cottrez F. Magnone V. Merten M. Groux H. Puchelle E. Barbry P. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 20: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We found that this method, although requiring duplication of experiments, improves the reproducibility of the quantification. Scratched and nonscratched RNA samples were reverse transcribed in the presence of known amounts of the corresponding nonmammalian “control” RNAs, namely DmdNaC and DGNaC (12Darboux I. Lingueglia E.

Lazdunski M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), added at a respective scratched/nonscratched ratio of 5 and 0.2. Only experiments showing a good correlation between the experimental and true ratios for these controls were kept for analysis. Results are expressed as average ratios of intensities in “scratched cells” over intensities in “nonscratched cells.” Data were then analyzed and/or visualized with MEV (14Saeed A.I. Sharov V. White J. Li J. Liang W. Bhagabati N. Braisted J. Klapa M. Currier T. Thiagarajan M. Sturn A. Snuffin M. Rezantsev A. Popov D. Ryltsov A. Kostukovich E. Borisovsky I. Liu Z. Vinsavich A. Trush V. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2003; 34: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (3944) Google Scholar), or with the stand alone program GeneANOVA (15Didier G. Brezellec P. Remy E. Henaut A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 490-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) Excel™ plug-in (16Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar). Lists of genes significantly down- and up-regulated under the different experimental conditions were selected by analysis of variance or using SAM. For the analysis of variance, the signal was modeled as proposed by Kerr and Churchill (17Kerr M.K. Churchill G.A. Biostatistics. 2001; 2: 183-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) according to Equation 1, Yijkg=μ+Ai+Dj+Tk+Gg+(TG)kg+(AG)ig+(DG)jg+ɛijkgEq. 1 where yijkg is the fluorescent intensity of array i and dye j representing treatment k and gene g. μ, Ai, Dj, Tk, and Gg are factors representing average signals among the whole experiment, one array, one dye, one treatment, or one gene, respectively. (TG)kg, (AG)ig, and (DG)jg are two-factor interactions between treatment and gene, array and gene (spot effects), and dye and gene, respectively. ɛijkg represents a residual noise component, modeled as a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance σ2. (TG)kg denotes differences in expression for particular treatment and gene combinations that are not explained by the average effects on these treatments and genes. They represent the effects of interest, which were modeled using GeneANOVA. SAM analysis was performed as described by Tusher et al. (16Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar). Ontologies attached to each gene were then used to classify altered genes according to main biological themes, as described in Ref. 18Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome. Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Annotation of our probes was also accessible through MEDIANTE, our own microarray data base (19Le Brigand K. Russell R. Moreilhon C. Rouillard J. Jost B. Amiot F. Magnone V. Bole-Feysot C. Rostagno P. Virolle V. Defamie V. Dessen P. Williams G. Lyons P. Rios G. Mari B. Gulari E. Kastner P. Gidrol X. Freeman T.C. Barbry P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which stores annotations derived from public data bases. Additional statistical analyses, including principal component analysis, were performed with GeneANOVA. The set of data is accessible in the GEO data base under the reference GSE6820. Quantitative Real Time One-step Reverse Transcription-PCR and Western Blot—RNAs were extracted as described above. mRNA expression levels were quantified by real time one-step reverse transcription-PCR using SYBR-Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The results are the average of three separate experiments. The oligonucleotide sequences corresponding to the different genes used for real time quantitative PCR are available upon request. Identification of the Transcriptomal Profile Associated with Keratinocyte Response to in Vitro Injury—This study was performed in order to identify genes from confluent NHK, the expression of which was altered after a mechanical scratching (i.e. an in vitro system used to recapitulate some aspects of skin wound reepithelialization). For that purpose, we used a device that creates calibrated long scratches, allowing a subsequent detection and quantification of overall molecular events (8Turchi L. Chassot A.A. Rezzonico R. Yeow K. Loubat A. Ferrua B. Lenegrate G. Ortonne J.P. Ponzio G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 56-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We observed that 5-6 h after scratching, cells began to migrate into the denuded space resulting from the tearing of the keratinocyte sheet. This space was totally filled after 25-30 h (not shown). Microarray Data Mining—To identify the genes accompanying the migration and proliferation of NHK in our scratch assay, we used a ∼4200 sequence-verified cDNA microarray, already described in Ref. 11Moreilhon C. Gras D. Hologne C. Bajolet O. Cottrez F. Magnone V. Merten M. Groux H. Puchelle E. Barbry P. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 20: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and further detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” NHK were scratched and harvested after 1, 3, 6, 15, and 24 h. Total RNAs were isolated and reverse transcribed into fluorescent cDNAs according to standard protocols (see “Experimental Procedures” for microarray procedures). Fig. 1 shows a typical MA plot (20Dudoit S. Speed T.P. Biostatistics. 2000; 1: 1-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of our experiments. It represents the ratio of scratched (S) cells and nonscratched (NS) signals according to the average intensity of the signal 6 h after scratching. Although the expression of most genes was not modified (M = 0), several probes were decidedly up- or down-regulated in a significant and reproducible way (corresponding to the points located over and below M = 0 in Fig. 1). Variation was corroborated by the use of exogenous nonhuman controls (namely DmDNAC and DgNaC). Their presence at defined concentrations in the RNA samples of nonscratched and scratched cells helped to validate each experiment (see “Experimental Procedures”). Since the results presented here correspond to experiments performed at least three times on three or more distinct cell cultures, selection of genes was performed using an analysis of variance as described by Didier et al. (15Didier G. Brezellec P. Remy E. Henaut A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 490-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cut-offs were defined as follows. The p value was chosen below 10-4, and statistical variance was above 40%. Significant transcripts were also identified using the SAM software, according to Ref. 16Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9648) Google Scholar. The cut-off for discriminating differential expression was set at 2 ± 0.75-fold for the up-regulated and down-regulated genes. These statistical analyses allowed us to select 118 up-regulated and 43 down-regulated genes during the healing time course in wounded cells (Fig. 2). An overview of the major gene pattern is summarized in Fig. 2. This analysis clearly revealed the existence of five clusters of transcripts, depending on their distinct time courses of variation. Cluster 1 included 34 transcripts associated with early genes. They were transiently altered between 0 and 3 h after injury. Cluster 2 (intermediary genes) included 19 transcripts, the expression of which was modified between 3 and 6 h after injury. Cluster 3 (late genes) included 56 transcripts that were altered between 6 and 24 h after injury. Cluster 4 (sustained) included 46 transcripts that were rapidly modified after “injury” but remained up-regulated or down-regulated for at least an additional 15 h. Finally, cluster 5 corresponded to three up-regulated transcripts exhibiting a “biphasic” pattern, with a first burst of stimulation between 1 and 3 h after injury, followed by a second burst after 15 h. To draw a clearer picture of the functional relevance of these genes, we used the Ease program (18Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome. Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to further classify the selected transcripts into seven functional families according to the biological properties of the proteins that they encode (Fig. 3). These seven families corresponded to the most significant families identified by the EASE algorithm. The F1 family grouped together the regulators of transcription; the F2 family grouped together signal transducers; the F3 family grouped together growth factors and cytokines; the F4 family grouped together transcripts associated with ECM component/remodeling and cell/cell interaction; the F5 family grouped together transcripts associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis; and the F6 family grouped together transcripts associated with metabolism and transport. The F7 family (“miscellaneous genes”) grouped together transcripts, the function of which remains unclear (Fig. 3). It is interesting to note some striking relationships between the five distinct clusters and the seven families. They are developed below. Transcription Factors and Signal Transducers—45% of the transcripts belonging to the “early genes” cluster also belonged to the transcription factor (F1) family. Most of them, such as ATF3, EGR1, JUN, JUNB, FOS, GATA3, ETS1, KLF10, TNFAIP3, ZFP36, and NR4A2, were early transient genes stimulated between 1 and 3 h after scratching. FOS, JUN, JUNB, EGR1, and ATF3 (Table 1) have previously been reported in wound healing studies (21Amendt C. Mann A. Schirmacher P. Blessing M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2189-2198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yates S. Rayner T.E. Wound Repair Regen. 2002; 10: 5-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Harper E.G. Alvares S.M. Carter W.G. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3471-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such observations validate our technical approach and suggest that it is relevant to dissect some aspects of wound healing. In addition, we also found the up-regulation of KLF6, KLF10, PRDM1, MXD1, IRF6, ZFP36, GATA3, NR4A2, and ETS1 transcription factors. The detection of the stress-responsive NR4A2 and ATF3 genes (24Lu D. Chen J. Hai T. Biochem. J. 2006; 401: 559-567Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) probably indicates that stress signals have effectively been delivered following the NHK sheet tearing. The stimulation of KLF10 (TIEG; TGFβ-induced early gene) a TGFβ-specific target, indicates that TGFβ is probably activated early after NHK scratching. This induction did not result from an increase of the TGFβ mRNA but most likely resulted from an activation of the latent TGFβ molecules associated with the ECM (25Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). One classical consequence of mechanical stress is to induce cell death. The stimulation of KLF10 is consistent with this model, since KFL10 is currently associated with the proapoptotic TGFβ signals in epithelial cells (26Chalaux E. Lopez-Rovira T. Rosa J.L. Pons G. Boxer L.M. Bartrons R. Ventura F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This observation implies that, in our model, TGFβ participates in the apoptotic program that accompanied NHK scratching. Stimulation of MXD1 (Mad1) was also noticed. This transcription factor is an antagonist of c-Myc and mediates, at least in part, the anti-mitotic and/or differentiation-inducing activities of TGFβ and activin in keratinocytes (27Werner S. Beer H.D. Mauch C. Luscher B. Werner S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7494-7504Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Its stimulation indicates that, besides their capability to induce apoptosis in response to stress signals, TGFβ family members also probably trigger “pure” antimitotic or differentiation signals intervening in proliferation arrest when cells attain confluence. Parallel to proapoptotic TGFβ signals, stimulation of the NF-κB pathway was noticed to occur rapidly after scratching. Due to well known antiapoptotic properties of NF-κB, it is tempting to speculate that NF-κB activation participates in the stress response by promoting the production of survival signals. These observations also indicate that pro- and antiapoptotic signals can be detected simultaneously immediately after injury. The fact that NHK maintain their ability to migrate and to proliferate a long time after scratching seems to indicate that antiapoptotic signals remain prominent during the whole process of scratch closure.TABLE 1List of the genes already reported in wound healingSymbolLocusLinkMolecular function (Ease)ReferenceV-EGF7422Growth factor activity49Werner S.

https://openalex.org/W2095124555,"Based on the prediction that histone lysine demethylases may contain the JmjC domain, we examined the methylation patterns of five knock-out strains (ecm5Δ, gis1Δ, rph1Δ, jhd1Δ, and jhd2Δ (yjr119cΔ)) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mass spectrometry (MS) analyses of histone H3 showed increased modifications in all mutants except ecm5Δ. High-resolution MS was used to unequivocally differentiate trimethylation from acetylation in various tryptic fragments. The relative abundance of specific fragments indicated that histones K36me3 and K4me3 accumulate in rph1Δ and jhd2Δ strains, respectively, whereas both histone K36me2 and K36me accumulate in gis1Δ and jhd1Δ strains. Analyses performed with strains overexpressing the JmjC proteins yielded changes in methylation patterns that were the reverse of those obtained in the complementary knock-out strains. In vitro enzymatic assays confirmed that the JmjC domain of Rph1 specifically demethylates K36me3 primarily and K36me2 secondarily. Overexpression of RPH1 generated a growth defect in response to UV irradiation. The demethylase activity of Rph1 is responsible for the phenotype. Collectively, in addition to Jhd1, our results identified three novel JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases and their sites of action in budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, the methodology described here will be useful for identifying histone demethylases and their target sites in other organisms."

The product kinetic energy distributions for the hydrogen atom elimination channels are bimodal, and the two peaks are readily assigned to propanoyl cation or hydroxyallyl cation coproducts. Ab initio multiple spawning dynamical calculations suggest that distinct ultrafast dynamics in the excited state deposit each conformer in isolated regions of the ground-state potential energy surface, and, from these distinct regions, conformer interconversion does not effectively compete with dissociation."

We have solved the 2.6 angstrom crystal structure of a ligase ribozyme that catalyzes regiospecific formation of a 5' to 3' phosphodiester bond between the 5'-triphosphate and the 3'-hydroxyl termini of two RNA fragments. Invariant residues form tertiary contacts that stabilize a flexible stem of the ribozyme at the ligation site, where an essential magnesium ion coordinates three phosphates. The structure of the active site permits us to suggest how transition-state stabilization and a general base may catalyze the ligation reaction required for prebiotic RNA assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2080756244,"Acetylation of lysine 56 of histone H3 (H3-Lys-56) occurs in S phase and disappears during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. However, it is not clear how this modification is regulated during the progression of the cell cycle. We and others have shown that the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) Rtt109 is the primary HAT responsible for acetylating H3-Lys-56 in budding yeast. Here we show that Rtt109 forms a complex with Vps75 and that both recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes and native complexes purified from yeast cells acetylate H3 present in H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones but not other histones. In addition, both recombinant and native Rtt109-Vps75 HAT complexes exhibited no detectable activity toward nucleosomal H3, suggesting that H3-Lys-56 acetylation is at least in part regulated by the inability of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to acetylate nucleosomal H3 during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Further, Rtt109 bound mutant H3/H4 tetramers composed of histones lacking their N-terminal tail domains less efficiently than wild-type H3/H4 tetramers, and Rtt109-Vps75 complexes displayed reduced HAT activity toward these mutant H3/H4 tetramers. Thus, the N termini of H3/H4 tetramers are required for efficient acetylation of H3 by the Rtt109-Vps75 complex.

Chromatin, Springer-Verlag, New York. 1989; Google Scholar, 2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6926) Google Scholar). In recent years, it has become clear that chromatin is dynamically regulated during the processes of transcription, DNA repair, and DNA replication (3Luger K. Chromosome Res. 2006; 14: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). One of the primary means of regulating chromatin structure and function is mediated by posttranslational modification of histones, including acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination (4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar, 6Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Histone acetylation plays an important role in transcription, DNA replication, nucleosome assembly, and DNA repair (7Roth S.Y. Allis C.D.

Trends Genet. 2003; 19: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). These diverse functions are likely to be carried out by distinct histone acetyltransferases (HATs) 2The abbreviations used are: HAT, histone acetyltransferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TAP, tandem affinity purification; CBB, Coomassie Brilliant Blue; NAP1, nucleosome assembly protein 1; INHAT, inhibitor of acetyltransferases; GST, glutathione S-transferase. that target different lysine residues on distinct histones. Although the acetylation of N-terminal lysine residues of histones H3/H4 is well known, lysine 56 of H3 (H3-Lys-56), a lysine residue in the core domain of H3, has only more recently been found to be acetylated (10Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 11Ozdemir A. Spicuglia S. Lasonder E. Vermeulen M. Campsteijn C. Stunnenberg H.G. Logie C. J.

Further, in contrast to the acetylated form remaining constant throughout the cell cycle as it does for most H3/H4 lysine residues, acetylation of H3-Lys-56 occurs in S phase and disappears during G2/M phase of the cell cycle (10Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Zhou H. Madden B.J. Muddiman D.C. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how H3-Lys-56 acetylation is restricted to S phase of the cell cycle. Two NAD-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs), Hst3 and Hst4, have been found to deacetylate H3-Lys-56 (15Maas N.L. Miller K.M. Defazio L.G. Toczyski D.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Celic I. Masumoto H. Griffith W.P. Meluh P. Cotter R.J. Boeke J.D. Verreault A. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1280-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of these two enzymes peaks at G2/M phase of the cell cycle when the levels of acetylated H3-Lys-56 are lowest, suggesting that H3-Lys-56 acetylation is regulated, at least in part, by the protein levels of H3-Lys-56 HDACs. Whether H3-Lys-56 HDACs are the only factors that regulate H3-Lys-56 acetylation during the progression of the cell cycle, however, is unknown. Recently, we and others have discovered that in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rtt109 is a unique HAT, sharing no sequence homology to any known HATs discovered so far, that acetylates H3-Lys-56 (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 18Driscoll R. Hudson A. Jackson S.P. Science. 2007; 315: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In vitro, recombinant Rtt109 and Rtt109 complexes purified from yeast cells acetylate H3 but not H4 in H3/H4 tetramers, suggesting that Rtt109 specifically targets H3. Cells lacking Rtt109 lose H3-Lys-56 acetylation and are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents to a similar degree as cells expressing H3 mutants unable to be acetylated at lysine 56. In addition, RTT109 genetically interacts with several genes involved in DNA replication as well as with genes involved in double strand break repair (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 19Tong A.H. Lesage G. Bader G.D. Ding H. Xu H. Xin X. Young J. Berriz G.F. Brost R.L. Chang M. Chen Y. Cheng X.

These genetic interactions suggest that H3-Lys-56 acetylation mediated by Rtt109 is involved in DNA replication. However, it is not known whether Rtt109 acetylates H2A and H2B, or H3 when H3 is assembled into nucleosomes. Thus, here we report further biochemical characterization of this novel HAT. Rtt109 co-purifies with Vps75, a previously uncharacterized protein, from yeast cells (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z.

Hughes T.R. Parkinson J. Gerstein M. Wodak S.J. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). We have reconstituted recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes, and these recombinant complexes display HAT activity toward H3. Moreover, both native Rtt109-Vps75 complexes purified from yeast cells and recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes purified from bacteria acetylate only H3, but not other histones, and do so only when H3 is not assembled into nucleosomes. These results suggest that the reduction of H3-Lys-56 acetylation during G2/M phase of the cell cycle is mediated, at least in part, by the inability of Rtt109 to acetylate nucleosomal H3. Furthermore, the N-terminal tail domains of H3/H4 tetramers were found to be required for efficient binding of Rtt109 to histones and H3-Lys-56 acetylation by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes. Thus, these studies provide insights into the substrate requirements of Rtt109 as well as the cell cycle regulation of H3-Lys-56 acetylation. Generation of rtt109Δ and vps75Δ Strains—The rtt109Δ deletion strain was generated as described (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Standard procedures were followed to delete the VPS75 gene through homologous recombination using the KanMX6 cassette. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed as described previously using antibodies that specifically recognize acetylated H3-Lys-56 (14Zhou H. Madden B.J. Muddiman D.C. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Purification of Rtt109-Vps75 Complexes from Yeast Cells—Whole-cell extracts were prepared using 2 liters of yeast cells expressing Rtt109 or Vps75 fused at the C terminus with the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag, and the proteins were purified as described (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant Histone H3/H4 Tetramers, H3/H4/H2A/H2B Core Histones, and Nucleosomes—Recombinant Drosophila H3/H4 tetramers were purified as described (23Levenstein M.E. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8749-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Sequences for generating the mutant “tailless” H3/H4 tetramers were from Xenopus laevis. The tailless H3 comprises amino acids 27–135, and the tailless H4 comprises amino acids 20–102 (24English C.M. Maluf N.K. Tripet B. Churchill M.E. Tyler J.K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13673-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The H3 and H4 mutants were expressed from the plasmid pST39GSTAsf1H3H4 (J. K. Tyler, University of Colorado, Aurora, CO) and purified following procedures similar to those used to purify full-length H3/H4 tetramers (23Levenstein M.E. Kadonaga J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8749-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones were purified from 293 cells using procedures described by Ausio and van Holde (25Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mononucleosomes and mixtures of mono- and dinucleosomes were purified from 6 liters of 293 cells using methods similar to those for purifying core histones (25Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), except that the hydroxyapatite chromatography step was not applied. Mononucleosomes were separated from other nucleosome species using sucrose gradient fractionation, and fractions containing predominantly mononucleosomes or mixed populations of mono- and dinucleosomes were pooled together (supplemental Fig. S4). Generation of Rtt109-Vps75 Complex Expression Constructs and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—GST-Rtt109 was cloned and expressed as described (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The VPS75 gene was cloned using genomic DNA as template for PCR. Since the VPS75 gene contains an intron, the DNA sequence corresponding to the intron was deleted using site-directed mutagenesis. Conventional chromatography methods for protein purification were used to purify Rtt109-Vps75 complexes. Assays for Histone Acetyltransferase Activity—The histone acetyltransferase activities of Rtt109-containing complexes were determined as described previously, with minor modifications (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h in 15-μl reaction mixtures that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% (w/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 6 pmol of [3H]acetyl-CoA (4.3 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). When indicated, 1 μg of recombinant Drosophila H3/H4 tetramers (dH3/H4), H2A/H2B dimers (H2A/H2B), H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones, tailless H3/H4 tetramers (sH3/H4), mononucleosomes, or mixed populations of mono- and dinucleosomes was added as substrate. One-half of each reaction mixture, 7.5 μl, was then spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper filters (Upstate Biotechnology) and air-dried. Paper filters were washed five times for 5 min each with 100 ml of 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.0, buffer and once with 50 ml of acetone. The radioactivity of air-dried filters was measured using a liquid scintillation counter. To detect which protein was acetylated, proteins from each reaction mixture were first resolved using 15% SDS-PAGE, and then gels were dried and exposed to films. To detect whether H3-Lys-56 was acetylated, samples were incubated with unlabeled acetyl-CoA at 30 °C for the indicated time periods, and Western blot analysis using antibodies that recognized H3 acetylated at lysine 56 was performed. GST Pull-down Assays—GST-Rtt109 (10 μg) or GST-REGα (10 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose was incubated with different amounts of H3/H4 tetramers in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 200 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C. After washing away unbound proteins, proteins bound to GST-Rtt109 or GST-REGα were eluted using 1× SDS sample buffer, resolved using SDS-PAGE, and revealed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) or Western blot analysis using antibodies against H3. DNA Damage Sensitivity Assays—Yeast strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in rich YPD medium and initially diluted to 6 × 106 cells/ml. Subsequently, cells were 10-fold serially diluted and spotted onto medium containing one of the indicated DNA-damaging agents: camptothecin (1 μg/ml), hydroxyurea (50 mm), or methylmethane sulfate (0.005%). To test for UV sensitivity, cells spotted onto YPD medium were irradiated by UV using a cross-linker. Vps75 Is a Component of the Rtt109 HAT Complex—Using a genome-wide screening technique in S. cerevisiae to identify proteins involved in acetylation of H3-Lys-56, we recently identified the unique HAT Rtt109 (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, we confirmed an observation made by others that Vps75, a previously uncharacterized protein, co-purifies with Rtt109 from yeast cells (22Krogan N.J. Cagney G. Yu H. Zhong G. Guo X. Ignatchenko A. Li J. Pu S. Datta N. Tikuisis A.P. Punna T. Peregrin-Alvarez J.M. Shales M. Zhang X. Davey M. Robinson M.D. Paccanaro A. Bray J.E. Sheung A. Beattie B. Richards D.P. Canadien V. Lalev A. Mena F. Wong P. Starostine A. Canete M.M. Vlasblom J. Wu S. Orsi C. Collins S.R. Chandran S. Haw R. Rilstone J.J. Gandi K. Thompson N.J. Musso G. St Onge P. Ghanny S. Lam M.H. Butland G. Altaf-Ul A.M. Kanaya S. Shilatifard A. O'Shea E. Weissman J.S. Ingles C.J. Hughes T.R. Parkinson J. Gerstein M. Wodak S.J. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Nature. 2006; 440: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar). Indeed, this Rtt109-Vps75 complex displays Rtt109-dependent HAT activity toward H3 (Fig. 1, A and B). However, the vps75Δ mutant was not among those identified in our genome-wide screen as affecting H3-Lys-56 acetylation (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), suggesting that Vps75 is not required for H3-Lys-56 acetylation in vivo. To test this idea, we deleted the VPS75 gene from yeast cells and analyzed H3-Lys-56 acetylation by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1C, H3-Lys-56 acetylation was not altered to a significant degree in the vps75Δ mutant cells as compared with wild-type cells. Furthermore, the vps75Δ mutant cells were not sensitive to DNA-damaging agents (supplemental Fig. S1), a phenotype displayed by cells with altered H3-Lys-56 acetylation (10Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, Vps75 is not required for H3-Lys-56 acetylation in yeast cells or for Rtt109 to acetylate H3-Lys-56 in vitro (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 18Driscoll R. Hudson A. Jackson S.P. Science. 2007; 315: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). As Vps75 is not required for H3-Lys-56 acetylation by Rtt109, possibly Vps75 is just a contaminating protein that co-purifies with Rtt109 and is not part of the Rtt109 HAT complex. To determine whether Vps75 directly forms a complex with Rtt109, we attempted to express and purify a recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complex. Indeed, when Vps75 and Rtt109 were co-expressed in Escherichia coli, a complex of Rtt109 and Vps75 was present throughout all chromatography steps (Fig. 1D). Moreover, these recombinant complexes displayed HAT activity toward H3 (Fig. 1, E and F). Thus, these results demonstrate that Vps75 is a component of the Rtt109-Vps75 HAT complex, with Rtt109 as the catalytic subunit. Native and Recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 Complexes Acetylate Non-nucleosomal H3—We have shown that Rtt109-Vps75 complexes purified from yeast cells acetylate H3, but not H4, when recombinant H3/H4 tetramers are used as substrates (17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z. Science. 2007; 315: 653-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus, we next sought to determine the substrate requirements for Rtt109-Vps75 complexes using both native complexes purified from yeast cells and recombinant complexes purified from E. coli. First, we tested the ability of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to acetylate H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones purified from 293 cells. Rtt109-Vps75 complexes purified from yeast cells acetylated H3 present in core histone complexes, as determined using both a filter binding assay (Fig. 2A) and autoradiography (Fig. 2B), although less efficiently than when H3 was present as a component of recombinant H3/H4 tetramers. Moreover, the complex acetylated H3, but not H2A, H2B, or H4 (Fig. 2B and supplemental Figs. S2 and S3A), suggesting that Rtt109-Vps75 complexes can confer histone specificity in vitro. In addition, the recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes exhibited a similar degree of HAT activity as native complexes toward H3 when H3/H4 tetramers or H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones were used as substrate (Fig. 2, A, B, D, and E). After analyzing the acetylation of H3 by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes when H3 is present as a mixture of four core histones, we next determined how Rtt109-Vps75 complexes acetylate H3-Lys-56. Surprisingly, although global acetylation of H3 by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes was more efficient when H3 was presented as H3/H4 tetramers, both recombinant and native complexes acetylated H3-Lys-56 to a similar degree irrespective of whether H3/H4 tetramers or H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones were used as substrates (Fig. 2, C and F). The difference in the ability of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to acetylate H3 when present in H3/H4 tetramers versus H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones does not appear to be due to differences in salt concentrations (supplemental Fig. S3A). Possibly, the observed high HAT activity of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes toward H3/H4 tetramers as compared with core histones is due to acetylation of H3 lysine residues other than H3-Lys-56 that are readily accessible for acetylation when presented as H3/H4 recombinant tetramers in vitro but not when H3 is assembled with core histones. Alternatively, these putative additional H3 lysine residues acetylated by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes when H3 is a component of H3/H4 tetramers may already be modified in H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones by acetylation and/or methylation in 293 cells, and as such, these lysine residues would no longer be available for acetylation by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes. As Rtt109-Vps75 complexes exhibited reduced HAT activity toward core histones, of which nucleosomes are composed, we next determined whether Rtt109-Vps75 complexes could acetylate nucleosomal H3. To this end, we purified mononucleosomes as well as mixed populations of mono- and dinucleosomes from 293 cells (supplemental Fig. S4) and used these as substrates for HAT assays. Remarkably, neither native nor recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes exhibited detectable HAT activity toward H3 present in mononucleosomes or mixed populations of mono- and dinucleosomes (Fig. 2, A, B, D, and E and supplemental Fig. S3A). Because Rtt109-Vps75 complexes could acetylate H3 when recombinant H3/H4 tetramers were mixed with mononucleosomes or mixed populations of mono- and dinucleosomes, the inability of Rtt109 to acetylate H3 when H3 is present as a component of nucleosomes is not likely due to inhibitors co-purified with mononucleosomes/mono- and dinucleosomes (supplemental Fig. S3B). Thus, these results indicate that Rtt109-Vps75 complexes acetylate H3 only before it is assembled into nucleosomes, consistent with observations indicating that H3-Lys-56 acetylation is present on newly synthesized histones during S phase of the cell cycle (10Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The N-terminal Tail Domains of H3 and H4 Are Required for Efficient Acetylation of H3-Lys-56 by Rtt109—The differences in HAT activities exhibited by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes toward H3, depending on whether H3 was a component of H3/H4 tetramers, core histones, or nucleosomes, suggest that the manner in which H3 is assembled is important for Rtt109-mediated acetylation. Further, specific domains of H3 outside of the core domain may affect acetylation of lysine 56. Indeed, native Rtt109-Vps75 complexes could not acetylate lysine 56 to a detectable degree when presented simply as an H3 peptide comprising residues surrounding lysine 56 (data not shown). We next tested whether deletion of the N-terminal tail domains of both H3 and H4 affected the ability of native and recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to acetylate H3 as a component of these tailless H3/H4 tetramers. At low protein concentrations, both native and recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes acetylated full-length H3/H4 tetramers much more efficiently than tailless H3/H4 tetramers, as determined by filter binding assays (Fig. 3, A and D), autoradiography (Fig. 3, B and E), and Western blot analysis using antibodies against acetylated H3-Lys-56 (Fig. 3, C and F). When higher concentrations of recombinant Rtt109-Vps75 complexes were used, however, H3-Lys-56 was acetylated in the context of tailless H3/H4 tetramers, but to a lesser extent (supplemental Fig. S5). Thus, domains in addition to those directly surrounding lysine 56 of H3, such as the N-terminal tail domains of H3/H4, appear to be required for efficient acetylation of H3-Lys-56 by the Rtt109-Vps75 complex. The N termini of H3 and H4 are far removed from lysine 56 of H3. However, it is possible that acetylation of lysine residues at the N terminus of H3 or H4 is required for H3-Lys-56 acetylation. Thus, we tested whether mutation of five lysine residues at the N terminus of H3 (Lys-9, Lys-14, Lys-18, Lys-23, and Lys-27) or three lysine residues at the N terminus of H4 (Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-12) to arginine affected H3-Lys-56 acetylation. As compared with wild-type cells, H3-Lys-56 acetylation was not affected to a detectable degree in either the H3 or the H4 N-terminal lysine-to-arginine mutant cells (supplemental Fig. S6), suggesting that acetylation of these lysine residues is not a prerequisite for H3-Lys-56 acetylation. Therefore, we next tested whether the N-terminal tail domains of H3/H4 tetramers might be required for the binding of Rtt109 with histones using a GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, GST-Rtt109 bound to H3/H4 tetramers, whereas under the same conditions, GST-REGα, a 20 S proteasome activator used as a control (26Zhang Z. Clawson A. Realini C. Jensen C.C. Knowlton J.R. Hill C.P. Rechsteiner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2807-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), did not. Using this assay, we then tested whether deletion of the N-terminal tail domains of H3/H4 affected the association of GST-Rtt109 with H3. As shown in Fig. 4B, GST-Rtt109 pulled down significantly more full-length H3 than tailless H3. Thus, these results together with those above indicate that the N-terminal tail domains of H3/H4 tetramers contribute to the association of Rtt109 with histones, and consequently, the efficient acetylation of H3 by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes. In the present study, we have reconstituted Rtt109-Vps75 complexes using recombinant proteins and established that Vps75 is an integral component of the novel Rtt109-Vps75 HAT complex. Using both recombinant and native Rtt109-Vps75 complexes, we have shown that these HAT complexes acetylate H3 present in H3/H4/H2A/H2B core histones but not H3 present in nucleosomes. These results suggest that regulation of H3-Lys-56 acetylation during the cell cycle is mediated, in part, by the inability of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to acetylate nucleosomal H3. Furthermore, we have shown that the N-terminal tail domains of H3/H4 tetramers contribute to the binding of Rtt109 to histones and the efficient acetylation of H3-Lys-56 by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes in vitro. Together, these results reveal insights into the substrate requirements for this novel HAT complex. Rtt109 can acetylate H3-Lys-56 in vitro and in yeast cells in the absence of Vps75. Thus, although Vps75 is a component of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes, it is not required for Rtt109-mediated acetylation of H3-Lys-56. Vps75 is homologous to the histone chaperone nucleosome assembly protein 1 (NAP1) and the human oncoprotein SET, a component of the inhibitor of acetyltransferases (INHAT) complex (data not shown). We envision at least two non-exclusive models to explain the function of Vps75 as a component of the Rtt109 HAT complex. First, Vps75 may function similar to NAP1 by interacting with histones, thus enhancing the binding affinity of Rtt109 for H3 and allowing Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to acetylate H3 more efficiently. Alternatively, Vps75 may function like INHAT. INHAT inhibits the HAT activity of several HATs by binding to histones and preventing a particular HAT from accessing its histone substrates (27Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Thus, it is also possible that Vps75 binds to specific lysine residues of H3 and prevents Rtt109 from acetylating these lysine residues, thereby increasing the specificity of Rtt109 toward lysine 56. Future studies will address these two possibilities. Acetylation of H3-Lys-56 occurs during S phase of the cell cycle and disappears at G2/M phase (10Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 14Zhou H. Madden B.J. Muddiman D.C. Zhang Z. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2852-2861Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, how this acetylation is regulated during the progression of the cell cycle is not clear. Our studies presented here on the Rtt109-Vps75 complex along with two recent studies on the H3-Lys-56 HDACs Hst3 and Hst4 (15Maas N.L. Miller K.M. Defazio L.G. Toczyski D.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 16Celic I. Masumoto H. Griffith W.P. Meluh P. Cotter R.J. Boeke J.D. Verreault A. Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 1280-1289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) suggest that there are at least two ways to regulate H3-Lys-56 acetylation during progression of the cell cycle. First, when H3 is assembled into nucleosomes, acetylation of H3-Lys-56 by Rtt109-Vps75 complexes is inhibited. Lysine 56 of H3 is located in the core domain of H3 at the end of an α-helix and is in close proximity to DNA when H3 is assembled into nucleosomes (2Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6926) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that when H3 is assembled into nucleosomes, lysine 56 of H3 is inaccessible to Rtt109-Vps75 complexes. Alternatively, domains of H3/H4 in addition to those in close proximity to H3-Lys-56, such as their N-terminal tail domains, might be altered in nucleosomes such that the ability of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to bind H3/H4, and consequently the ability of Rtt109 to acetylate H3-Lys-56, is reduced. Future studies may reveal additional potential mechanisms. Regardless, as Rtt109-Vps75 complexes could not acetylate nucleosomal H3, the presentation of H3 as a component of distinct complexes provides a way for regulating H3-Lys-56 acetylation during the cell cycle. Second, it has been proposed that H3-Lys-56 acetylation is regulated by the protein levels of two H3-Lys-56 HDACs, Hst3 and Hst4, because these two HDACs are highly expressed during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Thus, the inability of Rtt109-Vps75 complexes to acetylate nucleosomal H3 combined with the high expression levels of Hst3 and Hst4 during G2/M phase of the cell cycle provide a dynamic means for regulating H3-Lys-56 acetylation during the cell cycle. Recently, Schneider et al. (28Schneider J. Bajwa P. Johnson F.C. Bhaumik S.R. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 37270-37274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) observed that Rtt109 is required for H3-Lys-56 acetylation and that this modification may be involved in transcriptional elongation. In addition, others have also reported that H3-Lys-56 acetylation is detected at active genes (12Xu F. Zhang K. Grunstein M. Cell. 2005; 121: 375-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, acetylation of H3-Lys-56 occurs predominantly on newly synthesized histones (10Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and indeed, several studies have indicated that the primary function of Rtt109 and H3-Lys-56 acetylation is likely involved in DNA replication and/or the DNA damage response (10Masumoto H. Hawke D. Kobayashi R. Verreault A. Nature. 2005; 436: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 17Han J. Zhou H. Horazdovsky B. Zhang K. Xu R.M. Zhang Z.

Yuan D.S. Wang X. Bader J.S. Boeke J.D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1069-1081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Supporting this idea, we have shown that Rtt109-Vps75 HAT complexes exhibit no detectable activity toward H3 when H3 is assembled into nucleosomes. Together, these results suggest that the localization of H3-Lys-56 acetylation at active genes may reflect the S phase deposition of this modified form of H3 onto chromatin. Alternatively, this modification may be involved in transcription by replacing damaged histones with newly synthesized H3 acetylated at lysine 56. Future studies are needed to address the distinct roles of H3-Lys-56 acetylation mediated by Rtt109 in DNA replication and transcription. We thank Dr. Heather M.

In humans, selective attention is a dynamic process restricting perception to a succession of salient stimuli, while less relevant competing stimuli are suppressed. Local field potential recordings in the brains of flies responding to visual novelty revealed attention-like processes with stereotypical temporal properties. These processes were modulated by genes involved in short-term memory formation, namely dunce and rutabaga . Attention defects in these mutants were associated with distinct optomotor effects in behavioral assays."

Co-expression of PSD-95 with D1 in mammalian cells inhibits the D1-mediated cAMP accumulation without altering the total expression level or the agonist binding properties of the receptor. The diminished D1 signaling is mediated by reduced D1 expression at the cell surface as a consequence of an enhanced constitutive, dynamindependent endocytosis. In addition, genetically engineered mice lacking PSD-95 show a heightened behavioral response to either a D1 agonist or the psychostimulant amphetamine.

A key site of action for D1, the predominant subtype of the D1-class receptor, is the dendritic spine of glutamatergic synapses, where the receptor is especially concentrated. Ultrastructural studies reveal that the majority of D1 receptors are localized postsynaptically in the neck, head, as well as the postsynaptic density (PSD) 2The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; PDZ, PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1; SH3, Src homology 3; GK, guanylate kinase-like; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; NT, NH2 terminus; CT, COOH terminus; IL, intracellular loop; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Dyn I, dynamin I; HEK, human embryonic kidney; WT, wild-type; KO, knock-out.2The abbreviations used are: PSD, postsynaptic density; PDZ, PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1; SH3, Src homology 3; GK, guanylate kinase-like; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; NT, NH2 terminus; CT, COOH terminus; IL, intracellular loop; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Dyn I, dynamin I; HEK, human embryonic kidney; WT, wild-type; KO, knock-out. of medium spiny neurons (9Levey A.I.

This subcellular specialization thus provides a location where D1 can modulate the channels and receptors located at spines to control the excitability and synaptic properties of the (glutamatergic) spines. The molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate D1 targeting and signaling within spines are poorly understood. PSD-95 is a prototypical scaffolding protein highly enriched in the PSD and belongs to the membrane-associated guanylate kinase family (14Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). PSD-95 contains three PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1 homology (PDZ) domains, a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain, and a guanylate kinase-like (GK) domain, allowing the protein to interact with a host of proteins of diverse functions, most notably N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, and regulate the functional integration of these receptors into the signaling complexes in PSD (14Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar, 15Kennedy M.B. Science. 2000; 290: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Functionally, PSD-95 regulates NMDA receptor internalization, synaptic transmission and plasticity and plays essential roles in learning (16Roche K.W. Standley S. McCallum J. Dune Ly C.

We previously showed that PSD-95 regulates behavioral responses to the psychostimulant cocaine in mice (21Yao W.D. Gainetdinov R.R. Arbuckle M.I. Sotnikova T.D. Cyr M. Beaulieu J.M. Torres G.E. Grant S.G. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2004; 41: 625-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), suggesting that PSD-95 may play a role in dopaminergic signaling. Here, we identify a novel interaction between PSD-95 and D1. We demonstrate that PSD-95, through its NH2 terminus (NT), induces robust internalization of the otherwise plasma membrane localized D1 receptors in the absence of agonist stimulation, leading to reduced surface D1 expression and diminished D1 signaling. Consequently, mice lacking PSD-95 exhibits enhanced behavioral responses to a D1 agonist and the psychostimulant amphetamine. Our studies establish a new molecular mechanism by which the synaptic delivery of the D1 receptor and thus dopamine signaling can be regulated locally in spines and identify a new potential target in abnormal dopaminergic function. Mice and Behavioral Tests—All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of animals and with an approved animal protocol from the Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals. PSD-95 wild-type (WT) and knock-out (KO) mice (21Yao W.D. Gainetdinov R.R. Arbuckle M.I. Sotnikova T.D. Cyr M. Beaulieu J.M. Torres G.E. Grant S.G. Caron M.G.

Locomotion was evaluated using the automated ENV510 activity monitor (Med Associates Inc.). Age-matched mice were placed in the monitor and their horizontal and vertical activities were recorded at 4- or 5-min intervals. In each experiment, mice were habituated to the chamber environment and their activities monitored for up to 60 min. Each of the mice then received a dose of dopamine agonists or saline and their locomotor activities were measured for up to 120 min. All injections were performed intraperitoneally. cDNA Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfections—The full-length human dopamine D1 receptor cloned in pcDNA3 and a green fluorescence protein (GFP) tagged PSD-95 (PSD-95-GFP) in GW1 (22Topinka J.R. Bredt D.S. Neuron. 1998; 20: 125-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) were used to generate various D1 and PSD-95 constructs. HA-D1 and HA-D1ΔCT lacking amino acids 334-446 were constructed by placing the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the NT of the full-length WT D1 and the truncated D1, respectively. D1-FLAG and D1ΔCT-FLAG were constructed by placing the FLAG epitope at the COOH terminus (CT) of the full-length and the truncated D1, respectively. PSD-95-FLAG and PSD-95ΔNT-FLAG lacking amino acids 1-72 were constructed by placing the FLAG epitope at the CT of the full-length and the truncated PSD-95, respectively. Constructs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA5/FRT/TO (Invitrogen) unless otherwise specified. GFP-tagged PSD-95 truncation mutants ΔNT-GFP (lacking amino acids 1-72), ΔGK-GFP (lacking amino acids 533-712), ΔSH3, GK-GFP (lacking amino acids 431-712), and ΔPDZ1-3, SH3, GK-GFP (i.e. NT-GFP, lacking amino acids 73-712) were constructed by deleting the respective amino acid residues or motif(s) from the full-length PSD-95 and subcloned into the pEGFP-N2 vector (Clontech) in-frame. The rat dynamin I WT (Dyn I-WT) and the K44A (Dyn I-K44A) mutant constructs were described previously (23Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). All DNA constructs were generated by PCR and sequence verified. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293, HEK293T (collectively referred as HEK293(T)), and HEK293 cells stably expressing the rhesus monkey D1 receptor (D1-stable cells) were cultured in a high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were grown to 70-80% conflunence and transfected with 1-10 μg of total DNA using TransFectin (Bio-Rad). E14 rat striatal neurons were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, glucose (6.0 mg/ml), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) for 4 days before subsequent experiments. Immunocytochemistry, Confocal Microscopy, and Immunofluorescence Analysis—Cultured HEK293 cells or primary neurons were briefly fixed with freshly made 4% paraformaldehyde. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min and blocked with 10% goat serum (in PBS) for 30 min. Cells were incubated with the following primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C: anti-HA (1:500, Covance), anti-D1 (1:50, a generous gift from Dr. Allan Levey, Emery University; and from Sigma), anti-PSD-95 (1:200, BD Biosciences), and anti-dynamin I (1:100; Affinity BioReagents). Cells were incubated with appropriate Alexa Fluor dyes (Invitrogen) at room temperature for up to 1 h and mounted on glass slides. To study D1 internalization processes, live cells were incubated with an HA antibody (1:50) at 4 °C for 1 h, washed, and stimulated with or without SKF81297 (10 μm, 30 min, 37 °C). Cells were fixed and blocked before application of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary antibody to label surface HA-D1. The internalized HA-D1 was recognized by an Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary antibody after permeabilizing the cells with 0.25% Triton X-100. Confocal images were acquired using a Leica confocal microscope. Alexa Fluor 488 (green), Alexa Fluor 568 (red), and Alexa Fluor 647 (pseudo-colored “blue” as the emission wavelength of this fluorophore is beyond the sensitivity of human vision) were measured at the following excitation/emission wavelengths: 488/519, 568/604, and 647/669 nm, respectively. GFP fluorescence was measured directly in fixed cells without involving any primary and secondary antibody staining using excitation/emission at 488/508 nm. For quantification of internalization, the confocal settings for image acquisition were kept the same for all cells. Each acquired image file was a stack of 10 images along the z axis. Image stacks were flattened into a single image using a maximum projection and analyzed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.). Surface and internal D1 fluorescence intensities were measured as the integrated pixel intensities (i.e. total 8-bit intensity values across all pixels contained in a cell) in the blue and red channels, respectively. Total D1 fluorescence was determined as the sum of the surface (blue) and the internal (red) fluorescence intensities. Internalized receptors were operationally defined as those unambiguously localized inside the cells. These receptors were selected by tracing the cytoplasm 4 μm beneath the cell surface in the blue channel and transferred to the red channel, and the red fluorescence intensity was measured as the level of the internalized receptors. For each cell, the internalization index was defined as the ratio of the internalized fluorescence intensity to the total fluorescence intensity. Subcellular Fractionation—PSD fraction was isolated from mouse forebrain structures (containing the striatum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex) according to Carlin et al. (24Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Briefly, brain tissues were homogenized in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose containing 1 mm Hepes, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaHCO3 and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min (P1). The supernatant was centrifuged at 1300 × g for 15 min to yield a crude synaptosome and mitochondria (P2). The P2 pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 0.32 m sucrose containing 1 mm Hepes and 1 mm NaHCO3, loaded onto a sucrose gradient of 0.85, 1.0, and 1.2 m, and centrifuged at 82,000 × g for 2 h. The synaptosome fraction isolated between 1.0 and 1.2 m was centrifuged at 32,800 × g for 30 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended and centrifuged at 201,800 × g for 2 h over a sucrose gradient of 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m. The PSD fraction between 1.5 and 2.0 m was obtained after centrifugation at 201,800 × g for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Mouse forebrain structures were rapidly dissected and homogenized in ice-cold Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was solubilized in a DOC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1% DOC, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA and protease inhibitors) at 37 °C for 45 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Isolated PSD proteins were incubated in the solubilization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% SDS, 68.5 mm NaCl, 1.35 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 50 μm Na vanadate, protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C for 30 min, supplemented with five volumes of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 2% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 100 μm Na vanadate and protease inhibitor mixture), incubated at 4 °C for an additional 2 h, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. Transfected HEK293(T) cells were sonicated in 25 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The protein extracts of the supernatant from brain tissues, PSD, or HEK293(T) cells were used in immunoprecipitation and pulldown assays. Protein extracts were incubated with an anti-D1 (10 μl, Sigma), an anti-PSD-95 (8 μl, BD Biosciences), an anti-HA (5 μl, Covance), or an anti-FLAG antibody (5 μl, Sigma) at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. Immunocomplexes were captured by protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were immunostained with desired primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and immunoreactive signals were detected with an ECL-based LAS-3000 image system (Fujifilm). Densitometric analysis was carried out within linear range using ImageGauge (Fujifilm). Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Fusion Proteins and Pull-down Assay—The coding sequences of the intracellular loop 2 (IL2, amino acids 117-139), loop 3 (IL3, amino acids 218-273), and CT (amino acids 334-446) of the D1 receptor and the NT (amino acids 1-72), PDZ 1 (PDZ1, amino acids 73-167), PDZ 2 (PDZ2, amino acids 168-320), PDZ 3 (PDZ3, amino acids 321-430), SH3 (SH3, amino acids 431-532), and GK (GK, amino acids 533-712) domains of PSD-95 were generated by PCR and cloned into pGEX4T-1 vector in-frame and verified by automated sequencing. The GST fusion protein production was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Promega) for 2 h in BL21 bacterium and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were incubated at 4 °C over-night with lysates of HEK293T cells overexpressing PSD-95-GFP or D1-FLAG, or mouse brain extracts, followed by extensive washes with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The pulled down proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay—D1-stable HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with mock or PSD-95-GFP cDNA plasmids and split into 24-well plates 12 h after transfection. The cells were serum-starved for 1 h and stimulated by SKF81297 for 30 min. Whole-cell cAMP concentrations were measured using the Direct cAMP Enzyme Immunoassay Kit (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. Optical density was measured at 405 nm by a microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Radioligand Competition Binding—Cells were rinsed, harvested, and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer in 5 mm Tris-HCl containing 2 mm EDTA and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 3400 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm Tris containing 8.5 mm Hepes, 120 mm NaCI, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and protein concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). 200 μg of sample was incubated with 0.4 nm of [3H]SCH23390 (86 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of increasing concentrations of SKF81297 (10-12 to 10-4 m) at 4 °C for 2 h. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm SCH39166 (25Jassen A.K. Yang H. Miller G.M. Calder E. Madras B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed in triplicate. Binding data were analyzed by fitting the data with a sigmoidal dose-response curve to derive Bmax and IC50 using Graphpad Prism software. Cell Surface Biotinylation—Confluent monolayers of HEK293T cells transfected with HA-D1 in the absence and presence of PSD-95-GFP co-transfection were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with gentle agitation for 30 min at 4 °C with 2 ml of 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in PBS (pH 7.4). The reaction was quenched by incubating the cells for an additional 10 min with 50 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were rinsed twice with a Tris-buffered saline buffer, dissolved in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and briefly sonicated. Each sample was divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for isolation of biotinylated proteins after immobilizing them to NeutrAvidin (Pierce). The second aliquot was used to determine the total proteins. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting. PSD-95 Interacts with D1 in Vitro and in Vivo—We first investigated whether PSD-95 can interact with D1. HEK293T cells were transfected with PSD-95-GFP, HA-D1, or both. Immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1A) of whole-cell lysates showed that PSD-95-GFP was co-precipitated with an anti-HA antibody only when both proteins were expressed in these cells. Conversely, HA-D1 was co-precipitated with an anti-PSD-95 antibody only when both proteins were expressed, suggesting that D1 and PSD-95 were closely and specifically associated in these cells. To investigate whether PSD-95 may associate with D1 in vivo, we performed immunoprecipitation on protein extracts prepared from WT and PSD-95 KO mouse forebrain structures (Fig. 1B). A rat monoclonal anti-D1 antibody was able to precipitate PSD-95 in WT but not in KO mice. Similarly, an anti-PSD-95 antibody was able to precipitate D1 (Fig. 1B). Previous studies suggest that PSD-95 is localized primarily in the PSD of dendritic spines (26Hunt C.A. Schenker L.J. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For D1 to interact with PSD-95 in the PSD, the receptor needs to travel to this postsynaptic site of glutamatergic transmission. Consistent with the electron microscopic (9Levey A.I. Hersch S.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20196-20202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) studies, we found that D1 was enriched in the PSD purified from mouse forebrain structures. The high purity of our isolated PSD fraction was confirmed by its enrichment of PSD-95, PSD-93, and NMDA receptor subunits compared with other subcellular fractions, but the lack of the presynaptic protein synaptophysin (Fig. 1C). Moreover, D1 co-precipitated with PSD-95 in the purified PSD (Fig. 1D). To confirm the immunoprecipitation data, we examined the subcellular localization of PSD-95 and D1 in cultured striatal neurons using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. As expected, the more diffusive D1 staining co-localized with a subset of discrete clusters immunopositive to PSD-95 along neuronal processes (Fig. 1E). Together, these data demonstrate that PSD-95 interacts with D1 in vivo, possibly in the PSD. Interaction between PSD-95 and D1 Receptors through the PSD-95 NH2 Terminus and the D1 COOH Terminus—We next mapped the protein domains on PSD-95 and D1 that mediate their interaction using recombinant GST affinity purification assays (Fig. 2, A-D). The intracellular loops and carboxyl tail of D1 contain putative protein-protein interaction domains important for intracellular signaling (28Lezcano N. Mrzljak L. Eubanks S. Levenson R.

Cell. 2002; 111: 219-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Several domains of PSD-95, including the PDZs, the SH3, and the GK, are well characterized protein-protein interaction motifs (14Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). Recently, the NT of PSD-95, a region not previously known to be involved in protein-protein interaction, has been shown to interact with Src (31Kalia L.V. Pitcher G.M. Pelkey K.A. Salter M.W. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4971-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins encoding the various domains of D1 and PSD-95 were constructed (Fig. 2, A and B) and used as baits to precipitate associated proteins. Incubation of GST, GST-D1-IL2, GST-D1-IL3, or GST-D1-CT fusion proteins with PSD-95-GFP-expressing HEK293T lysates revealed a co-purification of PSD-95 and GST-D1-CT only. To our surprise, GST-PSD-95-NT, but not other GST-PSD-95 fusion proteins or GST alone, could precipitate solubilized D1 from HEK293T cells expressing the FLAG-tagged D1 (D1-FLAG). These data show that the D1 CT and the PSD-95 NT may mediate the interaction between these proteins. To investigate whether the D1 CT and the PSD-95 NT are responsible for D1-PSD-95 interaction in the brain, we performed GST pulldown assays on brain protein extracts using the above GST fusion proteins. GST-D1-CT, but not other GST-D1 fusion proteins or GST alone, was able to pull down PSD-95 from mouse forebrain extracts (Fig. 2C). Similarly, GST-PSD-95-NT, but not other GST-PSD-95 fusion proteins or GST alone, was able to pull down D1 from brain extracts (Fig. 2D). These data support our finding that the D1 CT and the PSD-95 NT may mediate the interaction seen between these two proteins in the brain. To further confirm the interaction domains involved, we generated truncation mutants that lack the PSD-95 NT or the D1 CT. Immunoprecipitation analysis in HEK293T cells demonstrated that these mutations completely abolished the interaction between PSD-95 and D1 (Fig. 2, E and F). Thus, we conclude that the interaction between PSD-95 and D1 is mediated by PSD-95 NT and D1 CT. PSD-95 Inhibits D1-mediated cAMP Production—We investigated how PSD-95 may regulate D1 function by measuring D1-mediated cAMP production in response to agonist stimulation in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing the rhesus macaque dopamine D1 receptor that shares all but two amino acid residues with its human homolog (referred as D1 stable cells) (Fig. 3). Basal cAMP levels were minimally detectable in these cells in the absence of agonist stimulation. However, stimulation of D1 by the full agonist SKF81297 (10 μm) produced a robust accumulation of cAMP in these cells (Fig. 3A). This effect was blocked by the D1 antagonist SCH23390, suggesting that the cAMP accumulation was mediated specifically by D1. Overexpression of PSD-95-GFP in these cells significantly inhibited the SKF81297-induced whole-cell cAMP accumulation (Fig. 3A). To evaluate whether PSD-95 overexpression may alter the ability of SKF81297 to stimulate cAMP production, we determined the dose-response curve of cAMP production in response to increasing concentrations of SKF81297 (Fig. 3B). PSD-95 co-expression decreased the maximal cAMP levels (Bmax) induced by saturating doses of SKF81297 but did not significantly alter the EC50 of SKF81297 (D1 stable + mock: 4.95 ± 0.64 × 10-8 m; D1 stable + PSD-95: 4.45 ± 1.41 × 10-8m; p = 0.72, Student's t tests). To test whether PSD-95 may modulate the agonist binding properties of the D1 receptor, radioligand competition binding experiments were performed to quantify the number as well as agonist binding parameters of D1 in both mock- and PSD-95-GFP-transfected D1 stable cells using the ligand [3H]SCH23390 and increasing concentrations of SKF81297 (Fig. 3C). PSD-95 overexpression had no effect on either the total number of D1 receptors expressed or the IC50 of SKF81297 (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that the inhibition of D1 activity by PSD-95 co-expres"
https://openalex.org/W2112697515,"The dysferlin gene is mutated in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, and distal anterior compartment myopathy. In mature skeletal muscle, dysferlin is located predominantly at the sarcolemma, where it plays a role in membrane fusion and repair. To investigate the role of dysferlin during early muscle differentiation, its localization was studied at high resolution in a muscle cell line. This demonstrated that dysferlin is not expressed at the plasmalemma of myotubes but mostly localizes to the T-tubule network. However, dysferlin translocated to the site of injury and toward the plasma membrane in a Ca2+-dependent fashion in response to a newly designed in vitro wounding assay. This reaction was specific to the full-length protein, as heterologously expressed deletion mutants of distinct C2 domains of dysferlin did not show this response. These results shed light on the dynamics of muscle membrane repair and are highly indicative of a specific role of dysferlin in this process in early myogenesis."

The sulfation of HS glycosaminoglycan residues is required for its interaction with various heparin-binding growth factors to promote their biological activities to activate their high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases. We have identified HS glycosaminoglycan-6-O-endosulfatase HSulf-1 as a down-regulated gene in ovarian, breast, and several other cancer cell lines. Here we have shown that HSulf-1 inhibits autocrine activation of the EGFR-ERK (epidermal growth factor receptor-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) pathway induced by serum withdrawal in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Short hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of HSulf-1 in HSulf-1 clonal lines of MDA-MB-468 led to a significant increase in autocrine activation of ERK compared with vector only control. The autocrine signaling was also inhibited with neutralization antibodies against amphiregulin and HB-EGF, the heparin-binding growth factor family of the EGF superfamily. Furthermore, HSulf-1-mediated inhibition of autocrine signaling was associated with reduced cyclin D1 levels, leading to decreased S phase fraction and increased G2–M fraction, as well as increased cell death. Finally, evaluation of HSulf-1 expression levels in primary invasive breast tumors by RNA in situ hybridization indicated that HSulf-1 is down-regulated in the majority (60%) of tumors, with a predominant association with lobular histology.

Despite the advances in early detection and therapeutic treatment options, an estimated 215,000 new cases and 41,000 deaths were reported in 2006 (1Jemal A. Siegel R. Ward E. Murray T. Xu J. Smigal C. Thun M.J. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2006; 56: 106-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (5532) Google Scholar). One of the molecular signatures known to be associated with poor prognosis is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 2The abbreviations used are: EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HB-EGF, heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor; ER, estrogen receptor; HS, heparan sulfate; TMA, tissue microarray; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; RT, reverse transcription; shRNA, short hairpin RNA. The EGFR expression in breast cancer is often associated with resistance to endocrine hormone therapy (2Johnston S.R. Clin.

Recent studies also indicate that hormone-induced estrogen receptor (ER) activation leads to activation of EGFR, suggesting that cross-talk between the two signaling pathways may be a crucial drug-resistant mechanism in ER-positive breast tumors (4Dubey S.

EGFR signaling is induced by various EGF-like growth factor family ligands, such as EGF, amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), betacellulin, epiregulin, and transforming growth factor-α (7Roskoski Jr., R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Amphiregulin is one of the most investigated EGFR ligands in relation to breast cancer. Amphiregulin is a heparin-binding growth factor that requires heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans as a low affinity coreceptor (8Johnson G.R. Wong L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27149-27154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is overexpressed in the majority of primary breast tumors (9Qi C.F. Liscia D.S. Normanno N. Merlo G. Johnson G.R.

However, most of the studies elucidating the regulatory role of HSulf-1 in heparin binding growth factor signaling have utilized exogenously added heparin-binding growth factors. What is not known is whether HSulf-1 is also involved in autocrine signaling. Here we have shown for the first time is that the loss of HSulf-1 in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells augments both autocrine and paracrine proliferation signaling through the heparin-binding growth factors of the EGF superfamily, amphiregulin, and HB-EGF. In addition, determination of HSulf-1 expression levels in primary invasive breast tumors on tissue microarray by RNA in situ hybridization indicated that HSulf-1 is down-regulated in the majority of tumors, especially those with lobular histology. These results suggest a potential mechanism by which HSulf-1 down-regulation may contribute to breast cancer development.

To induce autocrine signaling, cells were incubated in plain Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium at 37 °C for various time points. In some experiments, neutralization antibodies were added in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with the following concentrations: anti-amphiregulin (10 μg/ml), anti-HB-EGF (10 μg/ml), and anti-EGF (1 μg/ml). Protein Extracts and Western Blot—Cells were rinsed quickly with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed at 4 °C in SDS sample loading buffer and analyzed by Western blot as described previously (13Lai J.

The plasmid DNA was purified with the EndFree Plasmid Maxi kit and packaged into infectious adeno-associated viral particles following the manufacturer’s protocol. For viral transduction, breast cancer cells grown to confluency were incubated for 48 h with a 4:1 mixture of the viral supernatants and fresh culture medium followed by a 24-h recovery in fresh culture medium.

After blocking with 300 μl of Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 5 min, the samples bound on the wells were incubated with 1.0 μg/ml primary antibody in the blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature and washed with TBST followed by incubations with 50 ng/ml biotin-conjugated secondary anti-goat antibody and tertiary poly-horseradish peroxidase streptavidin diluted at 1:5000. The peroxidase activity was detected using the 3,5′,5′,5′-tetramethyl benzidine substrate kit (Pierce). A standard curve was drawn for each plate using recombinant amphiregulin, EGF, or HB-EGF proteins for reference. Minimum detection limits of the assays for serum amphiregulin, EGF, and HB-EGF were 0.02, 0.05, and 0.01 ng/ml, respectively. Cell Proliferation Assay and Cell Cycle Analysis—For measuring cell proliferation induced by amphiregulin, HB-EGF, or EGF, MDA468 clones seeded in 96-well plates (1000 cells/well) were serum-starved for 48 h in culture medium and then treated with 0.5 ng/ml amphiregulin, HB-EGF, or EGF in the presence of Alamar Blue dye (Invitrogen). The metabolically reduced Alamar Blue dye was quantified according to the protocol of the supplier. The cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry was performed as described previously (18Mullen P. Methods Mol. Med. 2004; 88: 247-255PubMed Google Scholar). Breast Cancer Tissue Microarray—Tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 3 cores from 113 non-selected primary invasive breast cancers (stage I–IIIC) were constructed. An experienced surgical pathologist evaluated hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides of all of the specimens before construction of the tissue microarray to identify representative tumor areas.

For production of the sense probe labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Applied Science), the resulting plasmid construct was linearized with SacII and translated by Sp6 RNA polymerase using Riboprobe in vitro transcription systems (Promega, Madison, WI). Like-wise, the antisense probe was produced using the plasmid linearized with SalI and T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA in situ hybridization on breast cancer TMA was performed as described previously (19Qian X. Guerrero R.B. Plummer T.B. Alves V.F. Lloyd R.V. Diagn. Mol. Pathol. 2004; 13: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).

Differences between groups were compared using an unpaired two-tailed t test. HSulf-1 Inhibits Autocrine-mediated Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and EGFR in the MDA-MB-468 Breast Cancer Cell Line—Our recent study (17Narita K. Staub J. Chien J. Meyer K. Bauer M. Friedl A. Ramakrishnan S. Shridhar V. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) demonstrates that HSulf-1 expression in HSulf-1-null, EGFR-overexpressing MDA-MB-468 (hereafter referred to as MDA468) breast carcinoma cell line led to reduction in cell proliferation in vitro and tumor burden in athymic nude mice in vivo. To understand the mechanism underlying the reduced proliferation in the HSulf-1-expressing cells, we investigated the role of HSulf-1 in autocrine signaling. Activation of the ERK/MAPK pathways following serum withdrawal was evaluated in MDA468 stable clones with or without expression of HSulf-1. In the vector-transfected clone, the activation of ERK1/2 declined rapidly in the first 30–60 min followed by an increase from 90 to 150 min, indicating the activation of autocrine signaling (Fig. 1, A and B). HSulf-1 stable clone numbers 4 and 5 also showed an acute decline of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in 30–60 min after serum withdrawal, as observed in the control. However, these HSulf-1 clones showed only modest levels of rephosphorylation in the following incubation times (Fig. 1, A and B). Consistent with this, loss of autocrine ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the HSulf-1-expressing clones was also associated with a marked reduction in EGFR phosphorylation of Tyr-992 and Tyr-1068, two sites implicated in ERK activation, as determined at 120 min after serum withdrawal (Fig. 1C). To eliminate the possibility that the above observations are due to clonal variations and/or are cell line-specific, we transiently expressed HSulf-1 in MDA468 and BT474 breast cancer cell lines using a high efficiency adeno-associated viral transduction system and then determined the levels of autocrine ERK phosphorylation. The expression of HSulf-1 in these cell lines following viral transduction was confirmed by RT-PCR and immunoblot for the V5 epitope tag fused at the C terminus (Fig. 2A). When the transduced cells were serum-starved for 2 h and the ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels compared with the vector-transduced control, significant reduction in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in both cell lines (Fig. 2, B and C). Consistent with the observation that forced expression of HSulf-1 leads to reduced autocrine signaling, HSulf-1 knockdown by RNA interference in MDA468 clone number 4 with stable HSulf-1 expression led to a significant increase in autocrine ERK phosphorylation compared with vector-transduced or untreated control samples (Fig. 3). The same trend was also observed in MDA468 clone number 5 (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that HSulf-1 inhibits autocrine activation of the EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling cascade in breast cancer cells, potentially involving heparin-binding growth factors. Autocrine Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in MDA468 Is Mediated by Amphiregulin and Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor—To identify the specific growth factors involved in this autocrine signaling, neutralization antibodies against three growth factors of EGF superfamily (amphiregulin, HB-EGF, or EGF) were added to serum-free medium, and their ability to inhibit autocrine ERK1/2 phosphorylation was investigated in the vector-transfected clone. When the cells were treated with neutralization antibodies against amphiregulin or HB-EGF, a significant inhibition (∼50%) of autocrine activation of ERK1/2 was observed (Fig. 4, A and B). These data suggest that both amphiregulin and HB-EGF, the heparin-binding growth factors of the EGF superfamily, stimulate autocrine signaling induced by serum withdrawal in MDA468. By contrast, the neutralization antibody against EGF enhanced the autocrine ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 4, A and B). Deprivation of EGF might be a key event for the initiation of autocrine signaling mediated by amphiregulin and HB-EGF. Quantification of amphiregulin, HB-EGF, and EGF in the conditioned medium from the vector-transfected and HSulf-1-expressing clones by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated no differences in the ligand levels between these clones (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these data suggest that HSulf-1 inhibits the autocrine EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling triggered by amphiregulin and HB-EGF in MDA468 cells without affecting their expression level. HSulf-1 Inhibits Autocrine Cyclin D1 Expression, S Phase Entry, and the Cell Survival under Serum-free Conditions—Because activation of the EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling cascade leads to mitogenic response, we next investigated the consequences of HSulf-1-mediated inhibition of autocrine activation on cell proliferation and survival under serum-free conditions. In the vector-transfected clone, cyclin D1 expression was down-regulated to a very low level in the first 6 h and remained so up to 12 h (Fig. 5). By contrast, in the HSulf-1 stable clone numbers 4 and 5, cyclin D1 protein was down-regulated to an undetectable level in the first 6 h and remained undetectable up to 12 h (Fig. 5). Cell cycle analysis at 72 h after serum withdrawal revealed a reduction in the S phase fraction in HSulf-1 clone numbers 4 and 5 (33.1 ± 0.6 and 36.8 ± 0.5%, respectively) compared with the vector-transfected clone (40.7 ± 0.5%) (Fig. 6A and Table 1). HSulf-1 clone numbers 4 and 5 also showed an increase in G2–M phase (29.5 ± 0.9% and 21.8 ± 1.1%, respectively) compared with the vector-transfected clone (14.1 ± 0.4%). In addition, quantification of cell death by trypan blue exclusion following a 4-day serum withdrawal showed a significantly higher rate of cell death in HSulf-1 clones (∼30%) compared with the vector-transfected clone (15%) (Fig. 6B). The mode of cell death could be necrosis, because the flow cytometry of these samples failed to detect a sub-G1 peak corresponding to apoptotic cells (Fig. 6A). Collectively, these data suggest that the inhibition of autocrine EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling cascade by HSulf-1 results in a reduced cyclin D1 expression, reduces the S phase fraction, and increases the G2–M fraction, leading to inhibition of cell survival.FIGURE 6HSulf-1 inhibits autocrine S phase entry and the cell survival under serum-free conditions.

The autocrine phosphorylation of ERK1/2 before stimulation was minimized by changing the serum-free medium several times over the 24-h serum starvation. When the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting, the vector-transfected clone showed a strong transient activation of ERK1/2 at 2 min that was sustained until 8 min after the addition of 0.5 ng/ml amphiregulin (Fig. 7, A and B). By contrast, HSulf-1 stable clone numbers 4 and 5 showed only a short activation of ERK1/2 with a short peak around 4 min after stimulation (Fig. 7, A and B) and with no sustained activation at 6–8 min. A similar trend was also observed with 0.5 ng/ml HB-EGF (data not shown). Stimulation of cells with 0.5 ng/ml EGF, on the other hand, showed no difference in the ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels between HSulf-1 clones and the vector-transfected control (Fig. 7, A and C). Consistent with this ERK1/2 activation data, HSulf-1 clones also showed reduced levels of cell proliferation compared with vector-transfected control upon stimulation with exogenous amphiregulin and HB-EGF (but not EGF), as measured by the fluorescence of metabolically reduced Alamar Blue dye (Fig. 7D). These data indicate that HSulf-1 inhibits MDA468 cell proliferation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation stimulated by amphiregulin and HB-EGF. Loss of HSulf-1 Expression Is Associated with Low Grade Invasive Lobular Breast Cancers—To investigate the clinical significance of HSulf-1 down-regulation in breast cancer, the potential association between the HSulf-1 expression level and clinicopathological parameters (such as tumor histology, grade, and hormone receptor status) and the presence of lymph node and recurrent disease was analyzed in breast cancer TMA. A TMA containing a total of 113 primary breast tumor samples (96 invasive ductal and 17 lobular carcinomas with varying grades and stages) of the patients treated at the Mayo Clinic were used in this study. The overall median age of the patients analyzed in this study was 60.4 years. HSulf-1 expression level was determined in 111 samples by RNA in situ hybridization (Fig. 8), and the intensity was scored from 1–2 (low) to 3–4 (high) by three independent scientists blinded to the clinical data. Our analysis indicated that 59.5% (66/111) of breast tumors had loss and/or lower levels of HSulf-1 expression (Table 2). There was a significant association between low HSulf-1 mRNA levels and low grade breast tumors (p = 0.0001, Table 2). Lower levels of HSulf-1 expression were detected in 87.5% (28/32) of low grade (grades 1 and 2) breast tumors compared with 48.1% (38/79) high grade (grades 3 and 4) breast tumors. Among the two histological subtypes on the TMA, 88.2% (15/17) of the invasive lobular carcinoma compared with 53.8% (50/93) of the invasive ductal carcinoma showed loss of HSulf-1 expression (p = 0.0076, Table 2). There was also a trend toward lower HSulf-1 expression levels in ER-positive (65.8%, 52/79) compared with ER-negative (44.4%, 12/27) tumors (p = 0.0682, Table 2). HSulf-1 expression level showed no significant association between the lymph node status and length to recurrence (Table 2). Statistical analysis of association between tumor histology and clinical data indicated that 64.7% (11/17) of invasive lobular breast carcinoma were low grade compared with 21.9% (21/96) of invasive ductal carcinoma (p = 0.0008, data not shown). In addition, 100% (0/17) of invasive lobular breast carcinomas were ER-positive compared with 70.3% (27/91) of invasive ductal carcinoma (p = 0.0059, data not shown). These data indicate that HSulf-1 expression is down-regulated in the majority of tumors with a predominant association with lobular histology. We have shown previously that the loss of HSulf-1 in cancer cells results in an increase in HS glycosaminoglycan sulfation, promoting various heparin-binding growth factor activities to induce the MAPK signaling pathway (13Lai J.

Our recent study using the MDA468 breast cancer cell line also demonstrates that HSulf-1 inhibits tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in vivo (17Narita K. Staub J. Chien J. Meyer K. Bauer M. Friedl A. Ramakrishnan S. Shridhar V. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). During analysis of growth factor signaling in the MDA468 stable clones expressing HSulf-1, we found that the HSulf-1 clones had diminished autocrine activation of EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling induced by serum withdrawal (Fig. 1). The inhibition of autocrine ERK phosphorylation was also observed in MDA468 and BT474 cells transiently transduced with the adeno-associated viral construct of HSulf-1 (Fig. 2), indicating that the above observations are not cell line-specific or due to clonal variations. In addition, knockdown of HSulf-1 expression by RNA interference promoted autocrine phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3), further lending support to the role of HSulf-1 in autocrine signaling. A more detailed analysis of this autocrine signaling indicated that the heparin-binding growth factors of the EGF superfamily, amphiregulin and HB-EGF, are involved in this process (Fig. 4). The autocrine activation of EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling by amphiregulin upon serum withdrawal has also been described in normal keratinocytes (20Kansra S. Stoll S.W. Johnson J.L. Elder J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4299-4309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Numerous reports have provided evidence that EGFR and amphiregulin play important roles in breast cancer pathology. The levels of amphiregulin in invasive breast tumors are increased following the tumor stage and grade (10Ma L. de Roquancourt A. Bertheau P. Chevret S. Millot G. Sastre-Garau X. Espie M. Marty M. Janin A. Calvo F. J. Pathol. 2001; 194: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Salomon D.S. Normanno N. Ciardiello F. Brandt R. Shoyab M. Todaro G.J. Breast Cancer Res.

Cancer. 1998; 78: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that an autocrine loop by overexpressed amphiregulin and EGFR is involved in the tumorigenic potential of transformed breast epithelial cell xenografts and that disrupting this autocrine loop with antisense-mediated down-regulation of either amphiregulin or EGFR is effective in inhibiting tumor growth (12Ma L. Gauville C. Berthois Y. Millot G. Johnson G.R. Calvo F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6513-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our present study demonstrating that down-regulation of HSulf-1 augments amphiregulin-EGFR autocrine signaling without affecting the ligand levels provides a novel mechanism of acquired autocrine signaling in breast cancer. Furthermore, the inhibition of autocrine EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling by HSulf-1 was associated with diminished expression of cyclin D1 (Fig. 5), reduced S phase, and increased G2–M fractions (Fig. 6 and Table 1). This is consistent with a previous report by Yin et al. (22Yin F. Giuliano A.E. Law R.E. Van Herle A.J. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 413-420PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrating that inhibition of EGFR by apigenin reduced ERK phosphorylation and induced G2–M arrest in MCF-7 and MDA468 cells. A delayed G2–M transition by dominant negative MAPKK1 was also reported in fibroblasts (23Wright J.H. Munar E. Jameson D.R. Andreassen P.R. Margolis R.L. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11335-11340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), further supporting our observation. HSulf-1 clones incubated in serum-free medium showed more necrotic cell death compared with the vector-transfected control (Fig. 6), consistent with our previous observation that tumor xenografts of the HSulf-1 clones showed reduced tumorigenesis associated with enhanced necrosis (17Narita K. Staub J. Chien J. Meyer K. Bauer M. Friedl A. Ramakrishnan S. Shridhar V. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, the mitogenic activity of exogenous amphiregulin and HB-EGF was also diminished in the HSulf-1 clones (Fig. 7), suggesting that HSulf-1 down-regulation augments both the autocrine and paracrine signaling of heparin-binding growth factors. Finally, an analysis of association between HSulf-1 expression and clinicopathological parameters in breast tumor samples demonstrated that HSulf-1 expression is down-regulated in the majority of tumors with a predominant association with lobular histology (Table 2), which is often associated with better clinical parameters such as tumor grades and positive ER expression (24Arpino G. Bardou V.J. Clark G.M. Elledge R.M. Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: R149-R156Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). The association between HSulf-1 down-regulation and lobular histology may explain why this histological subtype does not show a better clinical outcome than the invasive ductal subtype, despite the various favorable biologic phenotypes. Arpino et al. (24Arpino G. Bardou V.J. Clark G.M. Elledge R.M. Breast Cancer Res. 2004; 6: R149-R156Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that invasive lobular carcinoma is more likely to be estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive, lower in S phase fraction, and to be more diploid, HER-2-, p53-, and EGFR-negative than invasive ductal carcinoma, yet show no advantage in clinical outcome. Our data suggest that this histological subtype might have an enhanced autocrine amphiregulin and/or HB-EGF signaling because of HSulf-1 down-regulation, providing a potential mechanism that makes lobular carcinomas more aggressive than predicted based on classical biomarkers. In addition, Bottini et al. (25Bottini A. Generali D. Brizzi M.P. Fox S.B. Bersiga A. Bonardi S. Allevi G. Aguggini S. Bodini G. Milani M. Dionisio R. Bernardi C. Montruccoli A. Bruzzi P. Harris A.L. Dogliotti L. Berruti A. J. Clin. Oncol. 2006; 24: 3623-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that low dose metronomic cyclophosphamide therapy, which inhibits tumor angiogenesis and therefore limits nutrition supply, is beneficial for ductal but not lobular carcinoma when used in combination with systemic letrozole therapy. This seems to be consistent with our data implicating that HSulf-1 down-regulation in invasive lobular carcinomas might confer resistance to cell death under low nutrition conditions similar to the in vitro setup of serum withdrawal. This might also suggest that the loss of HSulf-1 could serve as a biomarker to predict the response to anti-angiogenic therapy. In addition, elevated EGFR signaling has also been implicated in acquired drug resistance to systemic hormone therapy in breast cancer, emerging as a rationale for the effective combination of endocrine hormone therapy and EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors in breast tumors (26Agrawal A.

https://openalex.org/W2062578000,"Formation of calcified tissues is a well regulated process. In dentin, the odontoblasts synthesize several biomolecules that function as nucleators or inhibitors of mineralization. To identify genes that are odontoblast-specific, a subtractive hybridization technique was employed that resulted in the identification of a previously undescribed novel gene synthesized by the odontoblasts. Based on the nomenclature in our laboratory, this gene has been named dentin matrix protein 4 (DMP4). The protein encoded by mouse DMP4 cDNA contained 579 amino acids, including a 26-amino acid signal peptide. Analysis of the protein sequence demonstrated the presence of a Greek key calcium-binding domain and one conserved domain of unknown function in all the species examined thus far. Calcium binding property was confirmed by 45Ca binding assays and the corresponding change in conformation by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism. Northern analysis demonstrated high expression levels of a single 3-kb mRNA transcript in tooth, whereas low expression levels were detected in other tissues. In situ hybridization analysis showed high expression levels of DMP4 in odontoblasts and low levels in osteoblasts and ameloblasts during tooth development. Gain and loss of function experiments demonstrated that DMP4 had the potential to differentiate mesenchymal precursor cells into functional odontoblast-like cells.

Mammalian tooth development requires a series of reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during the odontogenic developmental program (1Thesleff I. Keranen S. Jernvall J. Adv. Dent Res. 2001; 15: 14-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These interactions are necessary for the polarization and terminal differentiation of odontoblasts. Two important components of the dentin matrix are type I collagen, which acts as an inert scaffold, and the noncollagenous proteins, which function as regulators of mineralization (2Weiner S. Wagner H.D. Annu. Rev. Mater. Sci. 1998; 28: 271-298Crossref Scopus (2285) Google Scholar). During dentin formation, the odontoblast cells synthesize a number of noncollagenous proteins. Most of these proteins are proteolytically cleaved or post-translationally modified before being secreted to the extracellular matrix. It is generally believed that the noncollagenous proteins are involved in the organization of the matrix and the regulation of the mineralization process (3He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 4He G. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11649-11656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Several noncollagenous proteins from the dentin matrix have been identified in our laboratory, and based on their tissue localization they were named “dentin matrix proteins” (DMPs). 2The abbreviations used are: DMP, dentin matrix protein; DSPP, dentin sialophosphoprotein; DGI-II, dentinogenesis imperfecta type II; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcription; siRNA, small interfering RNA; BSA, bovine serum albumin; shRNA, small hairpin RNA. The complete sequences of dentin matrix proteins 1, 2, and 3 were deduced from cDNAs derived from a rat odontoblast library. DMP1 is an acidic protein present in the mineralized matrix of bone and dentin (5George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DMP2 is highly acidic and is mostly present in the dentin matrix and contains predominantly aspartic acid and phosphoserine amino acids (6George A. Bannon L. Sabsay B. Dillon J.W. Malone J. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32869-32873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). DMP3, also known as dentin sialophosphoprotein (DSPP) (mouse), is a compound protein of dentin sialoprotein and a phosphophoryn like domain at the C-terminal end (7George A. Srinivasan R. Thotakura R.S. Liu K. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 8MacDougall M. Simmons D. Luan X. Nydegger J. Feng J. Gu T.T. J. Biol.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta type II (DGI-II) is an autosomal dominant disorder of the tooth that primarily affects dentin biomineralization. Opalescent dentin with obliterated pulp chambers are the characteristic features in DGI-II (9Witkop Jr., C.J. MacLean C.J. Schmidt P.J. Henry J.L. Ala. J. Med. Sci. 1966; 3: 382-403PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, DSPP has been associated with the pathogenesis of DGI-II with and without progressive hearing loss in four independent Chinese families (10Zhang X. Zhao J. Li C. Gao S. Qiu C. Liu P. Wu G. Qiang B. Lo W.H. Shen Y. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G. Qian M. Yang J. Shi Y. Hu L. Han B. Wang Z. Huang W. Liu J. Chen Z. Zhao G. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These mutations have not been found in Caucasian families of European decent diagnosed with DGI-II (12MacDougall M. Thiemann F. Ta H. Hsu P. Chen L.S. Snead M.L. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 22: 71-77Google Scholar). These data suggest the presence of other genes synthesized by the odontoblasts and expressed during dentinogenesis, residing within the gene cluster. In our efforts to better describe the molecular mechanisms by which odontoblasts control dentin homeostasis, a subtractive cDNA library was constructed to identify genes that were differentially expressed in rat immortalized odontoblast cells (T4-4) versus osteoblastic cells (MC3T3-E1) (13Hao J. He G. Narayanan K. Zou B. Lin L. Muni T. Ramachandran A. George A. Bone. 2005; 37: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This paper describes the identification and characterization of a novel gene obtained using this technique. In keeping with the systematic nomenclature in our laboratory, we have assigned the name DMP4 to the protein and the corresponding gene as DMP4. The results from this study suggest that DMP4 might function during odontoblast differentiation and dentin matrix formation. Odontoblast and Osteoblast Cell Culture—The immortalized rat odontoblast, T4-4 (14Hao J. Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. He G. Almushayt A. Evans C. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19976-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and mouse preosteoblastic cells, MC3T3-E1, were cultured separately with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Celgro). These cells were grown to subconfluence, and poly(A)+ RNA was extracted using a FastTrack Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Suppressive Subtractive Hybridization and Cloning of Fulllength Mouse DMP4—Suppressive subtractive hybridization screen was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Briefly mRNA from T4-4 cells was used as a “tester” and mRNA from MC3T3-E1 cells was used as a “driver.” From this screen, we identified a partial cDNA sequence (450 bp) that corresponded to a partial coding region of mouse DMP4 (13Hao J. He G. Narayanan K. Zou B. Lin L. Muni T. Ramachandran A. George A. Bone. 2005; 37: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The upstream sequence was obtained from mouse tooth germ mRNA by performing a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique (Clontech) utilizing a series of gene-specific oligonucleotide primers. The complete mouse nucleotide sequence was deposited in the GenBank™ (accession number AY778962). RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—For conventional Northern blot analysis, poly(A) RNA (2 μg) from T4-4 and MC3T3-E1 cells or total RNA (10 μg) from adult mouse tissues were isolated and fractionated by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and blotted onto Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Mouse full-length DMP4 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random labeling system (Ambion). Hybridization was performed in ExpressHyb hybridization buffer (Clontech) at 68 °C overnight. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 20 min; washed twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 56 °C for 30 min; and exposed to x-ray film at –80 °C overnight. The density of each band was quantified by a Kodak digital imaging system. Expression of DMP4 during Mineralized Nodule Formation—The mineralization microenvironment was created by treating T4-4 cells at passage 35 (80–90% confluent) with 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate along with 10 nm dexamethasone for 45 days. mRNA was extracted from the T4-4 cells at 0, 15, 30, and 45 days and subjected to Northern blot analysis to check the expression of DMP4 and other dentin matrix proteins during mineralized nodule formation. In Situ Hybridization—The 3-kb full-length DMP4 cDNA was linearized for in vitro transcription using appropriate enzymes. The antisense and sense cRNA were prepared by in vitro transcription using T3 or T7 polymerase (Promega) in the presence of 35S-labeled dUTP (ICN). The radiolabeled probes were hydrolyzed to a final length of ∼300 bp. The experimental protocol for hybridization was conducted as described before (15Hao J. Zou B. Narayanan K. George A. Bone. 2004; 34: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, tissues from 3-day-old postnatal mice were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, at 4 °C, washed overnight with PBS at 4 °C, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5 μm were cut, mounted on charged glass slides, dewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated. After washing in PBS these sections were digested with 200 milliunits/ml proteinase K, postfixed, and acetylated with 0.25% acetic anhydride. The sections were hybridized overnight at 55 °C with radiation-labeled riboprobes. After hybridization, the sections were washed with 50% formamide, 2× SSC (0.3 m NaCl containing 0.03 sodium citrate) for 30 min at 55 °C, digested with RNase A, washed once with 2× SSC, and washed twice with 0.2× SSC for 20 min at 55 °C. The signal was visualized with NBT2 silver emulsion (Kodak). The developed slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin, dehydrated, and mounted. The corresponding sense probes served as negative controls. Establishment of C3H10T1/2, HAT-7, and MC3T3-E1 Stable Cell Lines Transfected with DMP4—The entire coding sequence of DMP4 cDNA was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and inserted into a mammalian expression vector p3XFLAG-CMV-14 (pCMV) (Sigma) containing cytomegalovirus promoter with a 3XFLAG epitope tag at the C terminus (pCMV-DMP4). The subcloned cDNA fragment was confirmed by sequencing. Transfections were performed in 6-well culture plates containing either C3H10T1/2 (embryonic mesenchymal mouse cell-line), HAT-7(undifferentiated mouse ameloblast cell-line) (16Harada H. Ichimori Y.

Matsumoto S. Tanaka J. Taniguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2257-2262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), or MC3T3-E1 cells (mouse preosteoblast cell line). pCMV-DMP4 or the mock vector (pCMV) was transfected into cells by lipofection using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were incubated in a maintenance medium containing 700 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The drug-resistant cells were isolated after 2 weeks. To confirm the overexpression of DMP4 in the transfected cells, we performed Northern blot, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Generation of DMP4 Knockdown Stable Cell Lines—Three target sequences of the mouse DMP4 gene were selected and designed using DHARMACON software (siRNA 793–811, siRNA 1057–1075, and siRNA 1836–1854). The oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT DNA (Coralvill, IA), annealed, and inserted into the pSIREN (Clontech) vector to generate three shRNAs. All three plasmids were tested for down-regulation of DMP4 expression by transient transfection with RT-PCR analysis (supplemental Fig. S4). One mDMP4-siRNA (siRNA 1836–1854) was selected for all experiements based on knockdown of DMP4 expression level. The sequence of the small hairpin mDMP4 (DMP4-shRNA) was as follows: sense, 5′-gatccACCGAATCCTGGACATCATTTCAAGAGAATGATGTCCAGGATTCGGTTTTTTTACGCGTg-3′; antisense, 5′-aattcACGCGTAAAAAAACCGAATCCTGGACATCATTCTCTTGAAATGATGTCCAGGATTCGGTg-3′. The sequence was designed to target mDMP4 at ACCGAATCCTGGACATCAT (position in gene sequence: nucleotides 1836–1854). Vector with scrambled shRNA was also constructed to serve as a control (Control-shRNA). The scrambled shRNA has been tested by BD Clontech and does not match with any known gene sequences. All three cell lines overexpressing DMP4, namely C3H10T1/2, HAT-7, and MC3T3-E1, were transfected with pSIREN-DMP4-shRNA and pSIREN-control-shRNA, respectively, by lipofection as mentioned above. The transfected cells were selected with culture medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Cellgro) for 2 weeks. Western blot and RT-PCR were used to analyze gene silencing efficacy (see Figs. 2 and 7a), and the functional effect of siRNA was evaluated by mineralized nodule formation assay (Fig. 7b).FIGURE 7a, expression of odontoblastic and osteoblastic biochemical markers in DMP4 overexpressing cell lines. Stably transfected cell lines were analyzed by RT-PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lanes 1, stable C3H10T1/2, HAT-7, and MC3T3-E1 cell lines overexpressing DMP4; lanes 2, mock C3H10T1/2, HAT-7, and MC3T3-E1; lanes 3, DMP4 overexpressed cells stably transfected with the DMP4 shRNA. PCR products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel, and odontoblast and osteoblast markers were identified. A densitometric representation of the RT-PCR data is shown in the panel ab. b, DMP4 overexpression and mineralization in different cell lines with von Kossa staining. The mineralized nodule formed after 45 days was photographed with a Nikon camera.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RT-PCR and Expression of Matrix Genes—DNase I (RNase-free, RQ1; Promega)-treated RNA was used for all RT-PCRs. 3 μg of total RNA from stably transfected and mock cells was reverse transcribed for 90 min at 42 °C with Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR Supermix (Invitrogen) was used in all of the PCRs. Primers for the matrix genes used in the PCR were designed from available sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information gene data bank (supplemental Fig. S1). The PCR products were verified either by sequencing or by restriction mapping. Western Blot Analysis—Stably transfected cells with DMP4 were cultured in 6-well plates (Nunc) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When cultures were 80% confluent, the serum-containing medium was replaced with serum-free medium (Invitrogen) followed by further culturing at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 3 days. Total protein was extracted from the cells and medium as described by Harlow and Lane (18Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1998: 421-470Google Scholar), and the concentration was estimated by Bradford micro assay (Bio-Rad). 20 μg of the total protein was fractionated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Transfer of proteins to nitrocellulose was performed according to Towbin et al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). The blots were incubated with polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) and then with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Sigma). The blots were washed with distilled water and then developed in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Immunohistochemical Analysis—For immunostaining, 50% confluent stably transfected cells from the second passage were grown on coverslips and fixed with paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were incubated with anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody in the presence of 5% BSA for 4 h. Upon washing with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody (fluorescent labeled) for 2 h. The coverslips were then mounted and observed under laser confocal microscope (Zeiss; LSM 510). Oregon, propidium iodide, and Hoechst dye were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene). von Kossa Staining for Mineralized Nodules—The C3H10T1/2, HAT-7, and MC3T3-E1 cells or stable transfected cells that were allowed to undergo differentiation under mineralization conditions (45 days in culture) were fixed with 10% formalin in neutral buffer (Sigma) for 15 min. The slides were washed with distilled water and then treated with 1% AgNO3 for 1 h, washed again with distilled water, and treated with 2.5% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min. The specimens were then examined under a light microscope. Postnatal day 3, rat head was used as positive control. Expression and Purification of Recombinant DMP4—Mouse DMP4 protein spanning the entire coding region was expressed in bacteria using pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) (20Srinivasan R. Chen B. Gorski J.P. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recombinant Escherichia coli BL-21 cells containing mouse DMP4 gene (pGEX4T3/mDMP4) were grown in 50 ml of LB media with 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight. This seed culture was inoculated in 1 liter of LB (without ampicillin) and incubated on a shaker for 2 h. The cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Fisher) and grown further for 4 h. The cells were then centrifuged and lysed by sonication, and the expressed protein was purified using glutathione S-transferase fusion protein purification method as per the manufacturer's protocol. The protein was either eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads using 10 mm reduced glutathione or after digestion (on column) with 1 unit of thrombin/100 μg of protein (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min at 37 °C. In the case of thrombin digestion, the protein was eluted in 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Fisher) in PBS. The eluted protein was subjected to dialysis for 30 h at 4 °C with three successive changes against 0.5× PBS. 45Ca Binding Assay—The 45Ca binding assay was based on the procedure described previously (3He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Specifically, 1 μg of recombinant DMP4 protein was dotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and washed with a solution containing 60 mm KCl and 10 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4, four times at 15 min each. Afterward, the membrane was incubated in the same buffer containing 1 mCi/liter of 45CaCl2 for 15 min, then rinsed with 50% ethanol for 10 min, and air-dried. Autoradiographs of the membrane were obtained by exposure of the dried membrane to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film overnight. Recombinant DMP1, calmodulin, and BSA were used, in equivalent amounts, as controls. Far-UV Circular Dichroism—The spectra were obtained using 5 mm recombinant DMP4 in 0.1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, or the same buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2 in a 1-mm-pathlength cell at 20 °C. The data were collected at 0.5-nm intervals at 2 nm/min. Five such runs were averaged and smoothened using the accompanying software program (3He G. Dahl T. Veis A. George A. Nat. Mater. 2003; 2: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Cloning and Characterization of the Primary Structure of DMP4—We had previously reported the construction of an odontoblast-enriched cDNA library using the suppressive subtractive hybridization technique (13Hao J. He G. Narayanan K. Zou B. Lin L. Muni T. Ramachandran A. George A. Bone. 2005; 37: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One such gene present in this enriched pool is a previously undescribed 450-bp fragment named DMP4. Primers were made, and a full-length fragment was obtained from the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product of mouse tooth germ mRNA. This 3018-bp fragment contained an open reading frame of 1740 bp flanked by 536 and 742 bp of untranslated sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (Fig. 1). These sequences were also confirmed in a mouse IMAGE clone 5101405 obtained from ATCC that contained the full-length DMP4. Sequence similarity was verified using the GenBank™ data base. Delineation of the corresponding genomic locus was enabled by BLAST searches of the mouse genome sequence (www.ensembl.org). The gene is located on chromosome 5G2 (syntenic to human chromosome region 7p22). Protein expression and Western blot analysis identified a single 66-kDa band, and this corresponded to the full-length open reading frame of mouse DMP4 (Fig. 2). Bioinformatic analysis of the primary sequence using CBS Signal P V2.0 World Wide Web Prediction Server at the Center for Biological Sequence (www.cbs.dtu.dk) indicated the presence of a signal peptide cleavage site between residues 26 and 27 (Fig. 1). The calculated pI is 7.10, hence different from the other DMPs. Of the 579 amino acids, only 111 residues are comprised of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serines. DMP4 also contains one RGD site located at position 530 in humans (accession number AAQ09019) and at position 150 in rat (accession number XP_221975). Three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, four tyrosine sulfation sites, and 11 cysteine residues were also identified (Table 1). The other characteristic protein domains that might be of functional importance include one Greek key domain (21Rajini B. Shridas P. Sundari C.S. Muralidhar D. Chandani S. Thomas F. Sharma Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38464-38471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and one conserved domain in all species examined thus far (22Nalbant D. Youn H. Nalbant S.I. Sharma S. Cobos E. Beale E.G. Du Y. Williams S.C. BMC Genomics. 2005; 6: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This conserved region is designated as the conserved C-terminal domain, and it is listed in the C-terminal domain at NCBI as DUF1193. So far, no function has been attributed to this domain.TABLE 1Characterization of the predicted mouse DMP4 amino acid sequenceAmino acid positionDescription1-26Signal peptide27Cleavage site530 (human), 150 (rat)RGD site, cell attachment sequence96, 330, 465N-Glycosylation site296, 300, 420, 430Tyrosine sulfation sites21, 46, 48, 357, 362, 366, 373, 421, 495, 496, 554Cysteine residue Open table in a new tab To further investigate the significance of DMP4 expression in the dentin matrix, we determined whether this gene was conserved in other species. Human (EAL23705) and rat (XP_221975) full-length cDNAs and a partial cDNA from bovine (XP_601319) have been submitted to GenBank™. Overall amino acid homology between different species is high; for example, human and mouse amino acid sequences have a 69% homology (73% similar) (supplemental Fig. S2), rat and mouse are 90% homologous, and bovine and mouse sequences are 59% homologous (71% similar). In addition, a similar sequence was found in the genomes of chimpanzee, Caenorhabditis elegens, dog, Drosophila, Fugu rubripes, red jungle fowl, and tetraodon. DMP4 Is a Secretory Protein—Signal sequences are commonly found on proteins that are directed to the endoplasmic reticulum and either retained there or processed and transported into the Golgi apparatus and secreted from the cell. Many proteins are glycosylated during their transit through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and the mouse DMP4 protein contains three potential sites for N-glycosylation (Table 1) and might be glycosylated during the transport process. Because DMP4 does not contain an endoplasmic reticulum retention signal, we predicted that it should be detected in the medium of expressing cells; therefore, a mammalian expression vector was constructed that contained the full-length mouse DMP4 coding sequence fused to a C-terminal 3X FLAG tag. The plasmid was transfected into three cell lines: a mouse multipotential mesenchymal cell line (C3H10T1/2), a dental epithelial cell line (HAT-7), and a preosteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1). Higher expression levels of DMP4 mRNA were detected in all three transfected cell lines by Northern blot (supplemental Fig. S3). Total protein was isolated from both the cells and the cell medium. Both protein samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-serum specific for the 3X FLAG epitope. The molecular mass of the processed form of mDMP4 was determined to be 66 kDa (Fig. 2). We then demonstrated the subcellular localization of the mDMP4 protein in the three DMP4 overexpressing cell lines and the control mock cells using anti-FLAG antibody. All three transfected cells displayed perinuclear and cytoplasmic staining consistent with endoplasmic reticulum localization (Fig. 3, arrowhead). In contrast, in the control mock cells DMP4 was exclusively localized within the cytoplasm. DMP4 Expression in Vivo and during Tooth Development—Tissue expression of DMP4 was then determined by Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization techniques using a mouse model. Northern blot detected DMP4 at very high expression level in the dental pulp-odontoblast complex. This level of expression was in concurrence with the data obtained from T4-4 odontoblast cell line, which was 10 times higher when compared with the expression in both precursor and fully differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 4A). It was also moderately expressed in bone, and low levels were present in kidney, liver, brain, and lung. No expression or very low expression levels were detected in spleen and skeletal muscle (Fig. 4B). The size of the message of mDMP4 in all tissues was confirmed to be about 3.0 kb. In situ hybridization results performed on sagital sections of postnatal 3-day-old mice with antisense DMP4 probe showed high expression levels in the differentiated odontoblasts (Fig. 5, arrow). Expression was also detected in the ameloblasts (Fig. 5, arrowhead) and osteoblasts in alveolar bone (Fig. 5, asterisk). However, the amount was lower than that in odontoblasts. No expression was detected in the dental pulp. Sense probe was used as a control, and no expression was observed (data not shown). Overexpression of DMP4 Accelerates Odontoblast Differentiation Process and Mineralized Nodule Formation—To monitor changes in the DMP4 mRNA expression levels during the mineralization of T4-4 in vitro, the cells were cultured in the presence of differentiation medium containing ascorbic acid, β-glycerophosphate, and dexamethasone for 45 days. Results from the Northern blot analysis demonstrated a steady increase in DMP4 mRNA expression during terminal differentiation of odontoblasts (Fig. 6). This process led to an up-regulation of the differentiation markers for odontoblasts namely DSPP and DMP2. However, fully differentiated MC3T3 cells expressed low amounts of DMP4 (Fig. 4A). Gain of function studies were performed to elucidate the function of DMP4 in dentin biomineralization. Stable clones overexpressing DMP4 were used in this study. Gene expression analyses by RT-PCR during the differentiation of overexpressed DMP4 cells with that of control mock cells were first compared. Expression of alkaline phosphatase, which is known to be synthesized during the early phase of odontoblast differentiation, was constitutively seen before and after induction, and the expression was not significantly different between overexpressing cells and mock cells (Fig. 7a). However, expression of DMP1 and DSPP, molecular markers of terminally differentiated odontoblasts, was strongly expressed in overexpressing cells and not in mock cells. We also performed cell nodule formation assays and compared the mineralization rate by von Kossa staining techniques. Results demonstrate that von Kossa staining was sign"
https://openalex.org/W2077401555,"Heterotrimeric G proteins play a central role in intracellular communication mediated by extracellular signals, and both Gα and Gβγ subunits regulate effectors downstream of activated receptors. The particular constituents of the G protein heterotrimer affect both specificity and efficiency of signal transduction. However, little is known about mechanistic aspects of G protein assembly in the cell that would certainly contribute to formation of heterotrimers of specific composition. It was recently shown that phosducin-like protein (PhLP) modulated both Gβγ expression and subsequent signaling by chaperoning nascent Gβ and facilitating heterodimer formation with Gγ subunits (Lukov, G. L., Hu, T., McLaughlin, J. N., Hamm, H. E., and Willardson, B. M. (2005) EMBO J. 24, 1965-1975; Humrich, J., Bermel, C., Bunemann, M., Harmark, L., Frost, R., Quitterer, U., and Lohse, M. J. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 20042-20050). Here we demonstrate using a variety of techniques that DRiP78, an endoplasmic reticulum resident protein known to regulate the trafficking of several seven transmembrane receptors, interacts specifically with the Gγ subunit but not Gβ or Gα subunits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DRiP78 and the Gβ subunit can compete for the Gγ subunit. DRiP78 also protects Gγ from degradation until a stable partner such as Gβ is provided. Furthermore, DRiP78 interaction may represent a mechanism for assembly of specific Gβγ heterodimers, as selectivity was observed among Gγ isoforms for interaction with DRiP78 depending on the presence of particular Gβ subunits. Interestingly, we could detect an interaction between DRiP78 and PhLP, suggesting a role of DRiP78 in the assembly of Gβγ by linking Gγ to PhLP·Gβ complexes. Our results, therefore, suggest a role of DRiP78 as a chaperone in the assembly of Gβγ subunits of the G protein."
https://openalex.org/W2004984431,"Subjective awareness may depend on neural networks in the brain supporting complex wiring schemes and dynamic patterns of activity. In a Connections essay, György Buzsáki outlines a theory to explain how the brain's neuronal circuits support its cognitive capacities. In this model, environmental inputs are seen as perturbations of ongoing spontaneous neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. If an event perturbs this activity for a sufficiently long time in a big enough population of neurons, it is noticed. That is, we become conscious of it. But the locally organized cerebellar cortex, used largely for sensorimotor integration, does not generate spontaneous activity, and its response to input is local and non-persistent. We remain unaware of such local computations."

Our robust (2σ) upper limit on the percentage of polarization, less than 8%, coincides with the fireball deceleration time at the onset of the afterglow. The combination of the rate of decay of the optical brightness and the low polarization at this critical time constrains standard models of GRB ejecta, ruling out the presence of a large-scale ordered magnetic field in the emitting region."
https://openalex.org/W1966128026,"Thrombopoietin (Tpo) is a glycoprotein growth factor that supports hematopoietic stem cell survival and expansion and is the principal regulator of megakaryocyte growth and differentiation. Several small, nonpeptidyl molecules have been identified as selective human Tpo receptor (hTpoR) agonists. To understand how the small molecule Tpo mimic SB394725 interacts and activates hTpoR, we performed receptor domain swap and mutagenesis studies. The results suggest that SB394725 interacts specifically with the extracellular juxtamembrane region (JMR) and the transmembrane (TM) domain of hTpoR. Solution and solid-state NMR structural studies using a peptide containing the JMR-TM sequences showed that this region of hTpoR, unexpectedly, consists of two α-helices separated by a few nonhelical residues. SB394725 interacts specifically with His-499 in the TM domain and a few distinct residues in the JMR-TM region and affects several specific C-terminal TM domain residues.

Binding of Tpo to Tpo receptor (TpoR) triggers activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases JAK2 and TYK2, which in turn results in the activation of STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (1Kuter D.J.

Activation of these signaling pathways results in changes in gene regulation, which are thought to promote progression of the TpoR-expression cells along the megakaryocytic pathway. TpoR is a member of the type I cytokine receptor family, which consists of an extracellular cytokine binding domain, a single transmembrane (TM) domain and a cytoplasmic domain. TpoR is most closely related to erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR). Considerable evidence suggests that dimerization and conformational change are the essential processes that lead to cytokine/growth factor receptor activation (7Constantinescu S.N. Keren T.

Structural studies of EpoR-interacting peptides with a range of activities have revealed that the dimerized EpoR extracellular domain has to be in the correct orientation for downstream signaling events to occur, indicating that receptor dimerization alone is not sufficient to drive receptor activation (12Stauber D.J. Yu M. Wilson I.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 2003; 1 (Elsevier, New York): 251-258Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that EpoR and the growth hormone receptor exist as dimerized but inactive receptors in the absence of ligands (12Stauber D.J. Yu M. Wilson I.A. Handbook of Cell Signaling. 2003; 1 (Elsevier, New York): 251-258Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 13Gent J. van Kerkhof P. Roza M. Bu G. Strous G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The isolated TM domain of the EpoR was shown to dimerize, suggesting that the TM domain may be involved in ligand-independent receptor dimerization (7Constantinescu S.N. Keren T. Socolovsky M. Nam H.

In addition, the TM domain may also play a key role in mediating receptor activation, as demonstrated by the constitutively active TM domain mutants of the mouse EpoR (mEpoR), human G-CSFR (hG-CSFR), and human TpoR (hTpoR) (14Kubatzky K.F.

SB394725 is a previously identified hTpoR-specific ligand with an unknown mechanism of action that activates Tpo signaling pathways and promotes differentiation of primary human bone marrow cells to megakaryocytes with an efficacy equivalent to that of recombinant hTpo (3Erickson-Miller C.L. DeLorme E. Tian S.S. Hopson C.B. Stark K. Giampa L. Valoret E.I. Duffy K.J. Luengo J.L. Rosen J. Miller S.G. Dillon S.B. Lamb P. Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). By performing hTpoR domain swap and mutagenesis studies and using combinatorial approaches of solution and solid-state NMR, we have demonstrated that SB394725 interacts specifically with His-499 in the TM domain and a few distinct residues in the extracellular JMR and the TM domain of the hTpoR. Plasmid Constructs—To generate a STAT response element-containing reporter construct, an oligonucleotide containing eight copies of the STAT response element from the IRF-1 gene promoter (5′-TGGTCCTGGGAATCTGCCTACATC-3′) was synthesized and cloned into the pGL2-basic vector. Full-length cDNAs of hTpoR and hG-CSFR were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from human bone marrow RNA and cloned into the pcDNA3.1/hygro(+) vector. Chimeric receptor constructs were generated by using a PCR-based bridging technique. Briefly, hTpoR and hG-CSFR cDNAs were used as templates to generate G(T)G, G(13 + T)G and T(T)G constructs with a set of primers for each construct. Each primer set contained a forward primer that annealed to the sequence corresponding to the N terminus of the chimeric construct and a reverse primer that annealed to the sequence corresponding to the C terminus of the chimeric construct and a pair of bridging primers that annealed to both the sequences corresponding to the N and C termini of the constructs. The forward and reverse primers for constructs G(T)G and G(13 + T)G were 5′-GTAAGCTTATGGCAAGGCTGGGAAACTGCAGC-3′ and 5′-GACTCGAGCTAGTCCCCCTGGAGCACATAGGTC T-3′, respectively. The forward and reverse primers for construct T(T)G were 5′-ACGATATCATGGTCACCTCCTGCCTCCTC-3′ and 5′-AGCCTCGAGTCAAGGCTGCTGCCAATAGCT-3′, respectively. The bridging primers for constructs G(T)G, G(T + 13)G, and T(T)G were 5′-CTTGACCCCAGAGGGGTCGGAGTGGATCTCCTTGGTGACCGCTC-3′, 5′-GCCACCAACAGTACAGTCCTCACCCTGATGACCGACCCAACTAGGGTGGAGACC GCCACCGAGACCGCC-3′, and 5′-GTCCTGGGCCTGCTGCTGCTGAGCCCCAACAAGAATCCC-3′, respectively. The resulting PCR products were purified and inserted into the HindIII and XhoI sites for constructs G(T)G and G(13 + T)G and into the EcoRV and XhoI sites for construct T(T)G. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. A pair of primers containing CAC or CAT at the corresponding Leu residue was used to generate the His mutants. Primer pairs containing GCT, GCC, GCA, or GCG at the designated site for alanine substitution were used to generate mutant receptors for alanine-scanning mutagenesis study. The cDNA construct containing the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide was generated from a pair of synthesized, codon-optimized (for Escherichia coli expression) oligomers containing the JMR-TM sequences of hTpoR from Asp-479 to Ala-519. The oligonucleotides were annealed (in 40 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl) and ligated to AlwNI-digested pET-31b(+) vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) by using a Quick Change ligation kit (New England Biolabs). All of the constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. Cell Lines and Cell-based Assay—HepG2 cells were maintained in regular tissue culture-treated flasks. Cells were routinely passed through a 21G1 gauge needle twice to break apart the multicell aggregates during cell passage. The various chimeric or mutant receptor constructs and the RE1.pGL2 luciferase reporter were co-transfected into HepG2 cells using FuGENE 6 at a DNA ratio of 4:1. The transiently transfected cells were resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + penicillin-streptavidin + glutamate supplemented with 0.2% of AlbuMaxII and seeded into 96-well clear bottom plates at 50,000 cells/well. After 16–18 h of serum starvation, the transfected cells were treated with or without varying concentrations of SB394725 (synthesized in-house according to the published synthetic route (18Duffy K.J.

BrightGlo was diluted to 60% and added 1:1 to the treated cells, and the plates were read on an Acquest plate reader to detect the luminescence signal. Recombinant hTpo and hG-CSF proteins were obtained from R & D Systems. The results were processed and graphed using PRIZM software (Houston, TX). hTpoR-(479–519) Peptide Expression and Purification—The hTpoR-(479–519) peptide was expressed and purified according to the protocol of Park et al. (19Park S.H. Mrse A.A. Nevzorov A.A. Mesleh M.F. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Opella S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide was expressed as a ketosteroid isomerase fusion protein in BLR(DE3)pLysS E. coli cells by growing the cells to A600 nm = 0.8 and then inducing with a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The fusion peptide was purified in the inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The ketosteroid isomerase and His tags were cleaved using a cyanogen bromide chemical reaction, and the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (Waters Delta 600 chromatographic system, Milford, MA) on a Delta-Pak C4 column. Uniformly 15N-labeled peptide was obtained by growing the bacterial culture in M9 minimal medium with (15NH4)2SO4 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory, Andover, MA) as the sole nitrogen source. For the selectively 15N-labeled peptides, the M9 culture medium with unlabeled (NH4)2SO4 was supplemented with 100–500 mg/liter of the 19 unlabeled amino acids and 100 mg/liter of the 15N-labeled Val and Leu (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory). The purity of the peptide was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Sample Preparation—For solution NMR experiments, 15N-labeled hTpoR-(479–519) peptides were dissolved in 400 μlof micelle solution that contained 100 mm deuterated DHPC (1,2-dihexanoly-sn-glycero-3-phsphocholine) (Cambridge Isotope Laboratory) and 10% (v/v) 2H2O at pH 3.6 to a final concentration of 0.5–1.0 mm. Weakly aligned samples were prepared by soaking the solution NMR sample into a dried 5% polyacrylamide gel overnight. The initial gel length of 28 mm was restricted to 20 mm in the Shigemi microcell NMR sample tube (Shigemi Inc., Allison Park, PA). For measurement of the chemical shift perturbations, SB394725 was added directly into 400 μlofthe solution NMR sample to a final concentration of 5 mm SB394725, and then the pH of the mixture was readjusted to pH 3.6. For solid-state NMR experiments, phospholipid bicelle samples were prepared by dissolving 15N-labeled hTpoR-(479–519) peptide in the short-chain lipid 1,2-O-dihexyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (6-O-PC) and then adding this mixture to the long-chain lipid 1,2-O-ditetradecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (14-O-PC) or 1,2-O-dihexadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (16-O-PC) (Avanti Polar lipid Inc. Alabaster, AL). The peptide/lipid mixture was vortexed and taken through repeated freezing and heating cycles until it formed a clear solution. The bicelle sample for q = 3.2 with 28% (w/v) of lipid concentration (cL) was ∼300 mm in 14-O-PC in a 200-μl volume at pH 4.0. A flat-bottomed NMR tube of 5 mm outer diameter (New Era Enterprises, Vineland, NJ) was filled with 160 μl of the bicelle solution using a precooled glass pipette. The NMR tube was sealed with a tight-fitting rubber cap and pierced with a thin syringe to remove residual air from the sample to create a tight seal. Samples of thicker bicelles, composed of 16-O-PC and 6-O-PC with q = 3.0 and cL = 28% (w/v) were prepared similarly. Parallel bicelle samples were prepared by adding YbCl3·6H2O (Sigma) directly to the samples in the NMR tube to a final concentration of 3 mm YbCl3·6H2O. Solution NMR Spectroscopy—The solution NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker DRX 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance cryogenic probe and z-axis gradient at a temperature of 45 °C. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra were obtained using the uniformly and selectively 15N-labeled samples at protein concentrations of 0.3–1.0 mm. The two-dimensional 1H-15N heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence-nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and three-dimensional 1H-15N nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy-HSQC spectra were obtained using a 250-ms mixing time. The sensitivity-enhanced in-phase and anti-phase HSQC spectra obtained on isotropic and weakly aligned samples were used to measure the 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings. The NMR data were processed using the NMRPipe/NMRDraw and NMRView programs (20Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar). The chemical shift perturbations by the addition of compounds were calculated using the formula Δδ = √{(ΔCSH)2 + (ΔCSN/5)2}/2. Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy—The solid-state NMR experiments were performed on spectrometers with a 1H resonance frequency of 900 or 750 MHz, consisting of a Bruker Avance console and Magnex magnet and room temperature shims. All bicelle samples were equilibrated for at least 30 min prior to the NMR experiments in the magnetic field at 40 °C. Double-resonance 1H-15N probes were used in the experiments. A radio-frequency strength of B1 = 50 kHz was used for 1H irradiation during acquisition and a 1-ms cross-polarization mixing time was applied for one-dimensional 1H-15N cross-polarization (CP). CP-MOIST (21Levitt M.H. Suter D. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1986; 84: 4243-4255Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar) was used for cross-polarization to compensate for power mismatch. Typical parameters were a 6-s recycle delay and 1-K scans with 5–10 ms of acquisition time for the one-dimensional experiments. The two-dimensional PISEMA spectra of uniformly 15N-labeled samples were obtained from a total of 64 t1 increments and 512 t2 complex points with 128 scans for each t1 increment. The frequency jumps (to satisfy the Lee-Goldburg off-resonance irradiation for PISEMA experiments) were 35.4 kHz. The optimal 1H carrier position was determined experimentally to be ∼9 ppm, which agreed with the prediction for the TM helices based on the typical position chosen for mechanically oriented bilayers parallel to the static field (∼3 ppm) and taking into account the 90° orientation and the bicelle order parameters. Dipolar Wave Analysis and Structure Calculation—The experimentally measured residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were analyzed by MATLAB software to identify helical regions as described elsewhere (22Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. Van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 23Ding K.Y. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 163: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The RDCs from the overlapped peaks were excluded for the analysis. The 1H-15N RDCs were fitted to sinusoids of a periodicity of 3.6 to characterize the length, curvature, relative orientation, and rotation of α-helices within the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide. Unconstrained nonlinear optimization was used to fit the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid with a periodicity of 3.6, and residues were designated as a part of a continuous helix if they fitted within the average error of the measurements (0.5 Hz). The software program X-PLOR-NIH (24Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar) was used to calculate the three-dimensional structures from the experimental data by using a basic simulated annealing protocol. An extended template was annealed against dihedral angle restraints with a 300-kcal/K force constant in the α-helical regions of the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide identified by dipolar wave fitting. As described in the rdcpot module of X-PLOR-NIH, the harmonic restraints for the 1H-15N RDCs were introduced with a linear increase of force constant from 0.01 to 7 kcal Hz-1 K-1 as the temperature was lowered to 25 K over 120 ps with a fixed error bound of 0.5 Hz/coupling. A Pgyr potential was applied in the calculation of the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide at a force constant of 50 kcal mol-1 Aå-2, and further optimization was performed. The accepted structures have violations of RDCs <0.5 Hz and deviation of dihedral angles <10° from those determined by dipolar wave fitting. One structural family was chosen from the accepted structures that supported the orientation of two helices as determined by solid-state NMR experiments. We generated chimeric receptor constructs containing different regions of the hTpoR and hG-CSFR to identify the sequence requirements for SB394725 activity. A cellular assay based on a luciferase reporter gene construct driven by STAT response elements derived from the IRF-1 promoter (STATRE-luc) (3Erickson-Miller C.L. DeLorme E. Tian S.S. Hopson C.B. Stark K. Giampa L. Valoret E.I. Duffy K.J. Luengo J.L. Rosen J. Miller S.G. Dillon S.B. Lamb P. Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate the activity of SB394725. The receptor constructs were co-transfected with the STATRE-luc plasmid into HepG2 cells, and the activity of SB394725 was measured (Fig. 1A). The activity of SB394725 was independent of the cytoplasmic domain sequence of hTpoR as shown by the robust activation of the chimeric receptor T(T)G, whose cytoplasmic domain consisted only of the hG-CSFR sequences, specifically the N-terminal portion with the STAT3 recruitment site. Substitution of the TM domain sequence of hTpoR with that of the hG-CSFR sequence resulted in the loss of activation of the chimeric receptor T(G)G by SB394725. These results suggested that the hTpoR TM domain is either involved in interaction with SB394725 or is required for productive conformational changes induced by binding of SB394725 to hTpoR. SB394725 activated the hG-CSFR chimeric receptor (G(T)G), which contains the hTpoR TM domain and G(13 + T)G, which contains 13 residues of the extracellular JMR and TM of the hTpoR in a Zn2+-dependent manner, with the G(13 + T)G chimera showing an equivalent SB394725 activity as the T(T)G chimera. These data also suggested that, in addition to the TM domain residues, the 13 amino acids in the extracellular JMR of hTpoR are likely to be involved with or influenced by interaction of the receptor with SB394725. The activity of SB394725 was reported to be specific for the human and chimpanzee TpoRs (3Erickson-Miller C.L. DeLorme E. Tian S.S. Hopson C.B. Stark K. Giampa L. Valoret E.I. Duffy K.J. Luengo J.L. Rosen J. Miller S.G. Dillon S.B. Lamb P. Exp. Hematol. 2005; 33: 85-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It was also reported that the presence of a His residue in the TM domain of the hTpoR confers species selectivity to other hTpoR-specific small molecule ligands (4Nakamura T. Miyakawa Y. Miyamura A. Yamane A. Suzuki H. Ito M. Ohnishi Y. Ishiwata N. Ikeda Y. Tsuruzoe N. Blood. 2006; 107: 4300-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Fassi A. Sangalli F. Maffi R. Colombi F. Mohamed E.I. Brenner B.M. Remuzzi G. Remuzzi A. Blood. 1996; 88: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). None of the other type I cytokine receptors examined, including hG-CSFR, contains a His residue in the TM domain (Fig. 1B). The significance of this TM domain His-499 residue in conferring SB394725 selectivity was demonstrated by the loss of activity of a mutant hTpoR containing a H499L mutation (Fig. 1C). Our results from the domain swap and mutagenesis studies suggested that the extracellular JMR-TM region of hTpoR plays a key role in interacting with SB394725. To understand the agonist activity of SB394725, we studied its interaction with the extracellular JMR-TM domain of hTpoR by solution and solid-state NMR using a 41-residue hTpoR-(479–519) polypeptide, which consists of 13 extracellular JMR residues, 22 predicted TM domain residues, and 6 cytoplasmic JMR residues (Fig. 2A). The uniformly 15N-labeled hTpoR-(479–519) peptide formed a homogeneous preparation in DHPC micelles (Fig. 2B) (26Opella S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 845-848PubMed Google Scholar). The limited dispersion of frequencies in the 1H chemical shift dimension of the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum suggests that the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide comprises primarily the α-helix, as the TM domains of type I cytokine receptors are predicted to form a single rigid α-helical structure (27Kubatzky K.F.

The predicted α-helix of the hTpoR TM domain starts from Ile-492 and ends at Leu-512 (Fig. 2A). Surprisingly, two distinct α-helical regions were identified from dipolar waves that mapped the RDCs measured from the in-phase and anti-phase HSQC experiments (Fig. 2B) (28Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 29Ishii A. Markus M.A. Tycko R. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The first 7-residue amphipathic helix (Thr-487 to Ser-493) may be somewhat more mobile than the second and is connected to the second 18-residue hydrophobic helix (Thr-496 to Leu-513) by a few non-helical residues. The first four predicted TM domain residues Ile-492–Val-495 were outside the second hydrophobic helix, with residues Ile-492 and Ser-493 located at the C terminus of the first amphipathic helix and residues Leu-494 and Val-495 at the interhelical region (Fig. 2C). Solid-state NMR spectra of magnetically aligned bicelle samples were used to characterize the relative orientations of the amphipathic and hydrophobic helices of the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide. The hTpoR-(479–519) peptide was well aligned in bicelles (Fig. 3A), and the one-dimensional 15N NMR spectrum of uniformly 15N-labeled hTpoR-(479–519) peptide in the parallel bicelles (30De Angelis A.A.

The frequencies of the resonances observed in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra were consistent with the simulated spectra (Fig. 3B). Resonances from residues in the hydrophobic TM helix occur between 160 and 200 ppm, and those between 80 and 100 ppm are associated with residues in an in-plane amphipathic helix oriented nearly parallel to the membrane surface. The resonance intensity near the isotropic frequency (120 ppm) is likely from the unstructured residues at the N and C termini of the polypeptide. The two-dimensional experimental PISEMA spectrum (Fig. 3C) of the uniformly 15N-labeled hTpoR-(479–519) peptide has resonances in the region (85–105 ppm) expected for a hydrophobic transmembrane helix with an ∼28° tilt angle, which is consistent with the value predicted by the hydrophobic mismatch with the lipids (30De Angelis A.A.

Biol. 2005; 350: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Fig. 3D is a structural model of the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide based on the NMR data shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra enabled the identification of residues that are affected by binding to SB394725. The superimposed 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the uniformly 15N-labeled hTpoR-(479–519) peptide with and without SB394725 are shown in Fig. 4A. Binding of SB394725 affected the resonance assigned to His-499 most significantly as shown from the chemical shift changes induced by SB394725 addition (Fig. 4B). In addition to His-499, residues Glu-484, Ser-493, Leu-494, Thr-496, Val-501, Leu-504, Ala-506, Gly-509, and Leu-511 were also affected to varying degrees upon SB394725 addition. Titration of SB394725 induced gradual changes in chemical shift of the residues affected, indicating that the changes observed are induced specifically by the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide binding to SB394725 (data not shown). The NMR data indicated that His-499 and several residues in the extracellular JMR-TM region of hTpoR play a key role in interacting with SB394725. To further confirm the results, we performed an alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of residues in the extracellular JMR-TM region of hTpoR using the STATRE-luc reporter gene assay. Each alanine mutant receptor was tested for response to both SB394725 and recombinant hTpo. Because hTpo interacts specifically with the extracellular domain of hTpoR, alanine substitution in the extracellular JMR-TM region of hTpoR should not affect binding of hTpo to alanine mutant hTpoRs that expressed and folded properly on the cell surface. The results from alanine scanning were presented in Fig. 4, C (SB394725 treatment) and D (Tpo treatment). The residues sensitive to alanine substitution are Thr-485, Glu-488, Trp-491, Ile-492, Leu-494, Val-495, Leu-498, His-499, Leu-500, Leu-504, Val-507, and Leu-508. Alanine substitution of residues Thr-485, Glu-488, Trp-491, Leu-498, and Leu-508 affected activities of both SB394725 and hTpo, indicating that these residues were most likely involved in maintaining the expression levels and/or structural integrity of the hTpoR. Consequently, the results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis indicated that Ile-492, Leu-494, His-499, Leu-500, Leu-504, and Val-507 are the residues involved in interaction with SB394725. Based on the NMR data, alanine-scanning results, and the physicochemical characteristics of SB394725, we concluded that residues involved in interaction with SB394725 were located at the extracellular JMR, the interhelical region, and the N terminus of the TM domain helix. A schematic diagram showing interaction between SB394725 and the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide is presented in Fig. 4E. Because SB394725 showed strong Zn2+-dependent activity in the luciferase reporter assay, we attempted to map Zn2+-coordinating sites in the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide by identifying chemical shift perturbations in the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra upon Zn2+ addition. Zn2+ addition affected only residues Ile-492, Ser-493, and His-499 significantly (data not shown). The addition of SB394725 to the peptide-Zn2+ complex induced additional resonance shifts, most notably Ile-492, Ser-493, Thr-496, His-499, and a few other C-terminal TM domain residues. Cytokines are known to activate their respective cell-surface receptor by binding and interacting specifically with the extracellular domain of the receptor. Here we have shown that residues in the extracellular JMR-TM region of hTpoR play a crucial role in the interaction with a small molecule Tpo mimic. The unexpected role that the TM domain played in direct interaction with SB394725 and mediating hTpoR activation is consistent with previous studies suggesting that the TM domain of several cytokine receptors may be involved in ligand-independent receptor dimerization and could also play a key role in mediating receptor activation (7Constantinescu S.N.

The hTpoR extracellular JMR-TM peptide unexpectedly comprises two α-helices separated by a few non-helical residues. Kubatsky et al. reported that the first few residues of the predicted TM domain of EpoR form α-helix cap (27Kubatzky K.F. Liu W. Goldgraben K. Simmerling C. Smith S.O. Constantinescu S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14844-14854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistent with their observation, Ile-492–Val-495 (the first four predicted TM residues of hTpoR) were outside the predicted hydrophobic TM helix. However, instead of formation of a helix cap, our NMR data show that the extracellular JMR of hTpoR contains a short seven-residue amphipathic helix and that the first two predicted TM residues Ile-492 and Ser-493 are a part of the amphipathic helix. We observed that binding of Zn2+ and SB394725 to the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide affected the resonances of Ile-492, Ser-493, and His-499. Interestingly, cysteine substitution of residues analogous to Ile-492 and Ser-493 in mEpoR (Leu-226 and Ile-227, respectively) was reported to result in presumed disulfide bond-mediated, constitutively active mEpoR (15Lu X. Gross A.W. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7002-7011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The collective information suggests that binding of SB394725 to hTpoR presumably brings two extracellular JMR-TM peptides into an active orientation involving residues Ile-492 and Ser-493 and is possibly facilitated by conformational flexibility of the non-helical residues located between the two α-helices. His-499 was identified as a key residue in determining the selective interaction between SB394725 and hTpoR as shown by mutagenesis studies and NMR experiments (Figs. 1 and 4). Interestingly, His-499 is not required by Tpo-induced TpoR activation (Fig. 4), indicating that His-499 is not an essential residue for the formation of a conformationally active dimeric receptor. Zn2+ addition induced a selective chemical shift perturbation of His-499, an amino acid with a known propensity for metal binding. Because SB394725 showed strong Zn2+-dependent activity, our data indicates that SB394725 presumably binds to hTpoR through Zn2+-mediated interaction with His-499. More detailed biophysical and chemical studies will be required to determine the exact stoichiometry of the SB394725·Zn2+·His-499 complex and the binding affinity of SB394725 to the extracellular JMR-TM peptide in the presence and absence of Zn2+. The NMR results showed that the addition of SB394725 induced chemical shift perturbations of the C-terminal residues of the TM domain. Because SB394725 contains a sulfonic acid moiety, it is unlikely that this charged molecule could move deeply into the highly hydrophobic TM environment. This is consistent with modeling information obtained from molecular docking of SB394725 to the hTpoR-(479–519) peptide, indicating that no significant interactions at the C terminus of the TM domain of hTpoR occurred (data not shown). Therefore, the chemical shift perturbations of the C-terminal residues Leu-504, Ala-506, Gly-509, and Leu-511–Leu-513 induced by the addition of SB394725 were most likely the result of conformational changes induced by the binding of SB394725 as opposed to direct interactions with SB394725. Taken together, our data, for the first time, provide detailed biophysical information on ligand-induced movement of cytokine receptor extracellular JMR-TM region residues and thus offer valuable insight into both the distinctive mechanism of action of SB394725 and the general mechanism of cytokine receptor activation.

In this study, we report the biochemical and genetic characterization of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rhp6 (a homolog of budding yeast Rad6), which has been shown to negatively affect stability of heterochromatic structures. We show that Rhp6 is a component of the multisubunit protein complex (termed HULC) that also contains two RING finger proteins Rfp1 and Rfp2, sharing homology with budding yeast Bre1 protein and a unique serine-rich protein Shf1. HULC is required for ubiquitination of histone H2B at lysine 119 (H2B-K119), and it localizes to heterochromatic sequences. Moreover, our analyses suggest that Rhp6-induced changes in heterochromatic silencing are mediated predominantly through H2B ubiquitination (ubH2B), and they correlate with increased RNA polymerase II levels at repeat elements embedded within heterochromatin domains. Interestingly, heterochromatic derepression caused by Rhp6 occurs independently of the involvement of HULC subunits and ubH2B in methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me). These analyses implicate ubH2B in modulation of heterochromatin, which has important implications for dynamics and many functions associated with heterochromatic structures.

Histone post-translational modifications play an important role in modulating chromatin structure that underlies various chromosomal processes in eukaryotic cells (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar, 2Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). These modifications, including acetylation, phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitination of histones, have been shown to regulate transcription, chromosome condensation, and DNA repair (1Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar, 3Osley M.A. Fleming A.B. Kao C.F. Results Probl.

Chromatin. 1989; (pp. , Springer-Verlag Inc., New York): 111-147Google Scholar). Specific histone modifications can modify chromatin structure either directly by influencing histone-DNA and/or histone-histone interactions, as suggested in the case of histone acetylation (6Hansen J.C. Tse C. Wolffe A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17637-17641Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), or mediate recruitment of other factors capable of modifying chromatin (7Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

Factors containing interaction motifs for binding to histones methylated at specific lysine residues have been identified and shown to mediate targeting of chromatin-modifying activities implicated in either activating or repressing transcription (9Schotta G. Lachner M. Peters A.H. Jenuwein T. Novartis Found. Symp. 2004; 259 (163–169): 22-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Grant P.A. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 919-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For example, histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me) recruits conserved heterochromatin protein HP1 via its chromodomain to mediate assembly of condensed heterochromatic structures (13Nakayama J. Rice J.C. Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Science. 2001; 292: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1385) Google Scholar, 14Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Partridge J.F. Miska E.A. Thomas J.O. Allshire R.C.

Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). In contrast, methylation of H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me), found at transcriptionally poised euchromatic regions, provides binding sites for PHD, chromodomain, or tudor domain-containing proteins to recruit gene activation machinery (16Mellor J.

In addition to well studied functions of histone acetylation and methylation in modulating chromatin, histone ubiquitination has emerged as an important modification for gene regulation. In particular, mono-ubiquitination of H2B (ubH2B) 2The abbreviations used are: ubH2B, ubiquitinated histone H2B; Shf, small histone ubiquitination factor; Clr, cryptic loci regulator; pol II, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II; RNAi, RNA interference; FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; WCE, whole cell extract; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; FACT, facilitates chromatin transcription; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. has been shown to play a crucial role in the maintenance of transcriptionally poised chromatin environment (3Osley M.A. Fleming A.B.

Berger S.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2004; 69: 289-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin is transferred to H2B by the sequential action of three enzymatic activities as follows: ubiquitin activating ATPase E1, conjugating E2, and ligating E3 enzymes (23Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 24Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2944) Google Scholar). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the multifunctional Rad6 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme associates with the RING finger-containing Bre1 E3 ligase to specifically direct mono-ubiquitination of H2B (25Robzyk K.

In addition to histone H2B, Rad6 targets several other factors involved in a variety of nuclear processes. For example, Rad6 associates with the Rad18 ubiquitin ligase to control post-replication DNA repair (28Bailly V. Lamb J. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 29Prakash L.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7351-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Rad6-mediated mono-ubiquitination of H2B at lysine 123 is necessary for methylation of lysine 4 and 79 of histone H3 (31Sun Z.W. Allis C.D.

A direct involvement of histone ubiquitination in gene expression is also suggested by a recent study showing that ubH2B facilitates function of the FACT complex (34Pavri R. Zhu B. Li G. Trojer P. Mandal S. Shilatifard A. Reinberg D. Cell. 2006; 125: 703-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), which has been implicated in elongation of RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription through chromatin templates (35Belotserkovskaya R. Reinberg D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement of ubH2B in gene expression, the removal of this modification by deubiquitinating enzymes is essential for preservation of silenced chromatin structures such as at telomeres and the mating-type loci in S. cerevisiae (36Emre N.C.

Although significant progress has been made in defining the requirements for heterochromatic transcriptional silencing, the factors involved in transcription of heterochromatic repeats are poorly defined. Previous studies have shown that the S. pombe Rhp6 protein, which shares structural and functional similarities to the budding yeast Rad6 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (54Reynolds P. Koken M.H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Prakash S. Prakash L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 55Maruyama T. Nakamura T. Hayashi T. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2420-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), is a negative regulator of heterochromatic transcriptional gene silencing (56Nielsen I.S. Nielsen O. Murray J.M. Thon G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 57Choi E.S. Kim H.S. Jang Y.K. Hong S.H. Park S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8366-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Whereas loss of Rhp6 enhances silencing at heterochromatic loci, overexpression of Rhp6 disrupts silencing that correlates with increased levels of euchromatin-specific modifications such as H3K4me (56Nielsen I.S. Nielsen O. Murray J.M. Thon G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 57Choi E.S. Kim H.S. Jang Y.K. Hong S.H. Park S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8366-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Despite these advances, the mechanism by which Rhp6 antagonizes the repressive effects of heterochromatin is not known. In this study we utilize biochemical and genetic approaches to characterize the mechanism of Rhp6-mediated heterochromatin derepression. We show that Rhp6 is a component of multisubunit protein complex, referred to as HULC (histone H2B ubiquitin ligase complex), which is required for ubiquitination of histone H2B lysine 119 in S. pombe. Interestingly, HULC localizes to heterochromatic loci and modulates stability of heterochromatin structures via ubiquitination of H2B but independently of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. Our results further suggest that HULC facilitates pol II occupancy at heterochromatic repeat elements in a ubH2B-dependent manner. Strains, Plasmids, and Media—Standard conditions were used for growing yeast strains, sporulation, and tetrad analysis. Strains expressing epitope-tagged proteins (H2B-FLAG, Rfp1-FLAG, Shf1-FLAG, and Rhp6-FLAG) and deletion strains (Δrhp6, Δrfp1, Δrfp2, and Δshf1) were generated using a PCR-based module method. To generate the H2B mutant, we transformed wild type strain with a DNA fragment consisting of mutated htb1 fused to a KanR cassette. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Rhp6 expression vector was constructed by inserting rhp6+ open reading frame into the pRep3 plasmid, as described previously (57Choi E.S. Kim H.S. Jang Y.K. Hong S.H. Park S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8366-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Expression of ura4+ reporter inserted at the heterochromatic location was assayed by performing serial dilution plating assay on nonselective (N/S), uracil-deficient (–ura), and counterselective FOA (5-FOA) thiamine-free minimal medium. Immunoaffinity Purification—Whole cell extracts from FLAG epitope tagged and untagged strains were prepared as described (58Jia S. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Twelve liters of exponentially growing cells (A ∼ 0.75–1.0) were harvested, washed with 2× HC buffer (300 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 40% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors), and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen cells were blended with dry ice using a household blender and extracted with 40 ml of 1× HC buffer containing 300 mm KCl for 30 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h. The supernatant was pre-cleared with IgG-Sepharose (Roche Applied Science), combined with 300 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose for 2 h, and washed five times with 1× HC buffer supplemented with 300 mm KCl, and 10 times with 1× HC buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with 150 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluted proteins were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, visualized by silver staining, and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described previously (58Jia S. Kobayashi R. Grewal S.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was performed as described previously (59Nakayama J. Klar A.J. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2000; 101: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) using antibodies against mono-, di-, or trimethylated H3K9 (Upstate Biotechnology), Swi6 (59Nakayama J. Klar A.J. Grewal S.I. Cell. 2000; 101: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), FLAG (M2; Sigma), and the largest subunit of pol II (8WG16; Covance). Histone Immunoprecipitation and Western Analysis—Exponentially growing cells (5 × 105) were harvested, washed with NIB buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 15 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.8% Triton X-100), and resuspended in 0.5 ml of NIB buffer supplemented with 2 mm ZnSO4, 10 ng/ml trichostatin A, and protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized using glass bead beater and collected by centrifugation (11,000 × g). Cell pellets were extracted twice with 0.4 m H2SO4. Histones were collected by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in 2.5 m urea, and resolved on 17% SDS-PAGE before subjecting to Western analysis with antibodies against H3K4me2 (Upstate), FLAG (M2, Sigma), or ubiquitin (P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For immunoprecipitation, histones dissolved in 2.5 m urea were diluted with IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) to adjust urea to a final concentration of 0.5 m and combined with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose for 2 h, washed three times with IP buffer, and eluted with 150 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma). In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Ubiquitination was performed at 30 °C for 4 h in 25 μl of mixture containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 5% glycerol, 30 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 6 mm ATP, 2.5 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma), 500 ng of histone H2B (Upstate), 500 ng of E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme (Calbiochem), and 100 ng of immunoprecipitated HULC. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5× SDS sample buffer, and proteins were resolved on 17% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Purification of Rhp6 and Identification of Its Interaction Partners—To gain insight into the mechanism of Rhp6-mediated modulation of heterochromatin, we used immunoaffinity to purify Rhp6 from a strain expressing Rhp6 tagged at its carboxyl terminus with three copies of FLAG epitope (Rhp6-FLAG). The fusion protein was expressed under the control of its native promoter, and its functionality was confirmed by comparing cell morphology and growth rate with Δrhp6 cells. Silver staining analysis of the Rhp6-purified fraction revealed several polypeptides that were specifically present in immunoaffinity-purified fraction of Rhp6-FLAG but not in the control fraction (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry analyses of excised bands identified an ∼22-kDa polypeptide to be Rhp6-FLAG, consistent with its predicted molecular weight (Fig. 1, A and B). Peptides from the major ∼80-kDa band identified two proteins encoded by SPCC970.10c and SPCC1919.15. Both of these proteins contain the C3HC4-type RING finger domain implicated in catalysis of ubiquitin transfer by E3 ubiquitin ligases (60Lorick K.L. Jensen J.P. Fang S. Ong A.M. Hatakeyama S. Weissman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11364-11369Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) and share similarity with the budding yeast Bre1 (43%) and with each other (42%) (Fig. 1C). We named these proteins Rfp1 and Rfp2 (RING finger protein 1 and 2). Another protein co-purifying with Rhp6-FLAG as an ∼25-kDa band was identified as a product of SPAC22F8.12c. This protein does not have any apparent homologs, and its only identifiable feature is a serine-rich region. We will refer to this protein as Shf1 (small histone ubiquitination factor). To verify that Shf1, Rfp1, Rfp2, and Rhp6 are indeed associated together in a complex, we constructed a strain that produced functional Shf1 fused at its carboxyl terminus with three copies of the FLAG epitope (Shf1-FLAG). Affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry identified Rhp6, Rfp1, and Rfp2 as Shf1-assocciated factors (Fig. 1, A and B). These analyses suggest that Rhp6, Rfp1, Rfp, and Shf1 are associated together in a complex, which we have named HULC. Consistent with these factors forming a complex, deletion of rfp1, rfp2, or shf1 causes phenotypes known to be associated with rhp6 mutant cells, including an elongated cell shape (Fig. 1D) (54Reynolds P. Koken M.H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Prakash S. Prakash L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HULC Mediates Ubiquitination of Histone H2B—In S. cerevisiae, Rad6-Bre1 has been implicated in mono-ubiquitination of H2B (26Hwang W.W. Venkatasubrahmanyam S. Ianculescu A.G. Tong A. Boone C. Madhani H.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 261-266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 27Wood A. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Golshani A. Zhang Y. Greenblatt J.F. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 267-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to explore whether HULC components play a role in H2B ubiquitination. For this purpose, we constructed strains expressing histone H2B fused at its carboxyl terminus with triple FLAG epitope (htb1-FLAG). Western analysis of immunoaffinity-purified H2B-FLAG isolated under denaturing conditions either from wild type or Δrhp6 cells was used to detect ubH2B. We detected a slower migrating H2B-FLAG band in a wild type sample that was missing in the Δrhp6 sample (Fig. 2A, upper panel). The slower migrating H2B band represented ubH2B as it was also detected in Western analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The intensity of the slower migrating band was enhanced slightly in histones isolated from cells overexpressing Rhp6, further indicating that this band corresponds to ubH2B-FLAG (supplemental Fig. 1). We next analyzed the involvement of Rhp6-associated proteins in H2B ubiquitination. Western analysis of H2B-FLAG isolated from mutants deficient for individual subunits of HULC revealed that slower migrating band representing ubH2B was missing in cells lacking either Bre1 homologs (i.e. Rfp1 or Rfp2) or Shf1. These analyses suggest that components of HULC are required for ubiquitination of H2B. To confirm that HULC is indeed a ubiquitin ligase, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay. Purified HULC was incubated with recombinant H2B in the presence of recombinant E1-activating enzyme and ubiquitin, and ubiquitin-tagged proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin antibody. An ∼20-kDa ubiquitin conjugate corresponding to ubH2B was detected specifically in reactions containing purified HULC (Fig. 2C). This band was eliminated when HULC or recombinant H2B was omitted from the reactions. Based on this analysis, we conclude that HULC is a ubiquitinating complex that most likely directly modifies H2B in vivo. To address whether HULC specifically modifies H2B at a lysine residue that corresponds to the known Rad6-Bre1 target (i.e. H2B-K123) in S. cerevisiae, we developed strains expressing mutant H2B carrying lysine 119 to arginine (htb1-K119R) substitution. Mutant H2B expressed under the control of native promoter was the sole source of histone H2B. Like cells carrying deletions of genes encoding HULC subunits, cells carrying htb1-K119R mutant allele showed an elongated cell shape (Fig. 1D). More importantly, Western analysis showed that the band corresponding to ubH2B was undetectable in htb1-K119R mutant cells (Fig. 2B). We conclude from these analyses that the Lys-119 residue is a key target of HULC-mediated H2B ubiquitination. Rhp6-mediated Modulation of Heterochromatin Requires HULC Components—Previous studies have suggested a role for Rhp6 in antagonizing heterochromatic gene silencing (56Nielsen I.S. Nielsen O. Murray J.M. Thon G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 57Choi E.S. Kim H.S. Jang Y.K. Hong S.H. Park S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8366-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which Rhp6 counteracts heterochromatic silencing has remained unclear. We sought to explore whether components of HULC affect heterochromatic silencing. The ura4+ reporter gene inserted in the outer repeat region of centromere 1 (otr1::ura4+) is subject to heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing (61Allshire R.C. Nimmo E.R. Ekwall K. Javerzat J.P. Cranston G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, silencing of the reporter gene is not completely stable. As a result, wild type cells carrying otr1::ura4+ can grow on both medium lacking uracil and counter-selective medium containing FOA, which selects for growth cells in which ura4+ reporter is silenced (Fig. 2D). We assayed the effects of deletion of genes encoding HULC subunits on otr1::ura4+ expression by performing serial dilution plating assay. Consistent with previous reports (56Nielsen I.S. Nielsen O. Murray J.M. Thon G. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 613-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 57Choi E.S. Kim H.S. Jang Y.K. Hong S.H. Park S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8366-8374Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), Δrhp6 resulted in enhanced silencing of the otr1::ura4+, as shown by reduced growth on medium lacking uracil (Fig. 2D). Loss of other HULC components such as Rfp1, Rfp2, or Shf1 also resulted in a similar increase in silencing of the ura4+ reporter (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that Rhp6 counteracts heterochromatic silencing as a component of the HULC. Overexpression of Rhp6 abrogates silencing of the otr1::ura4+ reporter, resulting in the loss of cell viability on medium supplemented with FOA (Fig. 3A).

Changes in p53 conformation can be monitored by reactivity with wild-type conformation-specific (pAb-1620) or mutant conformation-specific (pAb-240) p53 antibodies. Wild-type p53 accumulated in a mutant (pAb-240 reactive) form when its proteasome-dependent degradation was blocked during recovery from stress treatment and in cells co-expressing p53 and MDM2. This suggests that conformational change precedes wild-type p53 degradation by the proteasome. MDM2 binding to the p53 N terminus could induce a conformational change in wild-type p53. Interestingly, this conformational change was opposed by heat-shock protein 90 and did not require the MDM2 RING-finger domain and p53 ubiquitination. Finally, ubiquitinated p53 accumulated in a pAb-240 reactive form when p53 degradation was blocked by proteasome inhibition, and a p53-ubiquitin fusion protein displayed a mutant-only conformation in MDM2-null cells. These results support a model in which MDM2 binding induces a conformational change that is opposed by heat-shock protein 90 and precedes p53 ubiquitination. The covalent attachment of ubiquitin may “lock” p53 in a mutant conformation in the absence of MDM2-binding and prior to its degradation by the proteasome. p53 protein conformation is an important determinant of its localization and activity.

Inactivation of p53 is considered essential for the development of most or all human cancers (1Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7412) Google Scholar). More than 50% of human cancers harbor inactivating mutations in the p53 gene, and in cancers that retain wild-type p53, other defects in the p53 tumor suppressor pathway are observed. Cancer-associated p53 mutations are found almost exclusively in the DNA binding domain and inhibit the ability of p53 to activate expression of its downstream target genes (2Soussi T. Dehouche K. Beroud C. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 15: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 3Olivier M. Eeles R. Hollstein M. Khan M.A. Harris C.C. Hainaut P. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). These cancer-associated mutations also alter p53 protein conformation to varying extents. Changes in p53 conformation can be assessed by monitoring reactivity with conformation-specific antibodies that recognize p53 in either a wild-type (pAb-1620) 3The abbreviations used are: pAb, primary antibody; Hsp90, heat-shock protein 90; GA, geldanamycin; 17-AAG, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; Myc-Ub, Myc-tagged ubiquitin; wt, wild type. 3The abbreviations used are: pAb, primary antibody; Hsp90, heat-shock protein 90; GA, geldanamycin; 17-AAG, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin; Myc-Ub, Myc-tagged ubiquitin; wt, wild type. or mutant (pAb-240) conformation (4Milner J.

Wild-type p53 is a flexible and conformationally labile protein, and conditions that can alter its conformation have been examined. For example, Milner and Watson (6Milner J. Watson J.V. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1683-1690PubMed Google Scholar) reported that wild-type p53 switched to a mutant conformation in serum-stimulated murine fibroblasts. In addition, Milner and Medcalf (7Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) demonstrated that formation of hetero-oligomers of wild-type and mutant p53 proteins could drive the wild-type protein in to a mutant conformation. Regulated changes in p53 protein conformation are likely to be important determinants of p53 activity.Heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that plays an essential role in the conformational maturation of numerous proteins, including nuclear receptors, transcription factors, and protein kinases (8Calderwood S.K. Khaleque M.A. Sawyer D.B. Ciocca D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). It is believed that Hsp90 maintains these proteins in an active conformation that can be rapidly triggered after stimulus. Hsp90 also functions in the folding of newly synthesized proteins and their refolding after conditions of denaturing stress. Functions of Hsp90 may be modulated by association with co-chaperones such as Hsc70, Hsp40, and Hop (8Calderwood S.K. Khaleque M.A. Sawyer D.B. Ciocca D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 164-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 9Beliakoff J. Whitesell L. Anticancer Drugs. 2004; 15: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Complexes between Hsp90 and wild-type p53 have been recognized, and it is currently believed that Hsp90 is a positive regulator of p53. For example, the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) diminished the stress-induced accumulation and activation of p53 in a campothecin-treated human fibroblast cell line (10Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48836-48845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and in cells exposed to heat shock (11Wang C. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2066-2071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hsp90 inhibition was also reported to block the nuclear accumulation and reactivation of p53 when cells harboring a temperature-sensitive p53 mutant were shifted to the permissive temperature (12Muller P. Ceskova P. Vojtesek B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6682-6691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 13Galigniana M.D. Harrell J.M. O'Hagen H.M. Ljungman M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22483-22489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). And finally, purified Hsp90 protein maintained p53 in a wild-type, DNA binding conformation at elevated temperatures in vitro (10Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J. Zylicz A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48836-48845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Together, these results support a role for Hsp90 in maintaining the levels, activity, and conformation of wild-type p53.MDM2 is the product of a p53-inducible gene and can bind the N terminus of p53 and inhibit its transcriptional activity (14Momand J. Zambetti G.P. Olson D.C. George D. Levine A.J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2776) Google Scholar, 15Oliner J.D. Kinzler K.W. Meltzer P.S. George D.L. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1992; 358: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar). Importantly, MDM2 binding can also promote the ubiquitination of p53 and its degradation by the proteasome (16Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3659) Google Scholar, 17Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2814) Google Scholar). This may allow a more efficient inhibition of p53 activity than would result from MDM2 binding alone. Current models suggest MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that facilitates ubiquitin transfer to p53 (18Lavin M.F. Gueven N. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Various reports have suggested a possible relationship between the conformation of p53 and its degradation by the proteasome. For example, El-Deiry and co-workers (19Wang W. Takimoto R. Rastinejad F. El-Deiry W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2171-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that the drug CP-31398 could stabilize endogenous p53 in cultured cells. CP-31398 can maintain p53 in an active conformation and can drive some mutant p53s into a wild-type conformation (20Foster B.A. Coffey H.A. Morin M.J. Rastinejad F. Science. 1999; 286: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The fact that it could block p53 degradation raised the possibility that wild-type p53 might assume a mutant conformation before its degradation. The plant alkaloid ellipticine can also maintain p53 in a wild-type conformation and can drive some mutant p53s into a wild-type conformation (21Peng Y. Li C. Chen L. Sebti S. Chen J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4478-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Like CP-31398, ellipticine treatment stabilized endogenous wild-type p53 in cultured cells (21Peng Y. Li C. Chen L. Sebti S. Chen J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4478-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 22Kuo P.L. Hsu Y.L. Chang C.H. Lin C.C. Cancer Lett. 2005; 223: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), supporting the possibility that wild-type p53 might assume a mutant conformation before degradation. In the current study we monitored p53 protein conformation under conditions in which its MDM2 and proteasome-dependent degradation was inhibited. Our results support a model in which MDM2 binding promotes a conformational change in p53 that is opposed by Hsp90 and precedes p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid DNAs—DNA encoding p53 Δ42N has been described (23Unger T.

FLAG-tagged wild-type p53 has been described (24Gu J. Chen D. Rosenblum J. Rubin R.M. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell.

DNA encoding FLAG-tagged Hsp90 was provided by Len Neckers (NCI, National Institutes of Health).Cell Culture and Transfections—MCF7 (breast cancer), U2OS (osteosarcoma), and HepG2 (liver cancer) cell lines all expresses wild-type p53. MDM2/p53 double knock-out mouse embryo fibroblasts were from Rudy Alarcon (Stanford University). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (1% penicillin and streptomycin). Control siRNA or siRNA against MDM2 (smart-pool) were from Dharmacon and were transfected to Hep3B cells using Dharmafect reagent, also from Dharmacon. Transfections in U2OS or MDM2/p53 double knock-out cells were done using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol when cells were ∼60% confluent. Total DNA in each transfection was equalized by the addition of empty plasmid. Where indicated, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Boston Biochem) was added to a final concentration of 30 μm 18 h after transfection, and the cells were incubated for an additional 5-7 h before harvesting. MCF7 cells were treated with Hsp90 inhibitors at the following final concentrations: 17-AAG (10 μm), GA (10 μm), radicicol (0.5 μm). 17-AAG was from Ralph Weichselbaum (University of Chicago), GA was from A. G. Scientific, and radicicol was from Sigma.Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—To harvest cell lysates for immunoblotting, cells were rinsed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 700 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin) and transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The cells were then incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing and spun at 4 °C, 14,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cellular debris. For immunoprecipitations using conformation-specific p53 antibodies, cell lysates were first mixed for 1 h with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads to pre-clear the lysate. The lysate was then divided into equal halves, and each half was immunoprecipitated overnight with 1.75 μl of either the wild-type conformation-specific (pAb-1620, Invitrogen Ab-5) or mutant conformation-specific (pAb-240, Invitrogen Ab-3). Immunoprecipitates were captured by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h, and the beads were isolated by centrifugation for 10 s at 13,000 rpm. The beads were then washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, boiled for 10 min, and then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. Antibodies used in immunoblotting to detect p53 included the sheep polyclonal antibody Ab-7 (Oncogene Science), monoclonal p53 antibody 1801 (Oncogene Science), and the FLAG monoclonal antibody Ab-5 (Sigma-Aldrich). MDM2 antibody was SMP-14 (Santa Cruz). Tubulin antibody Ab-1 was from Santa Cruz.RESULTSp53 Accumulates in a Mutant Conformation When Its Proteasome and MDM2-dependent Degradation Is Inhibited—We wished to test whether endogenous p53 undergoes a conformational change before degradation by the proteasome. Wild-type p53 is stabilized and its levels increase in cells after DNA-damaging stress, and cells undergo G1-or G2-phase cell cycle arrests and DNA repair (28Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). p53 is subsequently degraded, and its levels decrease when DNA repair is complete and cells resume normal cell cycling (29Geyer R.K. Nagasawa H. Little J.B. Maki C.G. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 149-156PubMed Google Scholar, 30Joseph T.W. Zaika A. Moll U.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1622-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). p53 degradation during stress recovery is believed to be MDM2-dependent (29Geyer R.K. Nagasawa H. Little J.B. Maki C.G. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 149-156PubMed Google Scholar, 30Joseph T.W. Zaika A. Moll U.M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1622-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments we first monitored p53 levels in MCF7 cells exposed to actinomycin D (ActD) for 4 h and then allowed them to recover from ActD treatment for various time periods (Fig. 1A). p53 levels were increased after 4 h of ActD treatment, remained elevated for 7 h after removal of ActD, and subsequently decreased at the 10, 12, 16, and 20 h time points. These results suggest p53 degradation resumes between 7 and 10 h after ActD removal. MDM2 levels were also increased in cells exposed to ActD for 4 h and remained elevated at all time points after removal of ActD with a peak at 7 h. Next, we tested whether the decrease in p53 levels after ActD removal could be blocked by proteasome inhibition. As shown in Fig. 1B, p53 levels were increased by ActD treatment for 3 h, remained elevated 6 h after ActD removal, and were decreased 12 h after ActD removal. In contrast, the decrease in p53 levels between 6-12 h after ActD removal was blocked in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (compare p53 levels in lanes 4 and 5, Fig. 1B). This indicates the decrease in p53 levels between 6 and 12 h after ActD removal is proteasome-dependent. Finally, we monitored p53 conformation in response to ActD treatment and during recovery in which it was undergoing proteasomal degradation. Treated cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with wild-type conformation-specific (pAb1620) or mutant conformation-specific (pAb240) p53 antibodies followed by immunoblotting with the p53 antibody Ab-7. p53 immunoprecipitated by each antibody in these experiments is an indicator of p53 conformation. As shown in Fig. 1C, p53 displayed a mostly wild-type conformation (recognized by the wild-type conformation-specific antibody but not the mutant conformation-specific antibody) in cells treated with ActD for 3 h and in cells 6 h after ActD removal. At the 12-h time point after ActD removal, when p53 levels were decreased, p53 appeared to be evenly distributed between a wild-type and mutant conformation. Strikingly, however, p53 accumulated in a mutant (pAb240-reactive) conformation when its proteasomal degradation between 6 and 12 h after ActD removal was blocked by MG132 treatment, and abundant MDM2 binding to p53 was also observed (Fig. 1C). This suggests p53 undergoing proteasomal degradation during recovery from stress treatment may assume a mutant conformation before degradation.Wild-type p53 undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation when co-expressed with excess MDM2. We monitored p53 conformation under conditions in which it was being targeted for degradation by MDM2 in co-transfected cells. U2OS cells were transfected with DNAs encoding FLAG-tagged p53 either alone or with excess MDM2. In some cases cells were treated with MG132 to inhibit the proteasome before harvesting, and p53 and MDM2 levels were assessed. As expected, p53 levels decreased with MDM2 co-expression, and this decrease was blocked by proteasome inhibitor treatment (Fig. 2A). This is consistent with MDM2 promoting p53 degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. Next, we monitored p53 conformation in the transfected cell lysates. As shown in Fig. 2B, FLAG p53 maintained a mostly wild-type conformation when expressed alone and, whereas p53 levels decreased with co-expression of MDM2, there appeared to be a slight shift toward the mutant conformation. Importantly, blocking p53 degradation by proteasome inhibition caused an increase in mutant conformation p53 and decrease in wild-type conformation p53 (Fig. 2B), suggesting a shift from wild-type to mutant conformation before p53 degradation.FIGURE 2p53 accumulates in a mutant conformation when its MDM2-dependent degradation is blocked by proteasome inhibition. A, U2OS cells were transfected with DNA encoding FLAG p53 (100 ng) either alone or with MDM2 (1 μg). Where indicated cells were treated with MG132 (30 μm final concentration, 5.5 h treatment) 17 h after transfection. Transfected cell lysates were examined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (p53) and anti-MDM2 antibodies. B, transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with wild-type conformation-specific (W, pAb1620) or mutant conformation-specific (M, pAb240) antibodies and examined by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody and MDM2 antibody SMP-14.

The upper band indicated by the arrow is FLAG p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ubiquitinated p53 and a p53-Ubiquitin Fusion Protein Have a Mostly Mutant Conformation—MDM2 is an E3-ligase that can ubiquitinate p53 to promote its degradation. This led us to examine the conformation of wild-type p53 that is ubiquitinated by MDM2. To this end, U2OS cells were transfected with DNAs encoding FLAG p53, MDM2, and Myc-tagged ubiquitin (Myc-Ub), in different combinations (Fig. 3A). Myc-Ub was included in these experiments to facilitate detection of ubiquitinated p53 species. In some cases transfected cells were treated with MG132 to inhibit the proteasome before analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, p53 levels decreased when co-expressed with MDM2 alone or MDM2 plus Myc-Ub, and this decrease was blocked by MG132. This is consistent with MDM2 promoting p53 degradation by the proteasome. Transfected cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated with wild-type (pAb1620) or mutant (pAb240) conformation-specific p53 antibodies and examined by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. FLAG p53 maintained a mostly wild-type conformation when expressed alone (Fig. 3B, middle panel). When p53 was co-expressed with excess MDM2 alone or MDM2 plus Myc-Ub, the p53 that remained appeared to be shifted slightly toward a more mutant conformation (Fig. 3B, middle panel). Consistent with Fig. 2, p53 again accumulated in a mutant conformation when its degradation by MDM2 alone or MDM2 plus Myc-Ub was blocked by proteasome inhibitor treatment (+MG132 samples, Fig. 3B, middle panel). Long exposures of the film in Fig. 3B, middle panel, were used to assess conformation of ubiquitinated p53 in higher molecular weight, p53-ubiquitin conjugates. In each case where ubiquitinated p53 could be observed, it displayed a mutant or mostly mutant conformation (Fig. 3B, upper panel). We noted in some, but not all experiments that ubiquitinated p53 levels were somewhat decreased with MG132 treatment (as example, compare ubiquitinated p53 levels with MDM2 and Myc-Ub alone versus MDM2, Myc-Ub, and MG132, Fig. 3B). This is consistent with reports that endogenous, ubiquitinated p53 levels decreased in MG132-treated cells (31Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the conformation of ubiquitinated p53 further, we made use of a p53-ubiquitin fusion protein (p53-Ub) believed to mimic mono-ubiquitination of the p53 C terminus (25Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). p53/MDM2 double-null cells were transfected with DNAs encoding wild-type p53 or p53-Ub, and conformation of the expressed proteins was monitored. As shown in Fig. 4, wild-type p53 had a mostly wild-type conformation, whereas the p53-Ub fusion protein had a completely mutant (pAb240-reactive) conformation. These results were confirmed in duplicate experiments in Fig. 4 and support the idea that ubiquitinated wild-type p53 has a mutant conformation.FIGURE 3Ubiquitinated p53 accumulates in a mutant conformation after proteasome inhibition. A, U2OS cells were transfected with DNAs encoding FLAG p53 (100 ng), MDM2 (1 mg), and Myc-Ub (200 ng) as indicated. In some cases cells were treated with MG132 (30 μm final concentration, 5.5 h treatment) 17 h after transfection. FLAG p53 and MDM2 levels are shown. Tubulin is a loading control. B, transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with wild-type conformation-specific (W, pAb1620) or mutant conformation-specific (M, pAb240) antibodies followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody or anti-MDM2 antibody. The lower band indicated by the asterisk is detection of the antibody heavy used in the immunoprecipitation. The upper band indicated by the arrow is FLAG p53. Shorter exposure of the FLAG blot (middle panel) shows conformation of the non-ubiquitinated p53 in each condition. Longer exposure (upper panel) allows detection of ubiquitinated p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 4p53 ubiquitin fusion protein has a mutant conformation.

Transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with wild-type conformation-specific (W, pAb1620) or mutant conformation-specific (M, pAb240) antibodies, followed by immunoblotting with the anti-p53 polyclonal antibody Ab-7. The bands indicated by the arrows are full-length wild-type p53 and the p53-Ub fusion protein. The low molecular weight bands below the full-length proteins may represent an internal translation product of p53.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MDM2 Binding Promotes a Conformational Change in p53—We noted that when p53 is stabilized by proteasome inhibition, it accumulates mostly as a full-length band that is not obviously modified (not ubiquitinated). This led us to suspect that conformational change in p53 may precede its ubiquitination by MDM2. Efficient p53 degradation requires MDM2 input amounts be in excess to p53 (25Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). To test if MDM2 binding can affect p53 conformation, cells were transfected with equal amounts (1 μg of each) DNA encoding FLAG-tagged p53 and MDM2. p53 is not efficiently degraded by MDM2 under these conditions (25Li M. Brooks C.L. Wu-Baer F. Chen D. Baer R. Gu W. Science. 2003; 302: 1972-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and we could, therefore, monitor its conformation while maintaining protein levels. p53 conformation was then monitored by IP with the conformation-specific antibodies followed by probing with anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 5B, p53 wild type (wt) had a mostly wild-type conformation when expressed alone. However, co-expression with MDM2 caused an accumulation of p53 with a mutant conformation. This effect required MDM2 binding to the p53 N terminus since p53 Δ42N, which lacks the N-terminal MDM2 binding site, did not accumulate in a mutant conformation when expressed with MDM2 and did not bind MDM2 (Fig. 5B). We also tested if the MDM2 RING-finger domain was required for this effect. MDM2 ΔRING can bind p53 but is unable to promote p53 ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 5B, co-expression with MDM2 ΔRING also caused an accumulation of p53 in a mutant conformation, indicating that MDM2 ubiquitination activity is not required. It is important that p53 levels remained comparable throughout this experiment or decreased slightly with expression of MDM2 wt (levels Fig. 5A). This indicates accumulation of mutant conformation p53 is not due to an overall increase in p53 levels. These results suggest MDM2 binding can promote a p53 conformational change, evidenced by exposure of the mutant (pAb240) epitope.FIGURE 5MDM2 binding exposes the mutant (pAb-240) epitope in wild-type p53. U2OS cells were transfected with DNA encoding FLAG p53 wt or FLAG p53 Δ42N either alone or with DNA encoding MDM2 that was wt or lacked the RING-finger domain that is required for ubiquitination activity (ΔRING). A, immunoblotting shows the levels of FLAG p53 and MDM2 proteins. Tubulin levels were used as a loading control. B, transfected cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with wild-type conformation-specific (W, pAb1620) or mutant conformation-specific (M, pAb240) antibodies followed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-FLAG antibody and anti-MDM2 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Hsp90 Inhibition and MDM2 Cause Pronounced p53 Conformational Change—We noted that a significant portion of p53 remained in a wild-type conformation when expressed with MDM2, apparently resistant to conformational changes that might be caused by MDM2 binding. Based on this, we speculated one or more factors might associate with wild-type p53 and oppose conformational changes caused by MDM2. Hsp90 seemed a likely candidate since it has been reported to maintain wild-type p53 conformation and activity (10Walerych D. Kudla G. Gutkowska M. Wawrzynow B. Muller L. King F.W. Helwak A. Boros J.

One of the proton transfer pathways of the enzyme, the D pathway, used for the transfer of both substrate and pumped protons, accommodates a network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules that span the distance between an aspartate (Asp132), near the protein surface, and glutamate Glu286, which is an internal proton donor to the catalytic site. To investigate how changes in the environment around Glu286 affect the mechanism of proton transfer through the pathway, we introduced a non-hydrogen-bonding (Ala) or an acidic residue (Asp) at position Ser197 (S197A or S197D), located ∼7 Aå from Glu286. Although Ser197 is hydrogen-bonded to a water molecule that is part of the D pathway “proton wire,” replacement of the Ser by an Ala did not affect the proton transfer rate. In contrast, the S197D mutant CytcO displayed a turnover activity of ∼35% of that of the wild-type CytcO, and the O2 reduction reaction was not linked to proton pumping. Instead, a fraction of the substrate protons was taken from the positive (“incorrect”) side of the membrane. Furthermore, the pH dependence of the proton transfer rate was altered in the mutant CytcO. The results indicate that there is plasticity in the water coordination of the proton pathway, but alteration of the electrostatic potential within the pathway results in uncoupling of the proton translocation machinery.

The protons used for oxygen reduction are taken up specifically from the more negative side (N-side) of the membrane. In addition, the redox reaction catalyzed by CytcO drives the translocation of protons from the N- to the more positively charged side (P-side), across the membrane. Both processes contribute to maintaining the electrochemical gradient used for the production of ATP. The enzyme has four redox-active metal sites, which participate in electron transfer and the O2 reduction catalysis (Fig. 1). During turnover, electrons from cytochrome c are first donated to a copper center (CuA), from where they are transferred intramolecularly to heme a and then to the catalytic site, consisting of heme a3 and CuB, located about 30 Aå from the N-side surface (see Fig. 1). In its reduced state, the catalytic site binds O2, which is then reduced stepwise to H2O, accompanied by further electron transfer. In CytcO (cytochrome aa3) from Rhodobacter sphaeroides, two functional proton transfer pathways have been identified (e.g. see Refs. 6Fetter J.R. Qian J. Shapleigh J. Thomas J.W. García-Horsman A.

Upon reaction of the fully reduced CytcO (i.e. all four redox centers reduced) with dioxygen (see Fig. 2), binding of O2 to reduced heme a3 is followed by electron transfer from heme a to the catalytic site with a time constant of ∼50 μs (24Aödelroth P. Ek M. Brzezinski P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), forming an intermediate, PR, which presumably has the same chemical structure as PM, with the only difference being an additional electron at the catalytic site in PR (25Morgan J.E. Verkhovsky M.I. Wikstroöm M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12235-12240Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 26Sucheta A. Georgiadis K.E. Einarsdóttir Ó Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 554-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As with PM, formation of PR is not associated with proton uptake from solution (22Karpefors M. Aödelroth P. Aagaard A. Smirnova I.A. Brzezinski P. Isr. J. Chem. 1999; 39: 427-437Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Karpefors M. Aödelroth P. Namslauer A. Zhen Y.J. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14664-14669Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, due to the extra electron in the catalytic site, a group with high proton affinity is present in the PR state. This group is spontaneously protonated with a time constant of ∼100 μs, giving rise to the next detectable intermediate, the oxoferryl state (F). Formation of F is rate-limited by internal proton transfer from Glu286 (see below) that is followed by immediate reprotonation of Glu286 from solution via the D pathway (27Aödelroth P. Svensson Ek M.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1488-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, during the PR → F transition, the electron on CuA equilibrates with heme a, which has been shown to be controlled by the proton uptake from the bulk solution (28Smirnova I.A. Aödelroth P. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6826-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29Aagaard A. Namslauer A. Brzezinski P. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1998; 95: 13606-13611Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Also, during the next reaction (i.e. electron transfer from the heme a-CuA equilibrium to the catalytic site forming the fully oxidized state (O)), proton uptake takes place through the D pathway via Glu286 (22Karpefors M. Aödelroth P. Aagaard A. Smirnova I.A. Brzezinski P. Isr. J. Chem. 1999; 39: 427-437Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Namslauer A. Aagaard A. Katsonouri A. Brzezinski P.

The residue is a highly conserved component of the D pathway, and replacement of Glu286 by its nonprotonatable analog, Gln, results in impaired proton transfer through the pathway (8Brzezinski P. Aödelroth P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Konstantinov A.A. Siletsky S. Mitchell D. Kaulen A. Gennis R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13824-13829Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In both the PM/R → F and F → O transitions, the residue itself (or together with a cluster of water molecules) is the primary proton donor to the catalytic site, displaying an apparent pKa of 9.4 (30Namslauer A. Aagaard A. Katsonouri A. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1488-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). During enzyme turnover, the PM/R → F and F → O transitions are linked to proton pumping across the membrane (33Wikstroöm M.

Results from a number of experimental studies have shown that proton pumping in CytcO can be uncoupled from oxygen reduction by modification of amino acid residues within the D pathway (39Pfitzner U.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14064-14074Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More systematic studies of selected structural variants (e.g. N139D and N207D mutant CytcOs) showed that the uncoupling is correlated with an alteration in the apparent pKa of Glu286. This pKa change was suggested to be due to direct electrostatic interactions (40Namslauer A. Pawate A.S. Gennis R.B. Brzezinski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15543-15547Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or an altered hydrogen bonding pattern around Glu286 due to structural changes in the water molecules around the site (41Pawate A.S. Morgan J. Namslauer A. Mills D. Brzezinski P. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13417-13423Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Results from electrostatic calculations suggested that the latter explanation is more likely (43Olkhova E. Michel H. Hutter M.C. Lill M.A. Helms V. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1873-1889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The involvement of water molecules as “protonatable sites” is also implied from theoretical calculations, which indicate that a water cluster surrounded by Ser200, Ser201, and Ser197 may act as a transient proton donor to Glu286 (44Xu J. Voth G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, results from detailed theoretical studies suggest that the uncoupling of oxygen reduction from proton pumping in the N139D mutant CytcO is due to an alteration in the proton energy landscape within the D pathway (44Xu J. Voth G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45Olsson M.H. Warshel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6500-6505Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because such alterations may result in changes in the proton equilibrium involving Glu286, they may be reflected in an altered apparent pKa of the residue. To investigate the effect of changes in the water coordination pattern and electrostatic environment of the D pathway, we have studied the effect on function of two mutant forms of CytcO, one in which a hydrogen bond to a water molecule near Glu286 was removed (Ser197 → Ala, about 7 Aå from Glu286; see Fig. 1) without altering the electrostatics of the pathway and one in which the electrostatics and/or structure around Glu286 was altered by introducing an acidic residue, Asp, at the position of Ser197. Mutagenesis, Growth of Bacteria, and CytcO Purification—Site-directed mutagenesis of R. sphaeroides CytcO was done as described in detail in Ref. 46Hosler J.P. Shapleigh J.P. Mitchell D.M. Kim Y. Pressler M.A. Georgiou C. Babcock G.T. Alben J.O. Ferguson-Miller S. Gennis R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10776-10783Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar (see also Ref. 47Aagaard A. Gilderson G. Mills D.A. Ferguson-Miller S. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15847-15850Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in Sistrom’s medium, aerobically in a fermentor. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography was used to purify the histidine-tagged enzyme (48Mitchell D.M. Gennis R.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 148-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Measurements of the Catalytic Activity—The catalytic activity was determined from the initial oxidation rate of reduced cytochrome c (2 mm) upon mixing with CytcO (10 nm) in the presence of oxygen. Absorbance changes associated with cytochrome c oxidation were recorded at 550 nm. The measurements were done in a 50 mm phosphate buffer with 0.1% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside at pH 6.5. Potentiometric Titration of Heme a—Chemical redox titrations were performed as in Ref. 49Dutton P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 54: 411-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar. Frozen stock solutions of CytcO were diluted to a concentration of ∼5 μm in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside at pH 7. The sample was transferred to an anaerobic cuvette to which the standard and reference electrodes were inserted to monitor the reduction potential of the solution. The sample was flushed with N2(g) for 30 min, and KCN at a concentration of 5 mm was added to keep heme a3 oxidized during the titration. The redox mediators diaminodurene, quinhydrone, ferrocene, and phenazine methosulfate were added at concentrations of 10-20 μm. Heme a was first gradually oxidized by additions of potassium ferricyanide and then reduced in steps by additions of potassium ferrocyanide. Optical absorption spectra were recorded at each Eh value, and the degree of heme a reduction was determined from the absorbance peak at 605 nm (A605 nm - A630 nm). Proton Pumping Measurements—Phospholipid vesicles containing CytcO were prepared as described in Ref. 34Jasaitis A. Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Verkhovskaya M.L. Wikstroöm M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar. The argon-flushed proteoliposome sample contained 5 μm valinomycin, 12.5 μm (8 nmol) cytochrome c, and 0.5 mm ascorbate. The release of pumped protons upon small additions of air-saturated water (<2 nmol O2) was measured using a pH electrode. The pH response at the O2 pulse was calibrated by the addition of a known amount of H2SO4 to the same sample. The rereduction rate of cytochrome c by ascorbate was measured simultaneously by following absorbance changes at 550 nm to make sure that the measured changes in pH take place during CytcO turnover (i.e. when cytochrome c becomes oxidized) and not upon the slower rereduction of cytochrome c by ascorbate. Preparation of Fully Reduced CytcO—Frozen stock solutions of CytcO were diluted to a concentration of 10-15 μm in 100 mm Hepes and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside at pH 7.4, and the redox mediator phenazine methosulfate was added at a concentration of 1 μm. In experiments in which pH changes of the bulk solution were investigated, buffer was removed on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m KCl and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside at pH 7.8 (see Ref. 24Aödelroth P. Ek M. Brzezinski P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The solution was transferred to a modified anaerobic cuvette, which was repetitively evacuated on a vacuum line and flushed with N2. Ascorbate at a concentration of 2 mm was added to the anaerobic CytcO solution, after which the N2 was replaced by CO. The reduction and CO binding was confirmed by inspection of optical absorbance spectra in the visible region that were recorded during the process. Preparation of Mixed Valence CytcO—CytcO at a concentration of 10 μm in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 0.1% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was transferred to a modified anaerobic cuvette. The gas phase in the cuvette was exchanged to N2, and the cuvette was shaken to equilibrate the solution with the gas phase after each gas exchange cycle. After removal of all oxygen, N2 was exchanged for CO at ∼1mm, which results in formation of a state in which heme a and CuA are oxidized, and the binuclear center (heme a3/CuB) is reduced, with CO bound to the reduced heme a3 (mixed valence state). The CO itself acts as a reductant (reducing CytcO with two electrons, forming CO2, (50Brzezinski P. Malmstroöm B.G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)). Hence, a small fraction of CO is consumed (same amount as that of CytcO; i.e. negligible compared with the total amount of CO), and another CO molecule binds to heme a3, stabilizing the electron at that site. Flash Photolysis and Flow-Flash Measurements—The kinetics of internal electron transfer between hemes a and a3 was studied after flash photolysis of the CO ligand from the mixed valence CytcO in the absence of oxygen as described in Ref. 51Aödelroth P. Brzezinski P. Malmstroöm B.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2844-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. The flow-flash method was used to measure absorbance changes associated with the reaction of the fully reduced and mixed valence CytcO with oxygen. The CO-bound CytcO was mixed rapidly with an oxygen-saturated buffer solution (ratio 1:5), after which the CO ligand was photodissociated with a 5-ns laser flash (Quantel Brilliant; frequency-doubled Nd-YAG, 532 nm). The reaction was monitored by measuring absorbance changes at single wavelengths with a time resolution of ∼0.5 μs (bandwidth of the amplifier). Complete absorbance spectra (360-700 nm) were also collected with a time resolution of 2.5 ms (time between two consecutive spectra) using a diode-array detector (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Surrey, UK). The measurements were done in a modified custom built combined stopped flow/flash photolysis apparatus (LK.60 FF-60; Applied Photophysics Ltd., Surrey, UK) as described in detail in Ref. 52Braöndé;n M. Sigurdson H. Namslauer A. Gennis R.B. Aödelroth P. Brzezinski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar. In measurements of the proton uptake kinetics upon oxidation of the fully reduced CytcO, the oxygen-saturated buffer was replaced by 100 mm KCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, supplemented with the pH-sensitive dye phenol red at a concentration of 48 μm. The amount of reacting CytcO was calculated from the CO dissociation absorbance change at 445 nm upon illumination, using an absorption coefficient of 67 mm-1 cm-1. The relation between the observed absorbance changes and changes in the proton concentration was determined by several consecutive additions of well defined amounts of HCl to the enzyme-dye solution, as described (24Aödelroth P. Ek M. Brzezinski P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Optical Absorption Difference Spectra of the “Peroxy” and “Oxoferryl” Intermediates—The absorption spectra of the PM and F intermediates were obtained using a stopped flow apparatus equipped with a diode array detector (see above) as described in Ref. 53Orii Y. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1988; 550: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Briefly, the wild-type R. sphaeroides CytcO at a concentration of 10 μm in 100 mm Hepes at pH 7.4 and 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was reduced with a slight excess of dithionite and transferred anaerobically to one of the syringes of the stopped flow apparatus. The other syringe contained H2O2 at a concentration of 10 mm in the same buffer as the CytcO solution. Upon mixing the two solutions (ratio 1:1), the CytcO is rapidly oxidized (τ ≅ 1 ms), and the excess dithionite is consumed within a few ms by the oxygen present in the H2O2 solution. The pulsed, oxidized CytcO then reacts with H2O2 to initially form PM on the millisecond time scale, followed by formation of F on the second time scale. The spectral contributions, relative to that of the fully oxidized pulsed CytcO, were calculated from a global fit of the data to the sequential model O → PM → F. Measurements of Electric Membrane Potential Generation during Reaction between Reduced CytcO and Oxygen—The time-resolved electrometric measurements were based on a method originally developed for photosynthetic applications (54Drachev L.A. Kaulen A.D. Semenov A.Y. Severina I.I. Skulachev V.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 96: 250-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and applied later to CytcO (55Verkhovsky M.I. Morgan J.E. Verkhovskaya M.L. Wikstroöm M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 6-10Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the present system, Ag/AgCl electrodes recorded the voltage between the two compartments of a cell separated by a lipid-impregnated Teflon mesh. The proteoliposome solution was added to one of the two compartments of the cell, and the proteoliposomes were fused to the membrane by the addition of 12 mm CaCl2, followed by a 2-h incubation at pH 7 (100 mm MOPS). Then the liquid in both compartments was exchanged to remove excess proteoliposomes that did not adsorb to the membrane. Finally, the Ag/AgCl electrodes were inserted, and the air in the chamber was exchanged, first to N2(g) and then to CO(g). A laser flash (Quantel Brilliant; frequency-doubled YAG; pulse energy 50 mJ) was used to start the reaction. The measuring system consisted of a home-made operational preamplifier, the output of which was recorded using an IBM-PC-based digitizer, a 12-bit CompuScope 512 (Gage Applied Sciences, Montreal, Canada), and running data acquisition software written by Nikolai Belevich. A CTM-05 counter-timer board (Metrabyte) was used to control the timing. We have investigated the effect of modifying the local hydrogen-bonding pattern and/or electrostatic environment around glutamate 286 on the proton transfer in CytcO from R. sphaeroides. The modification was done by inserting an acidic amino acid residue (Asp, S197D) or an Ala (S197A) at the position of S197, located about 7 Aå from Glu286 (see Fig. 1, distance measured between the oxygen of the Ser197 side chain and the closest oxygen atom of the carboxyl group of Glu286). Basic Functional Characterization of the Mutant Cytochrome c Oxidases—The CytcO steady-state turnover activity was measured as the initial oxidation rate of reduced cytochrome c upon mixing with oxidized, detergent-solubilized CytcO. The proton pumping efficiency (i.e. number of pumped protons per electron) was measured using the O2 pulse method (see “Materials and Methods”). In the S197A mutant CytcO at pH 6.5, both the steady-state activity and the proton pumping efficiency were the same as with the wild-type CytcO. In contrast, the S197D mutant CytcO displayed an activity of ∼35% of that of the wild-type CytcO. No proton pumping was detected with the S197D mutant CytcO (i.e. the oxygen-reduction reaction was uncoupled from proton pumping). Instead, a small proton consumption (0.2 H+/e-) was observed from the outside of the vesicles. To test whether the mutations had any effect on the internal electron transfer rate between hemes a and a3, we investigated the kinetics of electron equilibration between these sites after flash photolysis of carbon monoxide from the two-electron reduced (mixed valence) CytcO (50Brzezinski P. Malmstroöm B.G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Both the rate and extent of this electron transfer were the same in the S197D mutant as in the wild-type CytcO (data not shown). Also, the midpoint potential of heme a, at equilibrium conditions with CN- bound to heme a3, was the same in the S197D as in the wild-type C"

https://openalex.org/W2053008970,"Vertebrate myosin Va is a typical processive motor with high duty ratio. Recent studies have revealed that the actin-activated ATPase activity of the full-length myosin Va (M5aFull) is inhibited at a low [Ca2+], which is due to the formation of a folded conformation of M5aFull. To clarify the underlying inhibitory mechanism, we analyzed the actin-activated ATP hydrolysis mechanism of the M5aFull at the inhibited and the activated states, respectively. Marked differences were found in the hydrolysis, Pi release, and ADP release steps between the activated and the inhibited states. The kinetic constants of these steps of the activated state were similar to those of the unregulated S1 construct, in which the rate-limiting step was the ADP release step. On the other hand, the Pi release rate from acto-M5aFull was decreased in EGTA by >1,000-fold, which makes this step the rate-limiting step for the actin-activated ATP hydrolysis cycle of M5aFull. The ADP off rate from acto-M5aFull was decreased by ∼10-fold, and the equilibrium between the prehydrolysis state and the post hydrolysis state was shifted toward the former state in the inhibited state of M5aFull. Because of these changes, M5aFull spends a majority of the ATP hydrolysis cycling time in the weak actin binding state. The present results indicate that M5aFull molecules at a low [Ca2+] is inhibited as a cargo transporter not only due to the decrease in the cross-bridge cycling rate but also due to the decrease in the duty ratio thus being dissociated from actin.

During a past decade, a number of myosin-like proteins have been found, and they are often called unconventional myosin because they fail to form thick filaments, one of the characteristics of “myosin” (for reviews, see Refs. 1Mermall V. Post P.L. Mooseker M.S. Science. 1998; 279: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar and 2Sellers J.R. Myosins.2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). Among them, class V myosin is best studied, because its function seems to be quite different from conventional myosin. The most intriguing finding is that myosin Va can travel for a long distance without dissociating from actin filaments (for a review, see Ref. 3Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) unlike conventional myosin. This feature has been termed “processive,” and it is thought that myosin Va functions as a cargo transporter rather than a force producer in cells (4Mehta A.D. Rock R.S. Rief M. Spudich J.A.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1091-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also shown that endosomal vesicles are transported by myosin Vb and Vc in cultured cells (14Lapierre L.A. Kumar R. Hales C.M. Navarre J. Bhartur S.G. Burnette J.O. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Bahler M. Goldenring J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1843-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 15Rodriguez O.C. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these vesicles are not always moved around and the transport process must be regulated by all means. One way to explain such a regulation of myosin V-based vesicle transport is the binding of myosin V to cargos. It was reported that the phosphorylation of myosin V down-regulates the vesicle transport in mitotic cells due to the dissociation from the vesicles (12Rogers S.L. Karcher R.L. Roland J.T. Minin A.A. Steffen W. Gelfand V.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The other is the direct regulation of the motor activity of myosin V. Recent biochemical studies have indicated that the regulation of the motor activity involves the interdomain interaction of myosin V (16Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Myosin Va is a two-headed myosin with two identically conserved head motor domains and the light chain binding domain consisting of six IQ sequences, IQXXXRGXXXR, as light chain binding sites. The dimer formation is achieved with a coiled-coil structure downstream of the IQ domain. This is followed by a series of flexible linkers and the predicted coiled-coil sequences. The C-terminal ∼400 amino acids of myosin Va form a globular tail domain mediating myosin Va recruitment to specific organelles, such as melanosome (10Wu X. Bowers B. Wei Q. Kocher B.

The actin-activated ATPase activity of full-length myosin Va (M5aFull) 2The abbreviations used are: M5aFull, full-length myosin Va; HMM, heavy meromyosin; S1, subfragment 1; CaM, calmodulin; Mant, methyl-anthraniloyl-; mdATP, 3′-Mant-2′-deoxy-ATP; mdADP, 3′-Mant-2′-deoxy-ADP; PBP, phosphate-binding protein; MDCC, 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)-coumarin; M, myosin Va; AM, actomyosin Va; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: M5aFull, full-length myosin Va; HMM, heavy meromyosin; S1, subfragment 1; CaM, calmodulin; Mant, methyl-anthraniloyl-; mdATP, 3′-Mant-2′-deoxy-ATP; mdADP, 3′-Mant-2′-deoxy-ADP; PBP, phosphate-binding protein; MDCC, 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)-coumarin; M, myosin Va; AM, actomyosin Va; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. is significantly inhibited at low Ca2+, whereas those of heavy meromyosin (HMM) or subfragment 1 (S1)-like constructs are not inhibited and constitutively active (16Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C-terminal globular tail plays an important role in the Ca2+-dependent regulation. By sedimentation analysis and electron microscopic observation, it was shown that myosin Va forms a folded conformation at low Ca2+ in which the tail domain is folded back toward the head, whereas it forms an extended conformation in high Ca2+ (16Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2333-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Of interest is that the conformational transition is closely correlated with activation of the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin Va (16Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2333-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because the lack of the tail domain abolishes the regulation, a model has been proposed, in which the tail domain interacts with and inhibits the myosin Va motor activity, and high Ca2+ abolishes the interaction between the head and tail domains, thus activating the actin-activated ATPase activity, presumably due to the conformational change of calmodulin (CaM) light chain. As described above, one of the most important motor properties of myosin V is its processivity, and this is closely correlated with the high duty ratio of myosin V. Because the high duty ratio myosin spends the majority of the cross-bridge cycle in the strong actin-binding form, it can move processively on actin filaments with possible cooperativity between the two heads. A critical question is whether the inhibition of the ATPase cycle at low Ca2+ is simply due to the decrease in the overall cycling rate or involves the change in the hydrolysis cycle mechanism that possibly affects the processive nature of myosin V. In this study, we analyzed the effect of Ca2+ on the kinetic mechanism of actin-activated ATPase reaction of the full-length myosin Va to address this question. Our results suggest that the decrease in the Ca2+ not only reduces the overall cycling rate but also changes the duty ratio of myosin Va. Materials—Escherichia coli strains XL1-Blue and DH10BAC were purchased from Stratagene (San Diego, CA), and Invitrogen, respectively. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-FLAG M2-agarose, purine nucleotide phosphorylase, 7-methylguanosine, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate kinase, and ADP were from Sigma. Ultrapure grade of ATP was purchased from AMRESCO Inc. (Solon, OH). 3′-Mant-2′-deoxy-ATP (mdATP) and 3′-Mant-2′-deoxy-ADP (mdADP) were kindly provided from Dr. Howard D. White (Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Spudich and Watt (22Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used after treatment of phalloidin (Invitrogen). Pyrene-actin was prepared as reported (23Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J.

Phosphate-binding protein (PBP) labeled with 7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl)-coumarin (MDCC) was prepared as previously described (25White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle myosin was prepared from turkey gizzard as described (27Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Full-length murine melanocyte-type myosin Va was expressed in Sf9 cells by co-infection of myosin Va heavy chain with CaM viruses and prepared using anti-FLAG antibody affinity column chromatography as described (28Sato O. White H.D. Inoue A. Belknap B. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28844-28854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The M5aFull fractions eluted from the affinity column were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against buffer A (30 mm KCl, 20 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.1 mm EGTA. Typically, 1 mg of protein was obtained from about 5 × 109 cells. The purified M5aFull was stored on ice and used within 3 days. For some experiments, nucleotide-free M5aFull was alternatively prepared by incubating with 0.2 units/ml apyrase at 25 °C for 30 min. The concentration of active sites of M5aFull was determined by using [2,8-3H]ADP/VO4. The unbound [2,8-3H]ADP/VO4 was removed using a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter, and the bound [2,8-3H]ADP/VO4 was detected by liquid scintillation counting. Steady-state ATPase Assay—The assay of steady-state ATPase activity was carried out at 25 °C in the presence of an ATP regeneration system. The assay was done in buffer A containing 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 5 μm CaM, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 1 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2, 10–100 μg/ml M5aFull, and various concentrations of F-actin from 0 to ∼20 μm. The liberated pyruvate was determined as described previously (29Reynard A.M. Hass L.F. Jacobsen D.D. Boyer P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic Measurements—The quenched flow measurements were performed at 25 °C using a Kin-Tek RQF-3 apparatus (Kin-Tek Corp., Clarence, PA) in buffer A plus 2 mm MgCl2, 5 μm CaM, 1 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2, and [γ-32P]ATP. M5aFull (1.85 μm head) and 0.4 μm [γ-32P]ATP were mixed, held in a delay line at the various times, and quenched by a second mix with 0.2 m perchloric acid and 50 mm NaH2PO4. The solution was then mixed with 1 ml of charcoal slurry, vortexed, and centrifuged to remove the unhydrolyzed ATP (27Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2380-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The data were fit to a double exponential equation and analyzed as described (25White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Stopped flow measurements were done at 25 °C with a Kin-Tek SF-2001 in buffer A containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 μm CaM, 1 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm CaCl2. The Mant nucleotides (λex = 356 nm) were excited by utilizing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer of tryptophan fluorescence (λex = 280 nm), and the fluorescence intensity was monitored using a 420-nm long pass filter. The wavelengths of the excitation and the emission in other experiments were as follows: λex = 365 nm with 370 ± 30-nm band pass filter and λem > 400 nm for pyrene-actin; λex = 295 nm and λem > 340 nm for tryptophan fluorescence; and λex = 433 nm with 436 ± 10-nm band pass filter and λem > 455 nm for MDCC-PBP, respectively. To measure the phosphate release step, 3 μm MDCC-PBP, 0.3 mm 7-methylguanosine, and 0.01 units/ml purine nucleotide phosphorylase were preincubated in all solution before the measurements, and 20 units/ml hexokinase and 2 mm glucose were added in a syringe containing actin to remove the contaminated ATP. The ratio of mixing two solutions was 1:1 in all experiments. Gel Electrophoresis—SDS-PAGE was carried out on a 4.5–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel according to the method of Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206989) Google Scholar). Molecular mass markers used were smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (204 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), phosphorylase b (97.4 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), myosin regulatory light chain (20 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). Other Measurements—The concentrations of the following reagents and proteins were determined by absorbance using the extinction coefficients reported: ATP and ADP, ɛ259 = 15,400; Mant nucleotides, ɛ255 = 23,300 (31Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar); actin, ɛ290 = 26,600 (32Houk Jr., T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar); pyrene-actin, ɛ290 = 29,400 (24Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Computer simulation was carried out using STELLA software version 8.1.5 (Isee Systems). Steady-state Actin-activated ATPase Activity of Full-length Myosin Va—Expression and purification of M5aFull (Fig. 1A) was done as described previously using anti-FLAG-agarose affinity chromatography (28Sato O. White H.D. Inoue A. Belknap B. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28844-28854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The purified M5aFull sample contained 190-kDa heavy chain and CaM light chain, and no significant contaminants were observed (Fig. 1B). All the experiments in the present study were done using this preparation. The basal ATPase activity (0.02 s–1) was increased in the presence of actin; however, the actin-activated ATPase activity was significantly influenced by Ca2+, consistent with the previous reports (16Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 877-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The steady-state ATPase activity was measured as a function of actin concentration, and the results were explained with Michaelis-Menten kinetics for both in the presence of 1 mm EGTA and 0.2 mm Ca2+. The obtained Vmax in the presence of Ca2+ was 8-fold larger than that in the presence of EGTA, and the KATPase value was 5-fold lower in the presence of Ca2+ than in its absence. On the other hand, we found that the basal ATPase activity was also influenced by Ca2+ (Fig. 2B). It has been suggested that the low ATPase activity in the presence of EGTA is due to the formation of the inhibited conformation of myosin Va (16Li X.D. Mabuchi K. Ikebe R. Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 315: 538-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Krementsov D.N. Krementsova E.B. Trybus K.M. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2333-2336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the steady-state ATPase activity in the presence of EGTA may not accurately represent the activity of the inhibited form, because a relatively small fraction of the unregulated myosin Va in the preparation would significantly increase the overall activity of the sample. To accurately determine the ATPase activity in the inhibited and the activated forms, respectively, we performed single turnover experiments. M5aFull was mixed with mdATP and held for 5 s to produce myosin Va (M)·mdADP·Pi intermediate, and then 60 μm actin and the excess amount of nonfluorescent ATP were added and followed the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the Mant group. After release of the products, the myosin active site binds ATP, but this does not reflect any fluorescence change because of the presence of excess nonfluorescent ATP. The decrease in the fluorescence intensity in Ca2+ up to 1 s was fit with a double exponential kinetics, and the observed rate constants (kobs) were 22 ± 4 and 3.5 ± 1.9 s–1 for the fast and slow rates, respectively (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the rate constant of the major fraction (∼65% in amplitude) observed in the presence of EGTA was 0.06 ± 0.01 s–1 with the minor phase of faster rate (0.31 ± 0.05 s–1, ∼20% in amplitude) (Fig. 3A). We could also observe the rapid phase (28 ± 4s–1), similar to the rate obtained in Ca2+. The fraction of the initial rapid phase in EGTA was approximately ∼15%, and this is thought to be due to the presence of the unregulated molecules. We expect that the rate constants obtained in this actin concentration are nearly saturated and thus similar to the Vmax values; nevertheless, the activity in EGTA was ∼30-fold lower than that obtained from the steady-state rate (Fig. 2). The result suggests that there is ∼15% of unregulated myosin Va present in the preparation. Fig. 3C shows the ATP single turnover rates of M5aFull without actin in the presence of EGTA and Ca2+. In this experiment, M5aFull was first mixed with unlabeled ATP and held for 5 s, and then an excess amount of Mant-ATP was added. Although the increase in the fluorescence intensity in EGTA followed a double exponential kinetics, the change in the intensity in Ca2+ followed a single exponential kinetics. The kobs values were 0.02–0.03 s–1 (∼30% in amplitude) and 0.003–0.004 s–1 (∼70% in amplitude) for fast and slow rates in the presence of EGTA, respectively, and 0.03–004 s–1 in the presence of Ca2+. This result also indicates that Ca2+ regulation is effective even in the absence of actin, and ATPase activity in the EGTA condition is inhibited.FIGURE 2Ca2+-dependent regulation of the steady-state actin-activated ATPase activity of M5aFull.

At 5 s after mixing M5aFull (0.3 μm head) with 3 μm mdATP, the solution was mixed with 60 μm F-actin plus 3 mm MgATP (before mix). The panels shown are the average of three fluorescence results. The observed rate constants (kobs) were obtained by fitting the time course to a double (I(t) = Ifaste–kobs1t + Islowe–kobs2t + C) or triple (I(t) = Ifaste–kobs1t + Imiddlee–kobs2t + Islowe–kobs3t + C) exponential equations. The inset in A shows a rapid decrease in fluorescence intensity within 1 s. The fast, middle, and slow kobs values in the presence of EGTA are 28 ± 4s–1 (∼15% of total amplitude), 0.31 ± 0.05 s–1 (∼20%), and 0.06 ± 0.01 s–1 (∼65%), respectively. The fast and slow kobs values in the presence of Ca2+ are 22 ± 4s–1 (∼75% of total amplitude) and 3.5 ± 1.9 s–1 (∼25%), respectively. The error bars indicate the S.E. (n = 3).

The fast rate, 0.02 s–1 (∼30% of total amplitude), and slow rate, 0.003 s–1 (∼70%), were observed in EGTA, and a single rate constant (0.04 s–1) was seen in Ca2+.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) ATP Binding to Full-length Myosin Va—The rate of ATP binding to M5aFull was determined by measuring the change in the fluorescence intensity of mdATP upon binding (not shown). The experiments were done in the absence and presence of actin. The time courses of fluorescence enhancement were fit by single exponential kinetics for both in EGTA and Ca2+. The kobs values showed a linear dependence on the mdATP concentration to yield the apparent second order rate constants (K1k+2(app)) of 1.91 ± 0.04 μm–1 s–1 and 1.80 ± 0.03 μm–1 s–1 in the EGTA and Ca2+, respectively. In the presence of actin, the apparent second order rate constants (K′1k′+2(app)) were 1.38 ± 0.02 and 3.1 ± 0.3 μm–1 s–1 in EGTA and Ca2+, respectively. The obtained values were similar to that previously reported for the S1 construct (33De La Cruz E.M. Wells A.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Ostap E.M. Sweeney H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It should be noted that the treatment of the samples with apyrase that eliminates any contaminated ADP did not alter the rate of ATP binding. This indicates that there was no contamination of ADP in the samples. ATP-induced Production of the Weak Actin Binding State of Actomyosin Va—The kinetics of ATP-induced transition of M5aFull from the rigor state to the weak actin binding state was monitored by measuring the changes in fluorescence intensity of pyrene-labeled actin (Fig. 4). The increase in the pyrene fluorescence upon the formation of “weak” actin-binding form of M5aFull was analyzed by a single exponential kinetics, and the kobs showed hyperbolic saturation curves on the ATP concentration (Fig. 4). The initial slope (Fig. 4, inset) of the curve represents a second order rate constant of ATP binding to acto-M5aFull (K′1k′+2). The K′1k′+2 values obtained from the change in pyrene fluorescence were 1.6 ± 0.4 and 3.4 ± 0.4 μm–1 s–1 in EGTA and Ca2+, respectively. These values are similar to those obtained from mdATP binding, suggesting that the Mant-moiety does not significantly influence the ATP binding rate to M5aFull. The maximal rates for the transition to the weak actin binding state were estimated from the hyperbolic curves to be 664 ± 66 s–1 and 694 ± 60 s–1, respectively, in EGTA and Ca2+. ATP-induced Enhancement of Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—It is known that the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity increases upon the addition of ATP, and this reflects the change in the conformation of myosin motor domain (i.e. the formation of the M·ADP·Pi ternary complex) (36Werber M.M.

The ATP dependence of the kobs showed a hyperbolic saturation curve to yield the maximum rate constants of 331 ± 35 and 240 ± 33 s–1 in EGTA and Ca2+, respectively (Fig. 5).

Real time measurements of net water flux in the lumen of single gastric glands of the intact amphibian stomach were performed using ion-selective double-barreled microelectrodes. Water movement was measured by recording changes in the concentration of impermeant TEA+ ions ([TEA+]gl) with TEA+-sensitive microelectrodes inserted in the lumen of individual gastric glands. Glandular K+ (K+gl) and H+ (pHgl) were also measured by using K+- and H+-sensitive microelectrodes, respectively. Stimulation with histamine significantly decreased [TEA]gl, indicating net water flow toward the gland lumen. This response was inhibited by the H+/K+-ATPase inhibitor, SCH 28080. Histamine also elicited a significant and reversible increase in [K+]gl that was blocked by chromanol 293B, a blocker of KCQN1 K+ channels. Histamine failed to induce net water flow in the presence of chromanol 293B. In the “resting state,” stimulation of CaR with diverse agonists resulted in significant increase in [TEA]gl. CaR activation also significantly reduced histamine-induced water secretion and apical K+ transport. Our data validate the strong link between histamine-stimulated acid secretion and water transport. We also show that cAMP-dependent [K+]gl elevation prior to the onset of acid secretion generates the osmotic gradient initially driving water into the gastric glands and that CaR activation inhibits this process, probably through reduction of intracellular cAMP levels.

Water transport is a process of vital importance for the physiology of the digestive system. Significant amounts of water are secreted/absorbed every day in the GI tract, and the molecular mechanisms involved are well characterized for most segments (1Masyuk A.I. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 545-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the case of the stomach, however, although much interest has been centered on the ion transport mechanisms linked to acid or alkaline secretion, the molecular mechanisms of water transport are not fully understood. Most of the information in this field derives from rather early reports where water transport was measured either in amphibian or mammalian stomach by monitoring change in weight (2Moody F.G.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2459-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In general, it is believed that in the stomach, as in other organ systems, water movement occurs secondarily to osmotic driving forces created by active ion transport (6Durbin R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 236: E63-E69PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rehm W.S. Butler C.F. Spangler S.G. Sanders S.S. J. Theor.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 1-228Google Scholar). Since gastric water flow (which can amount to up to 2 liters/day in humans (1Masyuk A.I. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F.

Gastrointestinal, Hepatobiliary, and Nutritional Physiology. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia1996: 91-118Google Scholar)) is proportional to acid secretion, it was previously assumed that secreted H+ and Cl– might create the osmotic driving force for water movement (6Durbin R.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 236: E63-E69PubMed Google Scholar). Later, Berglindh et al. (13Berglindh T. Dibona D.R. Ito S. Sachs G. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 238: G165-G176PubMed Google Scholar) proposed the “osmotic swelling” model in which the efflux of K+ from the acid-secreting cells into the canaliculi and into the gland lumen would create a gradient for the osmotic flow of water. To date, however, a clear correlation between the transport of specific ions and gastric water movement has yet to be established. More importantly, the temporal dynamics of gastric water flow have never been defined.Here we studied how the osmotic gradient driving water into the lumen of the glands in the initial phases of acid secretion is generated using an approach that allows real time monitoring of fluid movement in single gastric glands. Water movement was measured by recording changes in the concentration of impermeant ions with ion-sensitive microelectrodes inserted in the lumen of gastric glands in the intact perfused amphibian stomach. Our data show a direct correlation between time course of transport of specific ions, namely K+, and water movement in the secretory state.In this study, we also investigated how the activation of an unusual G-protein-coupled receptor, the extracellular Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaR), 5The abbreviations used are: CaR, Ca2+-sensing receptor; OCs, oxyntopeptic cells. 5The abbreviations used are: CaR, Ca2+-sensing receptor; OCs, oxyntopeptic cells. influences water secretion in the stomach. CaR was first described in the parathyroid gland (14Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2344) Google Scholar), where it serves as a detector for changes in extracellular [Ca2+], amino acids, and other polyvalent cations. The receptor has since been identified in many other cell types, including epithelial cells of the alimentary tract (for reviews, see Refs. 15Hofer A.M. Brown E.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar and 16Hofer A.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The formation and secretion of gastric juice, which is composed mostly of water, hydrochloric acid (145 mmol/liter in humans), and pepsinogen, is under the control of hormonal and neural pathways and is essentially mediated by gastrin, histamine, and acetylcholine (17Hersey S.J. Sachs G. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 155-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 18Yao X. Forte J.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 103-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Schubert M.L. Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2005; 21: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20Lloyd K.C. Soll A.H.

In addition, we previously showed that changes in the concentration of external free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]ext), working via CaR, can influence the secretory function of gastric mucosa (22Caroppo R. Gerbino A. Fistetto G. Colella M. Debellis L. Hofer A.M. Curci S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We found that stimulation with carbachol, which mobilizes intracellular Ca2+ in the oxyntopeptic cells (OCs), resulted in a substantial local increase in the extracellular [Ca2+] at the luminal face and a comparable depletion at the serosal aspect of amphibian acid-secreting cells (23Caroppo R. Gerbino A. Debellis L. Kifor O. Soybel D.I. Brown E.M. Hofer A.M. Curci S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6316-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The increase in [Ca2+] in the gastric gland lumen is due to activation of the plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase, which is highly expressed at the apical membrane of these cells, where it co-localizes with CaR.In the amphibian gastric mucosa, carbachol is a well known agonist of bicarbonate (24Debellis L. Caroppo R. Fromter E. Curci S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 235-241Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 25Flemstrom G. Garner A. Am. J.

Abad M.J. Michelangeli F. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G934-G941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that changes in [Ca2+]ext secondary to carbachol-induced increases in intracellular [Ca2+] were sufficient and necessary to elicit both alkaline and pepsinogen secretion, independently of intracellular [Ca2+] changes (22Caroppo R. Gerbino A. Fistetto G. Colella M. Debellis L. Hofer A.M. Curci S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Recent reports show that CaR may also be involved in the modulation of fluid secretion in different tissues. Lactating mammary gland can “sense” extracellular Ca2+ and adjusts milk secretion as well as the secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein and water in response to changes in [Ca2+]ext. This intricate set of responses defines a homeostatic system that helps to match milk production to the availability of Ca2+ (28VanHouten J. Dann P. McGeoch G. Brown E.M. Krapcho K. Neville M. Wysolmerski J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the kidney, CaR regulates renal Ca2+ excretion and influences the transepithelial movement of water and other electrolytes (29Chattopadhyay N. Baum M. Bai M. Riccardi D. Hebert S.C. Harris H.W. Brown E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F736-F743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Brown E.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, CaR, which is expressed along the entire gastrointestinal tract, seems to be involved in the modulation of fluid transport in the colon (31Hebert S.C. Cheng S. Geibel J. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).We found here that stimulation of CaR results in considerable attenuation of gastric water secretion under resting conditions. This modulation becomes less important, however, during maximal rates of acid secretion.MATERIALS AND METHODSTissue and Solutions—The experiments were performed on gastric fundus mucosa of Rana esculenta in accordance with the Italian guidelines for animal experiments. Frogs were sacrificed by decapitation followed by destruction of the spinal cord and brain. The isolated mucosa was mounted horizontally between two halves of a top-open Lucite chamber (aperture 0.2 cm2) with the serosal side facing up. The connective tissue layer was further removed with sharpened watchmaker forceps under direct microscopic observation in order to expose a number of glands for impalement with microelectrodes. Both the serosal and mucosal surfaces were constantly superfused with oxygenated Ringer’s solution at room temperature. Fast fluid exchange in the chamber was achieved within seconds from a shock-free, electronically controlled eight-way manifold.The control Ringer’s solution had the following composition: 102.4 mmol/liter Na+, 4.0 mmol/liter K+, 1.4 mmol/liter Ca2+, 0.8 mmol/liter Mg2+, 91.4 mmol/liter Cl–, 17.8 mmol/liter HCO–3 and 11 mmol/liter glucose. It was gassed with 5% CO2 in O2 and had a pH of 7.36.Tissues were maintained in resting state by serosal addition of cimetidine (a histamine H2 receptor blocker used to prevent acid secretion) or stimulated by serosal perfusion with histamine. All chemicals were of reagent grade and purchased from Farmitalia Carlo Erba (Milan, Italy), Sigma, Fluka Chemie AG (Buchs, Switzerland), Alexis Biochemicals (Lausen, Switzerland), or SmithKline Beecham (Baranzate, Italy).Transepithelial and Extracellular Ion Measurements—The transepithelial potential difference (Vt) was measured with a model 610C high impedance differential electrometer (Keithley, Cleveland, OH) using two flowing boundary calomel half-cells filled with 2.7 mol/liter KCl solution and connected to each bath solution downstream of the tissue. The serosal bath was connected to ground. The lumen of the gastric gland was punctured by lowering the ion-sensitive (TEA+, K+, H+, or Cl–) double-barreled microelectrode, mounted on a Leitz micromanipulator, perpendicular to the surface of an exposed gland under oblique (45°) observation through a stereomicroscope at ×50 magnification (Wild, Heerbrugg, Switzerland). The correct positioning of the microelectrode tip in the gland lumen was established by the following criteria: (i) the near identity of the glandular luminal potential (Vgl) with the transepithelial potential (Vt); (ii) the near identity of the electrical resistance recorded between the microelectrode reference channel and serosal bath macroelectrode with the transepithelial resistance. All measurements were performed with a model FD 223 dual channel electrometer (World Precision Instruments, New Haven, CT) and recorded on a strip chart recorder (Kipp & Zonen, Delft, The Netherlands).TEA+-sensitive Microelectrodes—Double-barreled TEA+-sensitive microelectrodes were constructed as described previously for pH-sensitive microelectrodes (24Debellis L. Caroppo R. Fromter E. Curci S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 235-241Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Debellis L. Iacovelli C. Fromter E. Curci S. Pflugers Arch. 1994; 428: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, two pieces of filament-containing aluminum silicate glass tubing of different diameter (1.5-mm outer diameter and 1.0-mm inner diameter and 1.1-mm outer diameter and 0.75-mm inner diameter) (Hilgenberg, Malsfeld, Germany) were fixed in parallel and melted together by first twisting and then untwisting them at melting point before they were pulled in a PE2 vertical puller (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan). Then the back of the thin channel was closed, and the thick channel was silanized for 180 s in dimethyldichlorosilane vapor (Fluka Chemie AG) and baked in the oven. The shank of the thick channel was back-filled with a small amount of the ligand mixture (World Precision Instruments), and its shaft was later filled with a solution containing 160 mmol/liter KCl and 1 mmol/liter TEA+.For all microelectrodes, the reference channel contained 500 mmol/liter KCl, and an Ag/AgCl wire was inserted. The average slope and resistance of the electrodes were 57.5 ± 0.4 mV per decade change in [TEA+](n = 26) and 180 ± 4 gigaohms (selective channel) and 125 ± 3 megaohms (reference channel). All microelectrodes were calibrated in the upper half-chamber before each puncture and, if the micropuncture was successful, also after the puncture by flushing the chamber with a HEPES-buffered Ringer’s solution containing different TEA+ concentrations (0.8, 1.0, and 1.5 mmol/liter). Although ion-selective microelectrodes respond to ionic activities and not to concentrations, calibrating solutions and results are reported as concentrations with the assumption that the activity coefficient does not change significantly during measurements (see Ref. 33Nicholson C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The slope of microelectrodes was not affected by pH (ranging between 4.0 and 8.0) or by spermine and Ca2+.pH-sensitive Microelectrode—The tip of the selective channel was back-filled with H+ ligand (Hydrogen Ionophore II, Mixture A/Mixture B; Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) and the shaft with a HEPES-buffered Ringer’s solution with pH 7.0. Average slope and resistance were 55.6 ± 0.4 mV/pH unit (n = 23), 292 ± 29 gigaohms (selective channel), and 187 ± 19 megaohms (reference channel). All microelectrodes were calibrated using HEPES-buffered Ringer’s solutions with pH values between 6.8 and 7.8.K+-sensitive Microelectrode—The K+ ligand (K+-selective liquid ion exchanger, Mixture A; Fluka) was inserted in the tip of the selective channel, and the shaft was filled with a HEPES-buffered Ringer’s solution containing 4.0 mmol/liter K+.K+ microelectrodes were calibrated in HEPES-buffered Ringer’s solutions containing 0.8, 4.0, and 10.0 mmol/liter K+. The sensitivity was 52.0 ± 0.6 mV (n = 13) for a 10-fold change in K+ concentration.Cl–-sensitive Microelectrodes—The Cl– ligand (Cl–-selective ion exchanger, Mixture A; Fluka) was inserted in the tip of the selective channel while the shaft was filled with HEPES-buffered Ringer’s solution containing 91.4 mmol/liter Cl–. Cl– microelectrodes were calibrated in Ringer’s solutions containing 50, 91.4, or 130 mmol/l Cl–. Average slope was 56.7 ± 0.9 mV (n = 4).Acid Secretion Measurements—Tissues were mounted vertically between two halves of a Lucite chamber having an exposed area of 0.64 cm2. Each half-chamber consisted of a circular fluid canal of 2.5-ml total volume filled with modified Ringer’s solution that was constantly recirculated by means of a bubble lift. The control Ringer’s solution on the serosal side was gassed continually with 5% CO2 in O2 (pH 7.36).The luminal solution was unbuffered and had the following composition: 102.4 mmol/liter Na+, 4.0 mmol/liter K+, 91.4 mmol/liter Cl–, 15 mmol/liter isethionate, 7 mmol/liter mannitol, and 11 mmol/liter d-glucose. To prevent accumulation of CO2, this solution was gassed with 100% O2 that was passed through a bottle containing Ba(OH)2 solution (50 mmol/liter). Acid secretion was measured with the pH-stat method (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). The titration procedure was activated every 10 min using 5 mmol/liter NaOH as the titrant, respectively. The transepithelial potential (Vt) was monitored with a voltmeter using two calomel half-cells connected to each bath solution. HCl secretion was stimulated, adding 500 μmol/liter histamine to the serosal solution (no cimetidine).Data Analysis and Statistics—Mean values are expressed ± S.E. of n individual micropuncture recordings. The significance of the observations was evaluated by Student’s t test for paired or unpaired data as appropriate, and p < 0.05 denoted a statistical difference.RESULTSTEA+ as a Tool to Measure Water Transport in Single Gastric GlandsThe technique employed to measure water transport relies on an electrophysiological approach developed in our laboratory. The method, based on the use of ion-selective microelectrodes inserted in the lumen of gastric glands, allows continuous monitoring, for extended periods of time (up to 3 h), of ion concentrations in the lumen of single glands of the intact amphibian stomach (22Caroppo R.

Water movement was measured by continuously superfusing the mucosal side of the tissue with Ringer’s solution containing an impermeant ion (TEA+) and measuring fluctuations in its concentration. The use of impermeant ions (TEA+ or TMA+) to evaluate water transport with microelectrodes has already been successfully applied in other laboratories in different tissues (33Nicholson C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Dietzel I. Heinemann U. Hofmeier G. Lux H.D. Exp.

(Lond.). 1995; 487: 685-697Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The ligand used to construct our microelectrodes is sensitive to K+ and TEA+ but in the presence of high TEA+ concentrations (1 mmol/liter) is selective only to TEA+. Fig. 1A shows a typical trace of a microelectrode calibrated with different K+ concentrations in the absence (upper trace) and in the presence of 1.0 mmol/liter TEA+ (lower trace). In the presence of TEA+ the average slope for K+ dropped to near zero values, and the ion exchanger became sensitive only to [TEA+] changes. Therefore, changes in TEA+ concentration in the gland lumen ([TEA+]gl) can be correlated with dilution or concentration of the intraglandular solution (i.e. with water movement across the gastric epithelium).After calibration in the perfusion chamber, the microelectrodes were advanced toward the basolateral membrane of OCs and positioned in the restricted space of the gland lumen. If, as shown in Fig. 1B (lower trace), microelectrodes were properly positioned in the gland lumen (for details, see “Materials and Methods”) the time course of the response to changes in luminal [TEA+] was much slower compared with when the tip was in the luminal bath (time to peak was 141.0 ± 11.8 s versus 20.3 ± 0.9 s; n = 4, respectively). Average slopes of bath/gastric gland lumen were not significantly different. The slope of microelectrodes was not affected by pH (ranging between 4.0 and 8.0) or by spermine and Ca2+. Fig. 1C shows that when the microelectrode tip was inserted in the lumen of a gastric gland, it was possible to record an immediate and reversible decrease in [TEA+]gl in response to increased osmolarity of the mucosal perfusate (300 mmol/liter mannitol), indicating entry of water in the gland lumen.Water Transport at Rest and after Stimulation: Correlation with Acid SecretionThe H+/K+-ATPase located on the apical membrane of the acid-secreting cells exchanges H+ for K+, and K+ is recycled from the lumen into the cytoplasm via apical K+ channels (40Sachs G. Chang H.H. Rabon E. Schackman R. Lewin M. Saccomani G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7690-7698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These channels are necessary for the H+-K+-ATPase to function, and in fact their inhibition results in extremely effective reduction of acid secretion (41Wallmark B. Larsson H. Humble L. J. Biol.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 1983; 97: 1-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we were concerned that the presence of TEA+ in the luminal bath could inhibit K+ movement across the apical membrane and block acid secretion. However, as shown in Fig. 2, the rate of histamine-stimulated acid secretion did not change when luminal TEA+ was added before (Fig. 2B) or after the addition of histamine (Fig. 2A). Another indication that TEA+ did not influence ion conductances (including K+ channels) was that mucosal membrane potential (Vm), measured with intracellular microelectrodes was not altered by TEA+ (Vm =–30.53 ± 8.25 mV in control and –30.00 ± 8.41 mV in the presence of TEA+, during histamine stimulation; n = 3). Taken together, these data indirectly exclude the inhibition of K+ movement through the apical membrane of OCs by TEA+ and indicate that the mucosa is still functional following exposure to luminal TEA+.FIGURE 2Effect of luminal TEA+ on gastric acid secretion rate.

As shown in Fig. 3, transepithelial potential (top trace) and glandular potential (middle trace) responded to stimulation with a typical, slow hyperpolarization due to ion transport mechanisms activated in stimulated cells (34Debellis L.

The response usually started after a lag period of 6–10 min (6.23 ± 0.43 min (S.E.), n = 4) and was fully reversible after the removal of histamine and perfusion with cimetidine. Fig. 4A summarizes the time course of changes in [TEA+]gl in experiments with different concentrations of histamine, showing that the dilution of [TEA+]gl increased significantly in parallel with concentrations of histamine.FIGURE 3Effect of stimulation with histamine on [TEA+] in the lumen of gastric glands (TEA+gl). Shown are original trace recordings of transepithelial potential (Vt), luminal surface-negative (upper trace) and gland lumen potential (Vgl)(middle trace) as measured by the reference barrel and [TEA+]gl as measured by a TEA+-selective barrel.
