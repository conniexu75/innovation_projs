They provide a fitting model to study the impact of ontogeny and microenvironment on chromatin state and whether chromatin modifications contribute to macrophage identity. Here, we profile the dynamics of four histone modifications across seven tissue-resident macrophage populations. We identify 12,743 macrophage-specific enhancers and establish that tissue-resident macrophages have distinct enhancer landscapes beyond what can be explained by developmental origin. Combining our enhancer catalog with gene expression profiles and open chromatin regions, we show that a combination of tissue- and lineage-specific transcription factors form the regulatory networks controlling chromatin specification in tissue-resident macrophages.

Macrophages are hematopoietic cells of the myeloid lineage that are specialized in phagocytosis and respond to diverse environmental signals (Epelman et al., 2014Epelman S. Lavine K.J. Randolph G.J.

In addition, tissue-resident macrophages play important homeostatic roles, depending on the tissue in which they reside. Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, prune synapses during development (Paolicelli et al., 2011Paolicelli R.C. Bolasco G. Pagani F. Maggi L. Scianni M. Panzanelli P. Giustetto M. Ferreira T.A.

Spleen red pulp macrophages phagocytose erythrocytes and recycle heme to maintain iron homeostasis (Chow et al., 2013Chow A. Huggins M. Ahmed J. Hashimoto D. Lucas D. Kunisaki Y. Pinho S. Leboeuf M.

Peritoneal cavity macrophages regulate the production of gut immunoglobulin (Ig) A by interacting with peritoneal B1 cells (Okabe and Medzhitov, 2014Okabe Y. Medzhitov R.

These studies, among others, highlight the plasticity of macrophages and their specialization to fulfill tissue-specific functions. Recent studies have demonstrated that most tissues are populated early during fetal development by macrophages that subsequently maintain themselves, independently of adult hematopoiesis, through longevity and limited self-renewal (Ginhoux et al., 2010Ginhoux F. Greter M. Leboeuf M. Nandi S. See P. Gokhan S. Mehler M.F. Conway S.J. Ng L.G.

Thus, most macrophages, although sharing a common lineage, take residence in tissues early during embryogenesis, and the respective macrophage compartments develop locally and independently from each other. A notable exception from this scheme is macrophages residing in the intestine, as these cells are constantly replenished from monocytes even in steady state (Bain et al., 2014Bain C.C. Bravo-Blas A.

Thus, distinct ontogeny is one defining feature of macrophages, but it is unclear to what extent it shapes macrophage identity. Emerging evidence indicates that environmental factors influence the specialization of tissue-resident macrophages. Heme has been shown to induce Spi-c, a transcription factor (TF) important for red pulp macrophage development (Haldar et al., 2014Haldar M. Kohyama M. So A.Y. Kc W. Wu X. Briseño C.G. Satpathy A.T.

Retinoic acid (RA) stimulates Gata6 expression and thereby contributes to the regulatory program of peritoneal macrophages (Okabe and Medzhitov, 2014Okabe Y. Medzhitov R.

Finally, TGF-β was shown to regulate a microglia expression program through Smad TFs (Abutbul et al., 2012Abutbul S. Shapiro J. Szaingurten-Solodkin I. Levy N. Carmy Y. Baron R. Jung S. Monsonego A.

These limited reports provide evidence that environment can govern the expression of tissue-specific macrophage signatures. Epigenetic modification is one conduit through which ontogeny and environment can influence the development of macrophage identities. The chromatin landscape, among other epigenomic features of a differentiated cell type, reflects both its developmental origin, as well as its future potential (Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014Lara-Astiaso D.

Nucleosomes are the fundamental unit of chromatin consisting, of ∼147 bases of DNA wrapped around a histone core. Nucleosome-depleted regions, known as “open chromatin,” contain regulatory elements—such as promoters and enhancers—that play a critical role in gene regulation (Gross and Garrard, 1988Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Nuclease hypersensitive sites in chromatin.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Changes enacted by chromatin remodelers, such as nucleosome eviction or insertion, as well as the addition or deletion of histone modifications, have been linked to changes in the expression of nearby genes (Cirillo et al., 2002Cirillo L.A. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Friedman D. Jarnik M. Zaret K.S. Opening of compacted chromatin by early developmental transcription factors HNF3 (FoxA) and GATA-4.Mol.

Controlling the double helix.Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Many regulatory modifications are ubiquitous, but variations on a global scale generate the distinct chromatin landscape observed between cell types (Ernst et al., 2011Ernst J. Kheradpour P. Mikkelsen T.S. Shoresh N. Ward L.D. Epstein C.B. Zhang X. Wang L. Issner R.

During development, pioneer TFs initiate chromatin accessibility to allow the binding of additional TFs (Cirillo et al., 2002Cirillo L.A. Lin F.R. Cuesta I. Friedman D. Jarnik M. Zaret K.S.

PU.1 has been implicated as a pioneering factor throughout hematopoietic development, especially in the myeloid lineage. In macrophages, PU.1 occupies most enhancers, where it is necessary for the maintenance of methylation on the fourth lysine of the H3 subunit (H3K4me1) (Ghisletti et al., 2010Ghisletti S. Barozzi I.

Cell. 2010; 38: 576-589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6340) Google Scholar). The cobinding of PU.1 with lineage-specific TFs orchestrates cell-type specificity by regulating expression and establishing the chromatin landscape (Heinz et al., 2010Heinz S. Benner C. Spann N.

Cell-type-specific responses to stimuli are largely coordinated through activation by stimulus-triggered TFs that frequently bind to previously occupied “poised” enhancers (Garber et al., 2012Garber M.

Poised enhancers may reflect past activity and persist throughout development or arise during lineage specification (Lara-Astiaso et al., 2014Lara-Astiaso D. Weiner A. Lorenzo-Vivas E. Zaretsky I. Jaitin D.A. David E. Keren-Shaul H. Mildner A. Winter D. Jung S. et al.Immunogenetics. Chromatin state dynamics during blood formation.Science. 2014; 345: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Active enhancers mark the current state of a cell and can be distinguished by the presence of acetyl groups on the histone tails, particularly H3K27ac (Creyghton et al., 2010Creyghton M.P. Cheng A.W. Welstead G.G. Kooistra T. Carey B.W. Steine E.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Frampton G.M. Sharp P.A. et al.Histone H3K27ac separates active from poised enhancers and predicts developmental state.Proc.

Genet. 2007; 39: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (2409) Google Scholar). Tissue-resident macrophages provide a fitting model for examining how chromatin is programmed through development to allow for plasticity within a cell type to specify tissue-specific functions. Here, we profile the expression and chromatin landscape of seven populations of mouse macrophages isolated from distinct tissues to determine the contributions of ontogeny and environment to tissue-resident macrophage identity. Based on the distribution of histone modifications, we map the regulatory elements of tissue-resident macrophages, including promoters, active enhancers, and poised enhancers. We compare candidate enhancers marked with H3K4me1 in different macrophage populations with those found in monocytes or neutrophils. Through analyzing the distinct enhancer landscape of tissue-resident macrophages, we assess the impact of developmental origin and local microenvironment and identify several potential regulators from TF-binding motifs within these regions. We further assess the essential contribution of tissue environment by replacing endogenous macrophages with adult bone-marrow-derived cells and transferring differentiated macrophages into a new tissue microenvironment. Collectively, our results indicate that, aside from ontogeny, the environment plays a critical role in shaping the unique identity and function of tissue-resident macrophages through the regulation of TFs. To elucidate the transcriptional and epigenomic networks in tissue-resident macrophages, we performed an array of complementary genome-wide assays on at least two biological replicates followed by high-throughput sequencing: RNA-seq, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq), and an assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (ATAC-seq) (Figure 1A). We purified macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils from fresh mouse tissues using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Experimental Procedures). Global gene expression profiles of purified cells were obtained by RNA-seq, and cells intended for ChIP-seq were crosslinked upon single-cell suspension, prior to sorting, to minimize the impact on chromatin state. Crosslinked samples of each population were used for profiling histone modifications, such as H3K4me1 (candidate enhancers), H3K4me2 (promoters and enhancers), H3K4me3 (promoters), and H3K27ac (active enhancers). Finally, we identified open chromatin regions through ATAC-seq (Buenrostro et al., 2013Buenrostro J.D. Giresi P.G. Zaba L.C. Chang H.Y. Greenleaf W.J.

Mildner A. Winter D. Jung S. et al.Immunogenetics. Chromatin state dynamics during blood formation.Science. 2014; 345: 943-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). To probe the spectrum of gene expression profiles among tissue-resident macrophages, we examined seven macrophage populations (brain microglia, spleen red pulp macrophages, liver Kupffer cells, lung macrophages, peritoneal cavity macrophages, and colonic large and ileal small intestinal macrophages), as well as monocytes. We identified 3,348 genes that were differentially expressed between at least two tissue-resident macrophages or monocytes (Figure 1B and Table S1). Many genes coding for TFs were uniquely expressed in specific macrophage populations, including Sall1 in microglia and Spi-c in red pulp macrophages (Figures 1B and 1C). Other population-specific genes included Clec4f in Kupffer cells (Yang et al., 2013Yang C.Y. Chen J.B. Tsai T.F. Tsai Y.C. Tsai C.Y. Liang P.H. Hsu T.L. Wu C.Y. Netea M.G. Wong C.H. Hsieh S.L. CLEC4F is an inducible C-type lectin in F4/80-positive cells and is involved in alpha-galactosylceramide presentation in liver.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8: e65070Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), Car4 in lung macrophages, and Tgfb2 in peritoneal macrophages (Figure 1C). Differentially expressed genes clustered into 11 groups by their expression patterns across samples (Figure 1B). Interestingly, macrophages that are presumably exposed to similar environmental cues displayed similar patterns of expression (Figures 1B, S1B, and S1C available online). Kupffer cells and splenic macrophages shared a cluster of highly expressed genes that are enriched for gene ontology (GO) annotations, such as heme and porphyrin metabolic processes, indicating their active role in erythrocyte turnover (Figures 1B and S1A, cluster III) (Chow et al., 2013Chow A. Huggins M. Ahmed J. Hashimoto D. Lucas D. Kunisaki Y. Pinho S. Leboeuf M. Noizat C. van Rooijen N. et al.CD169+ macrophages provide a niche promoting erythropoiesis under homeostasis and stress.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Similarly, small and large intestinal macrophages both express genes enriched for GO annotations that likely reflect their microbiota-exposed environment, such as response to bacterium and antigen processing (Figures 1B and S1A, cluster VII). RNA-seq analysis identified many genes expressed differentially by tissue-resident macrophage populations and monocytes and thereby corroborates and extends earlier expression profiling studies highlighting the inherent plasticity of this immune cell type (Gautier et al., 2012bGautier E.L. Shay T. Miller J. Greter M. Jakubzick C. Ivanov S. Helft J. Chow A. Elpek K.G. Gordonov S. et al.Immunological Genome ConsortiumGene-expression profiles and transcriptional regulatory pathways that underlie the identity and diversity of mouse tissue macrophages.Nat. Immunol. 2012; 13: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). Profiling genome-wide histone modifications can shed light on the current regulatory state of a cell type. We focused on the distributions of H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac because, taken together, these marks classify three important functional elements: promoters, poised enhancers, and active enhancers. To better understand the mechanisms underlying macrophage plasticity, we compared the histone modification signal of circulating myeloid cells, specifically monocytes and neutrophils, to an average macrophage signature obtained by computationally merging all macrophage populations (Figure 2A). The promoter of Mertk is active in macrophages, but not monocytes or neutrophils as visualized by the “merged” macrophage H3K4me3 signal (Figure 2A). However, the majority of active promoters—regions with high H3K4me3 intensity—were shared by all myeloid cells (8,861 of 10,806 promoters, 82%; Figures 2B and S2B and Table S2A). On the other hand, of the total 30,976 putative enhancers, defined as regions distal to the transcriptional start site (TSS) with high H3K4me1 and low H3K4me3, only 8,260 (27%) were shared by macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils. Indeed, both the loci of Emr1 (F4/80) and Mertk feature intragenic enhancers unique to macrophages (Figures 2A and S2E). Active enhancers marked with H3K27ac were even less likely to be shared between all three myeloid cell types (10%: Figure S2A). For instance, the gene locus harboring the complement system genes (C1qa) contains a macrophage-specific H3K27ac-enriched region (Figures 2A and S2E). Macrophage-specific enhancers were less conserved than other myeloid enhancers, suggesting that they are a late-acquired evolutionary function (Figure S2D). Interestingly, of the 12,743 (7,825 active) macrophage-specific enhancers, relatively few (< 2%) are shared across all macrophage populations (Figure S2C). Because enhancer usage is highly differential across cell types when compared to promoters, the enhancer landscapes likely form the basis for macrophage specificity and plasticity.Figure S2Myeloid Cells Have Distinct Chromatin Landscapes and Conservation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Venn diagrams representing the overlap of active enhancers (14,112) between macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils.

Distinct populations of tissue macrophages also acquire context-specific functions that are important for normal tissue homeostasis. To investigate mechanisms responsible for tissue-specific functions, we analyzed the transcriptomes and enhancer landscapes of brain microglia and resident macrophages of the peritoneal cavity. In addition, we exploited natural genetic variation as a genome-wide ""mutagenesis"" strategy to identify DNA recognition motifs for transcription factors that promote common or subset-specific binding of the macrophage lineage-determining factor PU.1. We find that distinct tissue environments drive divergent programs of gene expression by differentially activating a common enhancer repertoire and by inducing the expression of divergent secondary transcription factors that collaborate with PU.1 to establish tissue-specific enhancers. These findings provide insights into molecular mechanisms by which tissue environment influences macrophage phenotypes that are likely to be broadly applicable to other cell types."

Characterization of this mode of action additionally revealed a quality control function for enzymes that cleave bonds in the cell wall matrix. The results thus provide insight into the mechanism of cell wall assembly and suggest how best to interfere with the process for future antibiotic development. Penicillin and related beta-lactam drugs are one of our oldest and most widely used antibiotic classes. They have long been known to interfere with bacterial cell wall assembly as part of their mode of action (Park and Strominger, 1957Park J.T. Strominger J.L. Mode of action of penicillin.Science. 1957; 125: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The cell wall is an essential polysaccharide structure that surrounds most bacterial cells and protects their cytoplasmic membrane from osmotic rupture. It is built from the polymer peptidoglycan (PG), which consists of glycan chains with attached peptides used to crosslink adjacent glycans to form a matrix structure (Figure 1A). Beta-lactams disrupt PG biogenesis by inactivating enzymes called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (Tipper and Strominger, 1965Tipper D.J. Strominger J.L. Mechanism of action of penicillins: a proposal based on their structural similarity to acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1965; 54: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Bacteria encode a variety of PBPs that participate in PG assembly (Sauvage et al., 2008Sauvage E. Kerff F. Terrak M. Ayala J.A. Charlier P. The penicillin-binding proteins: structure and role in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2008; 32: 234-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The high-molecular-weight PBPs are the major PG synthases. They are subdivided into class A (aPBPs) and class B (bPBPs) enzymes (Figure 1B). aPBPs are bifunctional and possess both glycosyltransferase (GT) activity for polymerizing the glycan strands and transpeptidase (TP) activity for crosslinking them. bPBPs, on the other hand, are only known to possess TP activity. The primary target of beta-lactams is the TP active site of the synthetic PBPs, which is covalently modified by the drug. In addition to the PG synthases, beta-lactams also inhibit the low-molecular-weight PBPs. These factors belong to a large and diverse family of enzymes that cleave bonds in the PG matrix. Such enzymes, often referred to as PG hydrolases, are typically nonessential, but have been found to play important roles in morphogenesis (Uehara and Bernhardt, 2011Uehara T. Bernhardt T.G. More than just lysins: peptidoglycan hydrolases tailor the cell wall.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2011; 14: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The lethal activity of beta-lactams is thought to stem principally from the loss of wall integrity accompanied by cell lysis (Park and Strominger, 1957Park J.T. Strominger J.L. Mode of action of penicillin.Science. 1957; 125: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). According to the most widely accepted model, cell wall damage following beta-lactam treatment results from a drug-induced imbalance between the activities of cell wall synthases and hydrolases (Schwarz et al., 1969Schwarz U. Asmus A. Frank H. Autolytic enzymes and cell division of Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 419-429Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Tomasz and Waks, 1975Tomasz A. Waks S.

This view is supported by the observation that PG hydrolase inactivation can prevent or delay beta-lactam-induced cell lysis (Chung et al., 2009Chung H.S. Yao Z. Goehring N.W. Kishony R. Beckwith J.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 5094-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly little mechanistic insight underlies this general framework for drug action. It remains largely unclear which PG hydrolases disrupt the wall following drug treatment and whether these autolysins are “induced” to damage the wall or are simply carrying out their normal physiological function in the absence of TP activity. Clues suggesting a more complex mode of action for beta-lactams than simple TP inhibition have also been reported. Surprisingly, in Streptococcus pneumoniae mutants blocked for cell lysis, beta-lactam treatment still promoted cell death with kinetics similar to lysing cells (Moreillon et al., 1990Moreillon P. Markiewicz Z. Nachman S. Tomasz A. Two bactericidal targets for penicillin in pneumococci: autolysis-dependent and autolysis-independent killing mechanisms.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1990; 34: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Additionally, in Escherichia coli, beta-lactams were unexpectedly shown to cause a depletion of lipid-linked cell wall precursors prior to cell lysis (Kohlrausch and Höltje, 1991Kohlrausch U. Höltje J.V. Analysis of murein and murein precursors during antibiotic-induced lysis of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3425-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The lysis-independent effects of beta-lactams indicate that much remains to be learned about the events following TP inhibition and how they contribute to the killing activity of this vital class of antibiotics. These events have been difficult to elucidate because the effect of drug treatment on cell growth and morphology varies depending on the organism studied and on the number of different PBPs inhibited by the beta-lactam derivative used (Spratt, 1975Spratt B.G. Distinct penicillin binding proteins involved in the division, elongation, and shape of Escherichia coli K12.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). We overcame this challenge by studying the activity of mecillinam, a beta-lactam specific for a single essential PBP in the model gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (Spratt, 1975Spratt B.G. Distinct penicillin binding proteins involved in the division, elongation, and shape of Escherichia coli K12.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Our analysis revealed that, beyond simply inhibiting the TP activity of PBPs, mecillinam and other beta-lactams stimulate a deleterious futile cycle of cell wall synthesis and degradation by their target machineries that contributes to their lethal activity. Additional genetic analysis identified the enzyme responsible for beta-lactam-stimulated degradation of nascent PG. Characterization of the in vivo activity of this factor suggests a novel “quality control” function for cell wall cleaving enzymes in PG biogenesis. Our findings thus provide new insight into the cell wall assembly process in addition to uncovering an important mechanism by which beta-lactam antibiotics induce cell death. Like many rod-shaped bacteria, E. coli grows using two different PG biogenesis systems (Typas et al., 2012Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 123-136Google Scholar) (Figures 1C and 1D). The actin-like MreB protein and its partners constitute the Rod system, which catalyzes the insertion of new PG material along the cell body to promote cell elongation (Typas et al., 2012Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 123-136Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). The tubulin-like FtsZ protein, on the other hand, organizes the divisome to synthesize PG for the new daughter cell poles (de Boer, 2010de Boer P.A.J. Advances in understanding E. coli cell fission.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D). Each of these machineries requires an essential bPBP for their activity: PBP2 for the Rod system and PBP3 for the divisome (Typas et al., 2012Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 123-136Google Scholar) (Figures 1B–D). Proper PG biogenesis by these systems in E. coli is also thought to require the aPBPs, PBP1a and PBP1b, to promote glycan chain polymerization and crosslinking (Typas et al., 2012Typas A. Banzhaf M. Gross C.A. Vollmer W. From the regulation of peptidoglycan synthesis to bacterial growth and morphology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2012; 10: 123-136Google Scholar) (Figures 1B–1D). Rod system function is normally required for viability (Bendezú and de Boer, 2008Bendezú F.O. de Boer P.A.J. Conditional lethality, division defects, membrane involution, and endocytosis in mre and mrd shape mutants of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1792-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, Kruse et al., 2005Kruse T. Bork-Jensen J. Gerdes K. The morphogenetic MreBCD proteins of Escherichia coli form an essential membrane-bound complex.Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 78-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Inactivation of any of the essential components (MreB, MreC, MreD, PBP2, or RodA), causes cells to form spheres that fail to divide and eventually lyse. This lethal phenotype can be suppressed by overproduction of the division protein FtsZ, with the Rod- FtsZup cells growing and dividing as small spheres (Bendezú and de Boer, 2008Bendezú F.O. de Boer P.A.J.

Penicillin binding protein 2 is dispensable in Escherichia coli when ppGpp synthesis is induced.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1493-1501PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which increased FtsZ concentration suppresses the lethality of Rod system inactivation is not clear. In addition to genetic inactivation, Rod system function can also be blocked with the small molecules A22 (Gitai et al., 2005Gitai Z. Dye N.A. Reisenauer A. Wachi M. Shapiro L. MreB actin-mediated segregation of a specific region of a bacterial chromosome.Cell. 2005; 120: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) or mecillinam (Spratt, 1975Spratt B.G. Distinct penicillin binding proteins involved in the division, elongation, and shape of Escherichia coli K12.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) (Figure 2A). A22 inactivates MreB (Gitai et al., 2005Gitai Z. Dye N.A. Reisenauer A. Wachi M. Shapiro L. MreB actin-mediated segregation of a specific region of a bacterial chromosome.Cell. 2005; 120: 329-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), and mecillinam is a beta-lactam that is specific for the TP active site of PBP2 (Spratt, 1975Spratt B.G. Distinct penicillin binding proteins involved in the division, elongation, and shape of Escherichia coli K12.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1975; 72: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Because PBP2 can be rendered nonessential by the overproduction of FtsZ (Vinella et al., 1993Vinella D. Joseleau-Petit D. Thévenet D. Bouloc P. D’Ari R. Penicillin-binding protein 2 inactivation in Escherichia coli results in cell division inhibition, which is relieved by FtsZ overexpression.J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure 2B), we reasoned that studies of mecillinam presented a unique opportunity to study the consequences of PBP inhibition by beta-lactams under conditions where the target is not required for growth. The lethal effects of inactivating MreB with A22 are suppressed by the low-copy vector pTB63, from which the ftsQAZ operon is expressed via its native promoters (a condition we will henceforth designate as FtsZup) (Bendezú and de Boer, 2008Bendezú F.O. de Boer P.A.J. Conditional lethality, division defects, membrane involution, and endocytosis in mre and mrd shape mutants of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 1792-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). Surprisingly, however, FtsZup cells remained sensitive to mecillinam (Figure 2C). Thus, blocking PBP2 function with mecillinam is lethal even under conditions where the protein itself is not essential (Figure 2B). This observation suggested that, beyond inactivation of the TP activity of PBP2, mecillinam is also conferring a dominant-negative function to the inactivated protein. We reasoned that this toxic activity of inhibited PBP2 may stem from the malfunctioning of the Rod system. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells with both mecillinam and A22 to simultaneously inactivate the Rod system and the TP domain of PBP2. Indeed, inactivation of MreB with A22 in FtsZup cells completely suppressed the toxicity of mecillinam (Figure 2C). Genetic inactivation of the Rod system was also found to restore growth to FtsZup cells treated with mecillinam (Figure S1 available online). The contribution of Rod system malfunction to the lethal action of mecillinam was also apparent for cells lacking pTB63. Addition of mecillinam to a culture of wild-type cells led to a drop in culture OD600 and a loss of viability that was reduced in severity by cotreatment with A22 (Figures S2A and S2B). The production of a PBP2 variant with a defective TP active site [PBP2(S330A)] also killed FtsZup cells (Figure S2C), and this toxicity could also be suppressed by A22 treatment (Figure S2C). Thus, the toxicity induced by mecillinam is specific for PBP2 inhibition, and not the result of an off-target activity. We conclude that blocking the TP activity of PBP2 causes the Rod system to malfunction in a manner that contributes to the lethal activity of mecillinam.Figure S2Analysis of Mecillinam-Induced Cell KillingShow full caption(A and B) An overnight culture of MG1655 was diluted 1:100 in LB broth and grown at 30oC to exponential phase.

Results from Uehara and Park, 2008Uehara T. Park J.T. Growth of Escherichia coli: significance of peptidoglycan degradation during elongation and septation.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar previously found that mecillinam treatment induced the degradation of newly synthesized PG while A22 blocks synthesis. We suspected that the observed turnover of nascent PG was key to the lethal mode of action of mecillinam. We therefore monitored PG synthesis and turnover using similar procedures to those of Uehara and Park, 2008Uehara T. Park J.T. Growth of Escherichia coli: significance of peptidoglycan degradation during elongation and septation.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar. Cells were metabolically labeled with [3H]-meso-diaminopimelic acid (mDAP), an amino acid unique to the peptide moiety of PG (Figure 3A), following which, PG synthesis can be readily measured by monitoring the production of the major cytoplasmic precursor UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (UDP-MurNAc-pep5) and the incorporation of label into the PG matrix. [3H]-mDAP labeling can also be used to quantify PG turnover. The major degradation products of PG are disaccharide fragments liberated by lytic transglycosylases (LTs) (Fisher and Mobashery, 2014Fisher J.F. Mobashery S. The sentinel role of peptidoglycan recycling in the β-lactam resistance of the Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Bioorg. Chem. 2014; 56: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). Rather than hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond, these enzymes promote the formation of an anhydro linkage between the C1 and C6 positions of MurNAc to generate GlcNAc-anhydro-MurNAc-peptides (GlcNAc-anhMurNAc-peptide). These degradation products are normally imported and processed by a number of enzymes in the cytoplasm for recycling (Fisher and Mobashery, 2014Fisher J.F. Mobashery S. The sentinel role of peptidoglycan recycling in the β-lactam resistance of the Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Bioorg. Chem. 2014; 56: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). We therefore used a strain lacking the amidase AmpD to trap PG turnover products and allow the quantification of PG degradation without complications of complete recycling (Uehara and Park, 2008Uehara T. Park J.T. Growth of Escherichia coli: significance of peptidoglycan degradation during elongation and septation.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) (Figure 3A). To specifically monitor the effect of drug treatment on PG synthesis and degradation by the Rod system, divisome activity was blocked during the radiolabeling by expression of the FtsZ antagonist SulA prior to the addition of antibiotic(s). After 5 min of growth in the presence of drugs, [3H]-mDAP was added to the medium and growth was continued for 10 min (1/10th of a mass doubling). Cells were then harvested and extracted with hot (90°C) water. Soluble compounds (PG precursors and degradation products) were separated and quantified by HPLC and radiodetection. Material incorporated into the PG matrix was quantified as radioactive material released from the cell pellet by lysozyme treatment. In untreated cells, robust incorporation of label into the PG matrix was observed (Figure 4). Very little of the newly synthesized material was degraded as evidenced by the small amount of labeled anhMurNAc-peptides detected relative to the precursor pools (Figures 3B, 4, and S3). As reported by Uehara and Park, 2008Uehara T. Park J.T. Growth of Escherichia coli: significance of peptidoglycan degradation during elongation and septation.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, we found the effects of A22 treatment differed dramatically from those induced by mecillinam. In cells treated with A22, incorporation of radiolabel into mature PG was significantly reduced as expected. This defect was accompanied by increased pools of the PG precursors mDAP and labeled UDP-MurNAc-pep5 (Figures 3B, 4, and S3), suggestive of a late stage block in the synthesis pathway. Only a modest increase in anhMurNAc-peptide accumulation was observed following A22 treatment, indicating that the drop in label incorporation into the PG matrix resulted primarily from the inhibition of PG synthesis. Similarly, in cells treated with mecillinam, incorporation of label into PG was also greatly reduced (Figures 3B and 4). However, as expected from the results of Uehara and Park, 2008Uehara T. Park J.T. Growth of Escherichia coli: significance of peptidoglycan degradation during elongation and septation.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 3914-3922Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, a large pool of labeled turnover products was detected in mecillinam-treated samples (Figures 3B and 4). This observation confirms the conclusion that, rather than blocking PG synthesis by the Rod system like A22, mecillinam induced the degradation of nascent PG material produced by the machine. Given that A22 suppressed the toxicity of mecillinam, we wondered if it would also block the apparent futile cycle of nascent PG synthesis and turnover induced by this beta-lactam. This indeed proved to be the case (Figures 3B and 4), thus linking the induction of nascent PG turnover with the lethal mode of action of mecillinam.Figure S3Identification of the PG Species Observed in the Radiolabeled Samples Analyzed by HPLCShow full captionPulse labeling studies were performed in our WT labeling strain TU278 [ΔlysA ΔampD] or its ΔldcA, ΔdacA, or ΔnagZ derivatives exactly as described for Figure 3.

Similarly, pentapeptide or anhydro-disaccharide species were identified based on their accumulation in strains lacking the DacA carboxypeptidase or the NagZ glucosaminidase, respectively. PBP inhibition by beta-lactams was previously found to decrease cellular levels of the final PG precursor, lipid II (Kohlrausch and Höltje, 1991Kohlrausch U. Höltje J.V. Analysis of murein and murein precursors during antibiotic-induced lysis of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3425-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based on in vitro PBP assays, it was recently suggested that the decline in lipid II concentration may result from the stimulation of glycan strand synthesis when TP activity is blocked (Banzhaf et al., 2012Banzhaf M. van den Berg van Saparoea B. Terrak M. Fraipont C. Egan A. Philippe J. Zapun A. Breukink E. Nguyen-Distèche M. den Blaauwen T. Vollmer W. Cooperativity of peptidoglycan synthases active in bacterial cell elongation.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 85: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). A dual mode of action for beta-lactams was thus proposed where TP inhibition and substrate depletion act synergistically to promote efficient bacterial killing (Banzhaf et al., 2012Banzhaf M. van den Berg van Saparoea B. Terrak M. Fraipont C. Egan A. Philippe J. Zapun A. Breukink E. Nguyen-Distèche M. den Blaauwen T. Vollmer W. Cooperativity of peptidoglycan synthases active in bacterial cell elongation.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 85: 179-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the futile-cycle of PG synthesis and turnover induced by beta-lactams is likely to be the main driver of the PG precursor depletion observed here and by others (Kohlrausch and Höltje, 199"
https://openalex.org/W2098145231,"Cell size control is an intrinsic feature of the cell cycle. In bacteria, cell growth and division are thought to be coupled through a cell size threshold. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence disproving the critical size paradigm. Instead, we show through single-cell microscopy and modeling that the evolutionarily distant bacteria Escherichia coli and Caulobacter crescentus achieve cell size homeostasis by growing, on average, the same amount between divisions, irrespective of cell length at birth. This simple mechanism provides a remarkably robust cell size control without the need of being precise, abating size deviations exponentially within a few generations. This size homeostasis mechanism is broadly applicable for symmetric and asymmetric divisions, as well as for different growth rates. Furthermore, our data suggest that constant size extension is implemented at or close to division. Altogether, our findings provide fundamentally distinct governing principles for cell size and cell-cycle control in bacteria."

Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are promising therapeutic agents that can potentially generate an unlimited range and quantity of clinically relevant cell types that are not rejected by the patient’s immune system. Several studies have reported generation of cardiomyocytes from hiPSCs (Burridge et al., 2012Burridge P.W. Keller G. Gold J.D. Wu J.C.

In a guinea pig model of cardiac injury, transplanted human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CMs) showed electric coupling to native myocardium (Shiba et al., 2012Shiba Y.

Reinecke H. et al.Human ES-cell-derived cardiomyocytes electrically couple and suppress arrhythmias in injured hearts.Nature. 2012; 489: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, preclinical studies in large animal models of MI are necessary to fully evaluate the therapeutic potential of this approach and to empirically determine the optimal combination of cell types, supplementary factors, and delivery methods to maximize efficacy and stringently assess safety (Cibelli et al., 2013Cibelli J. Emborg M.E. Prockop D.J. Roberts M. Schatten G. Rao M. Harding J. Mirochnitchenko O. Strategies for improving animal models for regenerative medicine.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 271-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To this end, Chong et al. utilized a nonhuman primate model of myocardial ischemia, injecting one billion hESC-CMs into the hearts of macaques with MI injury, and finding extensive evidence of engraftment, remuscularization, and electromechanical synchronization 2 to 7 weeks after transplantation (Chong et al., 2014Chong J.J. Yang X. Don C.W. Minami E. Liu Y.W. Weyers J.J. Mahoney W.M. Van Biber B. Cook S.M. Palpant N.J. et al.Human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes regenerate non-human primate hearts.Nature. 2014; 510: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Despite these promising findings, telemetric electrocardiographic (ECG) evaluation demonstrated ventricular arrhythmias in some treated animals, suggesting further investigation of optimal cell quantities and delivery approaches is warranted. Currently, poor engraftment of transplanted cardiomyocytes presents a significant barrier to transplantation-based approaches for myocardial cell therapy. In vitro studies strongly suggest that myocytes survive better when cocultured with endothelial cells (ECs) than when cultured alone (Xiong et al., 2012Xiong Q. Ye L. Zhang P. Lepley M. Swingen C. Zhang L. Kaufman D.S. Zhang J. Bioenergetic and functional consequences of cellular therapy: activation of endogenous cardiovascular progenitor cells.Circ. Res. 2012; 111: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Coadministration of ECs could enhance CM survival and benefit left ventricular (LV) myocardial perfusion, metabolism, and contractile activity through release of signaling molecules such as nitric oxide, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and insulin growth factor (IGF), which has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis (Davis et al., 2006Davis M.E. Hsieh P.C. Takahashi T. Song Q. Zhang S. Kamm R.D. Grodzinsky A.J. Anversa P. Lee R.T. Local myocardial insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) delivery with biotinylated peptide nanofibers improves cell therapy for myocardial infarction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 8155-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, Brutsaert, 2003Brutsaert D.L.

Davis M.E. Lisowski L.K. Lee R.T. Endothelial-cardiomyocyte interactions in cardiac development and repair.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2006; 68: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, we recently demonstrated that transplantation of hiPSC-derived ECs (hiPSC-ECs) and smooth muscle cells (hiPSC-SMCs) into ischemic porcine myocardial tissue contributes to improvements in perfusion, wall stress, and cardiac performance (Xiong et al., 2012Xiong Q. Ye L. Zhang P. Lepley M. Swingen C. Zhang L. Kaufman D.S. Zhang J. Bioenergetic and functional consequences of cellular therapy: activation of endogenous cardiovascular progenitor cells.Circ. Res. 2012; 111: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); however, myocardial repair and functional improvements may be even more extensive if primary force-producing myocardial cells are included in the population of transplanted cells. In the present study, we injected three hiPSC-derived cell types (hiPSC-CMs, hiPSC-ECs, and hiPSC-SMCs) directly into injured hearts in a porcine large animal model of acute myocardial infarction. Cells were coinjected through an epicardial fibrin patch that provided prolonged release of the prosurvival factor insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and cell engraftment and functional outcomes were evaluated. Our results show engraftment of cells from all three lineages at the site of injury, for at least 4 weeks after injection. This was accompanied by improvements in myocardial wall stress, metabolism, and contractile performance, and, importantly, did not lead to the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Together, these findings show that coadministration of multiple hiPSC-cardiovascular lineage cell populations promotes myocardial repair in large-animal models of MI. hiPSCs were reprogrammed from human dermal fibroblasts and engineered to express eGFP (Figure S1 available online) and differentiated into CMs via the Sandwich method (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang J. Klos M. Wilson G.F. Herman A.M. Lian X. Raval K.K. Barron M.R. Hou L. Soerens A.G. Yu J. et al.Extracellular matrix promotes highly efficient cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells: the matrix sandwich method.Circ. Res. 2012; 111: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Isolated areas of contracting cells typically appeared on day 7 of differentiation (Movies S1, S2, and S3) and were collected 1 week later for purification via a microdissection and preplating method. Expression of cardiac-specific proteins in differentiated hiPSC-CMs was evaluated on day 30 after cells started contracting. Nearly all hiPSC-CMs expressed slow myosin heavy chain, α-sarcomeric actin (Figure 1A), and the cardiac-specific myofilament cTnT (Figure 1B). Approximately 20%–30% of the hiPSC-CMs expressed the 2v isoform of myosin light chain (MLC2v) (Figure 1B, middle), which is found only in ventricular CMs, and cardiac connexin-43 was present at numerous points of contact between adjacent cells (Figure 1C). The purity of the final hiPSC-CM population was as high as 93% when evaluated via flow cytometry analysis of cTnT expression (Figures 1D and 1E) and >90% when evaluated via fluorescence immunostaining for cTnT expression (Figure 1F). hiPSC-ECs and hiPSC-SMCs were generated via established differentiation protocols (Hill et al., 2010Hill K.L. Obrtlikova P. Alvarez D.F. King J.A. Keirstead S.A. Allred J.R. Kaufman D.S. Human embryonic stem cell-derived vascular progenitor cells capable of endothelial and smooth muscle cell function.Exp.

We then tested our hypothesis that transplantation of three hiPSC-derived cardiac cell types would improve recovery after ischemic myocardial injury in a large-animal model (swine) of ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. A total of 92 pigs underwent the IR protocol; 89 pigs survived and were divided into five groups (Table S1). Animals receiving CMs, EC, and SMCs (Cell group) or CMs, ECs, SMC, and the fibrin/IGF-1 patch (Cell+Patch group) were injected with two million hiPSC-CMs, two million hiPSC-ECs, and two million hiPSC-SMCs (six million cells total) directly into the injured myocardium; for animals in the Cell+Patch group, the needle was inserted through an IGF-1-containing fibrin scaffold patch (Figure S2) that had been created over the site of injury. Animals in the Patch group were treated with scaffold patch alone, and both the patch and the cells were withheld from animals in the MI group. Animals in the Sham group underwent all surgical procedures for induction of IR injury, except for the ligation step, and recovered without any experimental treatments. We then evaluated the engraftment and survival rates of the transplanted cells. Since the transplanted cells were genetically male and engineered to express GFP, while the recipient pigs were female, we performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) assessments for the human Y chromosome. Lineages of surviving cells were determined by staining for expression of the human-specific EC marker CD31 (hiPSC-ECs), for coexpression of GFP and α-smooth-muscle actin (SMA) (hiPSC-SMCs), and for coexpression of GFP and cTnT (hiPSC-CMs). At 4 weeks after injury, 4.2% ± 1.1% of transplanted cells survived in animals in the Cells group while 8.97% ± 1.8% survived in the hearts of Cell+Patch animals. In contrast, 3.2% ± 0.4% of the two million cells administered to the CM group survived. Substantial proportions of all three transplanted cell types were observed in Cell+Patch hearts: 27.1% ± 5% of surviving transplanted cells were hiPSC-CMs, 34.2% ± 10% were hiPSC-ECs, and 40.5% ± 1% were hiPSC-SMCs. These observations suggest that the IGF-1-containing fibrin patch may have substantially improved the engraftment of all three hiPSC-derived cell lineages. Furthermore, GFP-expressing cells were present in cardiac muscle fibers (Figures 2A), but rarely in fibers composed of porcine cardiomyocytes (Figures S3A–S3D), suggesting that the transplanted hiPSC-CMs may have developed into new muscle fibers rather than incorporating into existing host cardiac muscle. GFP+ cells were also identified in capillaries and arterioles (Figures 2B and 2C), although the proportion of vessels apparently generated directly from transplanted cells was less than 0.1%. Measurements of cardiac function were evaluated 1 and 4 weeks after injury and cell transplantation. Left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was significantly better in Cell+Patch group animals than in MI and Patch animals (Figure 3A) at 4 weeks. Systolic thickening fractions that reflect regional myocardial contractility were significantly greater in the infarct zone (IZ) and at the border zone (BZ) of the infarct in hearts from Cell+Patch animals than in MI hearts at both week 1 and week 4 time points (Figure 3B). Infarct size was significantly smaller in Cell+Patch hearts than in MI hearts (p < 0.05) at week 1, while the difference between Cell+Patch and Patch hearts approached statistical significance (p = 0.051) (Figure 3C). Measurements of regional wall stress performed 4 weeks after injury were significantly lower in Cell+Patch hearts than in Patch hearts (Figure 3D). Together, these results show that transplantation of multiple hiPSC-derived cardiac lineages, in combination with IGF-1/fibrin patch, improves cardiac function after MI. We then determined whether these functional improvements in Cell+Patch animals were accompanied by improved myocardial bioenergetics and efficient ATP utilization. Myocardial ATP hydrolysis rates were measured in vivo with the 31P MRS-MST method (Xiong et al., 2013Xiong Q. Ye L. Zhang P. Lepley M. Tian J. Li J. Zhang L. Swingen C. Vaughan J.T. Kaufman D.S. Zhang J. Functional consequences of human induced pluripotent stem cell therapy: myocardial ATP turnover rate in the in vivo swine heart with postinfarction remodeling.Circulation. 2013; 127: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed at the BZ of the infarct under both baseline and elevated cardiac work states in response to catecholamine stimulation. Myocardial PCr/ATP ratios that reflect mitochondrial energetic efficiency, were significantly higher in animals from the Cell+Patch group than in MI animals under baseline conditions (Figure 3E), while the rate of ATP hydrolysis was significantly higher in Cell+Patch group hearts than in MI and Patch hearts during high cardiac workload (Figure 3F); measurements in Patch and MI animals were similar under both conditions. Collectively, these observations indicate that the transplantation of hiPSC-derived cardiovascular cells improved LV pump function and myocardial energy metabolism while reducing infarct size. Arrhythmogenesis is a primary risk associated with pluripotent cell-derived CM therapy for treatment of cardiac disorders. In a recent study, significant ventricular arrhythmias were detected after transplantation of hESC-CMs in a nonhuman primate model of MI (Chong et al., 2014Chong J.J. Yang X. Don C.W. Minami E. Liu Y.W. Weyers J.J. Mahoney W.M. Van Biber B. Cook S.M. Palpant N.J. et al.Human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes regenerate non-human primate hearts.Nature. 2014; 510: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the hiPSC-CM patch transplantation protocol used here might be associated with onset of cardiac arrhythmia. Ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced in 16 pigs who then received the fibrin/IGF-1 patch alone (Patch group), the patch and ten million hiPSC-CMs (Patch+CMs), or neither experimental treatment (Table S1). ECGs were recorded continuously for 4 weeks afterward using an implantable loop recorder. Severe arrhythmias and ST elevations were observed in all animals during coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion, but no animal in any treatment group developed spontaneous arrhythmia during the 4-week follow-up period. Furthermore, no evidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced in response to programmed electrical stimulation (PES) in hearts of Patch+CM group animals, even when the most aggressive stimulation protocol was applied. Thus, the combined Patch+hiPSC-CM administration protocol used for the experiments described in this report does not appear to impair the electromechanical stability of swine hearts. We next assessed how Cell+Patch treatment improves cardiac function. One possibility is through induction of cytoprotective mechanisms. To evaluate this possibility, we measured apoptosis in the hearts of animals sacrificed 3 days after IR injury and treatment (Figures 4A–4G). At the BZ of the infarct, apoptotic (i.e., TUNEL+) cells were significantly less common in animals from the Cell+Patch group than in MI and Patch animals, both in the total cell population (Figure 4F) and specifically among CMs (i.e., cTnI+ cells) (Figure 4G). Furthermore, the proportion of CMs that expressed Nkx2.5 (Figures 4H–4N), which has been shown to protect CMs from oxidative stress (Toko et al., 2002Toko H. Zhu W. Takimoto E. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Zou Y. Oka T. Akazawa H. Mizukami M. Sakamoto M. et al.Csx/Nkx2-5 is required for homeostasis and survival of cardiac myocytes in the adult heart.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24735-24743Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was significantly greater in Cell+Patch animals than in MI animals at week 4 (p < 0.05), and the difference between Cell+Patch and Patch animals approached statistical significance (p = 0.056), at week 1 after IR injury (Figure 4N). Nkx2.5 expression in MI hearts increased at week 4 but remained significantly lower than in Cell+Patch hearts. Thus, transplantation of hiPSC-derived cells increased cell survival during the first few days after IR injury and is associated with upregulation of Nkx2.5 expression. The decline in apoptosis could also result from improvements in wall stress and decreased fibrosis. Consistently, examination of Masson-Trichrome-stained heart sections from animals sacrificed at week 4 showed thicker subepicardium in the region where the patch was applied (∼2.44 mm) than in animals from the Sham (0.16 mm) or MI (0.88 mm) groups (Figure S4). Increased angiogenesis could also contribute to improved ventricular function. We therefore assessed whether transplantation of hiPSC-derived cardiac cells promotes angiogenesis in peri-infarct border zone (BZ) of MI hearts. Four weeks after injury, CD31+vascular structures and arterioles that coexpressed CD31 and SMA were significantly greater in the BZ of Cell and Cell+Patch hearts than in the corresponding regions of MI and Patch hearts (Figure 5). Additionally, vascular density was significantly greater in the CM group than in the MI group. Thus, transplantation of the hiPSC-derived cardiac cells promoted neovascularization, probably by inducing paracrine mechanisms in recipient myocardial tissue (Table S2). The cell and patch treatments may also have delayed the immune response to IR injury. While infiltration of cells expressing the inflammatory marker CD11b (Figures S5A–S5F) peaked 3 days after injury in the MI group, this was significantly delayed in the IZ and BZ regions of hearts from Cell+Patch animals (Figure S5G). CD11b+ cells were significantly more common in Cell+Patch hearts than in MI hearts at week 1 but not at week 4, while the CM, Cells, and Patch groups showed a statistically nonsignificant increase at weeks 1 and 4, suggesting a delayed host immune response following cell transplantation, possibly reducing immune rejection and increasing engraftment and survival of hiPSC-derived cells. This increase in angiogenesis observed after Cell+Patch treatment could be due to release of paracrine factors, as suggested by studies showing that endothelial cells promote cardiomyocyte survival (Xiong et al., 2012Xiong Q. Ye L. Zhang P. Lepley M. Swingen C. Zhang L. Kaufman D.S. Zhang J. Bioenergetic and functional consequences of cellular therapy: activation of endogenous cardiovascular progenitor cells.Circ. Res. 2012; 111: 455-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To determine whether hiPSC-derived vascular cells possess cytoprotective effects similar to those previously reported in similar cell types, we cultured hiPSC-CMs under hypoxic conditions in media collected from the hiPSC-derived vascular cells (i.e., conditioned media) or with unconditioned (basal) media. hiPSC-CMs tended to shrink when cultured with unconditioned media but not when cultured with the conditioned media (Figures 5I and 5J). Culture in conditioned media was also associated with significant declines in hiPSC-CM apoptosis (Figures 5K, 5L, and 5N) and in the amount of cytoplasmic leakage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from hiPSC-CMs (Figure 5M). Thus, hiPSC-derived vascular cells appear to release paracrine factors that protect hiPSC-CMs from hypoxic injury. We then performed protein array analysis to identify paracrine factors that may be responsible for these in vitro cytoprotective effects and that might induce repair mechanisms in injured myocardial tissue. A total of 21 factors were detected, and their expression was confirmed in hiPSC-CMs, as well as hiPSC-derived vascular cells (Table S2). Several of the identified factors are known to impede apoptosis (angiogenin, angiopoietin, IL-6, MMP-1, PDGF-BB, TIMP-1, uPAR, and VEGF), induce cell migration or homing (angiogenin, angiopoietin, IL-8, MCP-1, MCP-3, MMP-9, uPAR, and VEGF), and promote cell division (angiogenin, angiopoietin, PDGF-BB, and VEGF), suggesting multiple paracrine mechanisms through which hiPSC-ECs and hiPSC-SMCs could promote CM survival and cardiac repair. Understanding changes in the expression profile of myocardial proteins will help reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying improvements in left ventricular function associated with cell therapy. To provide further insights into these mechanisms, we performed a quantitative proteomics analysis on LV tissues from SHAM hearts and from MI hearts that were treated with or without hiPSC-derived vascular cells (which have both hiPSC-ECs and hiPSC-SMCs) after IR injury (Figure S6). We confidently identified 66 proteins whose expression pattern was altered in MI hearts but fully or partially restored to normal after cell transplantation (Figure 6). Thus, the functional benefits associated with cell therapy appear to be accompanied by a recovery of the myocardial protein expression profile of the recipient hearts. The present study is among the first to evaluate the combined administration of three hiPSC-derived cardiovascular lineage cells in a large-animal model of ischemic myocardial injury. Our results indicate that when hiPSC-CM, hiPSC-SMC, and hiPSC-EC injection is performed through a fibrin patch that has been created over the injection site and contains gelatin microspheres that release IGF-1 into the surrounding tissue, the engraftment rate of the transplanted cells can be as high as 8.97% ± 1.8% 4 weeks after transplantation, which is ∼20-fold greater than the engraftment rate observed when adult swine progenitor cells were evaluated in the same animal model (Zeng et al., 2007Zeng L. Hu Q. Wang X. Mansoor A. Lee J. Feygin J. Zhang G. Suntharalingam P. Boozer S. Mhashilkar A. et al.Bioenergetic and functional consequences of bone marrow-derived multipotent progenitor cell transplantation in hearts with postinfarction left ventricular remodeling.Circulation. 2007; 115: 1866-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our results also demonstrate that the transplanted cells developed into functioning CMs and vascular cells and that the combination of hiPSC-CM, hiPSC-EC, and hiPSC-SMC injection with patch application led to significant improvements in LV wall stress, infarct size, systolic thickening fraction, vascular density, and ATP turnover rate. These findings are consistent with the concept that the severity of LV functional decline and structural remodeling is proportional to scar size (Pfeffer and Braunwald, 1990Pfeffer M.A. Braunwald E. Ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. Experimental observations and clinical implications.Circulation. 1990; 81: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar) and that LV dilatation and hypertrophy are exacerbated as increases in systolic wall stress propagate from the IZ and BZ to the adjacent myocardium (Pfeffer and Braunwald, 1990Pfeffer M.A. Braunwald E. Ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction. Experimental observations and clinical implications.Circulation. 1990; 81: 1161-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (2585) Google Scholar). Previous attempts to isolate hiPSC- or hESC-derived CMs have been only moderately successful. Xu et al., 2006Xu C. Police S. Hassanipour M. Gold J.D. Cardiac bodies: a novel culture method for enrichment of cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells.Stem Cells Dev. 2006; 15: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar used a method based on Percoll separation and cardiac body formation to obtain hESC-CMs, but just 35%–66% of the isolated cells expressed slow myosin heavy chain or cTnT, suggesting that the purity of the obtained population would not be sufficient for use in large-animal models. With the differentiation protocol (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang J. Klos M. Wilson G.F. Herman A.M. Lian X. Raval K.K. Barron M.R. Hou L. Soerens A.G. Yu J. et al.Extracellular matrix promotes highly efficient cardiac differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells: the matrix sandwich method.Circ. Res. 2012; 111: 1125-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) used here, 68% of the differentiated cells expressed cTnT, and the purity was subsequently increased to >90% via microdissection and preplating, yielding a total of three to four million hiPSC-CMs per well. This yield and purity is sufficient for experiments in large animal models and supports the feasibility of potential clinical trials. One of the primary factors limiting the effectiveness of cell therapy is the low proportion of transplanted cells that survive in the recipient heart a few weeks after transplantation (Beauchamp et al., 1999Beauchamp J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2035472204,"The global rise in obesity has revitalized a search for genetic and epigenetic factors underlying the disease. We present a Drosophila model of paternal-diet-induced intergenerational metabolic reprogramming (IGMR) and identify genes required for its encoding in offspring. Intriguingly, we find that as little as 2 days of dietary intervention in fathers elicits obesity in offspring. Paternal sugar acts as a physiological suppressor of variegation, desilencing chromatin-state-defined domains in both mature sperm and in offspring embryos. We identify requirements for H3K9/K27me3-dependent reprogramming of metabolic genes in two distinct germline and zygotic windows. Critically, we find evidence that a similar system may regulate obesity susceptibility and phenotype variation in mice and humans. The findings provide insight into the mechanisms underlying intergenerational metabolic reprogramming and carry profound implications for our understanding of phenotypic variation and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2017109450,"Normal energy metabolism is characterized by periodic shifts in glucose and fat oxidation, as the mitochondrial machinery responsible for carbon combustion switches freely between alternative fuels according to physiological and nutritional circumstances. These transitions in fuel choice are orchestrated by an intricate network of metabolic and cell signaling events that enable exquisite crosstalk and cooperation between competing substrates to maintain energy and glucose homeostasis. By contrast, obesity-related cardiometabolic diseases are increasingly recognized as disorders of metabolic inflexibility, in which nutrient overload and heightened substrate competition result in mitochondrial indecision, impaired fuel switching, and energy dysregulation. This Perspective offers a speculative view on the molecular origins and pathophysiological consequences of metabolic inflexibility."
https://openalex.org/W2147984307,"Obesity is associated with increased blood pressure (BP), which in turn increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. We found that the increase in leptin levels seen in diet-induced obesity (DIO) drives an increase in BP in rodents, an effect that was not seen in animals deficient in leptin or leptin receptors (LepR). Furthermore, humans with loss-of-function mutations in leptin and the LepR have low BP despite severe obesity. Leptin's effects on BP are mediated by neuronal circuits in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), as blocking leptin with a specific antibody, antagonist, or inhibition of the activity of LepR-expressing neurons in the DMH caused a rapid reduction of BP in DIO mice, independent of changes in weight. Re-expression of LepRs in the DMH of DIO LepR-deficient mice caused an increase in BP. These studies demonstrate that leptin couples changes in weight to changes in BP in mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2022264956,"Glycosylation processes are under high natural selection pressure, presumably because these can modulate resistance to infection. Here, we asked whether inactivation of the UDP-galactose:β-galactoside-α1-3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GT) gene, which ablated the expression of the Galα1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc-R (α-gal) glycan and allowed for the production of anti-α-gal antibodies (Abs) in humans, confers protection against Plasmodium spp. infection, the causative agent of malaria and a major driving force in human evolution. We demonstrate that both Plasmodium spp. and the human gut pathobiont E. coli O86:B7 express α-gal and that anti-α-gal Abs are associated with protection against malaria transmission in humans as well as in α1,3GT-deficient mice, which produce protective anti-α-gal Abs when colonized by E. coli O86:B7. Anti-α-gal Abs target Plasmodium sporozoites for complement-mediated cytotoxicity in the skin, immediately after inoculation by Anopheles mosquitoes. Vaccination against α-gal confers sterile protection against malaria in mice, suggesting that a similar approach may reduce malaria transmission in humans."

RNA tailing (nontemplated nucleotide addition to the 3′ end of RNA) is one of the most frequent types of RNA modification, with a deep evolutionary root and diverse molecular functions. In bacteria, adenylation of mRNA triggers RNA degradation whereas polyadenylation in eukaryotes increases the stability and translatability of mRNA (Dreyfus and Régnier, 2002Dreyfus M. Régnier P. The poly(A) tail of mRNAs: bodyguard in eukaryotes, scavenger in bacteria.Cell. 2002; 111: 611-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Tailing is catalyzed by a group of template-independent ribonucleotidyl transferases that contain DNA polymerase β-like nucleotidyl transferase domain (Aravind and Koonin, 1999Aravind L. Koonin E.V. DNA polymerase beta-like nucleotidyltransferase superfamily: identification of three new families, classification and evolutionary history.Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Apart from canonical poly(A) polymerases (PAPs) that generate poly(A) tail of mRNA, many noncanonical PAPs have been described from fission yeast to human (Martin and Keller, 2007Martin G. Keller W. RNA-specific ribonucleotidyl transferases.RNA. 2007; 13: 1834-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, Norbury, 2013Norbury C.J. Cytoplasmic RNA: a case of the tail wagging the dog.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because some noncanonical PAPs catalyze uridylation instead of adenylation, noncanonical PAPs are also called terminal uridylyl transferases (TUTases or TUTs). Some PAPs/TUTs have more relaxed nucleotide specificity and carry out both uridylation and adenylation. Humans have seven noncanonical PAPs/TUTs with distinct substrate specificity and subcellular localization. Uridylation of mRNA was initially noticed at the 3′ ends of miRNA-directed cleavage products in Arabidopsis and mammalian cells (Shen and Goodman, 2004Shen B. Goodman H.M. Uridine addition after microRNA-directed cleavage.Science. 2004; 306: 997Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). U-tails were also detected on human replication-dependent histone mRNAs that lack a poly(A) tail (Mullen and Marzluff, 2008Mullen T.E. Marzluff W.F. Degradation of histone mRNA requires oligouridylation followed by decapping and simultaneous degradation of the mRNA both 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Histone mRNAs are uridylated and degraded at the end of S phase or upon inhibition of DNA replication (Mullen and Marzluff, 2008Mullen T.E. Marzluff W.F. Degradation of histone mRNA requires oligouridylation followed by decapping and simultaneous degradation of the mRNA both 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to 5′.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 50-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). TUT4 (ZCCHC11) was reported to catalyze histone mRNA uridylation (Schmidt et al., 2011Schmidt M.J. West S. Norbury C.J.

Rhoads R.E. mRNAs containing the histone 3′ stem-loop are degraded primarily by decapping mediated by oligouridylation of the 3′ end.RNA. 2013; 19: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although two other TUTs (TUT1/MTPAP/PAPD1 and TUT3/PAPD5/TRF4-2) were proposed in an earlier study (Mullen and Marzluff, 2008Mullen T.E. Marzluff W.F.

Uridylation induces rapid decay of histone mRNA through both the 5′–3′ degradation by XRN1, DCP2, and LSM1 and the 3′–5′ degradation by exosome and ERI1 (3′hExo) (Hoefig et al., 2013Hoefig K.P.

Cell. 2014; 53: 1020-1030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Interestingly, uridylation occurs not only on poly(A)-lacking mRNAs but also on poly(A)+ mRNAs, as shown first with the actin (act1) mRNA in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Rissland et al., 2007Rissland O.S. Mikulasova A. Norbury C.J. Efficient RNA polyuridylation by noncanonical poly(A) polymerases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3612-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When six mRNAs were examined by circularized rapid amplification of cDNA ends (cRACE) technique, all of them were found to bear short U-tails (usually one or two uridines) at the end of poly(A) tails albeit at varying frequencies, indicating that mRNA uridylation may be widespread in fission yeast (Rissland and Norbury, 2009Rissland O.S. Norbury C.J. Decapping is preceded by 3′ uridylation in a novel pathway of bulk mRNA turnover.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The stability of the urg1 mRNA increased in a mutant lacking Cid1 which is one of the TUTs in fission yeast (Rissland et al., 2007Rissland O.S. Mikulasova A. Norbury C.J. Efficient RNA polyuridylation by noncanonical poly(A) polymerases.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 3612-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, Rissland and Norbury, 2009Rissland O.S. Norbury C.J. Decapping is preceded by 3′ uridylation in a novel pathway of bulk mRNA turnover.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 616-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The uridylation frequency was enhanced in mutants defective of deadenylase and decapping enzyme (ccr4Δ and dcp1-ts). Based on these results, it was proposed that uridylation and deadenylation may act redundantly to induce decapping. A more recent study showed that Arabidopsis mRNAs are also subject to uridylation (Sement et al., 2013Sement F.M. Ferrier E. Zuber H. Merret R. Alioua M. Deragon J.M. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Lange H. Gagliardi D. Uridylation prevents 3′ trimming of oligoadenylated mRNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 7115-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Short uridyl residues (1–2 uridines) were detected on deadenylated, decapped mRNAs. The Cid1 homolog URT1 is required for uridylation. But, curiously, URT1 mutation did not have a major impact on mRNA turnover and instead inhibited trimming of mRNA from the 3′ end (Sement et al., 2013Sement F.M. Ferrier E. Zuber H. Merret R. Alioua M. Deragon J.M. Bousquet-Antonelli C. Lange H. Gagliardi D. Uridylation prevents 3′ trimming of oligoadenylated mRNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 7115-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), implying that uridylation may be necessary to establish the directionality (5′–3′) rather than to control the rate of mRNA decay. Therefore, although these observations are intriguing, it was unclear if uridylation has a conserved function across species and whether animal poly(A)+ mRNAs are also uridylated. In addition, because previous studies examined a few individual mRNAs by RACE and small-scale cloning, it remained to be tested whether or not uridylation occurs globally and if the observed changes in uridylation and poly(A) length are statistically significant. To investigate tail structures at the genomic scale, we recently developed a method called TAIL-seq that deep-sequences the 3′ most fragments of RNAs (Chang et al., 2014bChang H. Lim J. Ha M. Kim V.N. TAIL-seq: genome-wide determination of poly(A) tail length and 3′ end modifications.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 1044-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The TAIL-seq protocol begins with removal of abundant noncoding RNAs such as rRNA, tRNA, small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) by affinity-based depletion and size fractionation. To avoid any bias against unconventional tails, TAIL-seq does not use splint ligation or oligo-d(T) enrichment. The resulting RNA sample enriched with mRNA is subsequently ligated to the 3′ adaptor that contains biotin residues. Following partial fragmentation, the 3′ most fragments are purified using streptavidin beads and ligated to the 5′ adaptor. Paired-end sequencing of the cDNA library yields 51 nt from the 5′ terminus of the fragment (to identify the transcript) and 231 nt from the 3′ terminus (to examine the tail sequences). TAIL-seq provided us with a unique opportunity to investigate poly(A) tail length and additional 3′ modifications simultaneously at the genomic scale. Surprisingly, we found that the vast majority of mRNAs are subject to uridylation in mammals. Over 85% of mRNAs are terminally uridylated at a frequency of higher than 1% in both NIH 3T3 and HeLa cells (Chang et al., 2014bChang H. Lim J. Ha M. Kim V.N. TAIL-seq: genome-wide determination of poly(A) tail length and 3′ end modifications.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 1044-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Interestingly, U-tails are found mainly on mRNAs with short A-tails (less than ∼25 nt), indicating that uridylation may occur following deadenylation. We further detected a negative correlation between uridylation frequency and mRNA half-life, suggesting a role of uridylation in general mRNA decay. Current model for eukaryotic mRNA decay pathway is mainly based on the pioneering genetic and biochemical studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Garneau et al., 2007Garneau N.L. Wilusz J. Wilusz C.J. The highways and byways of mRNA decay.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 113-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, Houseley and Tollervey, 2009Houseley J. Tollervey D. The many pathways of RNA degradation.Cell. 2009; 136: 763-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, Norbury, 2013Norbury C.J.

The enzymes and control of eukaryotic mRNA turnover.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Decay is generally initiated by deadenylation that is mediated by multiple deadenylases such as the Pan2-Pan3 complex and the Ccr4-Not complex. Subsequently, deadenylated mRNAs are subject to either of two major decay pathways. In the 5′–3′ decay pathway, the Lsm1–7 complex binds to the 3′ end of deadenylated mRNA and recruits the decapping complex (Dcp1/2) that removes 5′ cap structure. Subsequently, 5′ monophosphate-dependent exoribonuclease, Xrn1, digests mRNA processively. From the opposite orientation, a multisubunit exosome complex degrades deadenylated mRNAs from the 3′ end. This model seems to apply generally to most, if not all, eukaryotic species. However, S. cerevisiae is unusual among eukaryotes in that it does not have any known TUT homolog with uridylation activity and that mRNAs in S. cerevisiae do not carry terminal U-tails (Norbury, 2013Norbury C.J. Cytoplasmic RNA: a case of the tail wagging the dog.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 14: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, the current model for mRNA decay, particularly in mammals, may need to be revised to incorporate the recent findings of pervasive uridylation (Lee et al., 2014Lee M. Kim B. Kim V.N. Emerging roles of RNA modification: m(6)A and U-tail.Cell. 2014; 158: 980-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to identify enzyme(s) that catalyze mRNA uridylation in mammals and understand the significance of uridylation in the mRNA decay pathway. We discover TUT4 and TUT7 as uridylyl transferases for poly(A)+ mRNAs in humans and delineate in detail the action mechanism and molecular function of uridylation in the mRNA decay pathway. Based on these results, we propose a revised model for general mRNA decay in mammals. In order to identify enzyme(s) responsible for mRNA uridylation, we took a candidate approach by depleting seven human TUTases (Figure S1A available online). Because TUT2 (also known as GLD2 and PAPD4), TUT4 (ZCCHC11), and TUT7 (ZCCHC6) act redundantly in mono-uridylation of precursor of let-7 (pre-let-7) (Heo et al., 2012Heo I. Ha M. Lim J. Yoon M.J. Park J.E. Kwon S.C. Chang H. Kim V.N. Mono-uridylation of pre-microRNA as a key step in the biogenesis of group II let-7 microRNAs.Cell. 2012; 151: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we knocked down TUTases in two subgroups (TUT1/3/5/6 and TUT2/4/7) by transfecting siRNA mixtures into HeLa cells (Figure S1B) and carried out TAIL-seq (Figure 1A). Overall frequency of uridylation was quantified by dividing the read number of terminally uridylated mRNAs by that of total mRNAs. Because short A-tails are preferentially uridylated (Chang et al., 2014bChang H. Lim J. Ha M. Kim V.N. TAIL-seq: genome-wide determination of poly(A) tail length and 3′ end modifications.Mol. Cell. 2014; 53: 1044-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), uridylation frequency in short A-tail range (5–25 nt) is shown in Figure 1. Interestingly, when TUT2/4/7 were depleted, terminal uridylation was significantly reduced while RNAi of TUT1/3/5/6 did not affect uridylation.Figure 1TUT4 and TUT7 Are Required for mRNA Uridylation in Human CellsShow full caption(A) Uridylation frequency measured by small-scale TAIL-seq (with Illumina MiSeq) following RNAi of the indicated genes.

To narrow down on individual TUTases, we generated knockout HeLa cell lines using TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) against the genes coding TUT2, TUT4, or TUT7 proteins (Figure S1C). We observed a modest decrease of uridylation in both TUT4 and TUT7 knockout cells, but not in TUT2 knockout cells (Figure 1B). Repeated attempts to generate double knockout of TUT4 and TUT7 by utilizing the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) systems have failed (Figure S1D). Although genomic deletion was effectively introduced by the nucleases, mutant clones disappeared during clonal selection processes (Figure S1D), which indicates that the combined activity of TUT4 and TUT7 is essential for cell viability. Of note, previous studies have shown that TUT4 and TUT7 are highly similar in their domain organization and activity in pre-miRNA uridylation (Heo et al., 2012Heo I. Ha M. Lim J. Yoon M.J. Park J.E.

Thus, TUT4 and TUT7 (TUT4/7) may act redundantly in mRNA uridylation as well as in pre-miRNA uridylation. To confirm this notion, we carried out simultaneous transient RNAi against TUT4/7 by transfecting siRNAs (Figures 1C and S1E). The TUT4/7 knockdown cells looked largely normal and proliferated at a modestly reduced rate with a slight increase of apoptosis after 4 days of siRNA treatment (Figures S1F and S1G). Under this condition, uridylation of mRNA was significantly reduced when both TUT4 and TUT7 are depleted (Figure 1C). Oligo-uridylation (≥2 U) was more sensitive to TUT4/7 knockdown than mono-uridylation was (3.71-fold and 1.36-fold decrease, respectively), suggesting that a relatively high level of TUT4/7 may be required to generate oligo-U-tails on mRNA. Gene-level analyses revealed that the majority of mRNA species (638 out of 746 genes, 85.5%) are decreased in uridylation following TUT4/7 knockdown (p = 7.69 × 10−100, one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test) (Figure 1D; Table S1). This result strongly indicates that TUT4/7 uridylate most, if not all, mRNAs. Figure 1E presents 21 most abundant mRNAs as examples, the majority of which are reduced in uridylation upon TUT4/7 knockdown. Two biological replicate experiments showed a comparable decrease of uridylation (Figure S1H). Histone mRNAs that lack poly(A) tails are also uridylated and their uridylation is dependent modestly on TUT4/7, but not on TUT1/2/3/5/6 (data not shown). However, poly(A)– histone mRNAs were excluded from our current data analyses because we used nonsynchronous cell population for our experiments, and it is known that uridylation of histone mRNA occurs specifically at the end of S phase (Mullen and Marzluff, 2008Mullen T.E. Marzluff W.F.

It would be more appropriate to investigate histone mRNAs using synchronous cells in future studies. It is intriguing that uridylation occurs preferentially on shortened A-tails in plants and animals (Chang et al., 2014bChang H. Lim J. Ha M. Kim V.N.

Lange H. Gagliardi D. Uridylation prevents 3′ trimming of oligoadenylated mRNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 7115-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Figure 2A shows the distribution of U-tails over different lengths of A-tails in HeLa cells. The frequency of uridylation on the transcripts with a short A-tails (5–25 nt) is higher than that on the rest (A-tails of >25 nt), especially when only oligo-U (≥2 U) is counted. Note that mRNAs with A-tails of shorter than 5 nt were excluded from this analysis as it is sometimes difficult to distinguish them from genomic A-rich sequences in 3′ UTR. When TUT4/7 were depleted, uridylation on short A-tails was selectively reduced (especially for oligo-U), indicating that TUT4/7 are responsible for the specific uridylation of short A-tails (Figure 2A). To understand the mechanism underlying such strong association with A-tail length, we performed in vitro uridylation assays using immunopurified full-length TUTases (Figures 2B and S2A–S2C ). Substrate RNAs were chemically synthesized to contain heterogenous sequences (the last 20 nt from the SHOC2 3′ UTR) linked to A-tails of various lengths (0, 10, 25, and 50 nt) at the 3′ end (Figure 2B). We also used a “swapped” control (A25R) that has a 25 nt A segment at the 5′ side of the SHOC2 3′ UTR such that the RNA is identical to SHOC2-A25 (A25) in the overall length and base composition, but lacks an A-tail at the 3′ end (Figure 2B). Interestingly, RNAs with no tail (A0) or a short A-tail (A10) were oligo-uridylated efficiently by TUT4 under the condition where pre-let-7a-1 is mono-uridylated weakly (Figure 2B). A25 and A50 were less efficiently uridylated than A0 and A10 were. The A25R RNA was a much better substrate than the A25 was, indicating that it is the 3′ A-tail length (not the overall RNA length) that is measured by TUT4 (Figure 2B). Comparable results were obtained with full-length TUT7 protein (Figures S2A and S2B), again demonstrating that these two related enzymes are functional paralogs. The U-tail length in Figures S2A and S2B was overall shorter than those in Figure 2B because the amount of immunoprecipitated TUT7 was smaller than that of TUT4 in Figure 2B (data not shown). We also prepared recombinant TUT7 protein (951–1,495 aa) from Escherichia coli and used the fragment for in vitro uridylation assay (Figure S2C). Apart from the SHOC2 RNAs (Figure S2D), we synthesized and tested another series of RNAs based on the CALM1 3′ UTR sequences (Figure 2C). The purified protein fragment was fully capable of carrying out uridylation in an A-tail length-dependent manner with both RNAs (Figures 2C and S2D, see below). Thus, the C-terminal half of TUT7 is sufficient to recognize and uridylate single-stranded RNAs with a short A-tails (less than ∼25 nt), in a 3′ UTR sequence-independent manner. These results suggest that TUT4/7 possess an intrinsic ability to measure the 3′ terminal A length and avoid uridylation of long A-tails. As poly(A)+ mRNAs are associated with poly(A) binding protein (PABP) in cells, we asked if PABP has an influence on mRNA uridylation. It was previously shown that PABP preferentially interacts with poly(A) or A-rich sequences (Eliseeva et al., 2013Eliseeva I.A. Lyabin D.N. Ovchinnikov L.P.

However, use of EEG microstates as neurophysiological biomarkers requires assessment of the test-retest reliability of microstate analysis.We analyzed resting-state, eyes-closed, 30-channel EEG from 10 healthy subjects over 3 sessions spaced approximately 48 hours apart. We identified four microstate classes and calculated the average duration, frequency, and coverage fraction of these microstates. Using Cronbach's α and the standard error of measurement (SEM) as indicators of reliability, we examined: (1) the test-retest reliability of microstate features using a variety of different approaches; (2) the consistency between TAAHC and k-means clustering algorithms; and (3) whether microstate analysis can be reliably conducted with 19 and 8 electrodes.The approach of identifying a single set of ""global"" microstate maps showed the highest reliability (mean Cronbach's α > 0.8, SEM ≈ 10% of mean values) compared to microstates derived by each session or each recording. There was notably low reliability in features calculated from maps extracted individually for each recording, suggesting that the analysis is most reliable when maps are held constant. Features were highly consistent across clustering methods (Cronbach's α > 0.9).

How the 3D genome organization is orchestrated and implicated in pluripotency and lineage specification is not understood. Here, we find that maturation of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) pRNA is required for establishment of heterochromatin at ribosomal RNA genes, the genetic component of nucleoli, and this process is inactivated in pluripotent ESCs. By using mature pRNA to tether heterochromatin at nucleoli of ESCs, we find that localized heterochromatin condensation of ribosomal RNA genes initiates establishment of highly condensed chromatin structures outside of the nucleolus. Moreover, we reveal that formation of such highly condensed, transcriptionally repressed heterochromatin promotes transcriptional activation of differentiation genes and loss of pluripotency. Our findings unravel the nucleolus as an active regulator of chromatin plasticity and pluripotency and challenge current views on heterochromatin regulation and function in ESCs."

Here we investigated the immunomodulatory properties of representative species of commonly dominant small-intestinal microbial communities, including six streptococcal strains (four Streptococcus salivarius, one S. equinus, one S. parasanguinis) one Veillonella parvula strain, one Enterococcus gallinarum strain, and Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 as a bench mark strain on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. The different streptococci induced varying levels of the cytokines IL-8, TNF-α, and IL-12p70, while the V. parvula strain showed a strong capacity to induce IL-6. E. gallinarum strain was a potent inducer of cytokines and TLR2/6 signalling. As Streptococcus and Veillonella can potentially interact metabolically and frequently co-occur in ecosystems, immunomodulation by pair-wise combinations of strains were also tested for their combined immunomodulatory properties. Strain combinations induced cytokine responses in dendritic cells that differed from what might be expected on the basis of the results obtained with the individual strains. A combination of (some) streptococci with Veillonella appeared to negate IL-12p70 production, while augmenting IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α responses. This suggests that immunomodulation data obtained in vitro with individual strains are unlikely to adequately represent immune responses to mixtures of gut microbiota communities in vivo. Nevertheless, analysing the immune responses of strains representing the dominant species in the intestine may help to identify immunomodulatory mechanisms that influence immune homeostasis."

Typhi), the cause of typhoid fever, continues to be a major public health concern, particularly in developing countries. There are more than 20 million cases of typhoid fever every year, which result in more than 400,000 deaths (Crump and Mintz, 2010Crump J.A. Mintz E.D.

Dis. 2004; 38: S127-S134Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Unlike the illnesses associated with most other Salmonella, which are usually self-limiting gastroenteritis (i.e., “food poisoning”), typhoid fever is a systemic, often lethal disease (Parry et al., 2002Parry C.M.

In addition, in contrast to most Salmonella enterica serovars, which can infect a broad range of hosts, S. Typhi exhibits remarkable host specificity, causing symptomatic infections only in humans (Ohl and Miller, 2001Ohl M.E. Miller S.I. Salmonella: a model for bacterial pathogenesis.Annu. Rev.

Typhi is unable to replicate in most hosts, except chimpanzees where it was found to reach levels equivalent to those in humans (Edsall et al., 1960Edsall G. Gaines S. Landy M. Tigertt W.D. Sprinz H.

Typhi did not cause typical typhoid fever symptoms in chimpanzees, which developed a milder and much shorter lasting disease syndrome (Edsall et al., 1960Edsall G. Gaines S. Landy M. Tigertt W.D. Sprinz H. Trapani R.J. Mandel A.D. Benenson A.S. Studies on infection and immunity in experimental typhoid fever. I. Typhoid fever in chimpanzees orally infected with Salmonella typhosa.J. Exp.

Pasteur (Paris). 1911; 25: 865-874Google Scholar). These observations indicate that in addition to pathogen restriction, there are other host factors that must prevent the development of typhoid fever even in the presence of significant bacterial replication. Host restriction is manifested at the cellular level because, in contrast to human macrophages, S. Typhi is unable to survive within macrophages of nonpermissive species (Schwan et al., 2000Schwan W.R. Huang X.Z. Hu L. Kopecko D.J.

Typhi within macrophages of nonpermissive species (Spanò and Galán, 2012Spanò S. Galán J.E. A Rab32-dependent pathway contributes to Salmonella typhi host restriction.Science. 2012; 338: 960-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, this antimicrobial function is effectively neutralized by broad-host Salmonella serovars, which are able to proteolytically target Rab32 with a type III secretion effector protein that is absent from S. Typhi (Spanò and Galán, 2012Spanò S. Galán J.E.

Unlike all known members of this family, which possess a single enzymatic A subunit associated to a pentameric B subunit (Beddoe et al., 2010Beddoe T. Paton A.W. Le Nours J. Rossjohn J. Paton J.C. Structure, biological functions and applications of the AB5 toxins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), typhoid toxin is composed of two covalently linked enzymatic subunits, the deoxyribonuclease CdtB and the ADP ribosyl transferase PltA, associated to the homopentameric B subunit PltB (Song et al., 2013Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus typhoid toxin may have evolved from the combination of two exotoxins, cytolethal distending and pertussis toxins, and is the only known example of a toxin with an A2B5 organization. Recent studies have shown that direct injection of typhoid toxin into experimental animals can reproduce many of the pathognomonic symptoms of typhoid fever, thus placing this toxin at the center of the pathogenesis of this devastating disease (Song et al., 2013Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To enter cells typhoid toxin must bind glycosylated surface glycoprotein receptors in target cells, such as podocalyxin 1 on epithelial cells and CD45 on myelocytic cells (Song et al., 2013Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The toxin recognizes specific sialylated glycan moieties on the receptor proteins through a glycan-binding domain in its PltB B subunit. Sialoglycans on human cells are unusual in that they are primarily terminated in N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) (Varki et al., 2011Varki N.M. Strobert E. Dick Jr., E.J. Benirschke K. Varki A. Biomedical differences between human and nonhuman hominids: potential roles for uniquely human aspects of sialic acid biology.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2011; 6: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to other old world primates and most other mammals studied to date, whose glycans can also terminate in N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). These differences in glycan composition are the result of the absence of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH) in humans, due to an Alu-mediated exon deletion in the CMAH gene, which occurred after the separation of the Hominin lineage from other Hominids (the so-called “great apes,” e.g., chimpanzees) (Chou et al., 2002Chou H.H. Hayakawa T. Diaz S. Krings M. Indriati E. Leakey M. Paabo S. Satta Y. Takahata N. Varki A. Inactivation of CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase occurred prior to brain expansion during human evolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 11736-11741Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Here, we report that typhoid toxin exhibits exquisite specificity for human-like Neu5Ac-terminated glycans. We find that typhoid toxin is cytotoxic to cells expressing Neu5Ac glycans on their surface but not to those expressing Neu5Gc. Furthermore, typhoid toxin binds strongly to human tissues but poorly to those from chimpanzees, which predominantly display Neu5Gc-terminated glycans and do not develop the typical symptoms of typhoid fever. We also show that mice engineered to display Neu5Gc glycans in all tissues are resistant to typhoid toxin. These findings provide major insight into the molecular bases for the host specificity of S. Typhi and may help the development of novel therapeutic approaches against typhoid fever. Given the remarkable human specificity exhibited by S. Typhi and the central role of typhoid toxin in the pathogenesis of typhoid fever, we used a customized glycan array (Padler-Karavani et al., 2014Padler-Karavani V. Hurtado-Ziola N. Chang Y.C. Sonnenburg J.L. Ronaghy A. Yu H. Verhagen A. Nizet V. Chen X. Varki N. et al.Rapid evolution of binding specificities and expression patterns of inhibitory CD33-related Siglecs in primates.FASEB J. 2014; 28: 1280-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) to compare the ability of fluorescently labeled typhoid toxin to bind pairs of sialylated glycans terminated in either Neu5Ac (predominantly expressed in human cells) or Neu5Gc (predominantly expressed in cells of most other mammals). Consistent with previous results (Song et al., 2013Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), typhoid toxin bound a diverse group of sialylated glycans with preferential binding to termini with the consensus sequence Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-3/β1-4Glc/GlcNAc (Figure 1; Table 1; Table S1 available online). Remarkably, however, we found that typhoid toxin did not bind to otherwise identical glycans terminated in Neu5Gc (i.e., differing by a single oxygen atom) (Figures 1 and S1; Table 1; Table S1). The marked difference in binding was observed across all the glycans tested and with different toxin concentrations (Table 1; Figure S1; Table S1). Consistent with previous observations (Song et al., 2013Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), typhoid toxin carrying a mutation in the glycan-binding site of its PltB B subunit (PltBS35A) did not show significant binding to any of the glycans tested regardless of their sialylation status (Table S1). To confirm typhoid toxin’s preference for Neu5Ac-terminated glycans, we compared its binding to human and chimpanzee red blood cells, which display markedly different levels of surface Neu5Ac or Neu5Gc-terminated glycans (Figure 2A). In keeping with the glycan array findings, typhoid toxin showed much stronger binding to human than to chimpanzee cells (Figure 2B). Furthermore, the differences were observed at different toxin concentrations (Figure 2B). Similar differences were observed with lymphocytes from humans and chimpanzees (Figures 2C and 2D). These results indicate that typhoid toxin exhibits strong binding preference for Neu5Ac-terminated glycans, which are predominant in human cells.Table 1Analysis of Fine Ligand Specificity of Native Typhoid Toxin by a Customized Sialoglycan MicroarrayGlycan StructureMean Relative Fluorescence Units (n = 4)Sia = Neu5AcSia = Neu5GcSiaα3Galβ3GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcβO(CH2)3NH234,44125Sia9Acα3Galβ3GlcNAcβO(CH2)3NH223,12073Siaα3Galβ3GlcNAcβO(CH2)3NH220,664156Siaα3Galβ3GalNAcαO(CH2)3NH217,10088Siaα8Siaα3Galβ4GlcβO(CH2)3NH215,821134Siaα3Galβ4GlcβO(CH2)3NH214,781108Sia9Acα3Galβ3GalNAcαO(CH2)3NH213,29942Siaα3Galβ3GalNAcβO(CH2)3NH212,564147Siaα3Galβ4GlcNAcβO(CH2)3NH210,468114Sia9Acα3Galβ4GlcNAcβO(CH2)3NH210,07630Siaα6Galβ4GlcβO(CH2)3NH29,60579Sia9Acα3Galβ3GalNAcβO(CH2)3NH28,99372Siaα3(Neu5Acα6)Galβ4GlcβO(CH2)3NH28,205246Sia9Acα3Galβ4GlcβO(CH2)3NH26,73076Sia9Acα6Galβ4GlcβO(CH2)3NH26,61956Sia9Acα3GalβO(CH2)3NH23,513152Siaα3GalβO(CH2)3NH23,040182Sia9Acα6Galβ4GlcNAcβO(CH2)3NH22,16089Siaα6GalβO(CH2)3NH22,078125Siaα6Galβ4GlcNAcβO(CH2)3NH21,979229Siaα3Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAcβO(CH2)3NH21,63351Siaα3Galβ4(Fucα3)GlcNAc6SβO(CH2)3NH282796Sia9Acα6GalβO(CH2)3NH2592133Siaα3Galβ4GlcNAc6SβO(CH2)3NH251180Siaα6GalNAcαO(CH2)3NH2470200Sia9Acα6GalNAcαO(CH2)3NH221749 Open table in a new tab Figure S1Binding of Typhoid Toxin to Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc and Neu5Gcα2-3Galβ1-4Glc, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Comparison of Neu5Acα2-3Galβ1-4Glc and Neu5Gcα2-3Galβ1-4Glc binding to typhoid toxin over a range of toxin concentrations.

Although human cells lack Neu5Gc, they can metabolically incorporate this sialic acid if supplied into the cell culture medium (Tangvoranuntakul et al., 2003Tangvoranuntakul P. Gagneux P. Diaz S. Bardor M. Varki N. Varki A. Muchmore E. Human uptake and incorporation of an immunogenic nonhuman dietary sialic acid.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 12045-12050Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). To investigate the biological significance of typhoid toxin glycan selectivity, we compared the binding of fluorescently labeled typhoid toxin to human Henle-407 epithelial cells that had been grown in media supplemented with Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac. Predictably, growth in the presence of Neu5Gc significantly altered the sialic acid composition in these cells resulting in up to 60% of the total sialic acid containing Neu5Gc (Figure 3A). In contrast, cells grown in standard media or supplemented with Neu5Ac had almost undetectable levels of Neu5Gc (Figure 3A). Consistent with its reduced binding affinity to Neu5Gc terminated glycans, typhoid toxin binding and toxicity was markedly reduced in cells grown in the presence of Neu5Gc (Figures 3B–3D and S2). In contrast, levels of toxin binding and cytotoxicity were slightly increased in cells grown in media supplemented with Neu5Ac in comparison to cells grown in standard media (Figures 3B–3D and S2). Equivalent results were observed in Jurkat T cells, which display a different glycoprotein receptor for typhoid toxin (Song et al., 2013Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) (Figures 3E–3H). These results indicate that the abundance of Neu5Gc on the surface glycans render cells less permissive for toxin binding and therefore resistant to typhoid toxin.Figure S2Metabolic Incorporation of Neu5Gc Renders Cultured Cells Resistant to Typhoid Toxin, Related to Figure 3Show full captionHenle-407 cells were grown in the presence of Neu5Gc or Neu5Ac (as indicated) and then treated with typhoid toxin.

Cell distention, an indication of typhoid toxin activity, was not observed when cells were grown in the presence of Neu5Gc. Scale bar: 50 μm. Although wild-type mice express a fully functional CMAH and can express Neu5Gc, most of their tissues contain a significant amount of Neu5Ac as well, presumably due to low expression of CMAH in some cells (Hedlund et al., 2007Hedlund M. Tangvoranuntakul P. Takematsu H. Long J.M. Housley G.D. Kozutsumi Y. Suzuki A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Ryan A.F.

Consistent with this observation, Cmah−/− mice (Hedlund et al., 2007Hedlund M. Tangvoranuntakul P. Takematsu H. Long J.M. Housley G.D. Kozutsumi Y. Suzuki A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Ryan A.F.

Biol. 2007; 27: 4340-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) did not exhibit significantly higher susceptibility to typhoid toxin, showing equivalent levels of weight loss, white blood cell depletion, and time to death compared to those observed in wild-type animals (Figures 4A–4D). In fact, these mice exhibited a slightly reduced susceptibility to the toxin, which is most likely due to the presence of high levels of Neu5Ac-containing glycoproteins in the sera of these animals, which may provide protection against toxicity by competing with toxin binding to tissue receptors (Beddoe et al., 2010Beddoe T. Paton A.W. Le Nours J. Rossjohn J. Paton J.C. Structure, biological functions and applications of the AB5 toxins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 411-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the susceptibility to typhoid toxin of mice engineered to constitutively overexpress CMAH in all tissues (Cmahtg) (Figures 4A–4D). We reasoned that the forced expression of CMAH would result in the predominant display of Neu5Gc on the surface of all cells and thus confer protection against intoxication. Consistent with this hypothesis, Cmahtg mice were completely resistant to systemic administration of toxin amounts much higher than those that would be lethal for wild-type mice (Figure 4D). Also consistent with these observations, the binding of fluorescently labeled typhoid toxin was undetectable in tissues from Cmahtg mice but was readily detectable in tissues from wild-type and Cmah−/− mice (Figure S3).Figure S3Typhoid Toxin Staining of Small Intestine, Spleen, and Liver Tissues from Control, Cmah−/−, and Cmahtg Mice, Related to Figure 4Show full captionFrozen sections of mouse tissues were stained with fluorescently labeled typhoid toxin (red) and Hoechst for nuclei counter staining (blue).

Sprinz H. Trapani R.J. Mandel A.D. Benenson A.S. Studies on infection and immunity in experimental typhoid fever. I. Typhoid fever in chimpanzees orally infected with Salmonella typhosa.J. Exp. Med. 1960; 112: 143-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Metchnikoff and Besredka, 1911Metchnikoff E. Besredka A. Recherches sur la fievre typhoide experimental.Ann. Inst. Pasteur (Paris). 1911; 25: 865-874Google Scholar). However, infected animals did not develop the typical symptomatology associated with typhoid fever, such as the presence of stupor and extreme lethargy, showing instead a course of disease that was mild and brief. We found that, contrary to human tissues, toxin binding to chimpanzee organ tissue sections was nondetectable (Figure 5). This is explained by the observation that chimpanzee cells predominantly display Neu5Gc-terminated glycans on their surface and are therefore not permissive for toxin binding. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the lack of pathognomonic typhoid fever symptomatology observed in chimpanzees experimentally infected with S. Typhi is due to the inability of typhoid toxin to gain access to target cells. To gain insight into the structural bases for typhoid toxin’s binding specificity, we determined the atomic structure at 1.92 Å resolution of PltB bound to GalNAcβ1-4(Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3)Galβ1-4Glc (Figures 6A and 6B ; Table S2), which previous studies have shown binds typhoid toxin with high affinity (Song et al., 2013Song J. Gao X. Galán J.E. Structure and function of the Salmonella Typhi chimaeric A(2)B(5) typhoid toxin.Nature. 2013; 499: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Clear electron density corresponding to the (Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3)Gal trisaccharide was unambiguously observed at the canonical glycan-binding sites in two of the five subunits of the PltB pentamer (Figures 6A–6C). Because the glycan-binding sites of every subunit are identical, absence of binding to some subunits is most likely due to their limited accessibility because of crystal packing. No specific contacts between the galactose moiety and PltB were observed in the structure (Figure S4). In contrast, the first of the two Neu5Ac moieties interacts through multiple direct hydrogen bonds and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Tyr33, Ser35, Lys59, Thr65, and Arg100 in PltB (Figure 6D). In addition, the first Neu5Ac sugar ring makes hydrophobic contacts with the aromatic rings of Tyr33 and Tyr34. The second Neu5Ac contacts PltB through direct and water-mediated hydrogen bonds with Ser35, Asp36, Lys59, Asn61, Ser63, Ala130, and Thr131 of the glycan-binding domain (Figure S4). Consistent with their importance in carbohydrate binding, mutations in Tyr33, Ser35, and Lys59 drastically disrupted typhoid toxin activity (Figures 6E and S5). Some toxin B subunits undergo conformational changes upon binding their glycan receptors (Sixma et al., 1992Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. van Zanten B.A. Berghuis A.M. Hol W.G. Lactose binding to heat-labile enterotoxin revealed by X-ray crystallography.Nature. 1992; 355: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we solved the atomic structure of the apo form of PltB at 2.08 Å resolution. Comparison of the atomic structures of the receptor-bound and apo forms of PltB indicates that binding to glycan receptors does not result in marked conformational changes in PltB (Figure S6).Figure S4Interactions between PltB and the (Neu5Acα2-8Neu5Acα2-3)-Gal Trisaccharide, Related to Figure 6Show full captionChain E of PltB is shown as a yellow colored ribbon cartoon, the amino acids interacting with the sugar are shown as sticks, and the direct interactions are shown in black dash.

However, the X chromosome has been neglected or incorrectly analyzed in most genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We present tailored analytical methods and software that facilitate X-wide association studies (XWAS), which we further applied to reanalyze data from 16 GWAS of different autoimmune and related diseases (AID). We associated several X-linked genes with disease risk, among which (1) ARHGEF6 is associated with Crohn's disease and replicated in a study of ulcerative colitis, another inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Indeed, ARHGEF6 interacts with a gastric bacterium that has been implicated in IBD. (2) CENPI is associated with three different AID, which is compelling in light of known associations with AID of autosomal genes encoding centromere proteins, as well as established autosomal evidence of pleiotropy between autoimmune diseases. (3) We replicated a previous association of FOXP3, a transcription factor that regulates T-cell development and function, with vitiligo; and (4) we discovered that C1GALT1C1 exhibits sex-specific effect on disease risk in both IBDs. These and other X-linked genes that we associated with AID tend to be highly expressed in tissues related to immune response, participate in major immune pathways, and display differential gene expression between males and females. Combined, the results demonstrate the importance of the X chromosome in autoimmunity, reveal the potential of extensive XWAS, even based on existing data, and provide the tools and incentive to properly include the X chromosome in future studies."

Together, these results uncover specific regulation of hematopoietic progenitors by estrogens and potential antileukemic properties of SERMs. In adult mammals, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) reside in a complex bone marrow (BM) microenvironment where they respond to multiple extracellular signals (Mercier et al., 2012Mercier F.E.

Data regarding effects of estrogens on more primitive hematopoietic cells are somewhat conflicting. E2 was initially reported to decrease lin− c-kit+ Sca-1+ (LSK) HSPCs in mouse BM (Thurmond et al., 2000Thurmond T.S. Murante F.G. Staples J.E. Silverstone A.E. Korach K.S. Gasiewicz T.A.

Estradiol increases hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells independent of its actions on bone.Haematologica. 2012; 97: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HSC division frequency is higher in female mice than in male mice, and it is further increased by exogenous E2 administration or pregnancy, although these effects did not change BM HSC numbers. In addition, estrogen signaling promotes extramedullary hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis in the spleen (Nakada et al., 2014Nakada D. Oguro H. Levi B.P. Ryan N. Kitano A. Saitoh Y. Takeichi M. Wendt G.R. Morrison S.J. Oestrogen increases haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal in females and during pregnancy.Nature. 2014; 505: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Aberrant estrogen signaling might contribute to leukemogenesis because mice deficient in ERβ develop chronic myeloproliferative disease during aging (Shim et al., 2003Shim G.J. Wang L. Andersson S. Nagy N. Kis L.L. Zhang Q. Mäkelä S. Warner M. Gustafsson J.A.

Moreover, women consistently exhibit lower incidence of hematological cancers compared to men (American Cancer Society, 2013American Cancer Society (2013).

However, whether estrogen signaling can directly control normal and leukemic HSPCs has remained unclear. Outside the hematopoietic system, ER activation stimulates the growth of solid tumors, most prominently in breast cancer (Adkins et al., 1999Adkins D. Brown R. Trinkaus K. Maziarz R. Luedke S.

Med. 2004; 10: 40-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the selective ER modulator (SERM) tamoxifen is clinically used to treat ER+ breast cancer and recurrent gliomas. In this study we found that estrogen signaling differentially regulates survival, proliferation, and self-renewal of normal and malignant HSPCs. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of this pathway with the SERM tamoxifen could be a valuable strategy for blocking the development of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). To determine whether HSPCs might be directly regulated by estrogens, ER expression was analyzed in purified hematopoietic cells. Esr1 (ERα) and Esr2 (ERβ) mRNA and proteins were differentially expressed by distinct HSPC populations. Intriguingly, Esr1 expression was very high in long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) and lower in committed progenitors and mature lineages. In contrast, Esr2 expression was very low or undetectable (Figures 1A–1C), in agreement with public gene expression data (Figure S1A available online). Esr1 expression was similar in HSPCs from male and female mice (data not shown). ERα-deficient (Esr1−/−) mice had reduced BM LT-HSCs and short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs), but similar levels of MPPs, megakaryocyte precursors (lin− c-kit+ Sca-1− CD41+), and CD41+ megakaryocytic cells (Figure 1D and data not shown). However, ERα or ERβ were not required for long-term multilineage reconstitution after BM transplantation, and Esr1−/− BM cells exhibited only a partial reduction in short-term engraftment (Figures 1E and 1F). This suggested differential roles of estrogen signaling in specific HSPC subsets. We administered tamoxifen to male mice to avoid the confounding effects of variably high endogenous estrogens in females. Surprisingly, treatment of WT mice with tamoxifen at a dose typically used to induce CreER recombinases caused a rapid reduction in BM cellularity (50%–60% of control as early as 1 week; Figure 1G). However, except for reduced platelet counts, most hematological parameters were normal in mice chronically treated with tamoxifen (Table S1 available online), suggesting mild effects on mature hematopoietic cells. Tamoxifen rapidly reduced levels of LSK cells (Figures 1H and S1B), preceding the decay in BM cell number. Interestingly, differential effects were observed in distinct HSPC populations. While MPPs were ∼7-fold reduced, the decrease in ST-HSCs and more mature myeloid progenitors was less pronounced and LT-HSC numbers were relatively preserved (Figures 1I–1J and S1B). Further subfractionation revealed that MPP4 and MPP3 (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L. Bockamp E. et al.Hematopoietic stem cells reversibly switch from dormancy to self-renewal during homeostasis and repair.Cell. 2008; 135: 1118-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar) were the most affected populations. In contrast, the number of LT-HSCs, defined as LSK CD150+ CD48− or LSK CD150+ CD48− CD34− CD135− cells, did not change after treatment (Figure S1C and data not shown). These effects were the result of specific changes in cell survival and proliferation. ST-HSC/MPP depletion by tamoxifen was caused by apoptosis, whereas LT-HSCs and myeloid progenitors were more resistant to apoptosis (Figure 1K; see also Figure 5D). In a manner similar to that in males, tamoxifen also decreased BM HSPCs by apoptosis in female mice (Figures S1D and S1E). A more pronounced apoptotic effect on LT-HSCs was observed in females, which might be related to their higher proliferation rate (Nakada et al., 2014Nakada D. Oguro H. Levi B.P. Ryan N. Kitano A. Saitoh Y. Takeichi M. Wendt G.R. Morrison S.J. Oestrogen increases haematopoietic stem-cell self-renewal in females and during pregnancy.Nature. 2014; 505: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Treatment of BM lin− cells in vitro with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) also induced apoptosis, suggesting a direct proapoptotic effect of tamoxifen on HSPCs (Figure S1F). While LT-HSCs were comparatively more resistant to tamoxifen-induced cell death, their proliferative fraction increased after 2 weeks of treatment (Figure 1L). These results indicate that survival and proliferation are differentially regulated by estrogens in distinct HSPC subsets. Gene expression profiling was performed by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) in LT-HSCs, ST-HSCs, and MPPs isolated from tamoxifen- or vehicle-treated mice. Principal component analysis showed a coherent clustering of biological replicates (Figure 2A), indicating that tamoxifen treatment did not cause a global deregulation of gene expression profiles. Instead, tamoxifen caused coordinated changes in the expression of genes associated with HSC self-renewal, cell cycle, signal transduction, and metabolism, as revealed by gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Krivtsov et al., 2006Krivtsov A.V.

Most differentially expressed gene sets were downregulated in LT-HSCs but upregulated in ST-HSCs and/or MPPs (Figures 2B and S2). Tamoxifen can function as an ER agonist/antagonist in a cell-type- and context-dependent manner. To characterize its ligand activity in HSPCs, we analyzed how tamoxifen affected the expression of genes positively or negatively regulated by the native ER agonist E2 in other tissues (Frasor et al., 2003Frasor J.

Globally, these genes exhibited similar changes in LT-HSCs upon tamoxifen treatment—E2-induced genes were upregulated and E2-repressed genes showed decreased expression—suggesting an ER agonist action of this SERM on LT-HSCs (Figure 2C). E2-induced genes were upregulated by tamoxifen in all three HSPC populations, but E2-repressed genes were specifically downregulated in LT-HSCs (Figure S2), which could be related to reduced levels of ER corepressors in ST-HSCs/MPPs compared to LT-HSCs (Figure S3A). These results suggest that tamoxifen has ER agonistic activity in HSPCs, where it activates or represses genes in a cell-type-specific manner. To confirm that these effects were mediated by canonical ER signaling, pharmacological studies were performed in mice lacking ERs. Tamoxifen reduced ST-HSC and MPP numbers by apoptosis in control and Esr2−/−, but not in Esr1−/−, mice. In addition, LT-HSC cycle entry caused by tamoxifen was mostly abolished in the absence of ERα (Figures 2D–2F). In order to clarify whether these effects were direct or mediated by the BM microenvironment, WT recipient mice were transplanted with WT or Esr1−/− BM cells, allowed to engraft for 4 months, and treated with tamoxifen or vehicle for 2 weeks. Tamoxifen-induced changes were not observed in mice with Esr1−/− hematopoiesis and thus were hematopoietic cell autonomous (Figures 2G and 2H). Given the reduction in platelet counts observed in treated mice, we analyzed the effect of tamoxifen on megakaryocytic precursors. This population was also depleted by apoptosis in an ERα-dependent, cell-autonomous fashion (Figures 2G and 2H). These data indicate that tamoxifen can directly regulate hematopoietic cell proliferation and survival through the activation of ERα expressed by HSPCs. LT-HSCs display a low proliferative rate (Morrison et al., 1995Morrison S.J. Uchida N. Weissman I.L. The biology of hematopoietic stem cells.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 35-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), which allows for their long-term self-renewal (Wilson et al., 2008Wilson A. Laurenti E. Oser G. van der Wath R.C. Blanco-Bose W. Jaworski M. Offner S. Dunant C.F. Eshkind L.

In parallel with their increased proliferation, a striking feature of LT-HSCs from tamoxifen-treated mice was the loss of gene expression patterns associated with self-renewal and HSC identity (Figures 3A and S2 and Table S2 and Table S3). GSEA revealed coordinated downregulation of the self-renewal-associated signature described for HSCs and leukemia stem cells, the HSC-specific “fingerprint,” and genes positively regulated by the polycomb ring-finger oncogene Bmi1; conversely, LT-HSCs from tamoxifen-treated mice showed increased expression of genes repressed in self-renewing cells and negatively regulated by Bmi1 (Arranz et al., 2012Arranz L.

Tamoxifen treatment also activated the transcriptional program of the ER target Myc (Zeller et al., 2006Zeller K.I. Zhao X. Lee C.W. Chiu K.P. Yao F. Yustein J.T. Ooi H.S. Orlov Y.L. Shahab A. Yong H.C. et al.Global mapping of c-Myc binding sites and target gene networks in human B cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17834-17839Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar), associated with HSC differentiation and loss of self-renewal (Wilson et al., 2004Wilson A. Murphy M.J. Oskarsson T. Kaloulis K. Bettess M.D. Oser G.M. Pasche A.C. Knabenhans C. Macdonald H.R. Trumpp A. c-Myc controls the balance between hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2747-2763Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Indeed, Myc and Myc-induced genes were upregulated in tamoxifen-treated HSCs, whereas the expression of Myc-repressed genes was mostly reduced (Figures 3B and 3C), coincident with the induction of cell cycle progression genes (Figure 3D). In addition, many of the genes upregulated by tamoxifen in HSPCs were Myc targets (Figure S3B). Expression of the chromatin remodeling factor Satb1, which represses Myc and is required for HSC quiescence and self-renewal (Will et al., 2013Will B. Vogler T.O. Bartholdy B. Garrett-Bakelman F. Mayer J. Barreyro L. Pandolfi A. Todorova T.I. Okoye-Okafor U.C. Stanley R.F. et al.Satb1 regulates the self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells by promoting quiescence and repressing differentiation commitment.Nat. Immunol. 2013; 14: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was significantly downregulated by tamoxifen in both LT- and ST-HSCs (Figure 3E). To determine whether HSPC changes elicited by tamoxifen required Myc function, conditional Myc-deficient mice (Pol2-creERT2;MycloxP/loxP) were treated with tamoxifen chronically or only transiently, to activate CreERT2. Myc-deficient MPPs did not undergo cell death upon chronic tamoxifen treatment (Figure 3F), suggesting that Myc mediates, at least partially, tamoxifen’s effects on HSPCs. In addition, tamoxifen reduced the expression of the stem cell factor receptor Kit specifically in LT-HSCs; c-kit protein levels were also reduced by tamoxifen in the cell surface of WT or Esr2-deficient LT-HSCs, but not in Esr1-deficient LT-HSCs (Figures 3G and 3H), indicating that this effect was also mediated by ERα. Consistent with our initial findings, ST-HSCs (but not LT-HSCs) from tamoxifen-treated mice showed increased expression of proapoptotic genes (Aifm1 and Casp3) and reduced levels of antiapoptotic genes (Cflar) (Figure S4A). These changes were not observed in MPPs, probably due to their earlier apoptosis and depletion (Figure S1B) or the selection of estrogen-resistant subpopulations (MPP1 and MPP2; Figure S1C). Thus, tamoxifen impairs the self-renewal program of LT-HSCs and induces apoptosis of more differentiated progenitors, at least partially via ERα-mediated induction of Myc. To determine whether tamoxifen-induced changes in LT-HSC proliferation and self-renewal might have functional consequences, we studied the hematopoietic recovery of mice treated with tamoxifen or vehicle and subsequently subjected to myelotoxic regimens. Tamoxifen-treated mice exhibited defective multilineage hematopoietic recovery after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) challenge (Figure 3I) and premature death upon sublethal irradiation (Figure S4B). To study the reversibility of these effects, LT-HSCs from tamoxifen-treated mice were transplanted into tamoxifen-free recipients. These cells exhibited unaltered capacity for long-term multilineage reconstitution in a normal environment, demonstrating that the effects of tamoxifen can revert in the absence of the ligand (Figure S4C). In order to investigate whether the detrimental effect of tamoxifen on HSC function was also dependent on ERα, we studied the hematopoietic recovery of tamoxifen/vehicle-treated Esr1−/− mice after 5-FU administration. Unlike WT mice, tamoxifen-treated Esr1−/− mice exhibited normal reconstitution kinetics. Thus, tamoxifen’s effects on HSC function are also mediated by ERα (Figure 3I). The differential effects of ER activation in HSPCs suggested a potential use of SERMs to treat hematological malignancies through a dual action: impairment of leukemia-initiating cells and reduction of leukemic burden through apoptosis of leukemic progenitors. Therefore we tested the potential therapeutic effect of tamoxifen in a mouse model expressing a point mutation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2V617F) in HSCs, frequently found in patients with MPNs (Baxter et al., 2005Baxter E.J.

Notably, tamoxifen treatment completely abolished MPN-associated neutrophilia and thrombocytosis, with no major side effects in control mice (Figure 4A). Tamoxifen treatment also alleviated the early increase in red cell counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit; decreased BM megakaryocytes; and reduced MPN-associated splenomegaly, with preservation of spleen architecture and decreased infiltration of interfollicular areas by megakaryocytes (Figures 4A–4C and S5B–S5F). Prolonged tamoxifen treatment prevented the characteristic fibrosis and osteosclerosis of the BM associated with advanced disease (Figure 4D). Although—as expected from its bone anabolic effects—tamoxifen increased cortical bone thickness in both WT (data not shown) and JAK2V617F+ mice (Figure 4D), tamoxifen prevented excessive bone formation inside the BM.

Along with the sensory neurons, the TRPM8 protein is highly expressed in the prostate epithelial cells, and this expression is regulated by androgens. Here we investigated the expression and intracellular localization of the TRPM8 channel in relationship to androgens. We performed experiments using human prostate tissues obtained from healthy individuals and patients with prostate cancer at various stages of the disease as well as in cultured cells. Using an immunohistochemistry approach, we detected an intensive colocalization pattern of the TRPM8 protein with endogenous androgens in all tissues tested, suggesting possible interactions. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments performed using cultured prostate epithelial cells, prostate cancer cells, and HEK-293 cells stably expressing TRPM8 further confirmed direct binding of the steroid hormone, testosterone, to the TRPM8 protein. Applications of picomolar concentrations of testosterone to the primary human prostate cells, endogenously expressing TRPM8, elicited Ca(2+) responses and channel currents, and those were inhibited in the presence of TRPM8 antagonist, N-(2-aminoethyl)-N-(4-(benzyloxy)-3-methoxybenzyl)thiophene-2-carboxamide hydrochloride. These results indicate that the TRPM8 channel is physically associated with testosterone and suggest that, in addition to a genomic role, testosterone plays a role in direct regulation of the TRPM8 channel function."
https://openalex.org/W2042727692,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive and lethal blood cancer maintained by rare populations of leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Selective targeting of LSCs is a promising approach for treating AML and preventing relapse following chemotherapy, and developing such therapeutic modalities is a key priority. Here, we show that targeting telomerase activity eradicates AML LSCs. Genetic deletion of the telomerase subunit Terc in a retroviral mouse AML model induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of LSCs, and depletion of telomerase-deficient LSCs is partially rescued by p53 knockdown. Murine Terc−/− LSCs express a specific gene expression signature that can be identified in human AML patient cohorts and is positively correlated with patient survival following chemotherapy. In xenografts of primary human AML, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of telomerase targets LSCs, impairs leukemia progression, and delays relapse following chemotherapy. Altogether, these results establish telomerase inhibition as an effective strategy for eliminating AML LSCs."

Regulation of let-7 biogenesis involves direct interaction of LIN28A with the terminal loop region of let-7; this requires both the cold shock domain and a cluster of two CCHC-type zinc finger domains of LIN28A (Nam et al., 2011Nam Y.

In the cytoplasm, the LIN28A protein directly interacts with pre-let-7 and recruits the terminal uridylyltransferase TUT4/7 (Zcchc11/6) to induce oligouridylation of pre-let-7, which subsequently becomes targeted for degradation by the exoribonuclease DIS3L2. This mechanism effectively blocks pre-let-7 processing by Dicer and facilitates its rapid decay (Chang et al., 2013Chang H.-M. Triboulet R. Thornton J.E. Gregory R.I.

LIN28B is tagged by both a nuclear localization signal and a nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) and is abundant in the nucleolus (Piskounova et al., 2011Piskounova E. Polytarchou C. Thornton J.E.

Consistently, LIN28B is believed to sequester pri-let-7 and block its processing by primarily acting in the nucleus. However, LIN28A/B are not coexpressed in mammalian cells with ubiquitous TUT4 expression, suggesting that LIN28A and LIN28B in the cytoplasm both use TUT4/7-dependent mechanisms for let-7 degradation (Heo et al., 2012Heo I.

Although many studies have examined the mechanism through which LIN28A regulates the let-7 miRNA in the cytoplasmic compartment, our understanding of how LIN28A functions in the nucleus is more limited. Notably, LIN28A is tagged by a region that is highly homologous with the NoLS of LIN28B. Core pluripotency factors (e.g., OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and/or LIN28A) tightly modulate the states of ESCs transcriptionally and/or posttranslationally (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F.

Although it is well known that the expression of these factors is coordinately modulated at the transcription level (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S.

Whether PTMs of LIN28 proteins can affect function in human ESCs (hESCs) remains unknown. SET7/9 (SETD7) was originally identified as a protein methyltransferase that catalyzes monomethylation of histone 3 (Nishioka et al., 2002Nishioka K. Chuikov S. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Consensus target residue analysis identified a structurally conserved consensus recognition sequence in its substrates (K/R-S/T-K, with K being the target lysine residue) (Couture et al., 2006Couture J.-F. Collazo E. Hauk G. Trievel R.C. Structural basis for the methylation site specificity of SET7/9.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and the authors proposed other putative target substrates among the nonhistone protein pool in mammalian cells. Recently, SOX2 was identified as a SET7/9 substrate in mouse ESCs, targeting methylated SOX2 for degradation (Fang et al., 2014Fang L. Zhang L. Wei W. Jin X. Wang P. Tong Y. Li J. Du J.X. Wong J. A Methylation-phosphorylation switch determines Sox2 stability and function in ESC maintenance or differentiation.Mol Cell. 2014; 55: 537-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but little is known about its function in hESCs. Similar to the high expression of LIN28A in skeletal muscle (Polesskaya et al., 2007Polesskaya A. Cuvellier S. Naguibneva I. Duquet A. Moss E.G. Harel-Bellan A. Lin-28 binds IGF-2 mRNA and participates in skeletal myogenesis by increasing translation efficiency.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1125-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), the expression of SET7/9 is gradually increased during skeletal muscle (Tao et al., 2011Tao Y. Neppl R.L. Huang Z.-P. Chen J. Tang R.-H. Cao R. Zhang Y. Jin S.-W. Wang D.-Z. The histone methyltransferase Set7/9 promotes myoblast differentiation and myofibril assembly.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 194: 551-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) as well as embryoid body differentiation (Fang et al., 2014Fang L. Zhang L. Wei W. Jin X. Wang P. Tong Y. Li J. Du J.X. Wong J. A Methylation-phosphorylation switch determines Sox2 stability and function in ESC maintenance or differentiation.Mol Cell. 2014; 55: 537-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Here, we have examined the methylation of pluripotency factors and found that SET7/9 specifically monomethylates LIN28A at lysine 135, which is in a region that is homologous with the NoLS of LIN28B. Our results further suggest that SET7/9-mediated methylation of LIN28A increases LIN28A protein stability and localization to the nucleus. Furthermore, we find that LIN28A methylation stimulates multimerization of LIN28A with let-7 miRNA. In hESCs, the methylated LIN28A inhibits processing of the let-7 miRNA by sequestering its transcripts to the nucleoli in a TUTase-independent manner, thereby regulating pluripotency and differentiation. Preliminary in vitro methylation analysis using SET7/9 and the recombinant pluripotency factors showed that the SET7/9 protein was capable of methylating LIN28A (Figure S1A available online). Consistent with a recent report (Fang et al., 2014Fang L. Zhang L. Wei W. Jin X. Wang P. Tong Y. Li J. Du J.X. Wong J. A Methylation-phosphorylation switch determines Sox2 stability and function in ESC maintenance or differentiation.Mol Cell. 2014; 55: 537-551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), SOX2 was also methylated by SET7/9, while OCT4 and NANOG were not methylated under the same conditions. To investigate whether LIN28A is potentially regulated by lysine methylation, we tested in vitro methylation analysis using a variety of histone methyltransferases (HMTases). SET7/9 specifically methylated LIN28A (Figure S1B). To verify this finding, LIN28A was used to perform in vitro pull-down assays with HMTases (Figures S1C–S1E). Although several of the tested HMTases bound to the LIN28A protein, SET7/9 clearly showed the strongest enzymatic activity. Thus, we speculated that LIN28A may be functionally modified by lysine methylation. To confirm the binding between LIN28A and SET7/9, we estimated their physical interaction using an immunoprecipitation assay in cultured cells. Endogenous or overexpressed LIN28A was immunoprecipitated from H9, NCCIT, and 293T cells, and subsequent immunoblotting with the relevant antibodies revealed that SET7/9 was immunoprecipitated with LIN28A in all three cell lines (Figures 1A, S1F, and S1G). LIN28A did not immunoprecipitate with the negative control immunoglobulin G (IgG). Reverse immunoprecipitation of SET7/9 confirmed the identified interaction with LIN28A (Figure 1B). We next sought to identify the SET7/9-methylated residue(s) in LIN28A. We compared the amino acid sequence of LIN28A with the sequences surrounding the SET7/9 methylation sites of target substrates (Figure 1C). We found that the conserved lysine residue at position 135 and its neighboring residues of LIN28A showed strong similarities to the consensus SET7/9 recognition sequence (Couture et al., 2006Couture J.-F. Collazo E. Hauk G. Trievel R.C. Structural basis for the methylation site specificity of SET7/9.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, LIN28B does not contain the SET7/9 recognition sequence. When we aligned the full amino acid sequences of LIN28 proteins of various species, we found that the identified SET7/9 recognition sequence was evolutionarily conserved among the higher eukaryotes (Figure S2A). To facilitate studies on the SET7/9-mediated monomethylation of LIN28A at lysine 135 in cells, we generated polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognized unmethylated LIN28A-K135 or monomethylated LIN28A-K135. Next, we transfected 293T cells with a construct encoding FLAG-tagged LIN28A wild-type or FLAG-LIN28A-K135R mutant (K135R; in which lysine 135 was replaced with arginine). Immunoblot analysis using the anti-LIN28A-K135-me1 (methylated) antibody revealed the presence of methylated LIN28A in extracts prepared from cells overexpressing LIN28A but not K135R (Figure 1D). We therefore conclude that LIN28A is methylated at lysine 135 in cells. To determine whether the interaction between LIN28A and SET7/9 in cells is direct, we generated a series of MAL, 6xHIS, and GST fusion proteins containing various truncated versions of LIN28A and SET7/9 (Figures S1D and S1E), and used them to perform pull-down assays. Our results revealed that the carboxyl terminus (amino acids 125–209) of LIN28A interacted with SET7/9 (Figures S1H and S2C). Both LIN28A and the K135R bound to SET7/9 in this assay (Figure 1E). These results suggest that the LIN28A and SET7/9 proteins interact directly. We next examined whether SET7/9 could methylate LIN28A in vitro. When recombinant full-length LIN28A was incubated with recombinant SET7/9 in the presence of 3H-S-adenosine-methionine ([3H] SAM), we found that LIN28A was methylated (Figure 1F, lane 2). LIN28A was not methylated in the absence of the SET7/9 protein (Figure 1F, lane 3), indicating that LIN28A is indeed methylated by SET7/9 in vitro. As a positive control, recombinant human core histone (rC/H) was also shown to be methylated by SET7/9 under the same conditions, validating our in vitro methyltransferase assay (Figure 1F, lanes 4 and 5, and Figure S2F). Given that full-length LIN28A is methylated in cultured cells and in vitro by SET7/9, we next sought to confirm that K135 of LIN28A is a bona fide SET7/9 target. We purified 6xHIS-tagged proteins containing four different fragments of LIN28A and used them as substrates for an in vitro methyltransferase assay. Of the four tested fragments, LIN28A (125–209) and (125–156), which included K135, were methylated by SET7/9 (Figure 1G, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, LIN28A (1–124) and (157–209), which did not include K135, showed no evidence of methylation (Figure 1G, lanes 2 and 8). Because there are numerous lysine residues surrounding K135, we confirmed this result by running parallel experiments in which we substituted eleven lysines with nonmethylatable arginines. A single-point mutation at K135R, but not the other tested lysines, completely eliminated SET7/9-mediated methylation (Figure 1H, lane 19), providing additional evidence that SET7/9 methylates LIN28A at K135. Because LIN28B does not have the SET7/9 target residue (Figure 1C), we performed in vitro methyltransferase assays using LIN28B to investigate the specificity of the SET7/9-induced methylation of LIN28A at K135. As expected, LIN28B was not methylated by SET7/9 (Figure S2D). In the context of a negative control, DOT1L (a H3K79 methyltransferase) was purified from a baculovirus expression system (Kim et al., 2012Kim S.-K. Jung I. Lee H. Kang K. Kim M. Jeong K. Kwon C.S. Han Y.-M. Kim Y.S. Kim D. Lee D. Human histone H3K79 methyltransferase DOT1L protein [corrected] binds actively transcribing RNA polymerase II to regulate gene expression.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 39698-39709Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and used in our methyltransferase assay. It failed to methylate LIN28A (Figure S2E). Collectively, these results indicate that the SET7/9-mediated methylation of LIN28A at K135 is specific. SET7/9-mediated lysine methylation is known to regulate the stability of various K/R-S/T-K-containing targets. Therefore, we examined whether methylation by SET7/9 affects the stability of LIN28A in cells. Coexpression of SET7/9 in 293T cells upregulated the expression of LIN28A but not K135R (Figure 2A), suggesting that the SET7/9-mediated methylation of LIN28A may increase its stability. Further supporting this notion, the coexpression of SET7/9 did not alter the mRNA levels of LIN28A (Figure 2B). To assess whether this apparent stabilization was associated with the methylation of LIN28A at K135, we investigated the effect of SET7/9 on the half-life of LIN28A and K135R using cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor. We found that the SET7/9-mediated methylation of LIN28A promoted its stabilization and increased its half-life, whereas the half-life of K135R was reduced (Figure 2C). Furthermore, depletion of SET7/9 in H9 and NCCIT cells by transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) also affected stabilization of LIN28A (Figures 2D and 2E). Together, these data show that the SET7/9-mediated methylation of LIN28A at K135 increases the stability of LIN28A. Notably, K135 and its neighboring sequences in LIN28A are homologous with the NoLS of LIN28B (Figures S1H and S3A) (Piskounova et al., 2011Piskounova E. Polytarchou C. Thornton J.E. LaPierre R.J. Pothoulakis C. Hagan J.P. Iliopoulos D. Gregory R.I.

In order to determine whether methylated LIN28A preferentially localizes to either cellular compartment, we prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from either 293T cells (which do not endogenously express LIN28A), by exogenously expressing LIN28A or LIN28A-K135R or from H9 or NCCIT cells (which endogenously express LIN28A). These fractions were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies (Figures 3A and 3B ; Figure S3B). Consistent with the published data, we found that LIN28A (the cytoplasmic form) was abundant in the cytoplasm of all tested cells. A smaller portion localized to the nucleus, largely the methylated form (the nuclear form) (Figure 3A, lane 5, and Figure 3B, lanes 1 and 2). Intr"

Here, we developed a new Sendai virus vector, TS12KOS, which has improved efficiency, does not integrate into the cellular DNA, and can be easily eliminated. TS12KOS carries KLF4, OCT3/4, and SOX2 in a single vector and can easily generate iPSCs from human blood cells. Using TS12KOS, we established iPSC lines from chimpanzee blood, and used DNA array analysis to show that the global gene-expression pattern of chimpanzee iPSCs is similar to those of human embryonic stem cell and iPSC lines. These results demonstrated that our new vector is useful for generating iPSCs from the blood cells of both human and chimpanzee. In addition, the chimpanzee iPSCs are expected to facilitate unique studies into human physiology and disease."
https://openalex.org/W1970627754,"Background Since image based diagnostic tools fail to detect early metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) it is crucial to develop minimal invasive diagnostic methods. A promising approach is to identify and characterize circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the peripheral blood of HNSCC patients. In this pilot study, we assessed which non-hematopoietic cell types are identifiable and whether their numbers differ in pre- and postoperative blood samples. Methods 20 ml citrated peripheral blood was taken from 10 HNSCC patients before and after curative resection. CTC were enriched using density gradient centrifugation. CTC presence was verified by multi-immunofluorescence staining against cytokeratin (CK; epithelial), N-cadherin (mesenchymal); CD133 (stem-cell), CD45 (hematopoietic) and DAPI (nucleus). Individual cell type profiles were analyzed. Results We were able to detect cells with epithelial properties like CK+/N-cadherin−/CD45− and CK+/CD133−/CD45− as well as cells with mesenchymal features such as N-cadherin+/CK−/CD45− and cells with both characteristics like N-cadherin+/CK+/CD45−. We also observed cells showing stem cell-like features like CD133+/CK−/CD45− and cells with both epithelial and stem cell-like features such as CD133+/CK+/CD45−. The number of CK positive cells (p = 0.002), N-cadherin positive cells (p = 0.002) and CD133 positive cells (p = 0.01) decreased significantly after resection. Kaplan-Meier test showed that the survival was significantly shorter when N-cadherin+ cells were present after resection (p = 0.04; 474 vs. 235 days; [HR] = 3.1). Conclusions This is - to the best of our knowledge- the first pilot study identifying different CTC populations in peripheral blood of HNSCC patients and showing that these individual cell type profiles may have distinct clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2002870762,"Previous neuroimaging studies demonstrated sex and also sexual orientation related structural and functional differences in the human brain. Genetic information and effects of sex hormones are assumed to contribute to the male/female differentiation of the brain, and similar effects could play a role in processes influencing human's sexual orientation. However, questions about the origin and development of a person's sexual orientation remain unanswered, and research on sexual orientation related neurobiological characteristics is still very limited. To contribute to a better understanding of the neurobiology of sexual orientation, we used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to compare regional cortical thickness (Cth) and subcortical volumes of homosexual men (hoM), heterosexual men (heM) and heterosexual women (heW). hoM (and heW) had thinner cortices primarily in visual areas and smaller thalamus volumes than heM, in which hoM and heW did not differ. Our results support previous studies, which suggest cerebral differences between hoM and heM in regions, where sex differences have been reported, which are frequently proposed to underlie biological mechanisms. Thus, our results contribute to a better understanding of the neurobiology of sexual orientation."
https://openalex.org/W2056818592,"Primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS DLBCL) is a rare, aggressive subtype of DLBCL, the biology of which is poorly understood. Recent studies have suggested a prognostic role of MYC protein expression in systemic DLBCL, but little is known about the frequency and significance of MYC protein expression in CNS DLBCL. Hence, we investigated MYC protein expression profiles of CNS DLBCL and assessed the relationship between MYC expression and a variety of histopathologic, immunophenotypic, genetic, and clinical features. Fifty-nine CNS DLBCL diagnosed at our institution over the past 13 years were evaluated. The majority of cases (80%) showed centroblastic morphology, and 12 (20%) displayed a perivascular pattern of infiltration. According to the Hans criteria, 41 (69%) cases had a non-germinal center B-cell and 18 (31%) had a germinal center B-cell cell-of-origin (COO) phenotype. Mean MYC protein expression was 50% (median: 50%, range: 10-80%). Forty-three cases (73%) showed MYC overexpression (≥40%), and 35 (60%) showed MYC/BCL2 coexpression. MYC overexpression was seen in the single case harboring MYC translocation and in the cases showing increased copies of MYC (27%); however, no significant difference in mean MYC expression was seen between groups harboring or lacking MYC aberrations. In our series, age was associated with a significantly increased risk of death, and the perivascular pattern of infiltration was associated with a significantly increased risk of disease progression. Neither MYC expression (with or without BCL2 coexpression) nor other variables, including COO subtype were predictive of clinical outcome. Our findings indicate that the proportion of CNS DLBCL overexpressing MYC is higher compared to systemic DLBCL, and MYC overexpression appears to be independent of genetic MYC abnormalities. Thus, MYC expression and other immunophenotypic markers used for prognostication of systemic DLBCL might not apply to CNS DLBCL due to differences in disease biology."

In 2005, 472 multifamily buildings (10,506 dwellings) were invited (one subject/dwelling) and 7,554 participated (73%). Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, adjusting for gender, age, smoking, country of birth, income and years in the dwelling. In total, 11% had doctor's diagnosed asthma, 22% doctor's diagnosed allergy, 23% pollen allergy and 23% eczema. Doctor's diagnosed asthma was more common in dwellings with humid air (OR = 1.74) and mould odour (OR = 1.79). Doctor's diagnosed allergy was more common in buildings with supply exhaust air ventilation as compared to exhaust air only (OR = 1.45) and was associated with redecoration (OR = 1.48) and mould odour (OR = 2.35). Pollen allergy was less common in buildings using more energy for heating (OR = 0.75) and was associated with humid air (OR = 1.76) and mould odour (OR = 2.36). Eczema was more common in larger buildings (OR 1.07) and less common in buildings using more energy for heating (OR = 0.85) and was associated with water damage (OR = 1.47), humid air (OR = 1.73) and mould odour (OR = 2.01). Doctor's diagnosed allergy was less common in buildings with management accessibility both in the neighbourhood and in larger administrative divisions, as compared to management in the neighbourhood only (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.82). Pollen allergy was less common if the building maintenance was outsourced (OR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.51-0.88). Eczema was more common when management accessibility was only at the division level (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.06-2.11). In conclusions, asthma, allergy or eczema were more common in buildings using less energy for heating, in larger buildings and in dwellings with redecorations, mould odour, dampness and humid air. There is a need to reduce indoor chemical emissions and to control dampness. Energy saving may have consequences for allergy and eczema. More epidemiological studies are needed on building management organization."
https://openalex.org/W2139438301,"Effective therapy to prevent organ fibrosis, which is associated with more than half of all mortalities, remains elusive. Involvement of tumor suppressor ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) in the TGF-β1 pathway related to renal fibrosis is largely unknown. ATM activation (pATMSer1981) increased 4-fold in the tubulointerstitial region of the unilateral ureteral obstruction-injured kidney in mice correlating with SMAD3 and p53Ser15 phosphorylation and elevated levels of p22phox subunit of the NADPH oxidases (NOXs), and fibrotic markers, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and fibronectin, when compared to contralateral (contra) or sham controls. In fact, ATM is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser1981 by TGF-b1 stimulation. Stable silencing and pharmacologic inhibition of ATM ablated TGF-β1-induced p53 activation (>95%) and subsequent PAI-1, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and p21 expression in human kidney 2 (HK-2) tubular epithelial cells and normal rat kidney-49 fibroblasts (NRK-49F). ATM or p53 depletion in HK-2 cells, moreover, bypassed TGF-β1-mediated cytostasis evident in control short hairpin RNA-expressing HK-2 cells. Interestingly, stable silencing of NOX subunits, p22phox and p47phox, in HK-2 cells blocked TGF-β1-induced pATMSer1981 (>90%) and target gene induction via p53-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, NRK-49F fibroblast proliferation triggered by conditioned media from TGF-β1-stimulated, control vector-transfected HK-2 cells decreased (~50%) when exposed to conditioned media from ATM-deficient, TGF-β1-treated HK-2 cells. Thus, TGF-β1 promotes NOX-dependent ATM activation leading to p53-mediated fibrotic gene reprogramming and growth arrest in HK-2 cells. Furthermore, TGF-β1/ATM-initiated paracrine factor secretion by dysfunctional renal epithelium promotes interstitial fibroblast growth, suggesting a role of tubular ATM in mediating epithelial-mesenchymal cross-talk highlighting the translational benefit of targeting the NOX/ATM/p53 axis in renal fibrosis.—Overstreet, J.

https://openalex.org/W2021729079,"Aims This study investigated the trends and levels of the prevalence of health factors, and the association of all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality with healthy levels of combined risk factors among Lithuanian urban population. Methods Data from five general population surveys in Kaunas, Lithuania, conducted between 1983 and 2008 were used. Healthy factors measured at baseline include non-smoking, normal weight, normal arterial blood pressure, normal level of total serum cholesterol, normal physical activity and normal level of fasting glucose. Among 9,209 men and women aged 45–64 (7,648 were free from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke at baseline), 1,219 death cases from any cause, 589 deaths from CVD, and 342 deaths from CHD occurred during follow up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between health factors and mortality from all causes, CVD and CHD. Results Between 1983 and 2008, the proportion of subjects with 6 healthy levels of risk factors was higher in 2006–2008 than in 1983–1984 (0.6% vs. 0.2%; p = 0.09), although there was a significant increase in fasting glucose and a decline in intermediate physical activity. Men and women with normal or intermediate levels of risk factors had significantly lower all-cause, CVD and CHD mortality risk than persons with high levels of risk factors. Subjects with 5–6 healthy factors had hazard ratio (HR) of CVD mortality 0.35 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15–0.83) compared to average risk in the whole population. The hazard ratio for CVD mortality risk was significant in men (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12–0.97) but not in women (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.09–1.67). Conclusions An inverse association of most healthy levels of cardiovascular risk factors with risk of all-cause and CVD mortality was observed in this urban population-based cohort. A greater number of cardiovascular health factors were related with significantly lower risk of CVD mortality, particularly among men."
https://openalex.org/W1997095998,"Hypertonic saline (HTS) has been used intravenously to reduce organ dysfunction following injury and as an inhaled therapy for cystic fibrosis lung disease. The role and mechanism of HTS inhibition was explored in the TNFα and IL-1β stimulation of pulmonary epithelial cells. Hyperosmolar (HOsm) media (400 mOsm) inhibited the production of select cytokines stimulated by TNFα and IL-1β at the level of mRNA translation, synthesis and release. In TNFα stimulated A549 cells, HOsm media inhibited I-κBα phosphorylation, NF-κB translocation into the nucleus and NF-κB nuclear binding. In IL-1β stimulated cells HOsm inhibited I-κBα phosphorylation without affecting NF-κB translocation or nuclear binding. Incubation in HOsm conditions inhibited both TNFα and IL-1β stimulated nuclear localization of interferon response factor 1 (IRF-1). Additional transcription factors such as AP-1, Erk-1/2, JNK and STAT-1 were unaffected by HOsm. HTS and sorbitol supplemented media produced comparable outcomes in all experiments, indicating that the effects of HTS were mediated by osmolarity, not by sodium. While not affecting MAPK modules discernibly in A549 cells, both HOsm conditions inhibit IRF-1 against TNFα or IL-1β, but inhibit p65 NF-kB translocation only against TNFα but not IL-1β. Thus, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of HTS/HOsm appear to disrupt cytokine signals at distinct intracellular steps."
https://openalex.org/W1971343439,"The mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of clinical malaria remain largely unknown. We hypothesized that differential gene expression contributes to phenotypic variation of parasites which results in a specific interaction with the host, leading to different clinical features of malaria. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of isolates obtained from asymptomatic carriers and patients with uncomplicated or cerebral malaria. We also investigated the transcriptomes of 3D7 clone and 3D7-Lib that expresses severe malaria associated-variant surface antigen. Our findings revealed a specific up-regulation of genes involved in pathogenesis, adhesion to host cell, and erythrocyte aggregation in parasites from patients with cerebral malaria and 3D7-Lib, compared to parasites from asymptomatic carriers and 3D7, respectively. However, we did not find any significant difference between the transcriptomes of parasites from cerebral malaria and uncomplicated malaria, suggesting similar transcriptomic pattern in these two parasite populations. The difference between isolates from asymptomatic children and cerebral malaria concerned genes coding for exported proteins, Maurer's cleft proteins, transcriptional factor proteins, proteins implicated in protein transport, as well as Plasmodium conserved and hypothetical proteins. Interestingly, UPs A1, A2, A3 and UPs B1 of var genes were predominantly found in cerebral malaria-associated isolates and those containing architectural domains of DC4, DC5, DC13 and their neighboring rif genes in 3D7-lib. Therefore, more investigations are needed to analyze the effective role of these genes during malaria infection to provide with new knowledge on malaria pathology. In addition, concomitant regulation of genes within the chromosomal neighborhood suggests a common mechanism of gene regulation in P. falciparum."
https://openalex.org/W2060237560,"Ascamycin (ACM) and dealanylascamycin (DACM) are nucleoside antibiotics elaborated by Streptomyces sp. JCM9888. The later shows broad spectrum inhibition activity to various gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, eukaryotic Trypanosoma and is also toxic to mice, while ascamycin is active against very limited microorganisms, such as Xanthomonas. Both compounds share an unusual 5′-O-sulfonamide moiety which is attached to an adenosine nucleoside. In this paper, we first report on the 30 kb gene cluster (23 genes, acmA to acmW) involved in the biosynthesis of these two antibiotics and a biosynthetic assembly line was proposed. Of them, six genes (AcmABGKIW) are hypothetical genes involved in 5′-O-sulfonamide formation. Two flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent chlorinase genes acmX and acmY were characterized which are significantly remote from acmA-W and postulated to be required for adenine C2-halogenation. Notably gene disruption of acmE resulted in a mutant which could only produce dealanylascamycin but was blocked in its ability to biosynthesize ascamycin, revealing its key role of conversion of dealanylascamycin to ascamycin."
https://openalex.org/W2013047252,"Sperm chromatin in mammals is packaged in different blocks associated to protamines (PDNA), histones (HDNA), or nuclear matrix proteins. Differential packaging has been related to early or late transcription and also to differential susceptibility to genotoxic damage. Genes located in the more accessible HDNA could be more susceptible to injuries than those located in PDNA, being potential biomarkers of paternal DNA damage. Fish sperm chromatin organization is much diversified, some species lacking protamines and some others totally depleted of histones. Analyzing genotoxic damage in a species homogeneously compacted with some sperm nuclear basic protein type, could help in deciphering the clues of differential susceptibility to damage. In the present study we analyzed in rainbow trout the differential susceptibility of nine genes to UV irradiation and H2O2 treatment. The absence of histones in the sperm nuclei was confirmed by Western blot. The chromatin fractionation in sensitive and resistant regions to PvuII (presumably HDNA-like and PDNA-like, respectively) revealed that the nine genes locate in the same resistant region. The number of lesions promoted was quantified using a qPCR approach. Location of 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was analyzed by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy. UV irradiation promoted similar number of lesions in all the analyzed genes and a homogenous distribution of 8-OHdG within the nuclei. 8-OHdG was located in the peripheral area of the nucleus after H2O2 treatment, which promoted a significantly higher number of lesions in developmental-related genes (8.76–10.95 lesions/10 kb) than in rDNA genes (1.05–1.67 lesions/10 kb). We showed for the first time, that differential susceptibility to damage is dependent on the genotoxic mechanism and relies on positional differences between genes. Sensitive genes were also analyzed in cryopreserved sperm showing a lower number of lesions than the previous treatments and a predominant peripheral distribution of oxidative damage (8-OHdG)."

The aim of the study was to determine the anticoagulation intensity of rivaroxaban and its determinant factors in Japanese stroke patients.Consecutive stroke patients with NVAF admitted between July 2012 and December 2013 were studied. Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and estimated plasma concentration of rivaroxaban (Criv) based on an anti-factor Xa chromogenic assay were measured just before and 4 and 9 h after administration at the steady state level of rivaroxaban. Determinant factors for Criv were explored using a linear mixed-model approach.Of 110 patients (37 women, 75±9 years old), 59 took 15 mg QD of rivaroxaban and 51 took 10 mg QD. Criv at 4 h was 186 ng/mL for patients taking 15 mg QD and 147 ng/mL for those taking 10 mg QD. Both PT and aPTT were positively correlated with Criv. Criv was 72% lower at 4 h in 15 patients receiving crushed tablets than in the other patients, and tablet crushing was significantly associated with lower Criv (adjusted estimate -0.43, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.26) after multivariate-adjustment.The anticoagulation effects of rivaroxaban in the acute stroke setting for Japanese NVAF patients were relatively low as compared with those in the ROCKET-AF and J-ROCKET AF trials.

In particular, little is known about the population structure of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) compared to that of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. We investigated potential changes in the MSSA molecular epidemiology in Örebro County, Sweden, from 1980 through 2010. 400 MSSA bacteremia isolates, the first 100 isolated each decade from 1980 through 2010, were retrospectively identified and analyzed regarding assignment to clonal complexes (CCs), presence of virulence genes and antibiotic resistant determinants with DNA microarray-based genotyping. 24 different CCs were identified. Most isolates (80%) belonged to 6 predominant lineages. Of those, the number of isolates assigned to CC5 and CC15 increased, and those assigned to CC8, CC25, and CC30 decreased. The most prevalent clone, CC45, did not show a significant change in prevalence during the study period. A change in prevalence was observed for some of the virulence genes, mainly attributed with their association to certain CCs. With the exception of the common blaZ gene (encoding penicillinase), antibiotic resistance genes were only sporadically detected. In conclusion, the MSSA population structure was genetically diverse. We observed decadal changes in assignments to five predominant clones, and corresponding changes in the prevalence of some virulence genes linked to CC affiliation. In light of the restrictive antibiotics prescriptions and extensive infection control procedures in Sweden, antibiotic resistance genes were rarely detected and their prevalence unaffected during the study period."

Efficient biofilms of ammonia oxidizers in the stationary phase (packing material) was formed successfully in the MRIS without special inoculation. DGGE and phylogenetic analyses revealed that proteobacteria dominated in the MRIS. Relative abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) showed contrary tendency. In the flowing phase (water effluent), AOA diversity was significantly correlated with the concentration of dissolve oxygen (DO), NO3-N and NH3-N. AOB abundance was significantly correlated with the concentration of DO and chemical oxygen demand (COD). NH3-N and COD were identified as the key factors to shape AOB community structure, while no variable significantly correlated with that of AOA. AOA might play an important role in the MRIS.

https://openalex.org/W2006794507,"We report here the sequencing and analysis of the genome of the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus CBS. This microbe is a model for studies of its carboxydotrophic life style under anaerobic condition, based on its ability to utilize carbon monoxide (CO) as the sole carbon substrate and water as the electron acceptor, yielding CO2 and H2 as the end products. The CO-oxidation reaction is known to be catalyzed by two enzyme complexes, the CO dehydrogenase and hydrogenase. As expected, analysis of the genome of Rx. gelatinosus CBS reveals the presence of genes encoding both enzyme complexes. The CO-oxidation reaction is CO-inducible, which is consistent with the presence of two putative CO-sensing transcription factors in its genome. Genome analysis also reveals the presence of two additional hydrogenases, an uptake hydrogenase that liberates the electrons in H2 in support of cell growth, and a regulatory hydrogenase that senses H2 and relays the signal to a two-component system that ultimately controls synthesis of the uptake hydrogenase. The genome also contains two sets of hydrogenase maturation genes which are known to assemble the catalytic metallocluster of the hydrogenase NiFe active site. Collectively, the genome sequence and analysis information reveals the blueprint of an intricate network of signal transduction pathways and its underlying regulation that enables Rx. gelatinosus CBS to thrive on CO or H2 in support of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2049887250,"The rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line is a widely used system to study neuronal differentiation for which sustained activation of the extracellular signaling related kinase (ERK) pathway is required. Here, we investigate the function of MK-STYX [MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) phosphoserine/threonine/tyrosine-binding protein] in neuronal differentiation. MK-STYX is a member of the MAPK phosphatase (MKP) family, which is generally responsible for dephosphorylating the ERKs. However, MK-STYX lacks catalytic activity due to the absence of the nucleophilic cysteine in the active site signature motif HC(X5)R that is essential for phosphatase activity. Despite being catalytically inactive, MK-STYX has been shown to play a role in important cellular pathways, including stress responses. Here we show that PC12 cells endogenously express MK-STYX. In addition, MK-STYX, but not its catalytically active mutant, induced neurite-like outgrowths in PC12 cells. Furthermore, MK-STYX dramatically increased the number of cells with neurite extensions in response to nerve growth factor (NGF), whereas the catalytically active mutant did not. MK-STYX continued to induce neurites in the presence of a MEK (MAP kinase kinase) inhibitor suggesting that MK-STYX does not act through the Ras-ERK/MAPK pathway but is involved in another pathway whose inactivation leads to neuronal differentiation. RhoA activity assays indicated that MK-STYX induced extensions through the Rho signaling pathway. MK-STYX decreased RhoA activation, whereas RhoA activation increased when MK-STYX was down-regulated. Furthermore, MK-STYX affected downstream players of RhoA such as the actin binding protein cofilin. The presence of MK-STYX decreased the phosphorylation of cofilin in non NGF stimulated cells, but increased its phosphorylation in NGF stimulated cells, whereas knocking down MK-STYX caused an opposite effect. Taken together our data suggest that MK-STYX may be a regulator of RhoA signaling, and implicate this pseudophosphatase as a regulator of neuronal differentiation."

Previous studies have shown that FAM20C plays an essential role in the formation and mineralization of bone, dentin and enamel. The present study analyzed the loss-of-function effects of FAM20C on the health of mouse periodontal tissues. Methods By crossbreeding 2.3 kb Col 1a1-Cre mice with Fam20Cfl/fl mice, we created 2.3 kb Col 1a1-Cre;Fam20Cfl/fl (cKO) mice, in which Fam20C was inactivated in the cells that express Type I collagen. We analyzed the periodontal tissues in the cKO mice using X-ray radiography, histology, scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry approaches. Results The cKO mice underwent a remarkable loss of alveolar bone and cementum, along with inflammation of the periodontal ligament and formation of periodontal pockets. The osteocytes and lacuno-canalicular networks in the alveolar bone of the cKO mice showed dramatic abnormalities. The levels of bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, dentin matrix protein 1 and dentin sialoprotein were reduced in the Fam20C-deficient alveolar bone and/or cementum, while periostin and fibrillin-1 were decreased in the periodontal ligament of the cKO mice. Conclusion Loss of Fam20C function leads to periodontal disease in mice. The reduced levels of bone sialoprotein, osteopontin, dentin matrix protein 1, dentin sialoprotein, periostin and fibrillin-1 may contribute to the periodontal defects in the Fam20C-deficient mice."

Methods Twenty elderly people were recruited for this study. The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting posture was compared with the slumped, normal, and lumbar support sitting postures. Spinal curvatures (pelvic, lumbar, and thoracic angles) and muscle activations of 4 back muscles on both sides (maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis, and thoracic erector spinae at T9) were measured and compared between the different sitting postures using one-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. Results The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting posture showed a relatively neutral pelvic tilt (−0.32±4.80°) when compared with the slumped (22.84±5.27°) and lumbar support (−8.97±3.31°) sitting postures (P<0.001), and showed relatively higher lumbar lordosis (−23.38±6.50°) when compared with the slumped (14.77±7.83°), normal (0.44±7.47°), and lumbar support (−16.76±4.77°) sitting postures (P<0.05). It also showed relatively lower back muscle activity when compared with the normal and lumbar support sitting postures (P<0.05). Conclusions The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting concept was suggested because it maintains a more neutral pelvic tilt, higher lumbar lordosis, and lower back muscle activation, which may help maintain a better sitting posture and reduce the risk of back pain."
https://openalex.org/W2124492860,"Bacteriorhodopsins are a large family of seven-helical transmembrane proteins that function as light-driven proton pumps. Here, we present the crystal structure of a new member of the family, Haloarcula marismortui bacteriorhodopsin I (HmBRI) D94N mutant, at the resolution of 2.5 Å. While the HmBRI retinal-binding pocket and proton donor site are similar to those of other archaeal proton pumps, its proton release region is extended and contains additional water molecules. The protein's fold is reinforced by three novel inter-helical hydrogen bonds, two of which result from double substitutions relative to Halobacterium salinarum bacteriorhodopsin and other similar proteins. Despite the expression in Escherichia coli and consequent absence of native lipids, the protein assembles as a trimer in crystals. The unique extended loop between the helices D and E of HmBRI makes contacts with the adjacent protomer and appears to stabilize the interface. Many lipidic hydrophobic tail groups are discernible in the membrane region, and their positions are similar to those of archaeal isoprenoid lipids in the crystals of other proton pumps, isolated from native or native-like sources. All these features might explain the HmBRI properties and establish the protein as a novel model for the microbial rhodopsin proton pumping studies."
https://openalex.org/W1978141324,"Human adenovirus type 36 (Ad36) as an obesity agent induces adiposity by increasing glucose uptake and promoting chronic inflammation in fat tissues; in contrast, exercise reduces total body fat and inflammation. Our objective was to determine the association between Ad36 and the effects of exercise on inflammation and glycemic control. In the human trials (n = 54), Korean children (aged 12-14 years) exercised for 60 min on three occasions each week for 2 months. We compared the body mass index (BMI) Z-scores before and after exercise. C57BL/6 mice were infected with Ad36 and Ad2 as a control, and these mice exercised for 12 weeks postinfection. After the exercise period, we determined the serum parameters and assessed the presence of inflammation and the mitochondrial function in the organs. Ad36-seropositive children who were subjected to a supervised exercise regimen had high BMI Z-scores whereas Ad36-seronegative children had lower scores. Similarly, Ad36-infected mice were resistant to weight loss and exhibited chronic inflammation of their adipose tissues despite frequent exercise. However, Ad36 combined with exercise reduced the levels of serum glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, total cholesterol, and insulin in virus-infected mice. Interestingly, virus infection increased the mitochondrial function in the liver, as demonstrated by the numbers of mitochondria, cytochrome c oxidase activity, and transcription of key mitochondrial genes. Therefore Ad36 counteracts the weight-loss effect of exercise and maintains the chronic inflammatory state, but glycemic control is improved by exercise synergistically because of increased mitochondrial activity in the liver."

https://openalex.org/W1970972176,"Devrieseasis caused by Devriesea agamarum is a highly prevalent disease in captive desert lizards, resulting in severe dermatitis and in some cases mass mortality. In this study, we assessed the contribution of autovaccination to devrieseasis control by evaluating the capacity of 5 different formalin-inactivated D. agamarum vaccines to induce a humoral immune response in bearded dragons (Pogona vitticeps). Each vaccine contained one of the following adjuvants: CpG, incomplete Freund's, Ribi, aluminium hydroxide, or curdlan. Lizards were administrated one of the vaccines through subcutaneous injection and booster vaccination was given 3 weeks after primo-vaccination. An indirect ELISA was developed and used to monitor lizard serological responses. Localized adverse effects following subcutaneous immunization were observed in all but the Ribi adjuvanted vaccine group. Following homologous experimental challenge, the incomplete Freund's as well as the Ribi vaccine were observed to confer protection in bearded dragons against the development of D. agamarum associated septicemia but not against dermatitis. Subsequently, two-dimensional gelelectrophoresis followed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry was conducted with serum obtained from 3 lizards that showed seroconversion after immunisation with the Ribi vaccine. Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and aldo-keto reductase of D. agamarum reacted with serum from the latter lizards. Based on the demonstrated seroconversion and partial protection against D. agamarum associated disease following the use of formalin-inactivated vaccines as well as the identification of target antigens in Ribi vaccinated bearded dragons, this study provides promising information towards the development of a vaccination strategy to control devrieseasis in captive lizard collections."
https://openalex.org/W1987444874,"Background Perimembranous ventricular septal defect (PMVSD) is a congenital heart aberration, which is surgically treated by patch or device closure, but also can heal without operation as spontaneous closure (SC). Methods We analyzed data from 1873 PMVSD patients admitted to our hospital during September 2001 and December 2009, in order to establish a Cox regression model for PMVSD SC probability prediction (derivative cohort). Initial contact age, ventricular septal defect (VSD) diameter, shunt flow, aneurysmal tissue of the ventricular membranous septum (ATVMS) development, associated complications, and left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDD) were analyzed for correlations with SC. The derived scoring system based on the coefficients of the model was developed and applied to another cohort with 382 PMVSD patients to evaluate the validity for SC probability forecast (validation cohort). Results Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that SC of PMVSD was associated with age at first contact, defect size, diffuse shunt flow, ATVMS formation, associated complication, as well as increased LVDD, which were used to establish a new scoring system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of our predictive scaling was 0.831 (95% CI 0.804–0.858, p<0.001) in the derivative cohort. The scoring system also accurately predicted SC with an area under the ROC curve of 0.863 (95% CI 0.785–0.941, p<0.001) in the validation cohort. Conclusion Our scoring system using factors affecting SC can predict the probability of SC in PMVSD patients."
https://openalex.org/W1998324857,"Anopheles gambiae eggs generally hatch at the completion of embryo development; two-three days post oviposition. However, staggered or delayed hatching has been observed whereby a single batch of eggs shows marked variation in time-to-hatch, with some eggs hatching 18 days post oviposition or later. The mechanism enabling delayed hatch has not been clearly elucidated but is likely mediated by environmental and genetic factors that either induce diapause or slow embryo development. This study aimed to compare metabolic activity and embryonic development between eggs collected from sub-colonies of the baseline Anopheles gambiae GAH colony previously selected for early or late time-to-hatch. Egg batches from early and late hatch sub-colonies as well as from the baseline colony were monitored for hatching. For both time-to-hatch selected sub-colonies and the baseline colony the majority of eggs hatched on day two post oviposition. Nevertheless, eggs produced by the late hatch sub-colony showed a significantly longer mean time to hatch than those produced by the early hatch sub-colony. The overall proportions that hatched were similar for all egg batches. CO2 output between eggs from early and late hatch sub-colonies showed significant differences only at 3 and 7 days post oviposition where eggs from the early hatch and the late hatch sub-colony were more metabolically active, respectively. No qualitative differences were observed in embryo development between the sub-colonies. It is concluded that all viable embryos develop to maturity at the same rate and that a small proportion then enter a state of diapause enabling them to hatch later. As it has previously been shown that it is possible to at least partially select for late hatch, this characteristic is likely to involve genetic as well as environmental factors. Delayed hatching in An. gambiae is likely an adaptation to maximise reproductive output despite the increased risk of desiccation in an unstable aquatic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2037217681,"Fitness related traits often show spatial variation across populations of widely distributed species. Comparisons of genetic variation among populations in putatively neutral DNA markers and in phenotypic traits susceptible to selection (QST FST analysis) can be used to determine to what degree differentiation among populations can be attributed to selection or genetic drift. Traditionally, QST FST analyses require a large number of populations to achieve sufficient statistical power; however, new methods have been developed that allow QST FST comparisons to be conducted on as few as two populations if their pedigrees are informative. This study compared genetic and morphological divergence in three strains of brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis that were historically or currently used for stocking in the Lake Superior Basin. Herein we examined if morphological divergence among populations showed temporal variation, and if divergence could be attributed to selection or was indistinguishable from genetic drift. Multivariate QST FST analysis showed evidence for divergent selection between populations. Univariate analyses suggests that the pattern observed in the multivariate analyses was largely driven by divergent selection for length and weight, and moreover by divergence between the Assinica strain and each of the Iron River and Siskiwit strains rather than divergent selection between each population pair. While it could not be determined if divergence was due to natural selection or inadvertent artificial selection in hatcheries, selected differences were consistent with patterns of domestication commonly found in salmonids."
https://openalex.org/W1969358170,"Background The objectives of the study were to develop web-based Spanish and Catalan versions of the KIDSCREEN, and to compare scores and psychometric properties with the paper version. Methods Internet and paper Spanish and Catalan versions of the KIDSCREEN-52 were included in a cross-sectional study in school-age children. Web-based and paper Spanish or Catalan versions of the KIDSCREEN-52 were administered to students aged 8 to 18 years from primary and secondary schools in Palafolls (Barcelona, Spain, n = 923). All students completed both web-based and paper versions during school time with an interval of at least 2 hours between administrations. The order of administration was randomized. The KIDSCREEN-52, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and sociodemographic variables were collected. Missing values, floor and ceiling effects, and internal consistency were compared between both versions, as well as mean score differences, level of agreement, and known groups and construct validity. Results Participation rate was 77% (n = 715). Web-based and paper versions showed low percentage of missing values and similar high ceiling effect (range 0 to 44%). Mean score differences showed an effect size (ES) lower than 0.2 in all dimensions. Internal consistency ranged from 0.7 to 0.88, and degree of agreement was excellent (Intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] range 0.75 to 0.87). Expected differences were seen by sex, age, socioeconomic status and mental health status. Conclusions The web-based KIDSCREEN-52 showed similar scale score and reliability and validity than the paper version. It will incorporate the child population in the assessment of quality of life providing a more attractive format."
https://openalex.org/W2005048958,"Forming the proper number of synapses is crucial for normal neuronal development. We found that loss of function of the phosphoinositide phosphatase mtm-6 results in a reduction in the number of synaptic puncta. The reduction in synapses is partially the result of MTM-6 regulation of the secretion of the Wnt ligand EGL-20 from cells in the tail and partially the result of neuronal action. MTM-6 shows relative specificity for EGL-20 over the other Wnt ligands. We suggest that the ability of MTM-6 to regulate EGL-20 secretion is a function of its expression pattern. We conclude that regulation of secretion of different Wnt ligands can use different components. Additionally, we present a novel neuronal function for MTM-6."
