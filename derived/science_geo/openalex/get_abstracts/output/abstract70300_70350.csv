https://openalex.org/W2031206542,"Additivity failures are common in heterochromatic photometry when the usual criterion of equal brightness is used. Using instead the criterion of a minimally distinct border between two precisely juxtaposed fields, we found that the additivity law holds."

https://openalex.org/W1976843394,"Interferon can be induced by diverse agents in a variety of mammalian cell cultures through apparently two mechanisms. One results in an early (2 to 10 hours) appearance of interferon and is relatively resistant to inhibition by actinomycin, puromycin, or fluorophenylalanine. A second mechanism results in a late (18 to 24 hours) appearance of interferon and is more sensitive to inhibition by these inhibitors. The molecular basis for each mechanism is unclear. Since each interferon inducer may have multiple effects on the cell, the differences observed may not necessarily reflect a fundamental difference in the mechanism of interferon stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2036185133,Complementary macromolecules were isolated from yeasts of opposite mating type. These cell-surface molecules neutralize each other as do antibodies and antigens. Both yeast factors are glycoproteins of low molecular weight. Other specific cell associations may be due to the interaction of such complementary macromolecules.
https://openalex.org/W2041998159,"In the chick pineal body, activity of the melatonin-forming enzyme hydroxyindole-O-methyl transferase is greater in the light than in darkness. Neither bilateral enucleation of the eyes nor sympathetic denervation prevented this light-induced elevation of enzyme activity. This fact indicates that in the bird, in contrast to mammals, neither the retinas nor sympathetic innervation of the pineal body are essential for environmental control of melatonin formation."
https://openalex.org/W2056730914,"Administration of D-penicillamine and lathyrogens such as beta-amino-propionitrile to animals markedly alters connective tissue by preventing the normal cross-linkage of elastin and collagen. It had been shown that beta-aminopropionitrile blocks the cross-linkage of elastin and collagen by preventing the initial step in cross-linkage: the conversion of lysine in peptide linkage to alpha-amino adipic-delta-semialdehyde. We show that penicillamine acts after the initial step, causing the accumulation of an elastin rich in alpha-amino adipic-delta-semialdehyde."
https://openalex.org/W1564288155,"Abstract Kinetic studies have been performed with a recrystallized preparation of the pH 6 acetolactate-forming enzyme from Aerobacter aerogenes. The pH optimum in acetate is 5.8, and the enzyme activity is inhibited by phosphate and sulfate. These compounds cause sigmoidal kinetics, and apparent Michaelis kinetics is observed in acetate. The enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by the substrate analogues, glyoxylate and phenylpyruvate, and the inhibition is normal and strictly competitive in acetate. The activating effect of a number of acetate analogues has been tested, and acetate can be replaced by monochloroacetate, and to some extent by formate. Analogues with substitution in the carboxyl group had no activating effect, an indication that this group is essential for this effect. The possible biological significance of the regulation of the enzyme by acetate is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2078756308,Isolated perfused retinas of albino rats were exposed to brief saturating flashes of white light which bleached about 50 percent of the rhodopsin present. Transient photoproducts of the reaction could be detected for about 30 minutes. The b-wave threshold increased by some 3 logarithmic units immediately after the flash and remained stable at this level thereafter. This suggests that the longer-lived intermediate products of rhodopsin photolysis do not influence scotopic visual sensitivity.
https://openalex.org/W2047167396,"The ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylases from green and blue-green algae and the purple sulfur photosynthetic bacterium Chromatium are proteins with high molecular weights and with sedimentation coefficients of 18 to 21 Svedberg units. The carboxylases of the Athiorhodaceae are smaller, that of Rhodospirillum rubrum being a 6.2S molecule, and those of the two species of Rhodopseudomonas are 12S and 14.5S."

https://openalex.org/W163745758,"Abstract The steroid N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase of rabbit liver has been found also in rabbit kidney and intestine. It is absent from uterus, ovary, adrenal, spleen, and blood. In kidney the activity is higher than that of glucuronyl transferase, but this relationship is reversed in the other tissues. The transferase is located in the microsomes, requires UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, has a pH optimum of 8.0 in phosphate buffer, and a Km value of 6.8 x 10-5 m for 17α-estradiol-3-glucuronoside. It will also transfer N-acetylglucosamine to the 3-glucuronosides of 17-epiestriol and 16,17-epiestriol, but not to those of estriol or 16-epiestriol. Of a series of free steroids tested, including 17α-estradiol, 17-epiestriol, and 16,17-epiestriol, none served as substrate for the enzyme, although estrone, as well as diethylstilbestrol and some aliphatic alcohols, inhibited its activity. The results indicate a high specificity of the enzyme for the 17α-hydroxyl group on phenolic steroids which are already attached through position 3 to glucosiduronic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2046438552,"A fossil bone fragment-the first record of tetrapod life from Antarctica-was found near Graphite Peak in the upper Beardmore Glacier area (85 degrees 3.3'S; 172 degrees 19'E). The fragment was embedded in a pebbly quartzose sandstone, probably of fluvial origin, in the lower part of the Triassic Fremouw Formation (as yet undefined), which contains Dicroidium in the upper part. The fossil horizon is only 76 meters, stratigraphically, above the Glossopteris-bearing Buckley Formation, a coal-bearing sequence of Permian age. The bone fragment is the back portion of a left mandibular ramus of a labyrinthodont amphibian. This identification is based on the characteristic labyrinthodont external surface sculpturing, with indications of ""mucous grooves,"" as well as on other osteological features."

https://openalex.org/W2062067197,"Ultrasound is readily conducted across a boundary when the specific acoustic impedances of the two media are about equal. The specific acoustic impedance of dental enamel is about that of aluminum. A longitudinal sonic pulse, less than 250 nanoseconds in duration, conducted to the tooth through an aluminum rod, has positively detected the enamel-dentin junction as well as the dentin-pulp interface."
https://openalex.org/W2042391854,"CHRONIC opiate addiction in women is generally considered to be associated with amenorrhoea, anovulation and infertility1, but the number of observed pregnancies in drug addicts, as well as case reports of pregnancy in women with chronic addiction2,3, casts doubt on this belief. The irregular life of these women and the clouded sensorium make it difficult to define the effects of opiates on the hormonal state. A unique opportunity to observe gynaecic function in women maintained on large doses of a narcotic drug under close medical supervision was provided by the methadone maintenance treatment programme4. This is a programme for the voluntary rehabilitation of the “hard core” addict. The patients are given gradually increasing doses of methadone to induce a state of tolerance and then are maintained on a constant dose of 60–120 mg/day. It is thought that such large doses induce “narcotic blockade”, so that heroin becomes neither necessary nor desirable and the addict can return to a normal, useful life5."

https://openalex.org/W1990099721,"Individuals of Mulinia lateralis are randomly distributed over a homogeneous area (0.25 square meter) of a mudflat. Second-year individuals of Gemma gemma also are randomly distributed, but its total population is aggregated because of its ovoviviparous habit. As expected for two species having different life histories, their size-frequency distributions are very different, the indication being that the nature of a size-frequency curve may not be a reliable index of the degree of transport or integrity of a fossil assemblage."

A pigment with maximum absorbancy at 555 nanometers is converted by light to a long-lived intermediate with wavelength of maximum absorbancy at 496 nanometers. A second pigment with wavelength of maximum absorbancy at 496 nanometers bleaches in the light, seemingly without forming detectable products at wavelengths longer than 375 nanometers. Both pigments occur in each layer of microvilli."
https://openalex.org/W2054886473,"In the galea of silkmoths undergoing metamorphosis, generalized epidermal cells, which had previousty secreted pupal cuticle, transform into highly specialized cells producing a new protein, the enzyme cocoonase. These cells first segregate by mitosis and displacement, then grow rapidly through endomitosis and accumulation of RNA-rich cytoplasm, and finally begin rapid synthesis of cocoonase. Replication of DNA continues in fully differentiated cells synthesizing cocoonase."

https://openalex.org/W2071784810,"In certain recombination-deficient (Rec-) bacterial strains genetic recombination of bacteriophage S13 is reduced, but the existence of some residual recombination has suggested that there is a secondary mechanism of phage recombination that is still functioning. In these Rec- strains it is found that there is no stimulation of recombination by irradiation of the parental phage with ultraviolet light, in contrast to the large increase found when irradiated phage particles infect a Rec+ host. This selective stimulation of phage recombination in the Rec+ but not in the Rec- strains supports the view that the phage uses at least two mechanisms of genetic recombination."
