https://openalex.org/W2009291420,"The recently developed technique for determining the water stress of a plant by measuring the pressure necessary to force water back to the cut surface of a severed twig is adaptable to both field and laboratory experiments. We have designed and operated an efficient portable system weighing less than 18 kilograms. Sampling variation within and among Douglas fir trees varies from less than +/- I atmosphere under low stress conditions to +/- 10 atmospheres under high stress conditions. In the measurement of plants of comparable height and similar exposure, the variation is reduced to a minimum. Values in internal water stress of Douglas fir vary from 3 to more than 40 atmospheres. Both duration and magnitude of stress are important ecologically. Pressure-bomb measurements are used to demonstrate a relation between plant distribution and internal water stress."

The O2−˙ generated in mitochondria also acts as a redox signal triggering cellular apoptosis. The enzyme succinate ubiquinone reductase (SQR or complex II) is one of the major mitochondrial components hosting regulatory thiols. Here the intrinsic protein S-glutathionylation (PrSSG) at the 70-kDa FAD-binding subunit of SQR was detected in rat heart and in isolated SQR using an anti-GSH monoclonal antibody. When rats were subjected to 30 min of coronary ligation followed by 24 h of reperfusion, the electron transfer activity (ETA) of SQR in post-ischemic myocardium was significantly decreased by 41.5 ± 2.9%. The PrSSGs of SQR-70 kDa were partially or completely eliminated in post-ischemic myocardium obtained from in vivo regional I/R hearts or isolated global I/R hearts, respectively. These results were further confirmed by using isolated succinate cytochrome c reductase (complex II + complex III). In the presence of succinate, O2−˙ was generated and oxidized the SQR portion of SCR, leading to a 60–70% decrease in its ETA. The gel band of the S-glutathionylated SQR 70-kDa polypeptide was cut out and digested with trypsin, and the digests were subjected to liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis. One cysteine residue, Cys90, was involved in S-glutathionylation. These results indicate that the glutathione-binding domain, 77AAFGLSEAGFNTACVTK93 (where underline indicates Cys90), is susceptible to redox change induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, in vitro S-glutathionylation of purified SQR resulted in enhanced SQR-derived electron transfer efficiency and decreased formation of the 70-kDa-derived protein thiyl radical induced by O2−˙. Thus, the decreasing S-glutathionylation and ETA in mitochondrial complex II are marked during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. This redox-triggered impairment of complex II occurs in the post-ischemic heart and should be useful to identify disease pathogenesis related to reactive oxygen species-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.

In the post-ischemic heart, oxygen delivery to the myocardium is not sufficient to meet the need for mitochondrial oxidation during the physiological conditions of hypoxia, leaving the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) 2The abbreviations used are: ETC, electron transport chain; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion injury; SQR, succinate ubiquinone reductase or mitochondrial complex II; SCR, succinate cytochrome c reductase or supercomplex containing complex II and complex III; QCR, ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase or complex III; GS-SQR, glutathionylated SQR; O2−˙, superoxide anion; ROS,; SMP, submitochondrial particles; DEPMPO, 5-diethoxylphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl pyrroline N-oxide; SOD, superoxide dismutase; LC, liquid chromatography; MS/MS, tandem mass spectrometry; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ETA, electron transfer activity; DCPIP, dichlorophenol indophenol; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; DTT, dithiothreitol; LAD, left atrial descending; PrSSG, protein S-glutathionylation; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; FCCP, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; Q2, ubiquinone-2; TTC, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride; GS, glutathione; ROS, reactive oxygen species. in a more reduced state. This results in increased electron leakage from the ETC that in turn reacts with residual molecular oxygen to give O2−˙ (7Ambrosio G. Zweier J.L. Duilio C. Kuppusamy P. Santoro G. Elia P.P. Tritto I.

Chem. 1991; 266: 20296-20304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the lack of ADP, re-introduction of oxygen with reperfusion will greatly increase electron leakage along with a decrease in scavenging capacity, leading to O2−˙ and O2−˙-derived oxidants being overproduced in mitochondria. Specifically, an increased hyperoxygenation induced by reperfusion in the post-ischemic heart has been detected by in vivo EPR oximetry (9Zhao X. He G. Chen Y.R. Pandian R.P. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Circulation. 2005; 111: 2966-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The overproduction of ROS also initiates oxidative inactivation of the ETC as reported previously (9Zhao X. He G. Chen Y.R. Pandian R.P. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Circulation. 2005; 111: 2966-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial complex II (succinate:ubiquinone oxido-reductase; EC 1.3.5.1) is a key membrane complex in the tricarboxylic acid cycle that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate in the mitochondrial matrix (10Hagerhall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Succinate oxidation is coupled to reduction of ubiquinone at the mitochondrial inner membrane as one part of the respiratory electron transport chain. SQR mediates electron transfer from succinate to ubiquinone through the prosthetic groups of FAD as follows: [2Fe-2S] (S1), [4Fe-4S] (S2), and [3Fe-4S] (S3) and heme b. The enzyme is composed of two parts as follows: a soluble succinate dehydrogenase and a membrane-anchoring protein fraction. Succinate dehydrogenase contains two protein subunits, a 70-kDa protein with a covalently bound FAD, and a 30-kDa iron-sulfur protein hosting S1, S2, and S3 iron-sulfur clusters (10Hagerhall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The membrane-anchoring protein fraction contains two hydrophobic polypeptides (14 and 9 kDa) with heme b binding (11Lemos R.S. Fernandes A.S. Pereira M.M. Gomes C.M. Teixeira M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 158-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The catalysis of SQR is believed to contribute to superoxide generation in mitochondria (12Chen Y.R. Chen C.L. Yeh A. Liu X.

Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Two regions of the enzyme complex are hypothesized to be responsible for generating the superoxide anion radical, O2−˙. One is located on the FAD cofactor and is modulated by FADH• semiquinone (15Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol.

Defects in the SQR leading to O2−˙ overproduction have been linked with the pathogenesis of certain diseases. The redox pool in mitochondria is enriched in GSH with a physiological concentration of 5–10 mm in liver mitochondria (18Costa N.J. Dahm C.C. Hurrell F. Taylor E.R. Murphy M.P. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2003; 5: 291-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, lower GSH concentrations of 0.5–2 mm are present in other tissues, including heart, and generally mitochondrial GSH concentrations are similar to those in the cytosol (19Hansen J.M. Go Y.M. Jones D.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 215-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The 70-kDa subunit of SQR is one of the major components to host reactive/regulatory thiols, which are thought to have biological functions of antioxidant defense and redox signaling. The physiological role of SQR-derived regulatory thiols at the 70-kDa subunit has been implicated in the regulation of respiration and nitric oxide utilization (20Shiva S. Crawford J.H. Ramachandran A. Ceaser E.K. Hillson T. Brookes P.S. Patel R.P. Darley-Usmar V.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An important response of protein thiols (PrSH) to oxidative stress is to reversibly form protein mixed disulfides (PrSSG) via S-glutathionylation (21Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 22Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 23Gallogly M.M.

Trans. 2005; 33: 1390-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification has been suggested as a common mechanism regulating protein functions related to physiological changes (22Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 26Giustarini D. Rossi R. Milzani A. Colombo R. Dalle-Donne I. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2004; 8: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of protein S-glutathionylation of SQR and how this redox modification affects the enzymatic functions of SQR remain unknown. Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion provides an outstanding disease model to probe mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from in vivo overproduction of oxygen-free radical(s). This study was undertaken to address the fundamental questions regarding the redox biochemistry of SQR and its molecular mechanism of damage in the post-ischemic heart. Here we focused on the 70-kDa flavin subunit of SQR. We observed marked loss of SQR activity in the post-ischemic myocardium. This decreased activity was associated with deglutathionylation of the 70-kDa FAD-binding subunit of SQR, suggesting S-glutathionylation activates the enzyme in vivo. To further understand the mechanism of SQR glutathionylation, in vitro studies were performed to identify the cysteine residue involved in the protein S-glutathionylation of SQR and functionally characterize glutathionylated SQR, including its electron transport and superoxide generation activities that result from protein S-glutathionylation. Ammonium sulfate, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), ubiquinone-2 (Q2), sodium cholate, deoxycholic acid, glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), Triton X-100, carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), oligomycin, Cu,Zn-SOD and sodium succinate were purchased from Sigma and used as received. The 5-diethoxylphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO) spin trap and anti-DMPO polyclonal antibody were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). The DMPO spin trap from Aldrich was vacuum-distilled twice and stored under nitrogen at –80 °C until needed. Global ischemia-reperfusion conditions were imposed upon isolated hearts according to published procedures (27Wang P. Zweier J.L. Kuppusamy P. Williams R. Rayburn B.K. Smith D. Weisfeldt M.L.

Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼300–350 g and 9–10 weeks old) were heparinized with heparin (500 units) and anesthetized with intraperitoneal Nembutal (30–35 mg/kg). The hearts were excised, and the aortas were cannulated and perfused at 37 °C with a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg using Krebs solution (in mm, 16.7 glucose, 120 NaCl, 25.0 NaHCO3, 2.5 CaCl2, 5.9 KCl, 0.5 EDTA, and 1.2 MgCl2) pre-bubbled with 95% CO2,5% O2 gas. Two side arms in the perfusion line located just proximal to the heart cannula can allow infusion of treatment agents. Hearts were subjected to control perfusion or 30 min of ischemia followed by 60 min of reperfusion. Hearts were then placed on ice and immediately subjected to mitochondrial preparation. Ischemic duration was 30 min. The isolated hearts were perfused for 60 min at 37 °C by the method of Langendorff at a constant pressure of 80 mm Hg with a Krebs-buffered perfusate. The procedure for the in vivo ischemia-reperfusion rat model was performed by the technique reported in the literature (9Zhao X. He G. Chen Y.R. Pandian R.P. Kuppusamy P. Zweier J.L. Circulation. 2005; 111: 2966-2972Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 29Guo Y. Wu W.J. Qiu Y. Tang X.L. Yang Z. Bolli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1375-H1387PubMed Google Scholar) as indicated in supplemental Fig. 1. Sprague-Dawley rats (∼300–350 g and 9–10 weeks old) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal Nembutal (80–100 mg/kg). After the rats were fully anesthetized, they were intubated and then ventilated with room air (1.0 ml, rate of 100 breaths/min) using a mechanical ventilator model 683 (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). The rats then underwent a left lateral thoracotomy; the pericardium was opened, and a pericardial cradle was formed to allow adequate exposure of the heart surface. The left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery was then occluded by placing a suture (6.0 nylon) around the origin of the LAD. After 30 min of ischemia, the suture around the coronary artery was untied, allowing reperfusion to occur. Following the reperfusion, all wounds were closed and infiltrated with 0.5% xylocaine (<0.3 ml). The muscular layers and skin incisions were closed with 4.0 nylon sutures. A chest tube (2.5-cm polyethylene 50 tubing) was inserted at the wound site and maintained in position while the animal was taken off respiratory support. Upon spontaneous breathing, the chest tube was removed and a surgical clip applied over the withdrawal site. The animal was allowed to recover, and a physiological assessment was performed. During the recovery period the animals received supportive post-operative care as needed. Body temperature was maintained at 37 °C by a thermal heating pad. By 6 h post-operation, the animals had recovered sufficiently to eat and drink independently. At 1 day post-infarction, the rats were placed under deep anesthesia with Nembutal (200 mg/ml). The rats were then sacrificed, and the hearts excised and placed in the PBS buffer. The infarct area was identified by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The risk region of myocardial tissue without TTC staining was excised and subjected to biochemical analysis. Bovine heart mitochondrial SCR was prepared from submitochondrial particles (SMP). SMP was suspended in 0.1 m borate/phosphate, pH 7.8, to cytochrome b content of 11 μm and solubilized with sodium cholate (4 ml of 20% sodium cholate, 100 ml of SMP suspension). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to 37.5% saturation (21.25 g/100 ml) and stirred for 60 min before being centrifuged at 21,600 × g for 90 min in a Beckman J30-I centrifuge, rotor JLA 16.25. The supernatant collected was brought to 50% ammonium sulfate saturation (8.9 g/100 ml) and centrifuged at 21,600 × g in the same centrifuge for 20 min. The pellet collected was dissolved in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% sodium cholate and 1 mm EDTA and stored at 0 °C (in ice) overnight. The enzyme solution was then centrifuged at 142,500 × g for 40 min in a Beckman model L-90K ultracentrifuge, rotor type 45 Ti. The supernatant was collected and dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 1 mm EDTA, overnight, with two changes of buffer. The crude SCR was collected by centrifugation of the dialysate at 43,700 × g for 30 min in a Beckman J30-I centrifuge, rotor JA 30.50. The pellet was suspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, containing 0.67 m sucrose (TS buffer). Further purification of SCR was achieved by repeat ammonium acetate fractionation in the presence of deoxycholate. The crude SCR was diluted in TS buffer to a protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml (estimated by 0.75 absorption at 278 nm in 1% SDS), and the protein was solubilized with deoxycholate (0.35 mg/mg protein). A 50% saturated solution of ammonium acetate was used. The purified SCR was precipitated between 16.5 and 33.5% ammonium acetate saturation and then centrifuged at 142,500 × g for 30 min in a Beckman model L-90K ultracentrifuge, rotor type 45 Ti. The pellet obtained was dissolved in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer before being stored at –80 °C. The specific activity of purified SCR is ∼9.1 μmol of cytochrome c reduced per min/mg protein. SQR was isolated from succinate cytochrome c reductase (SCR) by calcium phosphate-cellulose chromatography under nonreducing conditions according to the published method developed by Yu and co-workers (30Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2016-2021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lee G.Y. He D.Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Succinate was omitted from all buffers used in the purification procedure. SQR-containing fractions obtained from the second calcium phosphate-cellulose column were concentrated by 43% ammonium sulfate saturation and centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 20 min (31Lee G.Y. He D.Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The precipitate obtained was dissolved in 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, containing 0.2% sodium cholate and 10% glycerol. The specific activity of purified SQR is ∼15.2 μmol of succinate oxidized (or DCPIP reduction)/min/mg protein. Optical spectra were measured on a Shimadzu 2401 UV-visible recording spectrophotometer. The protein concentrations of SMP and rat heart tissue homogenates were determined by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The heme b concentration of SQR was calculated from the differential spectrum between dithionite reduction and ferricyanide oxidation. The concentration of Q2 was determined by absorbance spectra from NaBH4 reduction using a millimolar extinction coefficient ϵ275–290nm = 12.25 mm–1cm–1 (32Chen Y.R. Chen C.L. Zhang L. Green-Church K.B. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37339-37348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of SQR was assayed by measuring Q2-stimulated DCPIP reduction by succinate as described in the literature (31Lee G.Y. He D.Y. Yu L. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6193-6198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To measure the electron transfer activity of SQR, an appropriate amount of SQR was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 75 μm DCPIP, 50 μm Q2, and 20 mm succinate as developed by Hatefi et al. (33Hatefi Y. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 53: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The SQR activity was determined by measuring the decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. The specific activity of SQR (nmol of DCPIP reduction (or succinate oxidized)/min/mg of SQR) or rat heart tissue homogenate (nmol of DCPIP reduction (or succinate oxidized)/min/mg protein) was calculated using a molar extinction coefficient ϵ600nm = 21 mm–1 cm–1. QCR (complex III) activity was assayed as reported previously (34Chen Y.R. Yu C.A. Yu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2057-2062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 35Chen Y.R. Shenoy S.K. Yu C.A. Yu L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10207-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An appropriate amount of SCR or tissue homogenate was added to an assay mixture (1 ml) containing 50 mm sodium/potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 μm cytochrome c, and 25 μm Q2H2. QCR activity was determined by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c (the increase in absorbance at 550 nm) at room temperature. Mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation described in the published method (37Vercesi A. Reynafarje B. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6379-6385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Mitochondria were precipitated by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at the final step and resuspended in the media containing 230 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm Trizma(Tris base)/HCl buffer, pH 7.4 (M-buffer). Mitochondrial respiration was measured by the polarographic method using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (World Precision Institute, Sarasota, FL). The incubation media contained M-buffer at 37 or 30 °C. Mitochondrial preparations were added to the media at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml, and oxygen consumption was induced by succinate (5 mm). ADP (0.5 mm) was then added, and the following parameters were measured as follows: state 2, oxygen consumption before the addition of ADP; State 3, oxygen consumption stimulated by ADP; state 4, oxygen consumption after the addition of oligomycin (6 μg/mg mitochondria) followed by ADP addition. The oxygen electrode was calibrated by assuming the concentration of O2 in the incubation medium at 37 °C to be 200 μm or 30 °C to be 250 μm. Myocardial tissues excised from the normal region (or nonischemic area) and risk region (or infarction area) containing the LAD were minced and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (250 watts, 10 s, three times) in ice-cold HEPES buffer (3 mm, pH 7.2) containing sucrose (0.25 m), EGTA (0.5 mm), and protease/inhibitor mixture (1:40; Roche Diagnostics). The supernatant of tissue homogenate was collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 20 min. The reaction mixture was mixed with the Laemmli sample buffer at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v) in the presence of β-ME (for detection of 70-kDa and DMPO adduct) or in the absence of β-ME (for detection of S-glutathionylation), incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, and then immediately loaded onto a 4–20% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gradient gel. Samples were run at room temperature for 2 h at 100 V. Protein bands were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) and 5% dry milk (Bio-Rad). The blots were then incubated overnight with anti-GSH monoclonal antibody (ViroGen Corp., Watertown, MA), anti-70-kDa monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR), or anti-DMPO polyclonal antibody at 4 °C. Blots were then washed three times in TTBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG in TTBS at room temperature. The blots were again washed twice in TTBS and twice in Tris-buffered saline, and then visualized using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The sample of S-glutathionylated SQR (GS-SQR) was prepared by incubated with as-isolated SQR (2 μm based on heme b) with GSSG (1 mm) at room temperature for 1 h. To avoid thiol-disulfide exchange and prevent artifactual oxidation, the free thiols of GS-SQR was subjected to carbomylmethylation with iodoacetamide (2 mm) at room temperature for 1 h. The obtained GS-SQR (50 pmol) was subjected to SDS-PAGE in the absence of β-ME using 4–20% gradient Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel. Protein bands on the gel were stained for 1 h with Coomassie Blue, and the background of staining was rapidly removed by methanol/acetic acid/water (40:10:50). The gel was then equilibrated with distilled water at 4 °C overnight prior to in-gel digestion and MS measurement. In-gel Digestion—Gels were digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega, Madison WI) and chymotrypsin (Roche Diagnostics) using the Montage in-gel digestion kit from Millipore (Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer's recommended protocols with minor changes for optimization of peptide extraction. Briefly, the bands of interest were trimmed as closely as possible to minimize background polyacrylamide material. After being washed twice in 50% methanol, 5% acetic acid for several hours, the gel bands were dehydrated with acetonitrile and washed again with cycles of acetonitrile and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The gels were then dried using a speed vac. A 50-μl aliquot of trypsin (20 ng/μl) or chymotrypsin (25 ng/μl) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to the dehydrated gel. The gel was set on ice for 10 min for rehydration before the addition of another 20 μl of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature overnight. The peptides were extracted from the gel using 50% acetonitrile with 5% formic acid several times and pooled together. The extracted pools were concentrated in a speed vac to ∼25 μl. Nano-LC/MS/MS (LC/MS/MS)—Capillary-liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC/MS/MS) was performed on a Micromass hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight Q-Tof II (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK) mass spectrometer equipped with an orthogonal nanospray source (New Objective, Woburn, MA) operated in positive ion mode. The capillary LC system was a Dionex UltiMate system (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Solvent A was water containing 50 mm acetic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile. A 5-cm 75 μm ID BioBasic C18 column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) packed directly in the nanospray tip was used for chromatographic separations. 2.5-μl aliquots of each sample were injected onto the column for the analysis. Peptides were eluted directly off the column into the quadrupole-time-of-flight system using a gradient of 2–80% solvent B over 48 min, with a flow rate of ∼300 nl/min. The total run time was 55 min. The nanospray capillary voltage was set at 3.0 kV and the cone voltage at 40 V. The source temperature was maintained at 100 °C. Mass spectra were acquired from m/z 400–2,000 every 0.9 s with a resolution of 8,000 (full width at half-maximum) and recorded using MassLynx 4.0 with automatic switching functions.

https://openalex.org/W1490806999,"Hex3 and Slx8 are Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins with important functions in DNA damage control and maintenance of genomic stability. Both proteins have RING domains at their C termini. Such domains are common in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein ligases (E3s), but little was known about the molecular functions of either protein. In this study we identified HEX3 as a high-copy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protease mutant, ulp1ts, suggesting that it may affect cellular SUMO dynamics. Remarkably, even a complete deletion of ULP1 is strongly suppressed. Hex3 forms a heterodimer with Slx8. We found that the Hex3·Slx8 complex has a robust substrate-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In this E3 complex, Slx8 appears to bear the core ligase function, with Hex3 strongly enhancing its activity. Notably, SUMO attachment to a substrate stimulates its Hex3·Slx8-dependent ubiquitination, primarily through direct noncovalent interactions between SUMO and Hex3. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of substrate targeting in which sumoylation of a protein can help trigger its subsequent ubiquitination by recruiting a SUMO-binding ubiquitin ligase.

Ubiquitin and small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) 5The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; SIM, SUMO-interacting motif; ORF, open reading frame; WT, wild type; MBP, maltose-binding protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TEV, tobacco etch virus. 5The abbreviations used are: SUMO, small ubiquitin-related modifier; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; SIM, SUMO-interacting motif; ORF, open reading frame; WT, wild type; MBP, maltose-binding protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; TEV, tobacco etch virus. are highly conserved proteins that can be covalently attached to target proteins (1Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2887) Google Scholar, 2Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 3Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Both ubiquitin and SUMO are attached to substrates by three types of enzymes: E1, E2, and E3. These enzymes work consecutively to catalyze isopeptide bond formation between the C terminus of ubiquitin or SUMO and a lysine side chain of the acceptor protein. In the case of ubiquitination, ubiquitin is first activated by the E1 activating enzyme and is transferred from a thiol group on E1 to a thiol on an E2 conjugating enzyme. The final step of ubiquitin conjugation to target proteins is facilitated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, which binds both E2 and substrate and facilitates ubiquitin transfer to the substrate. E3s are key mediators of substrate specificity.Sumoylation happens in an analogous manner to ubiquitin conjugation, requiring an E1, E2, and usually an E3, of which only a handful have been identified so far (4Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 5Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitination, which often targets substrates for proteasomal degradation, SUMO modification is not believed to target substrates directly to the proteasome. Instead, sumoylation appears to modulate the functional properties of a protein, including its localization, activity, and interactions with other macromolecules.Similar to ubiquitin regulation, SUMO-protein conjugates are in a dynamic state, with specialized proteases rapidly removing the SUMO moieties. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ulp1 and Ulp2 are the only known SUMO proteases and are responsible for desumoylating distinct sets of SUMO-modified proteins (6Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 7Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Ulp1 is also required for proteolytic maturation of the SUMO precursor encoded by the SMT3 gene. Like SUMO itself and the SUMO E1 (the Aos1-Uba2 heterodimer) and E2 (Ubc9), Ulp1 is essential for yeast cell viability. The temperature-sensitive ulp1ts mutant grown at nonpermissive temperature arrests primarily in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (7Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).To understand the mechanistic basis of ulp1ts lethality and gain insight into Ulp1 regulation of SUMO dynamics, we screened a high-copy yeast genomic library for dosage suppressors of ulp1ts. From this screen we isolated the HEX3 gene. HEX3 (SLX5) was originally identified together with SLX8 as a gene that becomes essential for viability in the absence of the Sgs1/Top3 pathway (8Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hex3 and Slx8 form a heterodimer and localize to the nucleus (9Yang L. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5541-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Deletions of either or both genes display similar defects in genome stability and are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, suggesting that they work interdependently to suppress the accumulation of DNA damage (10Zhang C. Roberts T.M. Yang J. Desai R. Brown G.W. DNA Repair (Amst). 2006; 5: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hex3 and Slx8 each bear a zinc-coordinating RING domain, a motif characteristic of many ubiquitin and SUMO ligases (E3s). Hex3 also binds SUMO in vivo (11Hannich J.T. Lewis A. Kroetz M.B. Li S.J. Heide H. Emili A. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4102-4110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Hex3·Slx8 complex might function by regulating SUMO dynamics. This hypothesis was further supported by the discovery that mutations in HEX3 and SLX8, like mutations in many known components of the SUMO pathway, are able to suppress a temperature-sensitive mutation of the essential Mot1 transcriptional regulator (12Wang Z. Jones G.M. Prelich G. Genetics. 2006; 172: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Here we report that the Hex3·Slx8 heterodimer is a ubiquitin ligase. Recombinant Slx8, but not Hex3, exhibits RING-dependent auto-ubiquitinating activity. We identified Rad52, a protein that regulates homologous recombination-dependent DNA repair, as a model in vitro substrate for Hex3·Slx8. Slx8 by itself has a very weak Rad52-ubiquitin ligation activity that is strongly stimulated by Hex3. Both the Slx8 and Hex3 RING domains are required for this activity and for in vivo DNA damage control. Notably, SUMO attachment to Rad52 stimulates its Hex3·Slx8-dependent ubiquitination and enhances binding between Hex3 and the substrate. Hex3 binds SUMO noncovalently, primarily through two N-terminal SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs).Our data demonstrate that Hex3 and Slx8 work together as a ubiquitin E3 in which Slx8 appears to provide the core ligase function and Hex3 enhances Slx8 activity and substrate targeting, in part by binding SUMO in SUMO-protein conjugates. This novel mechanism of ubiquitin-substrate specificity may also be relevant to the human BRCA1-BARD1 ubiquitin ligase implicated in human breast cancer, which also is a heterodimer of two RING proteins with asymmetric mechanistic contributions from the two RING domains (13Brzovic P.S.

A. 2003; 100: 5646-5651Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast and Bacterial Methods—Yeast rich (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) and minimal (SD) media were prepared as described previously, and standard methods were used for genetic manipulation of yeast (15Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). Standard techniques were used for recombinant DNA work in Escherichia coli.Yeast Strains—The hex3Δ::kanMX4 and slx8Δ::kanMX4 strains were obtained from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). They are in the BY4741 strain background. Where indicated, kanMX4 was PCR-amplified with primer pairs corresponding to regions 200 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the HEX3 and SLX8 open reading frame (ORF), respectively. The deletion cassettes were then transformed into wild-type (WT) strain MHY501 (16Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) to generate the hex3Δ::kanMX4 (MHY3712) and slx8::kanMX4 (MHY3716) strains. The hex3Δ::kanMX4 slx8Δ::kanMX4 double deletion strain (MHY3861) was generated from a cross between the two single mutants.Plasmids and Mutagenesis—Genomic SLX8, containing the endogenous promoter and terminator, was PCR-amplified and cloned into different plasmids. Genomic HEX3 was obtained from the ulp1ts suppression screen described below, and various fragments were subcloned into the desired plasmids. YCplac22-ulp1ts-kanMX4 contains the ulp1ts allele present on a BamHI/PstI fragment. The kanMX4 marker was inserted into the AflII site (after filling in the overhang with Klenow DNA polymerase) present 213 base pairs after the stop codon of ulp1ts. To generate FLAG-tagged Hex3 and T7-tagged Slx8, FLAG (DYKDDDDKG) and T7 (MASMTGGQQMG) epitope tags were introduced using PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis. To overexpress and purify Hex3 and Slx8 from bacteria, both ORFs were PCR-amplified and cloned into pMALc-HT (a gift from Sean Prigge, JHSOM), thereby adding an in-frame N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) module followed by a TEV protease cleavage site and a His6 epitope tag. For the corresponding RING-truncated versions, the PCR reactions were designed to introduce a stop codon at the position of the codon for the last zinc-coordinating Cys residue.To generate a RING-truncated Hex3 protein for expression in yeast, a premature stop codon was introduced such that the last two conserved zinc-coordinating cysteines were deleted. Specifically, the plasmid pRS425-HEX3 was digested with the restriction enzyme BspE1, filled in with Klenow polymerase, and religated to create an allele encoding a truncated Hex3 protein ending at Pro-591 followed by Ala-Gly and a stop codon. For creating point mutations in the RING domain, Cys-561 and Cys-564 of Hex3 and Cys-206 and Cys-209 of Slx8 were changed to serines by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). Rad52 clones for E. coli overexpression were made by inserting the PCR-amplified RAD52 ORF into pET11d and pET21a (for T7 epitope tagging; Novagen). A RAD52-SUMO E. coli overexpression clone was generated by inserting the PCR-amplified SMT3 ORF (lacking the region encoding the C-terminal Gly-Gly) in-frame with and downstream of RAD52 in pET21a-T7-RAD52. In this fusion construct, the major in vitro Rad52 sumoylation site (Lys-220) 6L. Krejci and P. Sung, unpublished data. was changed to arginine by QuikChange mutagenesis. For pQE30-TEV-SMT3gg, DNA encoding the mature portion of SUMO (Smt3) was amplified by PCR and cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen) along with a primer-encoded N-terminal TEV cleavage site.Isolation of HEX3 by ulp1ts Suppression—A ulp1ts strain was generated by replacing the WT ULP1 plasmid in MHY1321, which lacks the chromosomal copy of ULP1 (17Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), with YCplac22-ulp1ts-kanMX4. The strain was co-transformed with a plasmid expressing mature SUMO (pRS426-GPD-FLAG-SMT3gg) (11Hannich J.T. Lewis A. Kroetz M.B. Li S.J. Heide H. Emili A. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4102-4110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The resulting strain was transformed with a yeast genomic DNA library carried in the 2μ-LEU2 vector YEp13 (18Nasmyth K.A. Tatchell K. Cell. 1980; 19: 753-764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Approximately 10,000 Leu+ transformants were isolated at 30 °C and tested for their ability to grow at the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C upon replica plating. Of the 8 clones that supported growth at 37 °C, 6 carried 5′ truncated or full-length ULP1 genes. The other two plasmids contained identical DNA inserts from chromosome XVI that included the HEX3 ORF. A SacI/PacI restriction fragment from the original isolate containing only the HEX3 ORF was cloned into the high-copy plasmids pRS425 and pRS423. This fragment was found to be sufficient for full ulp1ts suppression.Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Yeast two-hybrid strains containing pOAD- and pOBD2-based plasmids with HEX3 and SMT3 were a gift from Marissa Vignali (Yeast Resource Center, University of Washington). We initially transformed the yeast two-hybrid reporter strain PJ69–4α that contained the pOBD2-SMT3 bait plasmid with pOAD-HEX3. Subsequently, pOAD-HEX3 was subject to PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis to generate the series of SIM point mutants (see “Results”). The resulting pOAD-HEX3-SIM mutants (sim-A, sim-B, sim-C, sim-D, and sim-A/B) were transformed into the yeast bait strain, and SUMO (Smt3) interaction was determined on SD plates lacking adenine. All putative SIM mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Recombinant Protein Purification—Hex3, Slx8, and their derivatives were expressed as MBP fusions in BL21 Star™ (DE3) cells containing plasmid pRIL, which expresses several rare-codon tRNAs (a gift from Sean Prigge, JHSOM, MD). Proteins were affinity purified on an amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Rad52 was expressed and purified according to Song and Sung (19Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). T7-tagged Rad52 and the T7-Rad52-SUMO fusion were expressed as above and purified on a Talon Superflow column (BD Biosciences). Bacterially expressed His6-Ubc4 was purified as in Bays et al. (20Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and yeast SUMO was purified from bacteria carrying pQE30-TEV-SMT3gg according to Johnson and Gupta (21Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and Pulldown Assays—For SUMO pulldown experiments, 20 nm recombinant Hex3, Slx8, or MBP was incubated with SUMO-1-agarose (BostonBiochem) or, as a control, protein A-agarose (Repligen) in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Proteins pulled down with beads were washed in the same buffer except with 1% Triton X-100 and 200 mm NaCl. For Rad52/Rad52-SUMO co-immunoprecipitation with Hex3, 10 nm recombinant Hex3, Slx8, or MBP were incubated with 10 nm T7-tagged Rad52 or Rad52-SUMO in 1 ml of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 0.1 μm bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. After incubation with anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen), samples were precipitated by protein A-agarose. Precipitates were washed in the same buffer but containing 1 m NaCl.In Vitro Auto-ubiquitination Assay—Based on the procedures used in Swanson et al. (22Swanson R. Locher M. Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2660-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar), a typical 20-μl reaction for Slx8 and Hex3 auto-ubiquitination contained 0.4 μg of yeast Uba1 (BostonBiochem), 0.2 μg of human His6-Ubc4 (20Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), 2.5 μg of human recombinant ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 10 mm ATP, and 2 μm recombinant wild-type Hex3, Slx8, or their respective RING mutants in reaction buffer (2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5). Reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 2 h and were terminated by adding 3× SDS gel-loading buffer. The resulting ubiquitin conjugates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin monoclonal antibody (Covance). To detect the ubiquitinated His6-tagged proteins from the auto-ubiquitination assay, samples from the reaction were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and probed with an anti-His4 antibody (Qiagen).In Vitro Rad52 Ubiquitination Assay—Unless otherwise noted, Rad52 and Rad52-SUMO ubiquitination assays contained 0.3 μg of yeast Uba1, 0.2 μg of human His6-Ubc4, 1.2 μg of human recombinant ubiquitin, and 10 mm ATP in a 20-μl reaction as above. Different concentrations of recombinant Hex3, Slx8, and the respective RING mutants and of recombinant Rad52 or Rad52-SUMO were used between reactions and are reported in the figure legends. Ubiquitinated Rad52 and Rad52-SUMO were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rad52 (23Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28194-28197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) or anti-T7 (Novagen) antibodies. For SUMO competition assays, recombinant Hex3 and Slx8 were preincubated with 10 μg of recombinant yeast SUMO in reaction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5) for 30 min at 4 °C. Reactions were transferred to 30 °C and initiated by adding ubiquitinating enzymes and substrate. Reactions were terminated at the designated times by the addition of 3× SDS gel-loading buffer.In Vitro Sumoylation Assays—Following Johnson and Gupta (21Johnson E.S. Gupta A.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), a 50-μl reaction for the auto-sumoylation assay contained the following bacterially expressed recombinant yeast proteins: 2 μg of SUMO, 1.1 μg of Aos1/Uba2 dimer, and 0.5 μg of Ubc9. Concentrations of recombinant Hex3 and Slx8 were 2.5 and 5 μm, respectively. Reactions were performed with 5 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg of bovine serum albumin at 30 °C and were terminated by boiling in SDS-gel loading buffer. Samples were resolved by 6–12% gradient SDS-PAGE and analyzed by anti-SUMO immunoblotting (6Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).RESULTSHEX3 Is a High-copy Suppressor of the ulp1ts and ulp1Δ Mutants—ULP1 encodes an essential yeast desumoylating enzyme (7Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The Ulp1 protease has both an isopeptidase activity, which cleaves SUMO from substrate lysines, and a SUMO-processing activity that removes the last three amino acids (ATY) from the SUMO precursor. A free di-glycine sequence at the mature SUMO C terminus is necessary for its conjugation to substrates. Deconjugation of SUMO from one or more unknown proteins by Ulp1 is required for progression through the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (7Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar).We reasoned that sumoylation of such a critical substrate(s) could function to arrest cell cycle progression until certain other regulatory events had occurred, with subsequent activation or recruitment of Ulp1. Overexpression of the nonsumoylated substrate might, therefore, allow partial bypass of the ulp1ts block. High levels of other factors regulating G2/M progression or Ulp1 or of another SUMO protease might also suppress the ulp1ts arrest. We, therefore, screened a high-copy yeast genomic library in ulp1ts cells to identify suppressors of the conditional growth defect of ulp1ts cells. From ∼10,000 transformants, 8 clones capable of growth at 37 °C were isolated. Six carried plasmids with ULP1 inserts. The remaining two suppressing plasmids had identical inserts, and the relevant gene was determined to be HEX3 (SLX5).HEX3 encodes a RING-domain protein involved in genome maintenance (8Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang C. Roberts T.M. Yang J. Desai R. Brown G.W. DNA Repair (Amst). 2006; 5: 336-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Importantly, the ability of HEX3 to suppress the growth defect of ulp1ts at the nonpermissive temperature depended on co-expression of SMT3gg, encoding mature SUMO. Alone, neither HEX3 nor SMT3gg was able to rescue the ulp1ts mutant, but the combination of both genes on separate high-copy plasmids supported robust growth of ulp1ts cells at 37 °C (Fig. 1A, top panel). This implied that high dosage HEX3 specifically suppressed the SUMO isopeptidase defect of the ulp1ts mutant but did not restore SUMO-precursor processing. In support of this, provision of an SMT3aty expressing plasmid encoding the unprocessed SUMO precursor did not support growth of ulp1ts cells carrying high-copy HEX3 (Fig. 1B). Remarkably, high-copy of HEX3 was also capable of suppressing a complete deletion of ULP1 both at 30 °C (Fig. 1A, bottom panel) and 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, increased Hex3 expression did not suppress the temperature-sensitive growth defect of ulp2Δ cells. ULP2 encodes a second SUMO protease with distinct specificity and function (6Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2367-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).SLX8 encodes another RING-containing protein that forms a heterodimer with Hex3 (8Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yang L. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5541-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both polypeptides are required for DNA damage resistance and maintenance of genome stability (8Mullen J.R. Kaliraman V. Ibrahim S.S. Brill S.J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 103-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Zhang C. Roberts T.M. Yang J. Desai R. Brown G.W.

Although high-copy SLX8 was unable to suppress the ulp1ts growth defect at 37 °C (data not shown), deletion of SLX8 in a strain lacking ULP1 prevented high-copy HEX3 and SMT3gg from rescuing growth (Fig. 1C). These data are consistent with a role for both Hex3 and Slx8 in regulating SUMO-conjugate dynamics and suggest that Hex3, but not Slx8, is normally expressed at limiting levels.Comparison of SUMO conjugates in WT, hex3Δ, slx8Δ, and hex3Δ slx8Δ double mutant (ΔΔ) cells by anti-SUMO immunoblotting revealed significantly greater levels of high molecular mass sumoylated species (greater than ∼150 kDa, including material in the stacking gel) in the mutants relative to WT cells (Fig. 1D). Therefore, both Hex3 and Slx8 have a major role in limiting cellular SUMO-protein levels, consistent with previous observations (12Wang Z. Jones G.M. Prelich G. Genetics. 2006; 172: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Because loss of these RING proteins causes an increase in SUMO conjugates, it is unlikely that they are SUMO ligases. They could function as components or activators of a SUMO protease or could reduce sumoylated protein levels by some other mechanism. We explore these possibilities below.Recombinant Hex3 Binds to SUMO—Hex3 was previously reported to bind SUMO in yeast, and the interaction was insensitive to overexpressed Ulp1 protease (11Hannich J.T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 4102-4110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), suggesting that Hex3 might associate with SUMO in a noncovalent manner. To test this, purified recombinant Hex3 fused with MBP (Fig. 2B, left panel) was incubated with human SUMO-1 coupled to agarose beads or, as a control, protein A-agarose. Proteins pulled down with the different resins were eluted and analyzed by anti-MBP immunoblotting (Fig. 2C). This assay revealed that MBP-Hex3, but not MBP alone, was able to bind specifically to SUMO. These data suggest that the effect of Hex3 on cellular SUMO dynamics may be based on a direct interaction between Hex3 and the SUMO polypeptide.FIGURE 2Recombinant Hex3 interacts with SUMO in vitro. A, schematic of Hex3 and Slx8 proteins with Hex3 SIMs and RING domains highlighted. B, purification of MBP fusions of Hex3 and Slx8 from E. coli cell extracts. Proteins were harvested from multiple elutions with maltose-containing buffer. Elutions 1 and 2 (E1, E2) were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE. Size standards are indicated on the left. C, direct interaction between Hex3 and SUMO was determined by an in vitro pulldown assay. Recombinant MBP (New England Biolabs) and MBP-Hex3 were incubated with either SUMO-1-agarose or protein A-agarose. Precipitated proteins were run on 8% SDS-PAGE gels and detected by anti-MBP (Santa Cruz) immunoblotting (WB, lanes 3–6).

A typical SIM features a patch of aliphatic residues often neighboring a cluster of acidic amino acids (26Kerscher O. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, we identified SIM-A and SIM-B in Hex3 together with two additional weak matches (SIM-C and SIM-D) (Fig. 3A, WT column). To test the role of these putative SIMs in Hex3-SUMO interaction, we mutated each of them by substituting multiple hydrophobic residues with alanines (Fig. 3A, mutant column). Interactions between Hex3 mutants and SUMO were then tested by the yeast two-hybrid assay. Disruption of SIM-B, -C, or -D individually did not affect SUMO binding, but the SIM-A mutation partially impaired Hex3-SUMO interaction as measured by cell growth on SD-adenine plates. Simultaneous mutation of SIM-A and SIM-B greatly reduced Hex3-SUMO association by this assay (Fig. 3B). The simA/B in Hex3 did not cause reduced expression of the protein relative to WT Hex3 (supplemental Fig. S2A). We note that purified recombinant Hex3-simA/B could still bind SUMO in vitro (not shown), so additional SUMO binding sites must exist in the protein. These data indicate that Hex3 uses partially redundant SIMs, SIM-A and SIM-B, as well as additional elements to interact with SUMO and/or sumoylated proteins.FIGURE 3The interaction of Hex3 with SUMO involves two SIMs. A, potential Hex3 SIMs and their mutated sequences tested by yeast two-hybrid assays.

Although genetic mutations have been useful for identifying some molecular pathways, small molecule probes of regenerative pathways might offer some advantages, including the ability to disrupt pathway function with precise temporal control. However, a vertebrate regeneration model amenable to rapid throughput small molecule screening is not currently available. We report here the development of a zebrafish early life stage fin regeneration model and its use in screening for small molecules that modulate tissue regeneration. By screening 2000 biologically active small molecules, we identified 17 that specifically inhibited regeneration. These compounds include a cluster of glucocorticoids, and we demonstrate that transient activation of the glucocorticoid receptor is sufficient to block regeneration, but only if activation occurs during wound healing/blastema formation. In addition, knockdown of the glucocorticoid receptor restores regenerative capability to nonregenerative, glucocorticoid-exposed zebrafish. To test whether the classical anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids is responsible for blocking regeneration, we prevented acute inflammation following amputation by antisense repression of the Pu.1 gene. Although loss of Pu.1 prevents the inflammatory response, regeneration is not affected. Collectively, these results indicate that signaling from exogenous glucocorticoids impairs blastema formation and limits regenerative capacity through an acute inflammation-independent mechanism. These studies also demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting chemical genetics to define the pathways that govern vertebrate regeneration.

These studies also demonstrate the feasibility of exploiting chemical genetics to define the pathways that govern vertebrate regeneration. The promise of regenerative medicine is that therapies will be devised to promote the repair or replacement of damaged or diseased tissues and organs. This emerging field is approached from two distinct lines of attack. In recent years, stem cell-based models have been developed to generate a suite of differentiated cells for therapeutic applications. The use of high throughput chemical genetic screening to identify modulators of stem cell fate offers great promise (1Ding S. Schultz P.G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The alternative approach exploits the inherent regenerative capacity of non-mammalian models to define the molecular events that permit tissue regeneration (2Brockes J.P. Kumar A. Science. 2005; 310: 1919-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). There are several regenerative animal models, including salamanders, newts, zebrafish, hydra, and flatworms, that are established to evaluate tissue regeneration (3Fujisawa T. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Bader D. Oberpriller J.O. J. Morphol. 1978; 155: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Akimenko M.A. Mari-Beffa M.

What is currently lacking is the availability of a vertebrate regeneration model that is amenable to rapid throughput assessments. Zebrafish have the remarkable capability to regenerate their fins, optic nerve, scales, heart, and spinal cord (7Poss K.D. Keating M.T. Nechiporuk A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Adult caudal fin regeneration is the best studied model for dissecting the molecular signaling that controls regenerative growth and angiogenesis (7Poss K.D. Keating M.T. Nechiporuk A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 8Bayliss P.E. Bellavance K.L. Whitehead G.G. Abrams J.M. Aegerter S. Robbins H.S. Cowan D.B. Keating M.T. O'Reilly T. Wood J.M. Roberts T.M. Chan J. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Comparative genomics indicate significant genetic conservation between mammals and lower vertebrates, which begs the question: what are the molecular differences that permit tissue regeneration in zebrafish and make mammalian tissues recalcitrant to regeneration? Answers to this question will provide a path for comparative studies in mammals. Zebrafish recover the lost caudal fin tissue after amputation through a process of epimorphic regeneration, and this occurs in a stepwise manner with the formation of an epithelial wound cap, followed by blastema formation and finally the regenerative outgrowth (Fig. 1) (5Akimenko M.A. Mari-Beffa M. Becerra J. Geraudie J. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 190-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 7Poss K.D. Keating M.T. Nechiporuk A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). This complex regenerative process is orchestrated by sequential interactions between biomolecules and cells in a spatiotemporal manner. Global gene expression analysis on heart and fin regeneration in adult zebrafish illustrates the involvement of multiple signaling pathways mediated through the differential expression of hundreds of genes during this remarkable process (9Andreasen E.A. Mathew L.K. Tanguay R.L. Toxicol. Sci. 2006; 92: 254-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Schebesta M. Lien C.L. Engel F.B. Keating M.T. Sci.

The identification of the signaling molecules that control these interactions will offer avenues to rapidly advance the field of regenerative medicine. The characterization of key regulators such as fibroblast growth factor and Wnt as critical factors during regeneration emphasizes the likely involvement of multiple signaling pathways in fin regeneration (12Poss K.D. Shen J. Nechiporuk A. McMahon G. Thisse B. Thisse C. Keating M.T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 222: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13Stoick-Cooper C.L. Weidinger G. Riehle K.J. Hubbert C. Major M.B. Fausto N. Moon R.T. Development (Camb.). 2007; 134: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). This again underscores the importance of a comprehensive approach to identify the full repertoire of molecular players required for tissue regeneration. Although adult zebrafish regeneration models have proven useful, many of the molecular and genetic tools that are useful for embryonic and larval studies are not easily applied to adult stage animals (7Poss K.D. Keating M.T. Nechiporuk A. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 226: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Recent results indicate that these technical barriers may be overcome by using an early life stage regeneration model. Specifically, 2-day-old zebrafish larvae completely regenerate their fin primordia within 3 days following amputation (14Kawakami A. Fukazawa T. Takeda H. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 231: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Mathew L.K. Andreasen E.A. Tanguay R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Nakatani Y. Kawakami A. Kudo A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2007; 49: 145-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Because this life stage is inherently amenable to molecular and genetic manipulations such as transient and stable transgenics, genetic mutant screens, and chemical genetics, this model offers a powerful new way to identify novel regulators of tissue regeneration. In vivo high throughput small molecule screening has the potential to target any biological process (17Zon L.I. Peterson R.T. Nat. Rev.

S. A. 2000; 97: 12965-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar); however, this approach has not been applied in a vertebrate regenerative system. To probe tissue regeneration, an inhibitory screen was developed. The underlying premise is that if a chemical inhibits or modulates an essential molecular target, then regeneration will be impacted. The identification of the chemical target will thus help to reveal underlying molecular pathways that permit tissue regeneration. Previous larval fin regeneration studies demonstrated the feasibility of this general inhibitory approach; inhibition of fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 with SU5402 or activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor disrupted tissue regeneration (14Kawakami A. Fukazawa T. Takeda H. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 231: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Mathew L.K. Andreasen E.A. Tanguay R.L. Mol.

We report here for the first time an in vivo vertebrate regeneration assay that employs a rapid small molecule library screening to identify pathways essential for tissue regeneration. We also demonstrate that this regenerative platform is well suited to identify the molecular targets of small molecules and to define the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the chemical response. Screening for Inhibitors of Larval Fin Regeneration—Fertilized eggs were obtained from AB strain zebrafish (University of Oregon, Eugene, OR) for all of the experiments. All embryos were raised in our laboratory according to standard procedures. Two-day-old embryos were dechorionated and anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (tricaine). The larvae were laid on an agar plate, and the caudal fin primordia were amputated with a surgical blade just posterior to the notochord. Two amputated larvae were arrayed per well in 96-well plates containing 50 μl of E3 embryo buffer (5 mm NaCl, 0.17 mm KCl, 0.33 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm MgSO4). The small molecules (2,000 bioactives from MicroSource Discovery Systems, Gaylordsville, CT) were added individually to the test wells at a final concentration of 25 μm. The amputated larvae were incubated for 3 days at 28 °C. Three days postamputation (dpa) 2The abbreviations used are: dpa, days postamputation; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; dpf, days postfertilization; ANOVA, analysis of variance; MO, morpholino; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; hpa, hours postamputation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; qRT, quantitative real-time; GILZ, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper. the larvae were anesthetized and assessed visually to score regenerative progression. After the primary screen, beclomethasone dipropionate (beclomethasone, Sigma) was used as a prototype glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonist. For all functional studies, beclomethasone was used at 1 μm final concentration. Adult Zebrafish Study—Adult male zebrafish (AB strain) were pre-exposed for 1 day to vehicle or beclomethasone with waterborne concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.0005 mg/liter. The concentration used for the study reported here is 0.005 mg/liter (n = 6). After pre-exposure, the fish were anesthetized, and their caudal fins were surgically amputated. The fish were transferred back to the tanks and were continuously exposed to vehicle or beclomethasone until the end of the study. The exposure solutions were changed daily. Quantitative Real-time PCR—The larvae were amputated at 2 days postfertilization (dpf) and exposed to vehicle or beclomethasone, and the regenerating fin tissue was specifically isolated at 1 dpa. Total RNA was extracted from the regenerating fin tissue using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Three groups per treatment, each composed of 150 larval fins, were pooled to make an individual replicate. For RNA from whole embryo, the amputated larvae exposed to vehicle or beclomethasone at 2 dpf were sampled at 3 dpf. Total RNA was isolated from triplicate groups of whole embryos using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were quantitatively expressed as the -fold change in the mRNA levels between beclomethasone-exposed embryos and vehicle-exposed embryos after normalizing to β-actin abundance. The p values represent the significant difference of transcript level between groups as calculated using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's method (SigmaStat, Chicago, IL) (see Fig. 4). To quantify GR transcript morpholino knockdown, RNA was isolated from the control or GR morphants at 2 dpf (see Fig. 5C). The transcript levels were normalized to β-actin abundance. The p value represents significance as determined by one-way ANOVA. For all of the experiments, cDNA was synthesized from 3 μg of total RNA per group using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers in a 20-μl volume. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR was conducted using gene-specific primers with the Opticon-2 real-time PCR detection system (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). Briefly, 1 μl of cDNA was used for each PCR in the presence of SYBR Green using a DyNAmo SYBR Green qPCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland). Agarose gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 5C) and thermal denaturation (melt curve analysis) were conducted to ensure formation of specific products. Primer sequences used were as follows: FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5), 5′-CACGTTCACAAACACACTGC-3′,5′-ATCAAACGAACAAGCGGGTC-3′; glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), 5′-CGACTTGTTTATATGGGCTG-3′,5′-TCTTCAGACACCAACATGCC-3′; SRY-box-containing gene 9b (SOX9b), 5′-TGACGAGTTGTTCTCCAGAG-3′,5′-AGGCCACACGTCTATAACCC-3′; and GR, 5′-CAAATGGGCTAAAGCTCTGC-3′, 5′-TCTTCAACCCATCCTTCGGC-3′.FIGURE 5Activation of GR is required for inhibition of regeneration by beclomethasone.

B, the bold line at the intron-exon (I5-E6) boundary designates the gene sequence targeted with the GR splice variant MO. The arrows at E5 and E8 indicate the forward and reverse primers designed for qRT-PCR to analyze the splice-blocking efficiency.

A putative zebrafish GR ortholog was identified (GenBank™ accession number AB218424). Because there were three predicted transcripts based on alternative splicing, a MO was designed at an intron-exon boundary that was conserved between predicted transcripts. The sequence of GR splice variant MO was 5′-CTGCTTCATGTATTTTAGGGTTCCG-3′. The sequence of Pu.1 MO is 5′-GATATACTGATACTCCATTGGTGGT-3′ (Gene Tools). Morpholinos were diluted to 3 mm in 1× Danieau's solution (58 mm NaCl, 0.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.6 mm Ca(NO3)2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6) as described (44Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). A standard control morpholino (5′-CTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′, Gene Tools) was used as the control morpholino (Control-MO). Approximately 2 nl of the appropriate MO solution was microinjected into the embryos at the 1-2-cell stage. The 3′ end of the MOs was fluorescein-tagged to screen microinjection success at 24 hpf. The control and GR morphants at 2 dpf were amputated, exposed to vehicle or beclomethasone, and raised for 3 days at 28 °C. The control and Pu.1 morphants were amputated and allowed to grow for 3 days at 28 °C. In Situ Hybridization—Whole mount in situ hybridization was conducted on the regenerating fin at different time points as described previously (45Poss K.D. Shen J. Keating M.T. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 219: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 46Schier A.F. Neuhauss S.C. Helde K.A. Talbot W.S. Driever W.

Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation Analysis by Immunohistochemistry—The amputated larvae that were exposed to vehicle or beclomethasone were incubated with BrdUrd (Roche Applied Science) for 6 h starting from 6 h postamputation (hpa) or 24 hpa. The larvae were labeled with BrdUrd (10 mm) in a 96-well plate with one larva in each well at 28 °C. After 6 h of incubation with BrdUrd, the animals were euthanized with tricaine and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The fixed larvae were dehydrated with methanol and then stored in methanol at -20 °C. For performing immunohistochemistry, the larvae were rehydrated using a graded methanol/PBST (phosphate-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween- 20) series. The larvae were then treated with Proteinase K (10 μg/ml) in PBST for 20 min at room temperature and then rinsed several times with PBST. The larvae were refixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and then rinsed several times in water. This was followed by quick rinses in 2 n HCl, then incubation in 2 n HCl at room temperature for 1 h, and washing with PBST several times. The larvae were then blocked with 1% normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:100, G3G4, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) overnight at 4 °C. After four 30-min washes with PBST, the larvae were incubated with a secondary antibody (1:1000, Alexa 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 4 h at room temperature. The larvae were then washed four times for 30 min in PBST and visualized by epifluorescence microscopy. The BrdUrd-labeled fluorescent cells were quantified with the images using the Image-Pro Plus software program (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). Morphologic Characterization by Histological Analysis—The amputated larvae exposed to vehicle or beclomethasone were euthanized and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 1 dpa. The fixed larvae were postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide and embedded in Embed 812-Araldite 502 resin. Semithin serial sections were cut at 1 μm, stained with toluidine blue, and analyzed by light microscopy. Neutrophil and Macrophage Migration Assay—The Tg(BACmpo:gfp)i114 transgenic line larvae were anesthetized and amputated at 3 dpf as described above. At the time points indicated, amputated larvae were taken from predetermined wells, the numbers of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive neutrophils were counted (39Renshaw S.A. Loynes C.A. Trushell D.M. Elworthy S. Ingham P.W. Whyte M.K. Blood. 2006; 108: 3976-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), and in the same fish the number of neutral red positive macrophages were assessed. For macrophage count, the amputated larvae at 3 dpf were exposed to neutral red at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/ml for 4 h prior to assessment. The macrophages were stained red and were counted at the amputation site as illustrated in Fig. 9, C, D, G, and H. Development of Rapid Throughput Zebrafish Regeneration Assay—Because regeneration is accomplished by an orchestrated coordination of multiple pathways and signaling events, a vertebrate regeneration assay was developed to identify small molecules that specifically modulated tissue regeneration. To demonstrate the power of this approach, a 2000-member structurally diverse bioactive small molecule library was screened to identify inhibitors of regeneration. Two-dpf larvae were amputated, transferred to 96-well plates, and continuously exposed to individual chemicals. At 3 dpa, the larvae were microscopically imaged to assess regenerative progression. A total of 17 small molecules (∼0.8% of the library) inhibited tissue regeneration. These inhibitory chemicals comprised several different functional classes such as anti-inflammatory, keratolytic, cytochrome P-450 inhibitor, etc. Representative images of complete and impaired regeneration are depicted (Fig. 2, A and B). Although a number of small molecules produced overt toxicity at the test concentration (25 μm) leading to systemic edema by the end of the assay, these animals completely regenerated their fin tissue (Fig. 2C). This specificity indicates that a toxic response can be uncoupled from the regeneration response. Identification of Glucocorticoids as Modulators of Regeneration—The positive “hits” were of different chemical classes, and using structure-function analysis, a major cluster of compounds was identified as glucocorticoids (five of the hit compounds). Although the main focus of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using small molecules to probe tissue regeneration, we also wanted to demonstrate the ability to identify small molecule targets rapidly during early life stages. We selected glucocorticoids for further studies because this was the largest cluster of hits. Glucocorticoids consistently and specifically inhibited regeneration without inhibiting normal growth, creating a V-shaped fin (Fig. 3A). This characteristic morphology occurs because the tissue lateral to the amputation plane continues to grow and partially collapses around the amputation plane. Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones that exert most of their actions by binding the GR (24Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. J.

Biol. 2002; 83: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). From mammalian studies it is clear that there are several isoforms of GR because of differential splicing and alternative translation initiation sites, of which GRα and GRβ are the best-studied (26Schaaf M.J. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 83: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 27Lu N.Z. Cidlowski J.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Binding of glucocorticoid activates GRα transcriptional activity, leading to the initiation or repression of transcription, whereas GRβ is not able to bind ligands and has a dominant negative activity through inhibition of GRα transcriptional activity (29Oakley R.H. Jewell C.M. Yudt M.R. Bofetiado D.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27857-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical genomic model of GR activation, nongenomic activities have also been reported at high concentrations of glucocorticoids (30Croxtall J.D. van Hal P.T. Choudhury Q. Gilroy D.W. Flower R.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 31Goulding N.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2004; 4: 629-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To broadly analyze the mechanism of action from the positive hits, dose response studies were completed with selected glucocorticoids by measuring the length of maximum outgrowth. The length of maximum outgrowth is the distance from the center of the amputation plane to the tip of the regenerating fin (15Mathew L.K. Andreasen E.A. Tanguay R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the IC50 for regeneration ranged from 200 to 400 nm (Fig. 3B). Beclomethasone dipropionate has a potent inhibitory effect on regeneration at the lower nanomolar range; hence, this small molecule was selected for further experiments. Because the adult fin regeneration model is more widely studied, it was important to determine whether chemical hits identified in the larval screen would be predictive for the adult fin regeneration responses. Therefore, the regeneration response to glucocorticoid exposure on fin regeneration was also assessed in adult zebrafish. Similar to the larvae, beclomethasone exposure inhibited adult caudal fin regeneration, and small projection-like structures were observed at the plane of amputation (Fig. 3C). The similar inhibitory response suggested that a common underlying molecular target was targeted by this chemical. Beclomethasone Induces Expression of GR Target Genes—Because the IC50 of glucocorticoids for regeneration was in the nanomolar range, it is highly likely that the glucocorticoids are acting via activation of the GR. To test whether beclomethasone activates the GR pathway, three primary GR target genes were identified, including gilz, fkbp5, and sox9b (32Sekiya I. Koopman P. Tsuji K. Mertin S. Harley V. Yamada Y.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13845-13850Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To analyze the expression of these genes, qRT-PCR was conducted using RNA from the larval regenerating fin tissue at 1 dpa in the presence and absence of beclomethasone. All three genes were significantly induced in response to beclomethasone exposure, indicating that the GR is activated by glucocorticoids in this regeneration model (Fig. 4). Similarly, qRT-PCR analysis was performed in the whole embryo at 3 dpf after exposure to beclomethasone at 2 dpf, and the global expression of those genes was similar in pattern to the regenerating fin tissue (supplemental Fig. 1). These results suggest that beclomethasone is activating the GR and that the inhibitory effect on regeneration could be mediated through inappropriate GR activation. GR Activation Is Required for Beclomethasone to Inhibit Regeneration—To directly determine whether the GR was the molecular target of beclomethasone and to determine whether the GR was necessary for the glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of regeneration, a morph"

Although a biological clock exists not only in the hypothalamus but also in each peripheral tissue, the biological relevance of the peripheral clock remains to be elucidated. In this study we searched for clock-controlled genes in vascular endothelial cells using microarray technology. The expression of a total of 229 genes was up-regulated by CLOCK/BMAL2. Among the genes that we identified, we examined the thrombomodulin (TM) gene further, because TM is an integral membrane glycoprotein that is expressed primarily in vascular endothelial cells and plays a major role in the regulation of intravascular coagulation. TM mRNA and protein expression showed a clear circadian oscillation in the mouse lung and heart. Reporter analyses, gel shift assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses using the TM promoter revealed that a heterodimer of CLOCK and BMAL2 binds directly to the E-box of the TM promoter, resulting in TM promoter transactivation. Indeed, the oscillation of TM gene expression was abolished in clock mutant mice, suggesting that TM expression is regulated by the clock gene in vivo. Finally, the phase of circadian oscillation of TM mRNA expression was altered by temporal feeding restriction, suggesting TM gene expression is regulated by the peripheral clock system. In conclusion, these data suggest that the peripheral clock in vascular endothelial cells regulates TM gene expression and that the oscillation of TM expression may contribute to the circadian variation of cardiovascular events.

Thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism (PE), 3The abbreviations used are: PE, pulmonary embolism; AMI, acute myocardial infarction; TM, thrombomodulin; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; ZT, Zeitgeber time; HUVECs, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; GFP, green fluorescent protein; ChIP, chromatin Immunoprecipitation; clk, clock. cerebral infarction, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are major causes of death in developed countries. The onset of PE, cerebral infarction, and AMI shows apparent circadian variation and frequently occurs in the morning (1Colantonio D. Casale R. Abruzzo B.P. Lorenzetti G. Pasqualetti P. Am. J.

Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms of circadian variation of these disorders may lead to the development of methods that prevent the onset of thromboembolic events. The circadian variation of the onset of thromboembolic events is thought to be related to the biological clock. Recently, the molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been elucidated (4Gekakis N. Staknis D. Nguyen H.B. Davis F.C. Wilsbacher L.D. King D.P. Takahashi J.S. Weitz C.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1564-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). This system is composed of several clock genes, including clock, period, bmal, and cry. The heterodimer of CLOCK and BMAL binds to the E-box sites upstream of the period and cry genes and transactivates these genes. The PERIOD and CRY proteins inhibit their own transactivation by CLOCK and BMAL, resulting in the formation of a negative feedback loop. This negative feedback loop persists for ∼24 h, which corresponds to circadian rhythm (5Dunlap J.C. Cell. 1999; 96: 271-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar). The biological clock regulates the expression of downstream target genes, clock-controlled genes, and modulates the cellular responses to these downstream genes. The central biological clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus (6Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1998; 392: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we and other researchers have reported that clock genes are also expressed in peripheral organs and cells and that their expression shows circadian oscillation, suggesting the existence of a peripheral clock (7Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 8Oishi K. Sakamoto K. Okada T. Nagase T. Ishida N. Neurosci.

Approximately 8–10% of the total number of genes expressed in mouse heart and liver were found to show a circadian expression pattern (10Storch K.F. Lipan O. Leykin I. Viswanathan N. Davis F.C. Wong W.H. Weitz C.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The peripheral clock is thought to regulate the expression of organ-specific, clock-controlled genes directly or indirectly through the expression of core clock genes such as clock and bmal (10Storch K.F. Lipan O. Leykin I. Viswanathan N. Davis F.C. Wong W.H. Weitz C.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). The circadian expression of clock genes in the cardiovascular system has been demonstrated as well (11Durgan D.J. Hotze M.A. Tomlin T.M. Egbejimi O. Graveleau C. Abel E.D. Shaw C.A. Bray M.S.

Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of this expression remains to be elucidated. Previously, we identified a clock gene in vascular endothelial cells, CLIF, which is also termed BMAL2 (12Maemura, K., de la Monte, S. M., Chin, M. T., Layne, M. D., Hsieh, C. M., Yet, S. F., Perrella, M. A., and Lee, M. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36847–36851Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found that CLOCK and BMAL2 in peripheral tissue may directly regulate the circadian expression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene, contributing to the morning onset of AMI (17Andreotti F. Kluft C. Chronobiol. Int. 1991; 8: 336-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Braunwald E. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1604-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Maemura K.

Hematol. 1998; 68: 371-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in this study we screened for clock-controlled genes in vascular endothelial cells using microarray technology. A total of 229 genes were up-regulated by CLOCK and BMAL2. Among them, we focused on the endothelial membrane protein, thrombomodulin (TM), since TM plays an important role in the regulation of blood coagulation processes by exerting anti-coagulant effects through the activation of protein C (21Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 22Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 23Wouwer M. Collen D. Conway E.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that TM mRNA and protein expression have a circadian pattern and that a heterodimer of CLOCK and BMAL2 binds to the E-box upstream of the TM promoter and transactivates promoter activity. In addition, these results suggest that the circadian rhythm of TM gene expression is under the control of circadian clock molecules. Animals—This study was approved by the Animal Committee of University of Tokyo. Clock mutant mice in BALB/c and C57BL/6J backgrounds were supplied by J. S. Takahashi (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) (24Vitaterna M.H. King D.P. Chang A.M. Kornhauser J.M. Lowrey P.L. McDonald J.D. Dove W.F. Pinto L.H. Turek F.W. Takahashi J.S. Science. 1994; 264: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Clock mutant mice carry an internal deletion of 51 amino acids in the C-terminal activation domain of the CLOCK protein, which results in a dominant negative mutation. Thus, Clock homozygotes fail to express persistent circadian rhythms when maintained in constant darkness. A breeding colony was established by further backcrossing with Jcl:ICR mice as described previously (25Oishi K. Miyazaki K. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Male BALB/c mice of 8–12 weeks of age were maintained under a 12-h:12-h light-dark cycle. Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 refers to light on, and ZT 12 refers to light off. ZT 0–12 is the subjective light phase, and 12–24 h ZT is the subjective dark phase. Under the restrictive feeding condition, mice were allowed access to food for 4 h from ZT5 to ZT9 for 10 consecutive days (days 7–16) (26Oishi K. Kasamatsu M. Ishida N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids and Recombinant Adenoviruses—The TM reporter, pGL3TM1562 (–1562 to +140), was constructed as described previously (27Horie S. Ishii H. Matsumoto F. Kusano M. Kizaki K.

Blood. 2003; 101: 4765-4774Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The fragment from –1370 to 958 was removed by SmaI, yielding pGL3TM1562 (deletion 1370–958). Successive deletion of the 5′-flanking region was performed using restriction enzymes KpnI and Blp1, which yielded pGL3TM1379 (–1379 to +140), or KpnI and SmaI, which yielded pGL3TM958 (–958 to +140). pGL3TM1562mut is identical to pGL3TM1562, except that the E-box site (bp –1473 to –1468) was mutated from CACGTG to CTCGAG. The mammalian expression vectors for BMAL1 (phBMAL1), CLIF/BMAL2 (phBMAL2), and CLOCK (phCLOCK) were constructed as described previously (12Maemura, K., de la Monte, S. M., Chin, M. T., Layne, M. D., Hsieh, C. M., Yet, S. F., Perrella, M. A., and Lee, M. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36847–36851Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were prepared as described previously (29Maemura K. Hsieh C.M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and those expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), CLOCK, or BMAL2 were designated as AdCMV.GFP, AdCMV.CLOCK, or AdCMV.BMAL2, respectively. Cell Cultures—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). A hemangioendothelioma cell line was obtained from ATCC (ATCC CRL-2586, Manassas, VA). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were obtained as primary cultures. Hemangioendothelioma cell lines and BAECs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (Sigma). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from HUVECs using the RNeasy method (Qiagen KK, Tokyo, Japan) or from frozen tissues using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo, Japan). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (29Maemura K. Hsieh C.M. Jain M.K. Fukumoto S. Layne M.D. Liu Y. Kourembanas S. Yet S.F. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31565-31570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Whole tissue protein was extracted using extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS) under nonreducing conditions and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The primary antibody used was rabbit anti-rat thrombomodulin polyclonal antibody (1:200, American Diagnostica Inc, Stamford, CT). Rabbit anti-β-actin polyclonal antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz) was used to correct for differences in protein loading. Transient Transfection Assay—Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (12Maemura, K., de la Monte, S. M., Chin, M. T., Layne, M. D., Hsieh, C. M., Yet, S. F., Perrella, M. A., and Lee, M. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36847–36851Google Scholar). Data for each construct are presented as the means ± S.E. Microarray Analysis—Microarray analysis was performed using ∼12,000 human cDNAs (human 1 cDNA Microarray, G4100A, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (30DeRisi J. Penland L. Brown P.O. Bittner M.L. Meltzer P.S. Ray M. Chen Y. Su Y.A. Trent J.M. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 457-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar, 31Iyer V.R. Eisen M.B. Ross D.T. Schuler G. Moore T.

HUVECs were infected with AdCMV. CLOCK and AdCMV.BMAL2 or AdCMV.GFP. Forty-eight hours after infection total RNA was isolated and applied to microarray analysis. Fluorescence labeling and hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction. The intensity of each signal was quantified by sequential excitation of the two fluorophores with a scanning laser read at an appropriate wavelength for each emission (GMS417 Array scanner, Affimetrix Santa Clara, CA). Expression data were analyzed using Imagene ver4.1 (Biodiscovery, El Segundo, CA). Differential expression values were demonstrated as the log ratios of the dye-normalized green and red channel signals. This hybridization experiment was performed in duplicate with dye swap design method. A threshold of a 2.5-fold change was used for comparison. In Vitro Transcription and Translation/Gel Mobility Shift Assay—In vitro transcription and translation and gel mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (32Takeda N. Maemura K. Imai Y. Harada T. Kawanami D. Nojiri T. Manabe I. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 2004; 95: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The sequence of the double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the E-box site (5′-GGTGCGTGTCTGTCGCACGTGGCAGACGCCATACTC-3′) was derived from the sequence of the TM promoter corresponding to positions –1488 to –1453. For supershift analysis, 1 μg of anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen) was used for the binding reaction. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were carried out as described previously after administrating adenovirus expressing CLOCK and Myc-tagged BMAL2 (10 multiplicity of infection) into HUVECs (33Manabe I. Owens G.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 823-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To precipitate Myc-tagged BMAL2, anti-c-Myc-agarose (Santa Cruz, sc-40, 9E10) was used. PCR of the TM promoter around the E-box (–1525∼–1364) was performed using immunoprecipitated chromatin with the following pair of oligonucleotide primers: 5′-TGCAGGTCAGTCCAGTCCAGCCCGGCCCAC-3′ and 5′-GCACAGAGTCCTCCTTCTGGGGTTGGAAGC-3′. For the negative control, PCR of the 3′-flanking region of the TM gene (+4062∼+4298) was performed with the following pair of oligonucleotide primers: 5′-AAGAAGTGTCTGGGCTGGGACGGACAGGAG-3′ and 5′-AGCAGTCGTGCTCGACGCACTGGCTGCCAC-3′. A 1:1000 dilution of input DNA served as a positive control for PCR amplification. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was used for quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (16Young M.E. Razeghi P. Taegtmeyer H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Primers and probes were obtained and used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The level of 18 S rRNA was quantitatively measured in each sample to control for sample-to-sample differences in RNA concentration. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired samples or one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison of parameters. p < 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Circadian Oscillation of the Expression of Clock Genes Was Induced in Cultured Vascular Endothelial Cells—First, we confirmed the existence of an intrinsic clock system in endothelial cells. Highly concentrated serum stimulates the circadian expression of clock genes in cultured fibroblasts (7Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Thus, we added a 50% concentration of serum to cultures of hemangioendothelioma cells and analyzed the expression of clock genes. Serum stimulation induced the circadian expression of clock genes, suggesting that vascular endothelial cells have an intrinsic clock system (Fig. 1). Although similar results were obtained with HUVECs (supplemental Fig. S1), the amplitude of the oscillation was smaller. This reduced amplitude may be due to the high concentration of serum and several growth factors required for maintenance of HUVECs. Downstream Clock-controlled Genes in Vascular Endothelial Cells—To identify the downstream target genes of the peripheral clock in endothelial cells, we screened for genes whose expression was up-regulated by CLOCK and BMAL2 using cDNA microarray techniques. We infected HUVECs with AdCMV.Clock and AdCMV.BMAL2 and isolated RNA after 48 h. As a reference, we used RNA from HUVECs that had been infected with AdCMV.GFP. Differential hybridization was performed on microarray slides containing ∼12,000 spots of human cDNA using labeled RNA from HUVECs. The expression of a total of 229 genes was up-regulated including Period2, Rev-erbα, wee-1, and Pai-1, which have been identified previously as clock genes or clock-controlled genes. The 229 identified genes included 14 genes that encode secreted proteins, 20 genes that encode membrane proteins, and 20 genes that encode transcription factors. These 229 genes are listed in the supplemental table. Among these genes we observed that TM expression was up-regulated by CLOCK and BMAL2. TM is expressed primarily in vascular endothelial cells and plays an important role in regulating the blood coagulation process (23Wouwer M. Collen D. Conway E.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We further examined the molecular mechanisms by which TM is up-regulated by Clock and BMAL2. The analysis of other genes will be described elsewhere. 4N. Takeda, K. Maemura, and R. Nagai, manuscript in preparation. Thrombomodulin mRNA and Protein Show Circadian Expression That Is Regulated by CLOCK and BMAL2—To confirm that TM expression is under the direct control of CLOCK and BMAL2, we performed Northern blot analysis using RNA from infected HUVECs and demonstrated that the overexpression of CLOCK and BMAL2 resulted in an increase in TM mRNA levels (Fig. 2, A and B). This induction was determined to be specific because infection by the same titer of control adenovirus, AdCMV.GFP, did not result in an increase the TM mRNA levels. These results indicate that TM mRNA is up-regulated by CLOCK and BMAL2 in vascular endothelial cells. To examine whether TM mRNA expression shows circadian oscillation, we performed quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA extracted from the mouse heart and lung. TM mRNA in the mouse lung and heart exhibited apparent circadian expression with the highest expression levels occurring at 18 ZT and the lowest expression levels occurring at 6 ZT (Fig. 2, C and D). TM protein expression in the lung also showed circadian oscillation (Fig. 2E). We did not detect TM protein expression in the heart by Western blotting, which may be due to the reduced abundance of TM mRNA in the heart compared with that of the lung. Co-expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 or -2 Transactivates the Thrombomodulin Promoter—To further elucidate the mechanism by which CLOCK and BMAL2 increase the TM mRNA level, we used a reporter plasmid, pGL3TM1562, that contains a 1.6-kilobase fragment of the human TM promoter. This reporter plasmid construct was co-transfected into BAECs together with the human CLOCK expression plasmid, phCLOCK, and the human BMAL1 or BMAL2 expression plasmid, phBMAL1 or phBMAL2. CLOCK, BMAL1, or BMAL2 alone did not induce TM promoter activation. However, the co-expression of CLOCK and BMAL1 or of CLOCK and BMAL2 increased TM promoter activity by about 3-fold (Fig. 3A). BMAL1 and BMAL2 showed similar activity with regard to TM promoter activation. We found two CACGTG-type E-box elements (Distal E-box at –1468 and Proximal E-box at –1009 from the transcription start site) within the TM promoter sequences, which act as putative binding sites of CLOCK and BMAL1 or BMAL2. Deletion of bp –1562 to –1379 in the TM promoter markedly diminished the induction of TM promoter activity by CLOCK and BMAL2, suggesting that the Distal E-box at –1468, but not the Proximal E-box at –1009, is important for transactivation of the TM promoter (Fig. 3B). To determine whether CLOCK and BMAL2 transactivate the TM promoter by binding to Distal E-box site, we constructed a mutant TM promoter with 2-bp mutations at –1472 and –1469 (CACGTG to CTCGAG). A reporter plasmid harboring this mutated site (pGL3TM1562mut) was transfected into BAECs. Mutation of the Distal E-box site abolished the transactivation of the TM promoter by CLOCK and BMAL2 (Fig. 3C). Heterodimer of CLOCK and BMAL2 Binds to the E-box of the TM Promoter—To examine whether the heterodimer of CLOCK and BMAL2 binds directly to Distal E-box, we performed gel mobility shift assays using in vitro translated CLOCK and BMAL2 proteins and a labeled probe containing the E-box element. In the presence of both the CLOCK and BMAL2 proteins, DNA binding activity was detected (Fig. 4A). Binding was attenuated by the addition of an unlabeled specific competitor containing endogenous E-box but not by an unlabeled competitor containing mutated E-box with 2-bp mutations. The in vitro translated BMAL2 protein was Myc-tagged. We performed supershift analysis using anti-Myc antibody. The addition of 1 μg of anti-Myc antibody in this reaction mixture interfered with binding of the heterodimer (Fig. 4A). To further examine the association of CLOCK and BMAL2 with the region around the E-box of the TM gene (–1525 ∼–1364) in vivo, we performed ChIP assays using HUVECs expressing CLOCK and Myc-tagged BMAL2 or β-galactosidase as a control (Fig. 4B). ChIP was performed using anti-Myc antibody and analyzed by PCR amplification of total DNA before immunoprecipitation, after nonspecific immunoprecipitation of DNA, or after specifically immunoprecipitating DNA. For the negative control, the 3′-flanking region of the TM gene (+4062∼+4298) that contains no E-box (-like) element was amplified. The region around the E-box of the TM gene was amplified in DNA recovered from a ChIP reaction with anti-Myc antibody performed on chromatin lysates from cells expressing CLOCK and Myc-tagged BMAL2 protein but not from control lysates. These data suggest that a heterodimer of CLOCK and BMAL2 associates with the region around the E-box of the TM gene in vivo. Oscillation of Thrombomodulin mRNA Expression Is Attenuated in Clock Mutant Mice—To examine whether TM expression is truly regulated by CLOCK in vivo, we analyzed the level of TM expression every 6 h during a 24-h period in wild-type mice and clock mutant mice, which have an impaired clock system. In wild-type mice, the TM mRNA showed clear cyclic expression. However, in clock mutant mice, the oscillation of TM mRNA expression was attenuated, suggesting that TM gene expression is regulated by clock in vivo (Fig. 5). Restrictive Feeding Affects the Circadian Oscillation of TM mRNA Expression in the Lung—Temporal feeding restriction was found to induce a phase-shift of circadian gene expression in peripheral tissues, leaving the phase of cyclic gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus unchanged (34Damiola F. Le Minh N. Preitner N. Kornmann B. Fleury-Olela F. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2950-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). To determine whether TM gene expression is regulated by the peripheral clock, we examined the effect of restrictive feeding on TM expression. Under the conditions where mice could access the food freely (ad libitum), the cyclic expressions of clock genes (Per2) and TM mRNA was sustained. However, under scheduled restrictive feeding, the phases of circadian expression of Per2 and TM were affected, suggesting that TM gene expression is regulated by the peripheral clock (Fig. 6). In this study we searched for clock-controlled genes using microarray analysis and found that TM is a clock-controlled gene expressed in vascular endothelial cells. The central biological clock is located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the hypothalamus (6Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1998; 392: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recent evidence demonstrated the existence of a peripheral biological clock in each peripheral tissue, including the heart and vasculature. The central clock regulates a peripheral clock in each organ or tissue through a neurohormonal network (35Schibler U. Nature. 2000; 404 (and 27–28): 25Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, the biological relevance of the peripheral clock remains to be elucidated. To elucidate the biological significance of the peripheral clock, genes whose expression is regulated by the peripheral clock need to be identified. In addition, we need to clarify whether the peripheral clocks are altered under pathological conditions and whether the impaired biological clock is associated with the development of diseases (36Young M.E. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1-H16Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Previously, as the first step to address these issues, we examined several genes as candidates of clock-controlled genes and found that PAI-1 expression is under the control of the clock genes, Clock and Bmal1/2 (12Maemura, K., de la Monte, S. M., Chin, M. T., Layne, M. D., Hsieh, C. M., Yet, S. F., Perrella, M. A., and Lee, M. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36847–36851Google Scholar). Because PAI-1 plays a crucial role in controlling fibrinolytic activity, the circadian oscillation of plasma PAI-1 activity partially explains the predominate occurrence of thromboembolic events in the morning (17Andreotti F. Kluft C. Chronobiol. Int. 1991; 8: 336-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 18Braunwald E. Circulation. 1995; 91: 1604-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Maemura K. Layne M.D. Watanabe M. Perrell M.A. Nagai R. Lee M.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 947: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 20Yamamoto K. Saito H. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 68: 371-385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among cardiovascular functions, vascular endothelial function has been well documented to show circadian oscillation (37Viswambharan H. Carvas J.M. Antic V. Marecic A. Jud C. Zaugg C.E. Ming X.F. Montani J.P. Albrecht U. Yang Z. Circulation. 2007; 115: 2188-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). For example, healthy individuals exhibit reduced endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the morning (38Otto M.E. Svatikova A. Barretto R.B. Santos S. Hoffmann M. Khandheria B. Somers V. Circulation. 2004; 109: 2507-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial cells prevent thrombogenesis, and the incidence of thromboembolic events, including pulmonary thromboembolism and AMI, exhibits morning peaks (1Colantonio D. Casale R. Abruzzo B.P. Lorenzetti G. Pasqualetti P. Am. J. Cardiol. 1989; 64: 403-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 2Muller J.E. Stone P.H. Turi Z.G. Rutherford J.D. Czeisler C.A. Parker C. Poole W.K. Passamani E. Roberts R. Robertson T. Sobel B.E. Willerson J.T. Braunwald E. N. Engl. J. Med. 1985; 313: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Moreover, the expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor gene shows circadian oscillation, implying the presence of a circadian rhythm in angiogenic processes in tumors (39Koyanagi S. Kuramoto Y. Nakagawa H. Aramaki H. Ohdo S. Soeda S. Shimeno H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7277-7283PubMed Google Scholar). The internal biological clock is thought to play an important role in circadian oscillation of endothelial functions; however, the precise mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In this study we searched for clock-controlled genes in vascular endothelial cells and demonstrated that TM expression is under the control of the clock genes, Clock and Bmal1/2. The oscillation of TM mRNA expression was abolished in clock mutant mice, suggesting that TM expression is regulated by CLOCK in vivo. Moreover, the phase of circadian expression of TM was affected by scheduled restrictive feeding, implying cyclic TM gene expression was regulated by the peripheral clock. BMAL2, as well as BMAL1, forms a heterodimer with CLOCK and transactivates the promoter activity of clock-controlled genes by direct binding to the E-box of their promoter sequences. The influence of either BMAL1 or BMAL2 on clock-controlled gene expression in vivo is thought to depend on the tissue or cell types. Cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate and blood pressure, show circadian variation. At the molecular level, the cardiovascular system has its own internal clock system (12Maemura, K., de la Monte, S. M., Chin, M. T., Layne, M. D., Hsieh, C. M., Yet, S. F., Perrella, M. A., and Lee, M. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 36847–36851Google Scholar, 13Nonaka H. Emoto N. Ikeda K. Fukuya H. Rohman M.S. Raharjo S.B. Yagita K. Okamura H. Yokoyama M. Circulation. 2001; 104: 1746-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the healthy state the clock system sustains cardiovascular function (15Rudic R.D. McNamara P. Reilly D. Grosser T. Curtis A.M. Price T.S. Panda S. Hogenesch J.B. FitzGerald G.A. Circulation. 2005; 112: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, in a pathological state, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, the circadian expression of several clock genes and genes encoding cardioprotective proteins, including atrial natriuretic polypeptide is attenuated (16Young M.E. Razeghi P. Taegtmeyer H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the peripheral clock is affected in damaged tissue. Furthermore, the clock system plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis. Mice carrying a mutation in the clock gene (clk/clk) show impaired circadian rhythm (24Vitaterna M.H. King D.P. Chang A.M. Kornhauser J.M. Lowrey P.L. McDonald J.D. Dove W.F. Pinto L.H. Turek F.W. Takahashi J.S. Science. 1994; 264: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). In a recent report, clock mutant mice were shown to be susceptible to developing a metabolic disorder that resembled metabolic syndrome in humans (40Turek F.W. Joshu C. Kohsaka A. Lin E. Ivanova G. McDearmon E. Laposky A. Losee-Olson S. Easton A. Jensen D.R. Eckel R.H. Takahashi J.S. Bass J. Science. 2005; 308: 1043-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar). These results suggest that an impaired biological clock is associated with the development of diseases. Studies using genetically manipulated mice that have a tissue-specific impairment of the clock system will clarify the importance of the peripheral clock, separate from that of the central clock. Regarding the circadian expression of the TM gene, the phase of circadian TM protein expression is similar to that of its mRNA level. TM protein is thought to be produced soon after transcription of the TM gene (41Masamura K. Oida K. Kanehara H. Suzuki J. Horie S. Ishii H. Miyamori I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, the half-life of TM protein is ∼8 h in vitro (42Lentz S.R. Tsiang M. Sadler J.E. Blood. 1991; 77: 542-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to the circadian regulation of its transcription, there may be other mechanisms such as degradation processes that account for the oscillation of TM protein levels. One unresolved question concerns the biological significance of circadian TM expression. The times of the peak and trough expression of the TM gene were similar to those of PAI-1. Thrombin and PAI-1 act cooperatively to accelerate fibrin accumulation by inducing fibrin formation as well as inhibiting the degradation processes. TM exerts an opposite effect to PAI-1 by inhibiting the function of thrombin. Moreover, the complex of TM and thrombin activates protein C, which has an inhibitory effect on PAI-1 activity (21Esmon C.T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 946-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 22Sadler J.E. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 23Wouwer M. Collen D. Conway E.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). One possibility is that TM may protect the endothelium against the thrombogenic activity of PAI-1. In clinical studies, members of families carrying a mutation in the TM gene showed an increased risk of thromboembolic diseases including PE and AMI (43Ohlin A.K. Marlar R.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Doggen C.J. Kunz G. Rosendaal F.R. Lane D.A. Vos H.L. Stubbs P.J. Cats MangerV. Ireland H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Accordingly, impairment of TM function leads to an imbalance between fibrinolytic and thrombogenic activities and may induce thromboembolic events. In contrast, TM may promote blood coagulation through enhancement of the inhibition of thrombus lysis, since the protein functions as the activator of thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (procar-boxypeptidase U) under the presence of a high thrombin concentration on the local vascular vessels (45Mutch N.J. Thomas L. Moore N.R. Lisiak K.M. Booth N.A. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2007; 5: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 46Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of circadian expression of TM in cardiovascular diseases. In conclusion, these data suggest that the peripheral clock in vascular endothelial cells regulates TM gene expression, and the circadian oscillation of TM expression may contribute to the circadian variation of cardiovascular events. Elucidation of the biological relevance of the peripheral clock of the heart and vasculature will provide new insights into the development as well as the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Although they belong to basically tropical rain-forest genera, all four types have now been discovered growing natu rally in the vicinity of Highlands, North Carolina, as clones on shady, damp rocks. Their sporophytes were rare or absent. The gametophytes are now identified as Grammitis nimbata (Jenm.) Proctor, Grammitidaceae; Hymenophyllum tunbridg ense (L.)

Identifi cation of the Grammitis was facilitated by the presence of some juvenile or dwarfed sporophytes; this constitutes the first report of this species, genus, and family for temperate North America. Growth and spread of fern gametophytes independently of, and distant from, the corresponding sporophytes is a novel phenomenon which should be investigated in other parts of the world."
https://openalex.org/W2065033830,"The motility of keratinocytes is an essential component of wound closure and the development of epidermal tumors. In vitro, the specific motile behavior of keratinocytes is dictated by the assembly of laminin-332 tracks, a process that is dependent upon α6β4 integrin signaling to Rac1 and the actin-severing protein cofilin. Here we have analyzed how cofilin phosphorylation is regulated by phosphatases (slingshot (SSH) or chronophin (CIN)) downstream of signaling by α6β4 integrin/Rac1 in human keratinocytes. Keratinocytes express all members of the SSH family (SSH1, SSH2, and SSH3) and CIN. However, expression of phosphatase-dead versions of all three SSH proteins, but not dominant inactive CIN, results in phosphorylation/inactivation of cofilin, changes in actin cytoskeleton organization, loss of cell polarity, and assembly of aberrant arrays of laminin-332 in human keratinocytes. SSH activity is regulated by 14-3-3 protein binding, and intriguingly, 14-3-3/α6β4 integrin protein interaction is required for keratinocyte migration. We wondered whether 14-3-3 proteins function as regulators of Rac1-mediated keratinocyte migration patterns. In support of this hypothesis, inhibition of Rac1 results in an increase in 14-3-3 protein association with SSH. Thus, we propose a novel mechanism in which α6β4 integrin signaling via Rac1, 14-3-3 proteins, and SSH family members regulates cofilin activation, cell polarity, and matrix assembly, leading to specific epidermal cell migration behavior.

The role α6β4 integrin plays in the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix has been well elucidated (1Litjens S.H. Kim J.M. Sonnenberg A.

The latter data have led to the notion that the primary function of α6β4 integrin is to mediate stable anchorage of cells to matrix, a property that would antagonize cell migration (1Litjens S.H.

In this study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which Rac1 activity leads to dephosphorylation of cofilin and the specification of migration behavior in keratinocytes. Previous data in neuronal cells have suggested that Rac1 activity leads to cofilin dephosphorylation through the positive regulation of LIM kinase (23Edwards D.C. Kim L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat.

The SSH1CS and SSH3CS/pENTR clones were used in a site-directed recombination reaction to place these cDNAs into the pAD/CMV/V5-DEST vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with sequences encoding the V5 tag, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The wild type SSH2 and SSH2CS cDNAs each contained an in-frame c-Myc tag, and these fusion constructs were placed into the pAD/CMV/V5-DEST. The plasmid encoding dominant inactive CIN (CIN D/N) was kindly provided by Dr. Gary Bokoch (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The CIN D/N cDNA was subcloned into the polylinker of pENTR4 and subsequently placed into the pAD/CMV/V5-DEST. Each of the adenoviral expression clones was introduced into 293A cells by Lipofectamine-mediated transfection.

Briefly, cells were plated onto uncoated 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) 18-24 h prior to cell motility assays. Cells were viewed on a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). Images were taken at 2-min intervals over 2 h, and cell motility behavior was analyzed by a MetaMorph Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corp., Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA). Motility assays were performed a minimum of three times. For migration on preformed matrices, keratinocytes were allowed to adhere to uncoated 35-mm glass-bottomed culture dishes overnight.

The plates were washed extensively with water and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. Keratinocytes infected with various adenoviruses were plated directly onto the isolated matrix, allowed to adhere for 2-4 h, and imaged over an additional period of 2 h as described above.

For immunoprecipitation analyses, cells treated with or without Rac1 inhibitor were extracted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm NaOV3 supplemented with the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × g. One-tenth of the lysate was saved as a loading control in immunoblotting studies. For immunoprecipitation of SSH1 and SSH3, anti-V5-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich) were added to the lysate and incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C on a rocking platform. Immunoprecipitation of SSH2 was performed as described above, except with anti-Myc-conjugated beads (Sigma-Aldrich). The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation. Following the last wash, a sample buffer (6% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5) was added to the bead pellet. The sample was boiled for 10 min, processed for SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and processed for immunoblotting as above.

SSH Proteins Are Expressed in Keratinocytes and Regulate Cofilin Phosphorylation—The SSH family of phosphatases and the phosphatase CIN are known to regulate cofilin activity (34Niwa R. Kim K.

To assess whether the SSHs and/or CIN protein might regulate the phosphorylation state of cofilin in human keratinocytes, we first assayed whether these proteins are expressed in epidermal cells. Fig. 1 shows Western blot analyses of an extract of human keratinocytes probed with antibodies specific for each of the three members of the SSH family (SSH1, SSH2, and SSH3) and CIN. Human keratinocytes express all three SSH family members (Fig. 1, lanes 1-3). CIN expression is also seen in these cells (lane 4). We next investigated which of these proteins regulates cofilin activity using a molecular genetic approach. Human keratinocytes were infected with adenovirus encoding phosphatase-dead (CS) SSH family members (SSH1CS, SSH2CS, and SSH3CS) or adenovirus encoding dominant inactive CIN (CIN D/N). Expression of the phosphatase-dead SSH proteins has been shown to inhibit endogenous SSH phosphatase activity (34Niwa R. Kim K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T. Cell. 2002; 108: 233-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 36Ohta Y. Kim K. Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohashi K. Muramoto A. Shima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K.

The SSH1CS and SSH3CS proteins were tagged with the V5 epitope while SSH2CS was tagged with the c-Myc epitope. Western blotting was used to confirm expression of each of the phosphatase-dead mutants as well as the dominant inactive CIN in the infected keratinocytes (Fig. 2A). At 48 h after infection of each of our cell populations, we assayed the phosphorylation level of cofilin. Expression of the CIN D/N protein had no effect on the levels of phosphorylated cofilin when compared with controls (Fig. 2B). In sharp contrast, phospho-cofilin levels in keratinocytes overexpressing SSH1CS, SSH2CS, or SSH3CS were increased more than 2-fold over that observed in control cells (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results suggest that the SSH family of phosphatases and not the phosphatase CIN regulates cofilin phosphorylation in human epidermal cells.FIGURE 2Cofilin activity is regulated by SSH proteins and not CIN in human keratinocytes. A, extracts of human keratinocytes infected with adenovirus encoding phosphatase-dead V5-tagged SSH1CS, c-Myc-tagged SSH2CS, V5-tagged SSH3CS, or dominant inactive CIN (CIN D/N) were processed for Western immunoblotting and then probed with antibodies that recognize the V5 epitope (lanes 1 and 3), the c-Myc epitope (lane 2), or with an antibody against CIN (lane 4). Samples in lanes 1-3 were processed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, whereas the sample in lane 4 was processed on 15% polyacrylamide gel. Molecular weight markers are indicated on the sides of the probed blots. B, whole cells extracts of uninfected keratinocytes (Control) and keratinocytes infected with adenovirus encoding phosphatase-dead SSH1CS, SSH2CS, SSH3CS, or dominant inactive CIN (CIN D/N) were processed for SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting. Blots were probed first with antibodies against phosphorylated cofilin (pSer3) and then with antibodies against total cofilin. The percentage phosphorylation (mean ± S.E. for three independent trials) was calculated relative to total cofilin levels in each of three studies, and the quantification is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cofilin Inactivation by Phosphatase-dead SSH Proteins Modulates the Actin Cytoskeleton and Polarity of Human Keratinocytes—We previously presented evidence that α6β4 integrin signaling to cofilin regulates motility behavior (14Sehgal B.U.

Because SSH proteins have been shown to bind F-actin and affect actin depolymerization by dephosphorylating cofilin (34Niwa R. Kim K. Takeichi M. Mizuno K. Uemura T.

FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1789-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we next asked whether expression of dominant negative SSH proteins might impact actin cytoskeleton organization in keratinocytes. Cells infected with adenovirus encoding SSH1CS, SSH2CS, SSH3CS, or CIN D/N were plated at subconfluency on uncoated surfaces and 48 h later were fixed and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin. The images in Fig. 3, left panels, depict select examples of staining patterns observed. These patterns were quantified (right panels). Uninfected keratinocytes, control-infected keratinocytes, and cells expressing CIN D/N are highly polarized, often exhibiting a single fanshaped lamellipodia at the leading edge of the cell and retraction fibers at the cell rear (Fig. 3, left panels; only uninfected keratinocytes and keratinocytes expressing CIN D/N are shown). Within the control and CIN D/N-expressing cells, F-actin is organized into fibrillar arcs toward the leading edge of the polarized cells and is also localized in retraction fibers (left panels). Moreover, the majority of the uninfected keratinocytes, control-infected keratinocytes, and cells expressing CIN D/N exhibit only one lamellipodium per cell (Fig. 3, right panel graphs). In sharp contrast, the number of lamellipodia per cell in keratinocytes expressing phosphatase-dead SSH proteins varies from none to three (right panel graphs). Furthermore, these cells fail to exhibit any obvious polarity; they do not appear fan-shaped (left panels). Specifically, cells expressing phosphatase-dead SSH proteins are either rounded with few, if any, lamellipodia or contain multiple lamellipodia and display a cortical actin ring at the perimeter of the cells (left panels).

In addition to playing multiple roles in innate immune defense such as bacterial aggregation and modulation of leukocyte function, SP-A and SP-D have also been implicated in the allergic response. They interact with a wide range of inhaled allergens, competing with their binding to cell-sequestered IgE resulting in inhibition of mast cell degranulation, and exogenous administration of SP-A and SP-D diminishes allergic hypersensitivity in vivo. House dust mite allergens are a major cause of allergic asthma in the western world, and here we confirm the interaction of SP-A and SP-D with two major mite allergens, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1 and Dermatophagoides farinae 1, and show that the cysteine protease activity of these allergens results in the degradation of SP-A and SP-D under physiological conditions, with multiple sites of cleavage. A recombinant fragment of SP-D that is effective in diminishing allergic hypersensitivity in mouse models of dust mite allergy was more susceptible to degradation than the native full-length protein. Degradation was enhanced in the absence of calcium, with different sites of cleavage, indicating that the calcium associated with SP-A and SP-D influences accessibility to the allergens. Degradation of SP-A and SP-D was associated with diminished binding to carbohydrates and to D. pteronyssinus 1 itself and diminished capacity to agglutinate bacteria.

Both SP-A and SP-D play important roles in innate host defense against inhaled pathogens. The immunomodulatory properties of SP-A and SP-D are diverse and include bacterial agglutination, opsonization, modulation of phagocyte function, and direct inhibition of microbial growth (9Crouch E. Wright J.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 521-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 10Crouch E. Hartshorn K. Ofek I. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 52-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In most cases the CRDs mediate Ca2+-dependent interactions of SP-A and SP-D with their ligands, and whereas CRD monomers can recognize these ligands, trimerization is necessary for high affinity binding. There is mounting evidence to suggest that SP-A and SP-D are also important regulators of allergy. SP-A and SP-D levels increase severalfold in allergic asthma (11Haczku A. Atochina E.N. Tomer Y.

Fukushima Y. Motojima S. Fukuda T. Eur. Respir. J. 2000; 16: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and furthermore, the kinetics of the increase in SP-D levels after allergen challenge have been reported to coincide with the resolution of inflammation (14Haczku A. Cao Y. Vass G. Kierstein S. Nath P. Atochina-Vasserman E.N. Scanlon S.T. Li L. Griswold D.E. Chung K.F. Poulain F.R. Hawgood S. Beers M.F. Crouch E.C. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3557-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Mouse models of house dust mite (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p)) allergy have clearly demonstrated a protective role for SP-D during secondary allergen exposure. Intranasal treatment of allergen-sensitized mice with native full-length human (Nh) SP-D or a 60-kDa trimeric recombinant fragment of human SP-D comprising just the α-helical neck region and CRDs (rfhSP-D) after allergen challenge was effective in reducing eosinophilic inflammation and allergen-specific IgE production, with a concomitant reduction in bronchial hyperresponsiveness and a shift in cytokine profile from the typical Th2 response toward a Th1 response (15Strong P. Townsend P. Mackay R. Reid K.B. Clark H.W. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2003; 134: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Liu C.F. Chen Y.L. Shieh C.C. Yu C.K. Reid K.B. Wang J.Y. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2005; 35: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed with both SP-A and SP-D in mouse models of allergy to Aspergillus fumigatus (17Madan T. Kishore U. Singh M. Strong P. Clark H. Hussain E.M. Reid K.B. Sarma P.U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which SP-A and SP-D bring about these protective effects are not clearly defined but in vitro studies have shown that SP-A and SP-D bind to glycosylated Der p and A. fumigatus allergens through their CRDs in a calcium-dependent manner (18Wang J.Y. Kishore U. Lim B.L. Strong P. Reid K.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 106: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 19Madan T. Kishore U. Shah A. Eggleton P. Strong P. Wang J.Y. Aggrawal S.S.

Reid K.B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and furthermore, SP-A and SP-D have also been shown to inhibit allergen-induced T lymphocyte proliferation (20Wang J.Y. Shieh C.C. You P.F. Lei H.Y. Reid K.B. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 158: 510-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These in vitro properties of SP-A and SP-D may account for some of their protective effects seen in vivo. SP-D has also been shown to enhance the removal of apoptotic cells in vivo (21Clark H. Palaniyar N. Strong P. Edmondson J. Hawgood S. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. 2002; 15: 2892-2899Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and because clearance of apoptotic cells is important in the resolution of an inflammatory response (22Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Konowal A. Freed P Westcott W.J.Y. Henson P.M. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 890-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (2516) Google Scholar, 23Savill J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) SP-D may minimize the inflammation that occurs during and after allergen challenge. Allergens of the house dust mite D. pteronyssinus are a major cause of allergic disease in the Western World. Der p 1, one of several such mite allergens, elicits IgE antibody responses in more than 80% of patients who are sensitive to D. pteronyssinus and is considered to be the most immunodominant allergen involved in the expression of IgE-mediated dust mite sensitivity (24Tovey E.R. Chapman M.D. Platts-Mills T.A. Nature. 1981; 289: 592-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The reason for this potent IgE-eliciting property of Der p 1 is likely to be due to its cysteine protease activity, which has been shown to cleave CD40 on dendritic cells, resulting in decreased interleukin-12 production (25Ghaemmaghami A.M. Gough L. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2002; 32: 1468-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), CD23 (IgE receptor) on B cells, which may disrupt a negative feedback mechanism resulting in excessive IgE production (26Schulz O. Laing P. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3191-3194Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and CD25 (the α subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor) on T cells, diminishing the proliferation and interferon γ production of T cells (27Schulz O. Sewell H. Shakib F. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 18: 271-275Crossref Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28Ghaemmaghami A.M. Robins A. Gough L. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 1211-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The cleavage of these molecules would collectively favor a Th2-mediated response. The proteolytic activity of Der p 1 also facilitates its entry into subepithelial tissues. Occludin, a protein component of intercellular tight junctions, is another substrate of Der p 1 (29Wan H. Winton H.L. Soeller C. Tovey E.R. Gruenert D.C. Thompson P.J. Stewart G.A. Taylor G.W. Garrod D.R. Cannell M.B. Robinson C. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), thus allowing the destruction of the integrity of tight junctions between epithelial cells. The importance of the enzyme activity of Der p 1 in inducing allergy has also been demonstrated in vivo, where intranasal administration of proteolytically active Der p 1 to sensitized mice leads to enhanced inflammatory cellular infiltration of the lungs and systemic production of IgE, in comparison to inactive Der p 1, which has no effect (30Gough L. Campbell E. Bayley D. Heeke Van G. Shakib F. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 2003; 33: 1159-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The less common house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f) is found predominantly in North America, Japan, and the Far East (31Masuda K. Tsujimoto H. Fujiwara S. Kurata K. Hasegawa A. Yasueda H. Yamashita K. DeBoer D.J. de Weck A.L. Sakaguchi M. Vet. Immunol. Immunopathol. 2000; 72: 303-313Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Der f 1, one of the major allergens, is also a cysteine protease and shows 82% homology to Der p 1. Similar to Der p 1, a recombinant form of Der f 1 has been shown to cleave human CD23 and CD25 in vitro (32Takai T. Kato T. Ota M. Yasueda H. Kuhara T. Okumura K. Ogawa H. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2005; 137: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and reduce barrier function of the skin through its proteolytic activity (33Nakamura T. Hirasawa Y. Takai T. Mitsuishi K. Okuda M. Kato T. Okumura K. Ikeda S. Ogawa H. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2006; 126: 2719-2723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to determine whether SP-A and SP-D, important modulators of allergy, were susceptible to degradation by the major house dust mite allergens Der p 1 and Der f 1, with resultant effects on their function. Here we show that Der p 1 and Der f 1 cleave NhSP-A, NhSP-D, and rfhSP-D in a time- and concentration-dependent manner at multiple sites within the CRD, α-helical neck region, and collagen-like-region, and cleavage of these collectins abrogates their lectin activity and lectin-associated functions such as bacterial agglutination and allergen binding. The cleavage and consequent inactivation of SP-A and SP-D may be a novel mechanism to account for the potent allergenicity of Der p 1 and Der f 1. Protein Purification—Native human SP-D (NhSP-D) and native human SP-A (NhSP-A) were purified from bronchiolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from alveolar proteinosis patients as described previously (34Strong P. Kishore U. Morgan C. Bernal Lopez A. Singh M. Reid K.B. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Suwabe A. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 327: 285-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The cDNA for the α-helical neck/CRD of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) including a short region of the collagen stalk, representing residues 179–345 of the mature protein sequence, was inserted into a pET24d vector (Altana Pharma AG, Konstanz, Germany). The plasmid was transformed into BL21 (λDE3) pLysS, and a single colony was selected and diluted into 25 ml of Luria-Bertani broth (LB) supplemented with 25 μg/ml ampicillin (LB+), and grown overnight with shaking at 37 °C. An aliquot of 5 ml of this was used to inoculate 2-liter flasks containing 500 ml of LB+. The optical density at 600 nm was measured at regular intervals, and at A600 = 0.6 expression was induced by adding a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h, cells were spun at 5000 × g for 5 min. Pellets were weighed and stored at –20 °C before use. Pellets were suspended in Bugbuster™ (Novagen) (6 ml/g pellet) containing 1 mm PEFA Block and left mixing at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 10% (v/v) Bugbuster™ (36 ml/g pellet). After thorough mixing, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min to pellet the inclusion body which contained rfhSP-D. The inclusion body pellet was weighed and solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5% (v/v) glycerol (solubilization buffer), 8 m urea at a concentration of 20 mg/ml and left to mix at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein was then refolded through the following series of dialysis steps; solubilization buffer with 2 m urea for 3 h, solubilization buffer with 1 m urea overnight, solubilization buffer with 0.5 m urea for 3 h, solubilization buffer for 24 h, and finally 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 for 24 h to remove glycerol. Correctly folded rfhSP-D was separated from misfolded rfhSP-D by maltose affinity chromatography and purified further by gel filtration as described previously (36Strong P. Reid K.B. Clark H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 130: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Der p 1 was isolated from house dust mite fecal pellets (Allergon, Angelholm, Sweden) using a multistep procedure involving immunoaffinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal anti-Der p 1 antibody (clone 4C1, Indoor Biotechnologies, Manchester, UK), removal of contaminating serine proteases on immobilized soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and finally fast protein liquid chromatography to remove low molecular weight contaminants (37Gough L. Schulz O. Sewell H.F. Shakib F. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Natural Der f 1 was purchased from Indoor Biotechnologies. The purity of all proteins was verified through SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing, and the purity of the Der p 1 preparation was further confirmed by demonstrating that enzymatic activity is completely dependent on pre-activation with cysteine and is totally blocked by cysteine protease inhibitor iodoacetamide (IAA). Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays—96-Well maxisorp microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with varying concentrations of Der p 1 and Der f 1 in 35 mm Na2C03, 15 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, and left overnight at room temperature. Wells were then washed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, (TSC) 0.05% (v/v) Tween and blocked with 300 μl of TSC, 0.05% (v/v) Tween, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37 °C to eliminate nonspecific binding. After washing again, 2 μg of NhSP-A, 2 μg of NhSP-D, or 3 μg of rfhSP-D were added to each well in 200 μl of BALF with 5 mm CaCl2 (BALF/Ca). The addition of proteins to uncoated wells served as background controls. After incubating for 2 h at 37° C and washing, bound NhSP-A was detected using biotinylated polyclonal anti-SP-A antibody (1:1000 dilution; Antibody Shop, Gentofte, Denmark), and bound NhSP-D/rfhSP-D was detected using biotinylated rabbit polyclonal anti-rfhSP-D antibody (1:4000 dilution) by incubating at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, 100 μl of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000; Sigma) was added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before washing. Finally, tetramethylbenzene substrate (Bio-Rad) was added to each well, and after sufficient color development, the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 0.5 m H2SO4. Absorbance values were measured at 450 nm, and background control values were subtracted from binding to protein-coated wells. In some cases BALF/Ca was replaced with BALF with 5 mm EDTA (BALF/E) or BALF/Ca with 100 mm mannose (for NhSP-A) or 100 mm maltose (for NhSP-D and rfhSP-D). Degradation Assays—Der p 1 and Der f 1 were made enzymatically active by incubating a final concentration of 62.5 μg/ml with 5 mm cysteine at 37 °C for 10 min. To investigate time-dependent cleavage of the collectins by Der p1 and Der f 1, a final concentration of 1.25 μg/ml allergen was incubated with 100 μg/ml NhSP-A, NhSP-D, or rfhSP-D in a total volume of 30 μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, (TSCa) for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Reactions were stopped by adding a final concentration of 10 mm IAA. To verify Der p 1/Der f 1-specific activity, these assays were also conducted in the presence of 10 mm IAA. Proteins were then resolved by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In some cases, the assays were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (without calcium). To examine dose-dependent cleavage of collectins, varying amounts of activated Der p 1 and Der f 1 (final concentrations ranging from 40 ng/ml to 5 μg/ml) were incubated with collectins as described above for 20 h. Proteins were then resolved by 12% (w/v) SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Degradation of endogenous NhSP-D and SP-A in BALF was also investigated by incubating BALF with 2.5 μg/ml Der p 1 and Der f 1 for various times ranging from 0 to 48 h and then detecting endogenous NhSP-D and NhSP-A by immunoblotting. N-terminal Sequencing of Degradation Products—150 μg/ml NhSP-D or rfhSP-D was incubated with 1.25 μg/ml Der p 1 and Der f 1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl with or without 2 mm CaCl2 for 20 or 6 h, respectively. The N-terminal sequences of cleaved products were determined by automated Edman degradation (Sequentor 472; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Der p 1 and Der f 1 Enzyme Activity Assay—Continuous rate assays were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm cysteine, pH 7.4, at 25 °C in a total volume of 200 μl in the presence of varying concentrations of calcium as described previously (38Schulz O. Sewell H. Shakib F. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 51: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 280 μm N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin, which acted as the substrate for the enzymes. The assays were started by adding cysteine-activated Der p 1 or Der f 1 to a final concentration of 10 nm. Hydrolysis of the 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) substrate to AMC was monitored using a fluorescent spectrophotometer (λex = 355 nm, λem = 460 nm). Results were related to a 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin standard curve and are expressed as the number of mol of substrate converted/min. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Biotinylated Der p 1, Der f 1, and mannan were immobilized on streptavidin-coated BIAcore chips as described previously (39Nadesalingam J. Bernal A.L. Dodds A.W. Willis A.C. Mahoney D.J. Day A.J. Reid K.B. Palaniyar N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25678-25687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 60 μg/ml NhSP-D or 120 μg/ml rfhSP-D had been incubated with 1.25 μg/ml enzymatically active Der p 1 and Der f 1 for 20 h in 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 (HSC) in the presence or absence of 10 mm IAA were flowed over the cells in HSC, 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 2000 software, and responses for binding to the empty flow cell were subtracted from values for binding to flow cells immobilized with mannan or the allergens. Bacterial Agglutination—Bacterial agglutination assays were performed with Escherichia coli K12. E. coli K12 was grown in 5 ml of LB overnight at 37 °C. The cells were then pelleted and washed 3 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl. Cells were then diluted to an A600 of 1.0 with TSCa. Then 2 μg of NhSP-A, 2 μg of NhSP-D, or 5 μg of rfhSP-D that had previously been digested for 24 h in TSCa with Der p 1 or Der f 1 in the presence or absence of IAA were added to the cells in a total volume of 1 ml. Absorbance was measured at 660 nm at regular intervals for 180 min. Aggregation was observed as a decrease in absorbance as bacterial cells precipitated out of solution. Additional controls were performed using bovine serum albumin and an equivalent amount of protease that would have been associated with the collectin degradation assays. Interaction between Collectins and House Dust Mite Allergens in BALF—The ability of purified NhSP-D, NhSP-A, and rfhSP-D to bind to the major HDM allergens Der p 1 and Der f 1 were tested in the solid phase by using allergen-coated microtiter wells. Previous studies have demonstrated interactions between lung collectins and Der p allergens (18Wang J.Y. Kishore U. Lim B.L. Strong P. Reid K.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 106: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), but these assays were carried out in BALF to determine whether the interactions could take place in the presence of competitor proteins and lipids that would normally be present in the lung environment. NhSP-D, NhSP-A, and rfhSP-D all bound to Der p1 and Der f 1 in a dose-dependent manner. The binding to these allergens was inhibited in the presence of maltose for NhSP-D and rfhSP-D and mannose for NhSP-A and with EDTA, confirming a carbohydrate-mediated interaction through the CRD (Fig. 1). Potential Cleavage Sites of Der p in SP-A and SP-D—Based on cleavage sites of known protein substrates and using a panel of synthetic peptide substrates, it appears that Der p 1 has a preference for small aliphatic residues (Gly/Ala/Val) in the P2 position, charged residues (Asp/Glu/Arg) in the P1 position, and small hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues (Thr/Ser/Ala/Gly) in the P1′ position (where the sequence surrounding the cleavage site is represented by P3, P2, P1, P1′, P2′, and P3′, and the site of cleavage is between P1 and P1′) (38Schulz O. Sewell H. Shakib F. Mol. Pathol. 1998; 51: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 40Shakib F. Schulz O. Sewell H. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 313-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). NhSP-D appeared to have several such potential cleavage sites throughout its sequence, whereas NhSP-A had only one within the CRD (Fig. 2). Der p 1 and Der f 1 Degrade SP-A and SP-D—Having determined that there were potential cleavage sites in NhSP-D and NhSP-A, NhSP-A, NhSP-D, and rfhSP-D were incubated with the cysteine proteases Der p 1 and Der f 1 under physiological conditions, and the proteins were subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE to determine whether degradation had taken place. Using molar enzyme:substrate ratios of 1:19, 1:15, and 1:33 for assays with NhSP-A, NhSP-D, and rfhSP-D respectively (where the number of moles of substrate are based on the number of trimeric units present), NhSP-A, NhSP-D, and rfhSP-D were all susceptible to cleavage by Der p 1 and Der f 1 (Fig. 3). Degradation of NhSP-A by Der p 1 and Der f 1 was visible after 3 h, as indicated by the decrease in intensity of the 35-kDa and 70-kDa bands representing the monomer and dimer of NhSP-A, respectively. No distinct cleavage products were visible, suggesting that there were multiple cleavage sites in NhSP-A and that it was degraded into small fragments that were not visible on a gel. Degradation of NhSP-D by Der p 1 and Der f 1 was also observed after 6 h, but in this case, two distinct cleavage products of ∼24 and 18kDa were visible (a third minor cleavage product of 11 kDa could be detected when using very high concentrations (>150 μg/ml) of NhSP-D; data not shown). By comparing the intensities of the 45-kDa band representing the intact monomer, after 24 h of incubation there was less than ∼30% of the original uncleaved protein. rfhSP-D was most susceptible to degradation by Der p 1 and Der f 1, with ∼50% of the protein having been degraded by 1 h. The major cleavage product for both Der p 1 and Der f 1 digestion was 18 kDa. By 12 h none of the original uncleaved monomer was visible. No cleavage of NhSP-A, NhSP-D, or rfhSP-D was observed in the presence of IAA, suggesting that the degradation was specific to the action of Der p 1 or Der f 1. Varying enzyme concentrations may be encountered in vivo, and to determine the minimum concentration at which degradation could be observed, a wide range of enzyme:substrate ratios were tested (Fig. 4). NhSP-A, NhSP-D, and rfhSP-D were all degraded in a concentration-dependent manner by both Der p 1 and Der f 1. The lowest enzyme:substrate ratio at which degradation of NhSP-A was visible was 1:38, as indicated by the decrease in intensity of the 35- and 70-kDa bands representing the monomer and dimer, respectively. NhSP-D showed a similar response to dose-dependent Der p 1 and Der f 1 digestion, and the minimal enzyme:substrate ratio at which cleavage was observed was 1:28. Consistent with the time-dependent cleavage assays rhfSP-D was most susceptible to degradation by Der p 1 and Der f 1. Even at the lowest co"

We determine kinetic rate constants for the processes of MMP9 activation by MMP3, MMP10, MMP13, and trypsin; inhibition by the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1 and 2; and MMP9 deactivation. This computational approach allows us to investigate discrepancies in our understanding of the interaction of MMP9 with TIMP1.

Temporally accurate biphasic inhibition requires either an additional isomerization step or a second lower affinity isoform of MMP9. We also theoretically characterize the MMP3/TIMP2/pro-MMP9 and MMP3/TIMP1/pro-MMP9 systems. We speculate that these systems differ significantly in their time scales of activation and inhibition such that MMP9 is able to temporarily overshoot its final equilibrium value in the latter. Our numerical simulations suggest that the ability of pro-MMP9 to complex TIMP1 increases this overshoot.

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) 2The abbreviations used are: MMP9matrix metalloproteinase 9TIMPtissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase is a zinc-dependent endopeptidase that participates in a variety of physiological and biochemical processes (1Fridman R.

Cell Biol. 2001; 33: 960-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In angiogenesis, MMP9 has been shown to play a part in the degradation of basement membranes through its type IV collagenase activity (3Wilhelm S.M. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Eisen A.Z. Grant G.A.

To quantify the existing biochemical data and help understand properties of MMP activation cascades, we have constructed a biochemically accurate numerical model of the post-secretional regulation of MMP9. Specifically, we have used existing experimental data to kinetically characterize mechanistic models of the MMP9 reaction network (e.g. Fig. 1). matrix metalloproteinase 9 tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase MMP9 enters this model (post-secretion) as a glycosylated latent enzyme (pro-MMP9) at a molecular mass of 92 kDa. From experimental studies, MMP9 is known to undergo activation, inhibition by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), and possibly post-activation processing, including C-terminal processing and deactivation. In this approach, we have not studied the proteolytic action elicited by MMP9. A vast quantity of literature exists to create detailed models of activation and inhibition; however, C-terminal processing and MMP9 deactivation are less studied or accepted. In general, MMP latency is maintained by an N-terminal prodomain that masks the Zn2+-dependent active site. The structure of the active molecule and the specific rate of activation depend on the exact mode of activation, but in all cases they require conformational unwinding in the catalytic domain. By far, the most studied mode of MMP9 activation is enzyme proteolysis of the pro-MMP9 prodomain. Confirmed in vitro activators of MMP9 include MMP2 (8Fridman R. Toth M. Pena D. Mobashery S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2548-2555PubMed Google Scholar), MMP3 (9Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MMP7 (10Imai K.

Ohuchi E. Yamamoto E. Okada Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), MMP13 (12Knauper V. Smith B. Lopez-Otin C. Murphy G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the serine protease trypsin (13Okada Y. Gonoji Y. Naka K. Tomita K. Nakanishi I. Iwata K. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21712-21719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP3 is generally regarded as the most potent activator of MMP9. Here, MMP9 is processed via an intermediate of 86 kDa (processing at Glu59-Met60), which relaxes to expose the second processing site (Arg106-Phe107) leading to the well established 82-kDa isoform. Evidence also supports nonproteolytic modes of activation, e.g. via conformational changes contingent on substrate binding (14Bannikov G.A. Karelina T.V. Collier I.E. Marmer B.L. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16022-16027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Post-activation processing for MMP9 can further involve removal of the C-terminal hemopexin-like domain, leading to an ∼65-kDa species (MMP9ΔC), or can involve direct cleavage in the active domain producing an ∼50-60-kDa inactive species (15Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P. Senior R.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6351-6356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, MMP9 is typically processed from 92 to 86 kDa and 82, 65, and ∼50-60 kDa. A distinct feature of MMP9 is its ability to form proenzyme complexes with TIMP1 (pro-MMP9·TIMP1) and to form dimers with other MMPs, including the MMP9·MMP1 heterodimer (16Goldberg G.I. Strongin A. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Marmer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4583-4591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and MMP9·MMP9 homodimer (17Cha H. Kopetzki E. Huber R. Lanzendorfer M. Brandstetter H. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1065-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Once activated, MMP9 is subject to inhibition by TIMPs resulting from binding of the N-terminal domain of a TIMP to the active site cleft in MMP9. Our understanding of MMP9 inhibition is incomplete. First, MMP9 is found as active isoforms at both 82 and 65 kDa, but the 65-kDa isoform lacks the hemopexin-like domain, which is generally recognized to increase the rate of MMP9 inhibition by TIMP1 (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not know what role enzymatic cleavage of the C-terminal domain of MMP9 plays in MMP9 inhibition. In addition, although MMP TIMP pairs such as MMP9 and TIMP2 or MMP2 and TIMP1 exhibit monophasic inhibition kinetics, MMP TIMP combinations capable of forming pro-MMP·TIMP complexes (e.g. pro-MMP9·TIMP1 and pro-MMP2·TIMP2) seem to exhibit biphasic inhibition kinetics (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). An important problem in our current understanding of MMP9 inhibition by TIMP1 is the large discrepancy in the reported Ki values between various groups. Assuming simple bimolecular kinetics, O'Connell et al. (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported values of Ki <50 pm, with an association rate constant (kon) of 1.11 × 107 m-1 s-1. In contrast, Olson et al. (19Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) reported lower affinity kinetics with nanomolar Ki = 8.5 nm and kon equal to 2.48 × 105 m-1 s-1. Furthermore, resonance biosensor analyses between MMPs and TIMPs consistently indicate binding kinetics with Ki in the low and intermediate nanomolar range across a wide range of MMP and TIMP combinations (19Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 20Troeberg L. Tanaka M. Wait R. Shi Y.E. Brew K. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15025-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). An important goal of this study is to examine the existing relationships and use numerical simulations to determine models capable of accurately reproducing observed behavior. In the physiological setting, TIMPs play a major role in inhibiting MMPs, and thus pro-MMP9 activation will never truly occur in isolation of an inhibitor. Experiments indicate that the rate of pro-MMP9 activation is reduced in the presence of TIMPs (15Shapiro S.D. Fliszar C.J. Broekelmann T.J. Mecham R.P. Senior R.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6351-6356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Watanabe H. Nakanishi I. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Okada Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 991-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) because of either TIMP1 inhibition of the activators or TIMP1 stabilization of pro-MMP9 by forming the pro-MMP9·TIMP1 complex. TIMP1 can bind pro-MMP9 through its C-terminal domain, leaving its active site available to inhibit other MMPs, e.g. MMP3. This is responsible for the importance of the MMP3 to TIMP1 ratio on pro-MMP9·TIMP1 complex activation. In all, our computational approach allowed us to test various hypotheses regarding MMPs and TIMPs against previously observed behavior. Using similar methodology, we previously confirmed the nonmonotonic dependence of MMP2 activation on MT1-MMP and TIMP2 ratios in the MT1-MMP/TIMP2/MMP2 system and showed the importance of membrane-bound MMPs over diffusible MMPs in type 1 collagen degradation (22Karagiannis E.D. Popel A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39105-39114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on the mechanisms proposed in the literature, we formulated a network of reactions in which MMP9 and its activators and inhibitors are likely to participate (Figs. 1 and 3). To form a numerical model of MMP9 behavior, these reactions were converted to a system of ordinary differential equations by applying mass action kinetics. These equations express the rate of change in concentration of each species based on the production of each species or consumption rates because of the listed reactions. Specifying the initial concentrations of all species allows calculation of the concentration of each species at a later time. For the simulated reactions, we assume well stirred and cell-free conditions allowing us to neglect spatial gradients of the species. Next, kinetic parameters for these reactions were either obtained from values calculated by other groups or were independently determined using data from the experimental literature (we did not carry out our own biochemical experiments). To determine kinetic parameters, we employed a grid search algorithm to minimize normalized error (1 - R2 = sum of squared residuals normalized to the total sum of squares) between the simulated results of our model and the experimental data (usually of time courses or dose-response curves). The specific reactions and equations, and the methodology used in estimating unknown kinetic parameters for these reactions, are detailed in the Supplemental Material. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations was solved with the Matlab software package (Mathworks, Inc.) using their ode23s stiff ordinary differential equation solver. Numerical precision was double floating point, and the time step size was automatically selected to have a relative error tolerance less than 10-3 and an absolute error tolerance less than 10-15. Estimates for Pro-MMP9 Activation in the Absence of TIMPs—Pro-MMP9 activation is a sequential processing event involving the conversion of the latent 92-kDa form to an 82-kDa species by an 86-kDa inactive intermediate (9Ogata Y. Enghild J.J. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3581-3584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We treated activation as a single step event leading from a 92- to an 82-kDa form. This assumption is valid because the 92- to 86-kDa conversion usually occurs fairly rapidly (several seconds) compared with activation to the 82-kDa species, which takes hours (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). First, we numerically estimated pro-MMP9 activation by MMP3 (Fig. 2A) using data from an experiment by O'Connell et al. (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the case of pro-MMP9 activation by MMP3, a Michaelis-Menten activation constant kact was previously determined to be 0.0019 s-1 (23Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Toth M. Kotra L.P. Massova I. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2661-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). By performing a numerical sensitivity analysis, we estimated different kon and koff values that fit the experimental time course to within experimental uncertainty as shown by the contour plot in Fig. 2B. These range from the relatively slow binding kinetics at kon = 6 × 103 m-1 s-1 and koff = 0 s-1 to relatively rapid kinetics at kon = 6 × 105 m-1 s-1 and koff = 0.1 s-1. The absolute minimum for kon assuming that kact is infinity is 2.5 × 103 m-1 s-1. With kact = 0.0019 s-1, we could restrict kon to being at least 6 × 103 m-1 s-1. We found that our later simulations were not very sensitive to different parameter combinations; thus we adopted one set of parameters for the rest of this study chosen as the median values of the estimated binding kinetics: kon = 1 × 104 m-1 s-1, koff = 1.0 × 10-3 s-1, and kact = 0.0019 s-1 (kact/Km = 8840 m-1 s-1). The entire family of optimal parameters leads to effective kact/Km in the range of 6 × 103 m-1 s-1 to 1.1 × 104 m-1 s-1, which is almost 10 times lower than that determined previously by Olson et al. (23Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Toth M. Kotra L.P. Massova I. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2661-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We also carried out similar analyses for MMP10 (Fig. 2C), MMP13, and trypsin. The results are presented in Table 1. Our calculations indicate that MMP13 and MMP3 are equally competent MMP9 activators, followed by trypsin, then MMP10. To show this, we simulated a test experiment where 200 nm pro-MMP9 was separately combined with 30 nm of each activator (Fig. 2D).TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of activation The activation of pro-MMP9 by various activators was modeled using a Michaelis-Menten reaction scheme. The kinetic parameters are listed in the 1st column for the respective proenzyme and activators. The on- and off- rates of activator towards the various pro-MMP9·TIMP·MMPX complexes were assumed equal to that towards pro-MMP9.

(19Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). These progress curves (Fig. 3) followed the onset of inhibition between free MMP9 and both TIMP1 and TIMP2 and the resumption of MMP9 activity following the dissociation of the MMP9·TIMP complex. The experimental data show a clear difference between the inhibitory behavior of TIMP1 and TIMP2 for MMP9. For example, similar increases of TIMP1 or TIMP2 elicit a larger loss of MMP9 activity within the first 100 s and a smaller loss of activity past 100 s for TIMP1. This indicates that TIMP1 causes a biphasic pattern of inhibition with an initial phase of relatively rapid inhibition followed by a phase of slower inhibition. The four mechanisms we tested include a single step binding inhibition (scheme I), a single step binding inhibition followed by isomerization into a second inhibited complex (scheme II), a noninhibitory initial binding followed by isomerization to an inhibited complex (scheme III), and a two-isoform MMP9 model with each MMP9 isoform having different binding properties (scheme IV). The reaction mechanisms for these schemes are displayed in Fig. 3. For each case, we present the predicted progress curves for the inhibition of MMP9 by TIMP (Fig. 3, panel i) and the dissociation of the MMP9·TIMP complex (Fig. 3, panel ii) against the experimental data. The kinetic parameters that we determined are tabulated in Table 2.TABLE 2Mechanisms of MMP9 inhibition We numerically fitted kinetic parameters for MMP9 inhibition by TIMP using schemes I-IV and data from Olson et al.

Reaction diagrams of the inhibition schemes are presented in Fig. 3. The chosen set of parameters was determined to be optimal by our grid-search algorithm.

(25Hutton M. Willenbrock F. Brocklehurst K. Murphy G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism was also previously considered between MMP1 and TIMP1 wherein the intermediate complex represented TIMP1 bound to the hemopexin domain of MMP1 (26Taylor K.B. Windsor L.J. Caterina N.C. Bodden M.K. Engler J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23938-23945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Scheme III is a variation of scheme II in that the intermediate is considered as fully active as the 82-kDa MMP9. Jointly, schemes II and III represent the extremes of the general binding + isomerization model, which we consider as scheme III*. Scheme IV was suggested by O'Connell et al. (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in noting two subpopulations of MMP9, with one capable of significantly stronger inhibition. We found that scheme I can accurately characterize the inhibition of 82-kDa MMP9 by TIMP2 (and of 62-kDa MMP2 by TIMP1; data not shown) (Fig. 3A) but not by TIMP1 (Fig. 3B). The differences between MMP9 inhibition by TIMP1 and TIMP2 cannot be accounted for simply by altering the kinetic parameters used in a scheme I reaction mechanism. On the other hand, we found that schemes III* and IV seem capable of characterizing inhibition between both MMP9 and TIMP1 and MMP2 and TIMP2 (latter not shown). The results for TIMP1 can also be seen by comparing the normalized errors for each of the schemes in Table 2. Scheme II (see Fig. 3C) does not significantly improve upon the results of scheme I and does not also seem capable of describing the MMP9/TIMP1 interaction. We searched the space of parameters for k1II between 1 × 103 and 1 × 108 m-1 s-1, and for k2II, k3II, and k4II between 1 × 10-8 and 1 × 102 s-1; the approximate error-minimizing fit is shown in Fig. 3C, using a k1II = 2 × 106 m-1 s-1, k2II = 4 × 10-3 s-1, k3II = 6 × 10-4 s-1, and k4II = 3 × 10-5 s-1, with an overall Ki of k2II/k1II × k4II/(k3II + k4II) equal to 96 pm. This is expected because the initial binding provides inhibition, and the subsequent isomerization to another inhibited state can only increase the rate of the initial binding inhibition. Scheme III and more so schemes III* and IV come closer to approximating the MMP9/TIMP1 interaction. In the case of scheme III (Fig. 3D), the model produced a biphasic approximation of the data; however, the proper active MMP9 concentration dependence on TIMP1 could not be reproduced. The effective Ki = k4III/k3III × k2III/k1III of 1.4 pm is well in the range approximated by O'Connell et al. (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at Ki < 50 pm. Using scheme III* (Fig. 3E), we determined that setting the activity of the intermediate complex to ∼35% that of free MMP9 provided optimal fitting for the isomerization type schemes. For scheme III*, the other parameters were determined at k1III* = 5.6 × 106 m-1 s-1, k2III* = 1.6 × 10-5 s-1, k3III* = 6.3 × 10-4 s-1, and k4III* = 2.5 × 10-4 s-1. Thus, the effective Ki = k2III* × k4III*/(k3III* + (1 - 0.35) × k4III*) or 0.9 pm. Similar to scheme III*, scheme IV is also able to reproduce the biphasic behavior and the proper TIMP1 concentration dependence (Fig. 3F). However, this occurred only when the ratio of the slowly inhibited (low affinity MMP9L) to total MMP9 (MMP9L + MMP9H) species was set to ∼0.31. The study of O'Connell et al. (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol.

We estimated the parameters of this model to be k1IV = 4.6 × 106 m-1 s-1 and k2IV = 6.3 × 10-6 s-1 for the rapidly inhibited form (Ki = 1.4 pm) and k3IV = 2.9 × 103 m-1 s-1, k4IV = 2.5 × 10-5 s-1 for the slowly inhibited form (Ki = 8.6 nm). We note that the rapidly inhibited form also was consistent with the strong inhibition strength seen by O'Connell et al. (18O'Connell J.P. Willenbrock F. Docherty A.J. Eaton D. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14967-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the low affinity isoform in the range noted by Olson et al. (19Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (Ki = 8.5 nm). The previous estimates are the optimal sets of parameters produced by our grid-search algorithm. However, as with any nonlinear parameter estimation algorithm, we have no guarantee for finding the absolute “global” error minimizing set of rate parameters. Furthermore, although there may be only one best fit, there may be a family of nearly well fitting curves that cannot be distinguished both on the basis of experimental uncertainty and the inability of experimental data to confer values for parameters of a specified model. Thus, similar to our attempt in Fig. 2B, we attempted to specify ranges of parameters (more accurately, the region traversed by the error-minimizing manifold). We only did this for schemes III* and IV because they were the only models consistent with the experimental data. We found that the error-minimizing manifold for scheme IV traversed over the following ranges: k1IV (3-7 × 106 m-1 s-1), k2IV (1-9 × 10-6 s-1), k3IV (3-20 × 103 m-1 s-1), and k4IV (2-8 × 10-5 s-1). The ratio of the low affinity isoform to total MMP9 was relatively defined at 0.3-0.35. For these parameters, the effective Ki value for MMP9H varied from 0.2 to 1.5 pm. Similarly for MMP9L, the Ki value ranged from 0.4 to 15 nm. The scheme III* error-minimizing manifold traverses a wider range of parameter combinations: k1III* (3-9 × 106 m-1 s-1), k2III* (2-2000 × 10-6 s-1), k3III* (2-20 × 10-4 s-1), k4III* (1-600 × 10-6 s-1), with the relative activity of the intermediate complex between 0.3 and 0.5. The range in viable effective Ki is 0.05-30 pm. Accurate estimation of the parameters for this model requires additional biochemical experimentation. Despite the degeneracy, our later conclusions are relatively insensitive to the exact set of parameters used for MMP9 inhibition by TIMP1. We also tested the 62-kDa MMP2/TIMP2 interaction using the various inhibition schemes, again using data from Olson et al. (19Olson M.W. Gervasi D.C. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29975-29983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Our conclusions are similar to that found for the MMP9/TIMP1 interaction"

The first step involves the formation of small, partially lipidated, apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing VLDL precursor particles in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The second step encompasses the transfer of the bulk of triacylglycerol (TG) to the precursor particles to form larger, fully lipidated VLDL particles. VLDL assembly is regulated by the availability of lipids, such as TG, which composes over 50% of VLDL lipids (6Jonas A. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. 2002: 483-504Google Scholar). Despite intensive research in this area, the source of the lipids transferred during the second step lipidation, the location where this occurs and the mechanism of lipid transfer have not been clearly defined. While the initial formation of the VLDL precursor particles in the ER is well accepted, the addition of bulk lipid (mainly TG) has been suggested to take place both in the ER (1Alexander C.A.

The source of TG for the second step lipidation of apoB is believed to be preformed intracellular lipid droplets (LD). There are at least three types of LD in the apoB-lipoprotein producing tissues (such as liver and intestine): the cytosolic lipid droplets (CLD), the apoB-containing lipid droplets (VLDL and its precursors), and the luminal apoB-free lipid droplets (LLD). The pool of stored TG for the provision of VLDL-TG substrates most likely resides in the lumen of organelles where VLDL is assembled (7Gibbons G.F. Wiggins D. Brown A.M. Hebbachi A.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 14Dolinsky V.W. Gilham D. Alam M. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Cell Mol.

The existence of the LLD has first been observed within the smooth ER in 1976 (1Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and this observation was further supported by electron microscopy studies using apoB-deficient mice (9Hamilton R.L. Wong J.S. Cham C.M. Nielsen L.B. Young S.G. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1543-1557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), a heterodimeric protein confined to the lumen of the ER and to a lesser amount to the Golgi, has been implicated to play a major role in the formation of the LLD. Generation of LLD was greatly diminished in liver-specific MTP knock-out mice (16Raabe M. Veniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Bjorkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and in hepatocytes treated with MTP inhibitors (17Kulinski A. Rustaeus S. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31516-31525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27793-27800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which the lipids from LLD are transferred to the apoB-containing primordial pre-VLDL particle during the second step remain speculative. Some models of VLDL assembly suggest “fusion” between the LLD and the primordial pre-VLDL particle (1Alexander C.A. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 69: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 3Shelness G.S. Sellers J.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, the occurrence of any fusion between the partially lipidated apoB particles, and LLD has never been experimentally demonstrated. Another possible mechanism may involve an indirect transfer of lipids from LLD to the primordial pre-VLDL particle through a series of enzymatic events. It has been reported that up to 70% TG in VLDL is derived from hydrolysis and re-esterification of the preformed TG stores (19Lankester D.L. Brown A.M. Zammit V.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1889-1895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 21Yang L.Y. Kuksis A. Myher J.J. Steiner G. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 262-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the candidate lipases that could be involved in this process is an ER luminal carboxylesterase Ces3, also termed triacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH) (14Dolinsky V.W. Gilham D. Alam M. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1633-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 22Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Inhibition of TGH activity leads to decreased mobilization of stored TG and VLDL secretion (23Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Faseb. J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, it is obscure which TG storage pool TGH accesses. In vitro studies have indicated that apoB-containing particles are not substrates for TGH (24Gilham D. Alam M. Gao W. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because TGH localizes exclusively to the lumen of the ER, we hypothesized that ER-localized LLD are the candidate substrates for TGH. In this study, we isolated LLD from mouse livers and determined their lipid and protein compositions. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, and horse serum (HS) were purchased from Invitrogen Canada (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Bovine serum albumin (BSA), Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture tablets were from Roche Applied Sciences Diagnostics (Laval, Quebec, Canada). Anti-FLAG antibodies conjugated to agarose beads were from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-porcine (22Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and anti-human (25Alam M. Ho S. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 24: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) TGH antibodies were generated in our laboratory. Polyclonal anti-apoB antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-human apoE antibodies were from BioDesign (Saco, ME). Polyclonal antibodies against albumin were a generous gift from Dr. Dennis E. Vance (University of Alberta). Anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) polyclonal antibodies were from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and dimethyl 3,3′-dithiobispropionimidate (DTBP) were from Pierce Biotechnologies. [9,10(n)-3H]Oleic acid (10 Ci/mmol), protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads, fullrange rainbow protein molecular weight markers, HMW native protein standards, and immunoblotting reagents were obtained from Amersham Biosciences-Pharmacia Canada (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). All other reagents were of analytical grade or higher. Isolation of Microsomal Luminal Contents—Microsomes from female C57BL/6J mouse liver homogenates were prepared essentially as previously described (26Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8781-8786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, mice were exsanguinated via cardiac puncture, and livers were removed and washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS). Livers were then homogenized with a motor-driven Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (Wheaton Science Products, Millville, NJ) at medium speed for 10 strokes in homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) to yield 20% (w/v) homogenate. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min. Crude mitochondrial pellets were obtained by centrifugation of the 500 × g supernatant at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and microsomes (pellet) and cytosol (supernatant) were separated by centrifugation of the 15,000 × g supernatant at 106,000 × g for 1 h. Microsomes were then resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.4) to remove peripherally associated membrane proteins and lipid droplets. Washed microsomes were recovered by centrifugation at 106,000 × g for 1 h. Microsomes were suspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation at 106,000 × g for 1 h to obtain luminal contents (supernatant) and microsomal membranes (pellet) (26Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8781-8786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wetterau J.R. Aggerbeck L.P. Laplaud P.M. McLean L.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4406-4412Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Protease inhibitor mixture was included in all of the solutions used in this isolation procedure. Isolation of Microsomal LLD by Density Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Microsomal luminal contents were adjusted to 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) and immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB polyclonal antibodies in the absence of detergents was performed as previously described (17Kulinski A. Rustaeus S. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31516-31525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). 2 ml of post-IP supernatant was combined with an equal volume of glycerol and transferred to a Beckman Ultra-Clear™ centrifuge tube (Palo Alto, CA). Samples were overlaid with 4 ml of buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and an additional layer of 4 ml of TBS. The solution was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a Beckman SW40 rotor for 2 h at 8 °C. Fractions of 2 ml were collected from the bottom of the tube (6 fractions in total). Immunoblotting—For the analyses of density gradient fractions, the top three fractions were concentrated 15-fold using Millipore Amicon® Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter units (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). 40-μl aliquots of each concentrated fraction were analyzed by 4-15% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. For particle size analysis by native gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), 25-μl aliquots of each sample were mixed with electrophoresis sample buffer without SDS or β-mercaptoethanol, and electrophoresed in 2-10% polyacrylamide gels in the absence of SDS. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting with anti-porcine TGH polyclonal antibodies were performed as previously described (22Lehner R. Verger R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1861-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with other antibodies (directed against apoB, apoE, PDI, and albumin) were performed according to protocols provided by the suppliers. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Coomassie Blue-stained proteins in polyacrylamide gels were excised and an automated in-gel tryptic digestion was performed on a MassPrep Station (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Proteins in the gel were destained, reduced (dithiothreitol), alkylated (iodoacetamide), digested with trypsin (Promega Sequencing Grade Modified) and the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel and analyzed via LC/MS/MS (the Institute for Biomolecular Design, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). LC/MS/MS was performed on a CapLC HPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) coupled with a Q-ToF-2 mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation). Tryptic peptides were separated using a linear water/acetonitrile gradient (0.2% formic acid) on a Picofrit reversed-phase capillary column, (5 micron BioBasic C18, 300 Å pore size, 75 micron ID × 10 cm, 15 micron tip from New Objective Inc., Woburn, MA) with an in-line PepMap column (C18, 300 micron ID × 5 mm from LC Packings, Sunnyvale, CA) used as a loading/desalting column. Protein identification from the resulting MS/MS data were done by searching the NCBI non-redundant data base using Mascot Daemon (Matrix Science, UK). Search parameters included carbamidomethylation of cysteine, possible oxidation of methionine and one missed cleavage per peptide. Generation of Rabbit Anti-mouse TGH Antibodies—Rabbits were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of mouse TGH conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (KLH-C-ESAQRPSHREHVEL). 0.5 mg of this antigen (0.5 ml) was combined with 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant, and the emulsion was injected subcutaneously into two rabbits. Two booster intramuscular injections were given at 4-week intervals with 0.5 mg of antigen in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Rabbits were bled prior to (preimmune) and 8 weeks after the initial immunization; sera were prepared, and titer was determined. The sera were then affinity-purified with the same TGH peptide conjugated to BSA and stored at -80 °C. Immunoprecipitation—For immunoprecipitation using anti-mouse TGH antibodies, 1 ml of luminal content was adjusted to 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 150 mm NaCl. Protease inhibitor mixture was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sample was incubated with anti-mouse TGH antibodies described above end-over-end at 4 °C overnight. 20 μl of washed protein A-Sepharose beads were added and incubated with the sample end-over-end for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein-beads complex was pelleted by centrifugation for 30 s at 6,000 × g. Immunoprecipitates were washed and solubilized by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-mouse TGH and anti-apoE antibodies. Cross-linking—Primary rat hepatocytes were prepared by collagenase perfusion of the liver as previously described (23Gilham D. Ho S. Rasouli M. Martres P. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Faseb. J. 2003; 17: 1685-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Primary hepatocytes were electroporated with a plasmid containing the human TGH cDNA with a FLAG epitope tag (24Gilham D. Alam M. Gao W. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Electroporation of primary rat hepatocytes was performed based on previously published protocols (28Yamamoto M. Sakuma T. Ichimaru H. Nemoto N. J. Biochem. Mol. Toxicol. 2001; 15: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 29Morimura S. Okuda A. Sakai M. Imagawa M. Muramatsu M. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 685-691PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of 1.5 × 107 cells were combined with 15 μg of plasmid DNA in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, then incubated on ice for 10-15 min. Electroporations were performed on a BTX ECM630 Electrocell Manipulator. Immediately after electroporation, cells were plated on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes and incubated overnight. Subsequently, cells (electroporated and non-electroporated controls) were incubated with 8 mm DTBP in phosphate-buffered saline for 50 min at room temperature, and then aspirated. Excess DTBP was quenched by incubation in TBS for 5-10 min. Cells were harvested in TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture. TGH was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins bound to protein A-Sepharose beads were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. Gas Chromatography Analysis of Lipids—The mass of cholesterol, phospholipids, cholesteryl ester (CE), and TG were quantified by gas chromatography. Lipids from cytosol, microsomes, luminal contents, and LLD were extracted in the presence of tridecanoylglycerol (internal standard) (30Sahoo D. Trischuk T.C. Chan T. Drover V.A. Ho S. Chimini G.

Lipids. 1989; 24: 408-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Luminal apoB-free contents were applied to a Superose 6 size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) column (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden). For TG analysis, eluted fractions were mixed in-line with the Infinity™ Triglyceride Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA) using a post-column T-connector/Solvent Delivery Module (model 110B, Beckman Coulter, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and passed through a CH-30 Column Heater (Eppendorf, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) set at 37 °C. Reaction products were monitored at 500 nm in real-time using a Programmable Detector Module (model 166, Beckman Coulter). For protein analysis, fractions (2 ml) were collected every 4 min from the 22nd to 58th minute. Fraction 1 (eluted from the 22nd to 26th minute) contains VLDL-sized particles and fractions 5-8 (eluted from the 38th to 54th minute) contain HDL-sized particles based on the elution of plasma lipoproteins used as standards. Proteins in collected fractions were precipitated with 2 volumes of ice-cold acetone for 30 min at -20 °C, resuspended in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Cell Culture—McArdle RH7777 (McA) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). McA cells stably transfected with human TGH cDNA have been produced and maintained in our laboratory (24Gilham D. Alam M. Gao W. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cells are cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) and 10% HS. All incubations were performed at 37 °C, in an atmosphere enriched with 5% CO2 and in the presence of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Metabolic Labeling of Lipids—Wild-type McA cells and McA cells stably expressing human TGH (24Gilham D. Alam M. Gao W. Vance D.E. Lehner R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 984-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) were incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 0.5% BSA and 0.4 mm [3H]oleic acid (125 μCi/μmol) for 4 h. At the end of the incubation, media were aspirated, and cells were washed with DMEM/0.5% BSA, followed by three washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested and cytosolic and luminal contents were isolated as described above. Lipids were extracted (32Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of non-labeled lipid carriers, applied to TLC plates and developed to one-third of the height with chloroform-methanol-acetic acid-water (25:15:4:2, by volume) to separate phospholipids, followed by development in heptaneisopropyl ether-acetic acid (60:40:4, by volume) to separate neutral lipids. Lipids were visualized by exposure to iodine; bands corresponding to various lipid classes were scraped off of the plates, and the associated radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Other Methods—7.5 mm oleic acid/10% BSA stock solution was prepared as previously described (33Lehner R. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit using BSA as a standard. Isolation of LLD—To isolate mouse liver LLD, female C57BL/6J mice were fasted overnight to accumulate liver TG stores, livers were harvested, and microsomes were prepared. The commonly used procedure to release luminal contents from organelles utilizes alkaline Na2CO3. However, this procedure also strips loosely associated peripheral membrane proteins. To preserve the integrity and protein content of LLD we used hypotonic 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8 to release luminal contents. Compared with 0.2 mm Na2CO3, pH 12, 1 mm Tris-HCl released only about one-fourth of the total protein released by Na2CO3 (data not shown). However, the majority of luminally localized apoB and TGH were released efficiently by the hypotonic buffer treatment (Fig. 1). Luminal contents contain apoB-containing particles (VLDL and its precursors) in addition to LLD. ApoB-containing particles were removed by immunoprecipitation with anti-apoB antibodies (Fig. 1). The post-apoB immunoprecipitation (Post IP) supernatant contains non-apoB-associated luminal proteins including those associated with LLD. The majority of TGH is recovered in this supernatant and is not present in the apoB immunoprecipitation pellet. Lipid Composition of LLD—Lipid analysis of subcellular fractions isolated from fasted animals revealed that about 93% of cellular TG resided in the CLD and 7% in microsomes. 30% of luminal TG associated with apoB and 70% was found in the post-IP supernatant. The observed partition of TG to various subcellular locations suggested that LLD compose a relatively small pool of intracellular neutral lipid stores. Floating lipid fractions (LLD) were isolated from the apoB-free post-IP fraction by glycerol-sucrose density centrifugation. About half of lipids present in the post-IP supernatant were recovered in LLD. Lipid content of LLD (fractions 4-6) was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 2A) and gas chromatography (Fig. 2B). Significant differences were found in the lipid composition of LLD and CLD. While CLD contained about 80% TG and less than 20% glycerophospholipids, LLD were less enriched in TG (ranging from 40% to 60%) and contained a near equal percentage of phospholipids (Fig. 2, A and B). Protein Composition of LLD—All biological lipid droplets contain a specific set of associated proteins. To determine the protein composition of LLD, a proteomic approach was employed. Proteins present in combined fractions 4-6 were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and individual protein bands were subjected to analysis by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3A and Table 1). The LLD-associated proteins include TGH and a homologous protein of unknown function, carboxylesterase1 (Ces1), VLDL secretion-related proteins (MTP and apoE), and ER-resident proteins (such as heat shock proteins). The identification of MTP and apoE is of particular interest as these proteins are implicated participants in VLDL assembly. MTP has been suggested to play an important role in the transfer of lipid from the cytosol/ER membranes to the lumen of the ER (34Higashi Y. Itabe H. Fukase H. Mori M. Fujimoto Y. Takano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21450-21458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It forms an obligatory heterodimer with PDI, which was also found in the analysis (Table 1). Some mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins were also found in the analysis. They represent possible contaminants that were non-specifically adsorbed to the droplets during preparation. Importantly, transmembrane proteins from either the ER or the Golgi were not found in LLD preparations. The CLD coat protein, adipophilin, was also absent from the LLD both by proteomic and immunoblotting analyses, indicating lack of contamination of LLD with CLD.TABLE 1Identification of LLD-associated proteins by mass spectrometryCategoryNameGI no.BandCarboxylesterasesTriacylglycerol hydrolase (TGH)167165057,8Carboxylesterase 1200707178VLDL secretion-relatedApolipoprotein E675310212MTP152151615ER-resident proteinsBiP25985626Heat shock protein 8767793126Heat shock 70 protein16611346Tumor rejection antigen gp9667558635Calreticulin130974329Protein-disulfide isomerase8609869Protein-disulfide isomerase-associated 366796879Protein-disulfide isomerase-associated 4861983166Microsomal protease ER-6015839299Sorbitol dehydrogenase 12212862711Carbonic anhydrase III1071713414Possible contaminantsAlbumin269860647,8Clathrin heavy chain 1512592421,2Complement component 3239560442Transferrin170464716Catalase10661148Alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (class I)3244983911Regucalcin667773913Ribosomal proteinsMultiple Open table in a new tab The presence of apoE and TGH in the LLD fractions was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). The LLD were devoid of albumin (secretory protein), which partitioned to the bottom of the gradient (fractions 1-3). Interestingly, although both TGH and apoE partitioned into LLD, the levels of the two proteins varied in the individual fractions, suggesting a degree of heterogeneity in the LLD protein composition. ApoE/TGH Association—Apolipoproteins play a role in the inhibition and activation of lipolytic activities (35Holm C. Biochem. Soc.

Therefore, we wished to address whether apoE and TGH are present on separate or on the same LLD and, if both of these proteins can be found on the same lipid droplet, we sought to determine whether these two proteins directly interact with each other. Immunoprecipitation of TGH under non-denaturing conditions (in the absence of detergent) resulted in a significant recovery of apoE in the immunoprecipitation pellet (Fig. 4A), indicating the presence of apoE on the same LLD as TGH.

https://openalex.org/W2009617385,"The hyperpolarization-activated cation current, Ih, plays an important role in regulating intrinsic neuronal excitability in the brain. In hippocampal pyramidal neurons, Ih is mediated by h channels comprised primarily of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel subunits, HCN1 and HCN2. Pyramidal neuron h channels within hippocampal area CA1 are remarkably enriched in distal apical dendrites, and this unique distribution pattern is critical for regulating dendritic excitability. We utilized biochemical and immunohistochemical approaches in organotypic slice cultures to explore factors that control h channel localization in dendrites. We found that distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 is first detectable at postnatal day 13, reaching maximal enrichment by the 3rd postnatal week. Interestingly we found that an intact entorhinal cortex, which projects to distal dendrites of CA1 but not area CA3, is critical for the establishment and maintenance of distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1. Moreover blockade of excitatory neurotransmission using tetrodotoxin, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, or 2-aminophosphonovalerate redistributed HCN1 evenly throughout the dendrite without significant changes in protein expression levels. Inhibition of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity, but not p38 MAPK, also redistributed HCN1 in CA1 pyramidal neurons. We conclude that activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors by excitatory temporoammonic pathway projections from the entorhinal cortex establishes and maintains the distribution pattern of HCN1 in CA1 pyramidal neuron dendrites by activating calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-mediated downstream signals.

Compartmentalization of voltage-gated ion channels within neurons is critical for integration and transmission of neuronal signals, and disorganization of functional channels among subcellular domains could be a mechanism of pathophysiology in certain neurological diseases (1Lai H.C.

Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Both Ih and h channel subunit proteins are enriched 6-10-fold in distal apical dendrites compared with the soma of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA1 (2Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 3Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R.

Neurol. 2004; 471: 241-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), and this enrichment of Ih in distal dendrites profoundly influences neuronal excitability. Along these lines, h channels 1) are active at resting membrane potentials, thereby contributing an inward current that reduces the input resistance at the distal dendrites (6Magee J.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) close with depolarization, thereby reducing the amplitude and duration of distant synaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials and normalizing temporal summation (6Magee J.C. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7613-7624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Magee J.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Blockade of this nonuniform Ih enhances temporal summation of excitatory inputs, increasing neuronal excitability (7Magee J.C. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), whereas pharmacological activation of h channels reduces temporal summation of dendritic synaptic inputs and concurrently reduces CA1 excitability (8Poolos N.P. Migliore M. Johnston D. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, enrichment of h channels in distal apical dendrites serves an important role in providing an antiexcitatory influence to hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Despite the importance of distal dendritic enhancement of h channels for neuronal excitability, molecular factors controlling h channel localization are not well known. Expression and distribution of the principal hippocampal h channel subunits, HCN1 and HCN2, are regulated developmentally. In rodent hippocampus, protein expression levels of HCN1 and HCN2 increase 4-fold from neonatal to young adult animals, and the distally enriched distribution pattern of h channel subunits in CA1 appears in the second postnatal week (9Bender R.A. Brewster A. Santoro B. Ludwig A. Hofmann F. Biel M. Baram T.Z. Neuroscience. 2001; 106: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Vasilyev D.V. Barish M.E. J.

Miyaguchi K. Segal M. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 1614-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 14Dailey M.E. Smith S.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2983-2994Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that synaptic activity could control h channel localization. Interestingly others have reported up-regulation of Ih in CA1 pyramidal neurons by ionotropic glutamate receptor activation (15Welie I. van Hooft J.A. Wadman W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5123-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 16Fan Y. Fricker D. Brager D.H. Chen X. Lu H.C. Chitwood R.A. Johnston D. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1542-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although changes in h channel localization were not evaluated in these prior studies, we wondered whether excitatory neuronal inputs might control h channel localization in CA1 pyramidal neurons, thereby affecting excitability. Apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons are innervated by the Schaffer collateral pathway from CA3 as well as branches of the perforant pathway often referred to as the temporoammonic (TA) pathway (17Amaral D.G. Witter M.P. Neuroscience. 1989; 31: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 18Witter M.P. Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To explore whether excitatory inputs control h channel localization, we evaluated the expression of HCN1 in cultured rat organotypic hippocampal slices. Utilizing pharmacological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical approaches, here we show that the distal dendritic localization of HCN1 in CA1 pyramidal neurons is regulated by excitatory inputs from the TA pathway and specifically requires activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors and CaMKII. Antibody Generation—Antibody specific to the C terminus of HCN1 (guinea pig (gp) α-HCN1) was prepared commercially (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) by immunizing guinea pigs with a fusion protein consisting of amino acids 778-910 of mouse HCN1. cDNA was generated by PCR using primers 5′-CGCGAATTCATGGAAAGGCGGCGGC and 3′-CGCGTCGACTCAGTCACTGTACGGATGG followed by subcloning the PCR product into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the glutathione S-transferase-producing vector, pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare). Fusion protein was expressed in BL21 bacteria (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Dissociated Hippocampal Neuron Culture—Hippocampal neuron cultures were prepared as described previously (19Chetkovich D.M. Bunn R.C. Kuo S.H. Kawasaki Y. Kohwi M. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6415-6425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chetkovich D.M. Chen L. Stocker T.J. Nicoll R.A. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 18 rats were plated at a density of 600/mm2 on glass coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) and maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) with medium replacement twice weekly. Organotypic Hippocampal Slice Culture—P7 rats were anesthetized by halothane and decapitated, and then the brain was rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold dissection medium (75 mm sucrose, 25 mm glucose, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.1 mm kynurenate, 90 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm NaH2PO4, and 1 μm 2-aminophosphonovalerate (APV)). Hemispheres were separated and individually placed on a Vibratome (World Precision Instruments, Sara-sota, FL) and immobilized using superglue. Horizontal sections (350 μm) were generated, and the hippocampal formation including attached entorhinal cortex was gently subdissected using 26 5/8-gauge needles. Dissected tissues were placed on culture inserts (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in prewarmed high serum culture medium (50% minimum Eagle's medium, 25% Earle's balanced salt solution, 25% horse serum, 36 mm glucose, and 25 mm HEPES). For maintenance, high serum medium was replaced the next day followed by replacement with low serum medium (5% horse serum) every 3 days thereafter. All animal usage in these studies was approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee. Pharmacological Treatment—For pharmacological treatment, 1 μm tetrodotoxin (TTX; Sigma), 10 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; Sigma), or 100 μm APV (Tocris, Ellisville, MO) was dissolved into the medium either at day in vitro (DIV) 3 for chronic exposure or at DIV14 for acute exposure. During chronic treatment (>3 days), drug-containing medium was replaced every 3 days. Kainic acid (6 μm; Tocris), cell-permeable BAPTA-AM (10 μm; Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA), and cell-permeable autocamtide-2-related inhibitory peptide II (AIP-II; 30 μm; Calbiochem), 4-(N-ethyl-N-phenylamino)-1,2-dimethyl-6-(methylamino)pyrimidinium chloride (ZD7288; 10 μm; Tocris) were dissolved in distilled H2O and mixed with medium. The CaMKII inhibitor KN93 (10 μm; Sigma) and its inactive analog KN92 (10 μm; Sigma) as well as the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm; Calbiochem) and its inactive analog SB202474 (10 μm; Calbiochem) were dissolved in Me2SO and mixed in medium to yield the working concentrations listed above. The final concentration of Me2SO was less than 0.1%. Immunohistochemistry—Immunocytochemistry was performed on dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures at DIV28. Coverslips were removed from wells and placed in fixative (2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, pH 7.4)) for 10 min at room temperature (RT), then placed in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), and washed 3 × 5 min. Coverslips were incubated in PBST containing 1% normal goat serum for 1 h at RT. Primary antibodies gp α-HCN1 (1:1000) and mouse α-MAP2 (1:500, BD Biosciences) were added in this block solution for 1 h at RT followed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 (1:2500; Molecular Probes) or Cy3 (1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) fluorophores diluted in block solution for 1 h at RT. Coverslips were washed 3 × 5 min in PBST after each antibody step and then mounted on slides (Fisher) with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL). For immunohistochemistry of fixed brain tissues, 8-12 week-old rats and mice were perfused with fixative, 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were removed and postfixed overnight at 4 °C in fixative, and parasagittal or horizontal free floating sections (50 μm) were cut on a micro-slicer (VT1000 S, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Diaminobenzidine staining was performed with primary antibody gp α-HCN1 (1:1000) followed by species-appropriate secondary antibody in an avidin-biotin-peroxidase system (ABC Elite, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peroxidase staining was developed using 3,9-diaminobenzidine as the chromogen. For fluorescence staining, Cy3-conjugated α-guinea pig secondary antibody was used. For fluorescence immunohistochemistry of cultured organotypic slices, membranes of tissue inserts surrounding the culture were excised and fixed in 4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at RT. Tissues were rinsed with PBST twice and then incubated with blocking solution (3% normal goat serum in PBST) at least for 1 h at RT. Then tissues were incubated with the desired primary antibody followed by species-appropriate secondary antibody as described above for 1 h at RT. Slices were washed 3 × 10 min in PBST after each antibody step and then mounted on slides (Fisher) with Vector-shield (Vector Laboratories). Propidium iodide uptake assay was performed by adding 2 μm propidium iodide (Invitrogen) solution to the culture medium and then incubating at 37 °C for 1 h before fixation. Western Blotting—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected at 30% confluence in serum-free medium using Lipofectamine reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 48 h, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and protein extracts were generated in TEEN-Tx (0.1 m Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100). To obtain mouse brain, wild type (C57/B6; Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) and HCN1 knock-out mice (Hcn1tm2Kndl; Jackson Laboratory) were anesthetized by halothane inhalation and decapitated. Brains were rapidly removed and homogenized in 10 volumes (w/v) of buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 320 mm sucrose and centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and insoluble material. The post-nuclear homogenate was centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 40 min to yield a cytosolic fraction (S2) and crude membrane pellet, which was then resuspended in TEEN-Tx (S3). Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Primary antibodies including gp α-HCN1 (1:1000) and mouse α-tubulin (clone DM1A, 1:2000; Sigma) were diluted in block solution containing 5% milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) and then incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at RT. Blots were washed 3 × 10 min with TBST, and species-appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) was added in TBST containing 5% milk at a dilution of 1:2500. Labeled bands were visualized using SuperSignal chemiluminescence (Pierce). Quantification of band intensity was performed by densitometry using NIH Image software, and band intensity of HCN1 in each sample was normalized with the band intensity of tubulin to adjust for loading differences. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless specified. Microscopy and Data Analysis—For dissociated hippocampal neuron cultures, images of mounted coverslips were taken under fluorescence microscopy with a 63× oil immersion objective (numerical aperture = 1.4) affixed to a Zeiss Axiovert 200M inverted microscope with Axiovision 3.0 software-driven controls equipped with an Axio Cam HRm camera. For organotypic slices and fixed brain tissues, digital images were taken with a 5× objective utilizing the same microscope configuration. Images were analyzed with NIH Image software. h channel distal spatial distribution was quantitated utilizing NIH Image J analysis software. Area CA1 was identified (by thin pyramidal layer and relationship to dentate gyrus blades), and a line beginning with and perpendicular to the pyramidal cell body layer extending to the distal stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) layer was placed across the middle of area CA1. This line spanning the region of apical dendrites was divided into 10 equal sections, and the average pixel intensity in each subsegment (as well as for the pixels across the soma) was assigned to the distal (with respect to the soma) point of each division. Division in equal subsegments allowed comparisons between different slices that might have been sectioned in slightly different planes or angles and hence have different lengths of dendritic fields. HCN1 immunoreactivity (pixel intensity) was analyzed across CA1 along the bisection line using the “plot profile” function. The data file was used to graph x as distance from soma and y as intensity of pixels. Data were represented as relative value of pixel intensity (percentage of minimum segmental intensity, normalized to lowest average intensity of all subsegments, minus background signal from an area of the image lacking tissue). For each tissue, five adjacent lines were analyzed, and values from each line were averaged. Statistical analysis involved analysis of variance with posthoc analysis using Tukey's honest significant difference. Characterization of Antibody against the C Terminus of HCN1—We generated guinea pig polyclonal antisera against HCN1 utilizing a glutathione S-transferase fusion of the C terminus (amino acids 778-910) of HCN1 as antigen. We next sought to characterize the sensitivity and specificity of our custom HCN1 antibody. Western blotting of membrane extracts from transfected COS-7 cells showed that α-HCN1-(778-910) recognizes HCN1 but not another h channel subunit enriched in brain tissue, HCN2 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore this antibody recognized a single 110-kDa protein band on Western blots prepared from wild type mouse brain but not from the HCN1 knock-out mouse brain (Hcn1tm2Kndl) (Fig. 1A), confirming specificity for detecting HCN1 in tissue extracts. Next we evaluated the specificity of α-HCN1-(778-910) for rat brain immunohistochemistry. We found that the expression pattern of our custom α-HCN1-(778-910) in rat brain is similar to that reported in prior studies (Fig. 1B) (5Notomi T. Shigemoto R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2004; 471: 241-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and is abolished by antigen preabsorption (Fig. 1B). We also performed immunohistochemistry using α-HCN1-(778-910) on control mouse brain (C57/B6) and HCN1 knock-out mouse brain. Whereas we found a staining pattern identical to that observed in rat brain (Fig. 1B and Refs. 10Vasilyev D.V. Barish M.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8992-9004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 21Santoro B. Grant S.G. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14815-14820Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), no staining was observed in the brain of HCN1 knock-out mice using α-HCN1-(778-910) (Fig. 1C). Based on these data, we conclude that gp α-HCN1-(778-910) antibody is specific for detecting HCN1. Distal Dendritic Enrichment of HCN1 Is Present in Cultured Organotypic Hippocampal Slices but Not Dissociated Pyramidal Neurons—To study the basic mechanism controlling h channel localization in dendrites, we sought to develop an in vitro assay that would 1) recapitulate enrichment of HCN1 protein observed in distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal area CA1 in fixed brain tissue and 2) allow easy pharmacological manipulation to evaluate the establishment and maintenance of this distal dendritic enrichment. To determine whether h channels are enriched in the distal dendrites of hippocampal neurons maintained in cultures in vitro, we initially evaluated HCN1 distribution in dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neuron cultures by immunofluorescence microscopy. At DIV28 in dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we found that HCN1 protein is evenly distributed within dendrites, similar to the distribution of the dendrite-specific cytoskeletal protein MAP2 (Fig. 2B). We next prepared organotypic slice cultures, dissecting the hippocampus and attached entorhinal cortex from P7 neonatal rat pups. In contrast to the diffuse dendritic HCN1 staining in dissociated cultures, the distribution of HCN1 was asymmetric within apical CA1 pyramidal dendrites of organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Specifically at DIV14, HCN1 immunoreactivity in area CA1 pyramidal neurons was low in the cell body layer and increased by distance to the extent of the distribution of the apical pyramidal dendrites (Fig. 2C, left panel). That MAP2 staining in organotypic cultures remained evenly distributed across the apical dendritic field (Fig. 2C, right panel) suggests that distal enrichment of HCN1 reflects an increased density of HCN1 protein rather than an increased density of dendritic processes. The distal dendritic distribution of HCN1 at DIV14 in organotypic cultures strongly resembled the distribution in fixed rat brain tissues (Fig. 2A, arrow). Thus, we reasoned that the organotypic hippocampal slice culture is an excellent in vitro model to study the trafficking mechanisms of h channels in CA1 pyramidal neurons. HCN1 Distal Dendritic Enrichment Is Established Developmentally in Vitro—In the hippocampus, HCN1 protein expression levels and distribution patterns change during postnatal development, reaching adult levels and distribution by P28 (11Brewster A.L. Chen Y. Bender R.A. Yeh A. Shigemoto R. Baram T.Z. Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Surges R. Brewster A.L. Bender R.A. Beck H. Feuerstein T.J. Baram T.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the expression and distribution pattern of HCN1 showed similar developmental changes in vitro. Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures were fixed and immunolabeled with gp α-HCN1 and α-MAP2. Because immunostaining of cultured slices produces an intense staining artifact along the edges of slices containing basal dendrites and because physiologically relevant h channel enrichment in distal dendrites has been best characterized in apical dendrites, we restricted our analysis of HCN1 protein distribution to the soma and apical dendritic fields. To quantitate the changes in HCN1 density, the apical dendritic field of area CA1 was divided into 10 equal segments from the cell body layer (S1) to the distal apical dendritic fields (S10). The average HCN1 immunoreactivity was determined for each segment and normalized to the lowest segmental value to obtain the relative intensity of each segment. At DIV1, HCN1 was distributed pre-dominantly near the somata of CA1 pyramidal neurons with lower immunoreactivity detected in the distal dendrite (137 ± 6% in S1 versus 111 ± 4% in S10; unit, percentage of minimum segmental intensity; p < 0.001 for S1, S9, and S10 compared with DIV14; p < 0.05 for S2 and S3 compared with DIV14; n = 9). At DIV3, HCN1 immunoreactivity was relatively even throughout the dendrite from the soma to the distal dendrite (122 ± 3% in S1, 110 ± 2% in S5, and 110 ± 3% in S10; unit, percentage of minimum segmental intensity; p < 0.001 for S9 and S10 compared with DIV14; n = 13). By DIV6, HCN1 was enriched in SLM layer, consistent with prior reports of the establishment of distal dendritic enrichment of HCN1 in the later 2nd postnatal week in vivo (11Brewster A.L. Chen Y. Bender R.A. Yeh A. Shigemoto R. Baram T.Z. Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Surges R. Brewster A.L. Bender R.A. Beck H. Feuerstein T.J. Baram T.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2006; 24: 94-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (110 ± 2% in S1 versus 149 ± 6% in S10; unit, percentage of minimum segmental intensity; n = 9). From DIV6 to DIV21, the gradient of enrichment from the soma to the distal dendrite remained the same (Fig. 3, A and B). We also explored developmental changes in HCN1 protein expression by Western blotting extracts prepared from subdissected area CA1 of cultured slices at each developmental stage. Similar to HCN1 protein expression levels in vivo, HCN1 levels increased during development in vitro. Specifically HCN1 expression increased 3-fold (2.7 ± 0.23, n = 3) from DIV1 to DIV6 and 5-fold (5.07 ± 0.25, n = 3) from DIV1 to DIV14 with no significant increase of HCN1 expression level between DIV14 and DIV21 (5.07 ± 0.25-versus 5.23 ± 0.35-fold compared with DIV1, n = 3 each) (Fig. 3, C and D). Because the magnitude and timing of the developmental increase in protein expression as well as the onset of distal dendritic enrichment closely resemble that published for HCN1 in vivo (11Brewster A.L. Chen Y. Bender R.A. Yeh A. Shigemoto R. Baram T.Z. Cereb. Cortex. 2007; 17: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the in vitro slice culture model is a useful tool to study mechanisms controlling HCN1 distribution and protein expression in hippocampus. TA Pathway Projections from Entorhinal Cortex Control HCN1 Distal Dendritic Enrichment—Because HCN1 distal dendritic enrichment is established in organotypic cultures with a developmental time course similar to that found in vivo but fails to form in dissociated hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we wondered whether control of HCN1 localization depends upon specific inputs to pyramidal neuron dendrites. The two major afferent pathways to CA1 pyramidal neurons target different dendritic domains. The Schaffer collateral/commissural pathway projections from area CA3 form synapses in the stratum radiatum, whereas TA pathway inputs from entorhinal cortex (EC) form synapses in the SLM layer (17Amaral D.G. Witter M.P. Neuroscience. 1989; 31: 571-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar, 18Witter M.P. Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). To determine whether one or both of the principal CA1 afferent pathways control HCN1 localization, we first prepared cultured hippocampal slices in which area CA3 or EC was removed at the time of plating, P7. These sectioned slices were then maintained in culture for 14 days to permit the developmental establishment of distal HCN1 enrichment and were then fixed and stained for HCN1. In addition to HCN1, all slices were double labeled with antibody against MAP2, which stains viable dendrites and is a qualitative measure of the health of slices (23Noraberg J. Kristensen B.W. Zimmer J. Brain Res. Brain Res. Protoc. 1999; 3: 278-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Upon removal of area CA3 to abolish Schaffer collateral inputs, the distribution pattern of HCN1 in CA1 area was not significantly different from control, non-sectioned slices (CA3-lacking slices: 112 ± 3% in S1, 108 ± 1% in S5, and 154 ± 8% in S10, n = 13; control slices: 112 ± 3% in S1, 108 ± 2% in S5, and 141 ± 6% in S10; unit, percentage of minimum segmental intensity; n = 15; p > 0.7 for all segments compared with control; Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, slices with the EC removed showed significant reductio"

The selenoprotein population was partially replaced in liver with mutant transgenes encoding mutations at either position 34 (34T→A) or 37 (37A→G) in tRNA[Ser]Sec. The A34 transgene product lacked the highly modified 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine, and its mutant base A was converted to I34. The G37 transgene product lacked the highly modified N6-isopentenyladenosine. Both mutant tRNAs lacked the 2′-methylribose at position 34 (Um34), and both supported expression of housekeeping selenoproteins (e.g. thioredoxin reductase 1) in liver but not stress-related proteins (e.g. glutathione peroxidase 1). Thus, Um34 is responsible for synthesis of a select group of selenoproteins rather than the entire selenoprotein population. The ICA anticodon in the A34 mutant tRNA decoded Cys codons, UGU and UGC, as well as the Sec codon, UGA. However, metabolic labeling of A34 transgenic mice with 75Se revealed that selenoproteins incorporated the label from the A34 mutant tRNA, whereas other proteins did not. These results suggest that the A34 mutant tRNA did not randomly insert Sec in place of Cys, but specifically targeted selected selenoproteins. High copy numbers of A34 transgene, but not G37 transgene, were not tolerated in the absence of wild type trsp, further suggesting insertion of Sec in place of Cys in selenoproteins.

Loss of SelP in liver, achieved by targeted knock-out of the selenocysteine (Sec) tRNA[Ser]Sec gene (designated trsp), implicated SelP in transport functions in plasma and substantiated its essential role in brain (15Schweizer U.

Selenoprotein synthesis is dependent on the presence of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec. Given this dependence, selenoprotein expression can be modulated by perturbing Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec expression, providing a means of elucidating the role of selenoproteins and selenium in development and health (16Moustafa M.E. Kumaraswamy E. Zhong N. Rao M. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: S2494-S2496Crossref Google Scholar). The Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec population in higher vertebrates consists of two isoforms that differ by a single 2′-O-methyl group. One isoform contains 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine (mcm5U) at position 34, and the other is methylated on the ribosyl moiety at that position generating 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2′-O-methyluridine (mcm5Um; see Ref. 17Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The presence of this 2′-methyl ribose modification (designated Um34) confers several unique properties on mcm5Um. For example, Um34 affects Sec tRNA[Ser]SecmcmUm secondary and tertiary structure (18Diamond A.M. Choi I.S. Crain P.F. Hashizume T. Pomerantz S.C. Cruz R. Steer C.J. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. McCloskey J.A. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14215-14223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Um34 addition is dependent on the prior synthesis of the four modified bases found in tRNA[Ser]Sec and on an intact tertiary structure (19Kim L.K. Matsufuji T. Matsufuji S. Carlson B.A. Kim S.S. Hatfield D.L. Lee B.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 1306-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Synthesis of all other modified nucleosides of Sec tRNA[Ser]Sec, including mcm5Um, is less stringently associated with primary and tertiary structure. In addition, synthesis of Um34 is dependent on the selenium status of the organism, with increased dietary selenium increasing Um34 levels (17Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3565-3576Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Removal of trsp is embryonic lethal (20Bösl M.R. Takaku K. Oshima M. Nishimura S. Taketo M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The targeted removal of floxed trsp in defined cell types using transgenic mice with tissue-specific expression of Cre recombinase permitted some study of the effects of selenoprotein loss in specific tissues and organs in the absence of endogenous trsp. However, the resulting animals have a variety of defects, including embryonic mortality or early adult death (26Shrimali R.K. Weaver J.A. Miller G.F. Carlson B.A. Novoselov S.N. Kumaraswamy E.

https://openalex.org/W2035786230,"Human dUTPase is essential in controlling relative cellular levels of dTTP/dUTP, both of which can be incorporated into DNA. The nuclear isoform of the enzyme has been proposed as a promising novel target for anticancer chemotherapeutic strategies. The recently determined three-dimensional structure of this protein in complex with an isosteric substrate analogue allowed in-depth structural characterization of the active site. However, fundamental steps of the dUTPase enzymatic cycle have not yet been revealed. This knowledge is indispensable for a functional understanding of the molecular mechanism and can also contribute to the design of potential antagonists. Here we present detailed pre-steady-state and steady-state kinetic investigations using a single tryptophan fluorophore engineered into the active site of human dUTPase. This sensor allowed distinction of the apoenzyme, enzyme-substrate, and enzyme-product complexes. We show that the dUTP hydrolysis cycle consists of at least four distinct enzymatic steps: (i) fast substrate binding, (ii) isomerization of the enzyme-substrate complex into the catalytically competent conformation, (iii) a hydrolysis (chemical) step, and (iv) rapid, nonordered release of the products. Independent quenched-flow experiments indicate that the chemical step is the rate-limiting step of the enzymatic cycle. To follow the reaction in the quenched-flow, we devised a novel method to synthesize γ-<sup>32</sup>P-labeled dUTP. We also determined by indicator-based rapid kinetic assays that proton release is concomitant with the rate-limiting hydrolysis step. Our results led to a quantitative kinetic model of the human dUTPase catalytic cycle and to direct assessment of relative flexibilities of the C-terminal arm, critical for enzyme activity, in the enzyme-ligand complexes along the reaction pathway."

An understanding of the folding requirements for Tat substrates is of fundamental importance for the elucidation of the transport mechanism. We now demonstrate for the first time Tat transport for fully unstructured proteins, using signal sequence fusions to naturally unfolded FG repeats from the yeast Nsp1p nuclear pore protein. The transport of unfolded proteins becomes less efficient with increasing size, consistent with only a single interaction between the system and the substrate. Strikingly, the introduction of six residues from the hydrophobic core of a globular protein completely blocked translocation.

In many organisms, a subset of proteins has to be translocated across biological membranes in a folded state to allow essential folding events, such as cofactor assemblies or oli-gomerizations, prior to translocation. The Tat 3The abbreviations used are: Tat, twin-arginine translocation; HiPIP, high potential iron-sulfur protein. system is the general translocation machinery that is adapted to such folded protein substrates (1Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is of prokaryotic origin and widely occurring in archaea and bacteria, and it also plays a pivotal role in the translocation across the thylakoid membranes in plant plastids (2Yen M.R. Tseng Y.H. Nguyen E.H. Wu L.F. Saier Jr., M.H. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In proteobacteria and plants, it consists of three membrane proteins, namely TatA, TatB, and TatC (3Müller M. Klösgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Proteins that are translocated by the Tat system are recognized by a usually cleavable N-terminal signal sequence, which contains the eponymous twin-arginine motif, a conserved sequence pattern with two consecutive and almost invariant arginine residues. So far, all evidence supports the view that such a signal sequence at an N terminus of a folded protein is sufficient to target proteins to the Tat translocon (4Thomas J.D. Daniel R.A. Errington J. Robinson C. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 5Santini C.L. Bernadac A. Zhang M. Chanal A. Ize B. Blanco C. Wu L.F. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Tat system therefore can be regarded as a general transport system that is not specialized to certain individual proteins but rather accepts a very broad range of proteins as substrates. The smallest known Tat substrates are high potential iron-sulfur proteins (HiPIP) of less than 10 kDa (8Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the largest are heterodimeric formate dehydrogenases of nearly 150 kDa (9Sargent F. Berks B.C. Palmer T. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This variability shows that the shapes of the transported proteins cannot be very important. Hence, the Tat system extends the spectrum of transportable proteins to those that are folded in the cytoplasm and thus not compatible with the more commonly used Sec transport system. Several Tat signal sequence-fused Sec substrates, such as c-type cytochromes or alkaline phosphatase (PhoA), have been clearly shown to become Tat-compatible only after cytoplasmic folding (6Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). This requirement for folding supported the hypothesis of a folding quality control at the Tat translocon (7DeLisa M.P. Tullman D. Georgiou G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6115-6120Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Others suggested quality control steps prior to translocon binding (10Brüser T. Sanders C. Microbiol. Res. 2003; 158: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Jack R.L. Buchanan G. Dubini A. Hatzixanthis K. Palmer T. Sargent F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3962-3972Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Tat-incompatible unfolded twin-arginine signal-fused PhoA (RR-PhoA) has been shown to interact with the Tat system, thereby causing inhibition of growth (12Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Translocon binding and growth inhibition suggested that the selectivity for folded proteins at the Tat translocon is not a physiological folding quality control. We suspected that the bacterial Tat system may not directly detect whether substrate is folded or not and that translocation of unfolded proteins should in principle be possible. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the Tat targeting of proteins that are not able to fold and thus carry out their physiological function in an unfolded state. We demonstrate here that the bacterial Tat system can indeed translocate such naturally unfolded polypeptides and that folding therefore is not a general prerequisite for Tat transport. Instead, we show that the absence of an exposed hydrophobic core motif is the critical factor that determines whether or not a protein can be translocated by the Tat system.

Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and derivatives with one, two, three, or four Cys → Asp mutations. Primers used were as follows: hip-C43D-F (3′-CCC GAA GAG CAG CAC GAC GCC AAC TGC CAG-5′)/hip-C43D-R (3′-CTG GCA GTT GGC GTC GTG CTG CTC TTC GGG-5′), hip-C43,46D-F (3′-GCA GCA CGA CGC CAA CGA CCA GTT CAT GCA GG-5′)/hip-C43,46D-R (3′-CCT GCA TGA ACT GGT CGT TGG CGT CGT GCT GC-5′), hip-C63D-F (3′-GAG TGG AAG GGC GAC CAG CTC TTC CCC GG-5′)/hip-C63D-R (3′-CCG GGG AAG AGC TGG TCG CCC TTC CAC TC-5′), hip-C77D-F (3′-CGT CAA CGG CTG GGA CGC TTC CTG GAC C-5′)/hip C77D-R (3′-GGT CCA GGA AGC GTC CCA GCC GTT GAC G-5′). Arg-Arg → Lys-Lys mutations were generated using the primer pair hip-KK-F/hip-KK-R (see above), to allow the assessment of Tat dependence of translocation. For purification and structural analyses, the C-terminally His6-tagged FG5 and FG5-Φ domains were produced from the arabinose-regulated plasmids pBAD-nspR5-H6 and pBAD-nspR5Φ-H6, which were constructed by PCR amplification with pFF18 as template, using the primer pair nsp1p-NcoI-F (5′-GGG ATC CAT GGC AAA ACC AGC CCT C-3′)/nsp1p-XhoI-R5, followed by restriction of the fragment with NcoI and XhoI and ligation together with the His6 tag-containing XhoI-ScaI fragment from pEXH5 (17Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) into the corresponding sites of pBAD22 (18Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3978) Google Scholar), which resulted in pBAD-nspR5-H6. For the generation of pBAD-nspR5Φ-H6, the hydrophobic core codons were introduced by QuikChange™ as described above, using the primer pairs nsp1p-core-1F/nsp1p-core-1R and nsp1p-core-2F/nsp1p-core-2R. All constructs were confirmed by restriction analyses and sequencing. The vector pABS-tatABC was used for co-expression of the tatABC genes (19Berthelmann F. Brüser T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Biochemical Methods—SDS-PAGE and protein estimations were carried out by standard methods (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionations as well as Western blotting and blot developments were carried out as previously described (8Brüser T. Yano T. Brune D.C. Daldal F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the HiPIP signal sequence and the hexahistidine tag (17Brüser T. Deutzmann R. Dahl C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 164: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were used. For NMR data collection, samples of FG5 or FG5-Φ (0.2 mm each) in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were measured in Shigemi tubes at 10 °C. All NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker DMX 500 spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz proton resonance frequency and equipped with a 5-mm triple resonance 1H{13C/15N} probe that had XYZ gradient capability. Homonuclear two-dimensional 1H/1H TOCSY experiments (22Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar) were collected with the carrier placed in the center of the spectrum on the water resonance, which was suppressed by presaturation. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimension was obtained by the states-time-proportional phase incrementation method. All NMR spectra were acquired and processed on Silicon Graphics computers using the program XWINNMR 3.5 (Bruker Bio-Spin, Rheinstetten, Germany). A 90° phase-shifted squared sine-bell function was used for apodization in all dimensions. Polynomial baseline correction was applied to the processed spectra in the directly detected 1H dimension. The chemical shifts were referenced to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. Tat Transport of Natively Unfolded Proteins—In bacteria, proteins that are translocated by the Tat system are believed to require folding prior to translocation (23Lee P.A. Tullman-Ercek D. Georgiou G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 60: 373-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). A strict folding requirement has not been perceived in the Tat system of plant thylakoids, since the translocation of malfolded proteins has been demonstrated in that system (24Hynds P.J. Robinson D. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34868-34874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is therefore an important issue in protein translocation research to address the reasons for the incompatibility of certain unfolded Tat substrates with the bacterial Tat system. Based on our previous observation of an artificially unfolded protein that is targeted to the Tat translocon (12Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), we were encouraged to assess the translocation of a natively unfolded protein. Such natively unfolded soluble proteins are very hydrophilic and generally do not fold into any globular conformation. We found that the so-called FG repeat domain of the yeast nuclear pore protein Nsp1p was an ideal tool for our studies. It has been shown in the past by circular dichroism that this polar domain is 80–95% in a naturally unfolded conformation (25Denning D.P. Patel S.S. Uversky V. Fink A.L. Rexach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2450-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The multiple repeats of 19 amino acids function as an unstructured flexible peptide in the transport through nuclear pores (16Clarkson W.D. Kent H.M. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Hurt E.C. J. Cell Sci. Suppl. 1989; 12: 243-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bayliss R. Littlewood T. Stewart M. Cell. 2000; 102: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 28Frey S. Richter R.P. Gorlich D. Science. 2006; 314: 815-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The repetitive nature of the FG repeat domain allowed us to construct a series of Tat signal-fused unfolded proteins that differ in length. We analyzed the translocation of 3, 5, 7, 10, and 17 repeats, which were N-terminally fused to the signal sequence of our model Tat substrate HiPIP. The variation of the repeat number served the purpose to examine possible size restrictions in the transport of unfolded proteins by the Tat system. The constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 1A. For clarity, the constructs are termed RR-(FG3) to RR-(FG17), where “RR” represents the twin-arginine signal sequence and where the number of fused FG repeats is given in parentheses. All constructs were hexahistidine-tagged to allowed their detection in Western blot analyses as well as the rapid purification and biophysical analyses. When the translocation of the naturally unfolded Tat substrates was examined, we found a clear Tat-dependent translocation with the RR-(FG3), RR-(FG5), RR-(FG7), and RR-(FG10) constructs (Fig. 1B). Significant translocation required co-expression of tatABC, indicating Tat dependence of transport. Without co-expression of the tat genes, transport was hardly detectable. The Tat dependence of transport was further confirmed by the analysis of transport with a mutated signal sequence, in which the two arginines were substituted by lysines. Such a substitution efficiently and selectively blocks Tat-dependent translocation (29Halbig D. Wiegert T. Blaudeck N. Freudl R. Sprenger G.A. Eur J Biochem. 1999; 263: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Buchanan G. Sargent F. Berks B.C. Palmer T. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 177: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As expected, the Arg-Arg → Lys-Lys mutation resulted in a block of translocation, as shown for FG5 in Fig. 1C, confirming that the translocation of the RR constructs was indeed Tat-dependent. The data thus demonstrate that unfolded proteins can be translocated by the Tat system up to a size of 20–30 kDa. The translocation efficiency decreased with increasing length until, in the RR-(FG17) construct, the translocation was undetectable, indicating some inverse correlation of size and translocation efficiency. As typically observed with recombinant Tat substrates (31Sturm A. Schierhorn A. Lindenstrauss U. Lilie H. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13972-13978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the translocation of the Tat-compatible constructs was not complete, and precursor as well as signal sequence-degraded mature proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm. The FG repeats were only slightly sensitive to degradation, since predominantly full size and mature size protein was detected. The results thus demonstrate that proteins have to be neither globular nor tightly folded to be compatible with the bacterial Tat system. Hydrophobic Surface Patches Block Tat Transport—The transport of unfolded FG repeats prompted the question of why the other proteins studied thus far required folding to become compatible with the Tat system. Certainly, some tested proteins, such as RR-PhoA, were too large to be translocated in an unfolded conformation. However, also smaller proteins, such as cytochromes, are reported to be incompatible with the Tat system when they cannot fold properly prior to transport (6Sanders C. Wethkamp N. Lill H. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We thus suspected that there are additional characteristics in proteins that are not properly folded that prevent translocation. These characteristics had to be absent in natively unfolded proteins, such as the above described FG repeats, because these polypeptides can be transported by the Tat system. Globular proteins have hydrophobic core regions that contribute to the stability of the protein fold (32Munson M. Balasubramanian S. Fleming K.G. Nagi A.D. O'Brien R. Sturtevant J.M. Regan L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1584-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). When globular proteins are prevented from proper folding (e.g. by not allowing cofactor assembly or disulfide formations), these proteins can expose hydrophobic core regions to the surface. Such hydrophobic patches are absent on the surface of natively unfolded proteins, such as the FG repeats used in this study, which are very polar and highly charged. It thus seemed feasible to suppose that Tat substrates must be polar on their surface. We tested this hypothesis by introducing the residues NIILLI from the hydrophobic core of PhoA into the third repeat of the unfolded RR-(FGn) constructs. A comparison of the hydrophobicity of the constructs with and without the artificial hydrophobic core is shown in Fig. 2A for RR-(FG5). As expected, the highest hydrophobicity is found in the N-terminal signal sequence. In contrast, the mature domain of the translocated RR-(FG5) construct is hydrophilic overall and shows some periodic fluctuations that are due to the repetitive nature of the construct, with slightly hydrophobic regions alternating with entirely hydrophilic regions. Importantly, the introduction of the PhoA hydrophobic core motif results in a punctually increased hydrophobicity at the insertion site in the third repeat, thereby mimicking an exposed hydrophobic core of an unfolded globular protein (Fig. 2A). In the following, we term such hydrophobic core-containing constructs RR-(FGn)-Φ.FIGURE 2Transport analysis of natively unfolded FG domains with introduced hydrophobic cores. A, comparison of the hydropathy of the RR-(FG5) and RR-(FG5)-Φ constructs by the dense alignment surface (DAS) method (43Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). B, transport analyses of the RR-(FG3)-Φ, RR-(FG5)-Φ, RR-(FG7)-Φ, RR-(FG10)-Φ, and RR-(FG17)-Φ constructs in the strain MC4100/pABS-tatABC (tatABC+).

Detection of the constructs in subcellular fractions was as described in the legend to Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When we examined the transport of these constructs, we found that the introduced hydrophobic core region completely blocked Tat-dependent translocation in all cases (Fig. 2B). This block of translocation was independent of the total length of the constructs. We then tested whether the position of the hydrophobic core residues within the unfolded FG repeat constructs had any influence on the block of Tat transport. For that purpose, we introduced the same hydrophobic core residues into the fifth repeat of RR-(FG5), which resulted in the construct RR-(FG5)-Φc. As in the case of RR-(FG5)-Φ, we could not detect any transport with RR-(FG5)-Φc (Fig. 2C). In this experiment, the position of the hydrophobic core residues within the unfolded protein was therefore not relevant. The detailed RR-(FG5) sequence and the positions of the introduced hydrophobic core regions in RR-(FG5)-Φ and RR-(FG5)-Φc are shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The data indicate that already a small number of surface-exposed hydrophobic residues can result in an abortion of Tat-dependent translocation. Hydrophobic Surface Patches Do Not Affect the Unstructured Conformation of the FG Repeats—We analyzed the structure of the five FG repeats (FG5), which was representative for the transported unfolded proteins. The protein was purified by affinity chromatography and cation exchange chromatography and analyzed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Strikingly, all amide proton resonances were found within a narrow region of the 1H/1H TOCSY spectrum between 8.1 and 8.8 ppm, similar to the natively unfolded α-synuclein (33Eliezer D. Kutluay E. Bussell Jr., R. Browne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1061-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 34Lücke C. Gantz D.L. Klimtchuk E. Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1714-1724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), thus indicating the complete absence of secondary structure in the construct (Fig. 3A). This was additionally confirmed by analysis of the side-chain resonances, which for example showed that the resonances of all 15 lysine residues in the construct are essentially superimposed, indicating that there are no structural features present that would cause a variation of these resonances (see supplemental Fig. S2A). These results are in full agreement with the published CD spectroscopy data, which showed that the FG repeats are natively unfolded (25Denning D.P. Patel S.S. Uversky V. Fink A.L. Rexach M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2450-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 35Bayliss R. Kent H.M. Corbett A.H. Stewart M. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 131: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Next, it was important to compare these data with a construct that was blocked in transport due to the introduction of hydrophobic core residues. We therefore purified and analyzed the FG5-Φ construct in the same way. Strikingly, there was hardly any change in the NMR spectra. Again, all amide signals concentrated between 8.1 and 8.8 ppm (Fig. 3B). Few resonance changes occurred due to the six amino acid substitutions, but this had no effect on the unstructured conformation of the construct. Again, this was confirmed by the side-chain resonances of the lysine residues, all of which were found at identical positions (see supplemental Fig. S2B). From these experiments, it can be concluded that (i) the herein tested translocated proteins indeed adopted a fully unfolded conformation and (ii) the introduction of the hydrophobic core residues did not affect the structural properties of the unfolded proteins. Hydrophobic Surface Patches Affect Growth—It is known that recombinant production of Tat signal sequence-fused PhoA (RR-PhoA) causes an inhibition of the growth of cell cultures (12Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This inhibition depends on the twin-arginine motif in the signal sequence, is strongly enhanced by co-expression of the tatABC genes, and is most likely due to effects on membrane integrity (12Richter S. Brüser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42723-42730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The reported effect on membrane integrity could be caused by exposed hydrophobic core residues in unfolded RR-PhoA. When we carried out such growth experiments with a strain that produced the nontransported RR-(FG17) construct and with a strain that produced the twin-lysine derivative of that construct, KK-(FG17), there was hardly any effect on growth upon gene induction, and the minor effects observed clearly did not depend on the twin-arginines (Fig. 4A). The results obtained with constructs of the other lengths were the same (data not shown). However, when we analyzed the effects of RR-(FGn)-Φ derivatives on growth, we found a clear growth inhibition (Fig. 4B). After induction, all strains producing RR-(FGn)-Φ derivatives showed a lowered growth rate, independent of the size of the constructs, whereas the twin-lysine derivatives KK-(FGn)-Φ did not show this effect. Obviously, the introduced hydrophobic core residues were harmful for the cells, but only when they were fused to an intact twin-arginine signal sequence. Hence, the tested specific hydrophobic core sequence was not toxic to the cells per se. This demonstrates the Tat dependence of the growth inhibition and its dependence on the presence of exposed hydrophobic core residues. Since the hydrophobi"

We recently provided evidence for enterocyte MG hydrolysis and demonstrated expression of the monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) gene in human intestinal Caco-2 cells and rodent small intestinal mucosa. Despite the large quantities of MG derived from dietary TG, the regulation of MG metabolism in the intestine has not been previously explored. In the present studies, we examined the mRNA expression, protein expression, and activities of the two known MG-metabolizing enzymes, MGL and MGAT2, in C57BL/6 mouse small intestine, as well as liver and adipose tissues, during development and under nutritional modifications. Results demonstrate that MG metabolism undergoes tissue-specific changes during development. Marked induction of small intestinal MGAT2 protein expression and activity were found during suckling. Moreover, while substantial levels of MGL protein and activity were detected in adult intestine, its regulation during ontogeny was complex, suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of expression. In addition, during the suckling period MG hydrolytic activity is likely to derive from carboxyl ester lipase rather than MGL. In contrast to intestinal MGL, liver MGL mRNA, protein and activity all increased 5–10-fold during development, suggesting that transcriptional regulation is the primary mechanism for hepatic MGL expression. Three weeks of high fat feeding (40% kcal) significantly induced MGL expression and activity in small intestine relative to low fat feeding (10% kcal), but little change was observed upon starvation, suggesting a role for MGL in dietary lipid assimilation following a high fat intake.

Along with fatty acid, it is formed by the action of pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase (PTL) in the intestinal lumen, because PTL preferentially cleaves the sn-1 and 3 positions of TG (1Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W.B. Saunder Co., Philadelphia2002: 125-141Google Scholar). Both hydrolysis products are absorbed as monomers across the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial cell (1Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W.B. Saunder Co., Philadelphia2002: 125-141Google Scholar, 2Ho S.-Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of sn-2-MG uptake into the enterocyte has been demonstrated to be a saturable function of the monomer concentration of sn-2-MG at both apical and basal lateral surfaces of the cell, suggesting carrier-mediated uptake (2Ho S.-Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Murota K. Storch J. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 1626-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). At higher concentrations, a diffusional uptake pathway is also apparent (2Ho S.-Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Murota K. Storch J. J. Nutr. 2005; 135: 1626-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). After absorption, sn-2-MG is rapidly reincorporated into TG in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the so-called monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) pathway, which is catalyzed by two enzymes, MGAT2 and diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Two DGAT isoforms (DGAT1 and 2Ho S.-Y. Storch J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1106-C1117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been identified, and both are expressed in small intestine (4Cases S.

In addition to the MG pathway, the intestine can also synthesize TG via the glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) pathway, which is the dominant TG synthetic pathway in other tissues such as adipose and liver (1Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W.B. Saunder Co., Philadelphia2002: 125-141Google Scholar). In the intestine, however, more than 75% of postprandial TG resynthesis is catalyzed by the MGAT pathway (6Johnston J.M. Rao G.A. Lowe P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 137: 578-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Kayden H.J. Senior J.R. Mattson F.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1967; 46: 1695-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Reesterified TG and apolipoproteins are assembled into chylomicron particles, which are then secreted into the lymphatic circulation. Intestinal MG metabolism has generally been thought to involve only an anabolic pathway, the reesterification to TG via the MGAT pathway. Nevertheless, the presence of a MG hydrolytic activity in small intestine was noted several decades ago (8Pope J.L. McPherson J.C. Tidwell H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2306-2310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the partial purification of MG lipase (MGL; EC 3.1.1.23) activity from rat intestinal mucosa was reported (9De Jong B.J. Kalkman C. Halsmann W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 1393: 119-127Google Scholar). Recently, additional insight into intestinal MG metabolism was obtained. After incubation of Caco-2 cells with sn-2-[3H]MG at either the apical or basal lateral surface, a substantial amount of radioactivity was recovered in the unesterified fatty acid fraction (10Ho S.-Y. Delgado L. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1816-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, human MG lipase mRNA expression was detected in Caco-2 cells, and the murine MG lipase gene (11Karlsson M. Contreras J.A. Hellman U. Tornqvist H. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27218-27223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) was also shown to be expressed in rodent small intestine (10Ho S.-Y. Delgado L. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1816-1823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These results suggested that catabolic processing of sn-2-MG may occur in intestinal mucosa, in addition to the well known anabolic processing. The regulation and function of this MG hydrolytic activity in the enterocyte are at present entirely unknown. On a daily basis, the human small intestine metabolizes an estimated average of 100 g of dietary fat which is composed of more than 90% TG (1Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W.B. Saunder Co., Philadelphia2002: 125-141Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism by which the enterocyte metabolizes sn-2-MG, which is one of the major products of luminal TG hydrolysis and a backbone for TG reesterification, is of great importance for dietary lipid assimilation. Despite this physiological significance, surprisingly little is known about the regulation of intestinal MG metabolism. In the liver, MG metabolism has been shown to be developmentally regulated, with hepatic MGAT activity dramatically higher in the suckling period than in adult rat liver (12Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8934-8938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, nothing is known about the developmental expression of hepatic MGL, nor about the developmental expression of either MGL or MGAT2 in the intestine. Therefore, in the present studies, we examined the expression and activity of the two MG metabolizing enzymes, MGAT and MGL, in intestine as well as liver during ontogeny. Cao et al. (13Cao J. Hawkins E. Brozinick J. Liu X. Zhang H. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol.

It is known that the expression of other genes involved in intestinal lipid metabolism are also altered upon a change in nutritional status. For example, the induction of small intestinal liver fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP) expression by high fat feeding has been reported (14Lin M.C. Arbeeny C. Bergquist K. Kienzle B. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29138-29145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Poirier H. Niot I. Degrace P. Monnot M. Bernard A. Besnard P. Am. J.

Arbeeny C. Bergquist K. Kienzle B. Gordon D.A. Wetterau J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29138-29145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is well known that a standard fasting and refeeding regime markedly alters hepatic lipid metabolism (16Sul H.S. Wang D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 331-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 17Coleman R.A. Lewin T.M. Muoio D.M. Ann. Rev. Nutr. 2000; 20: 77-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), but the influence on intestinal lipid metabolism is less clear. Thus, the effects of nutritional status on intestinal MG metabolism, in comparison with other tissues, were also investigated in the present studies. The results show that MG metabolism is dramatically altered in a tissue-specific manner in both intestine and liver during development and following a high fat diet. Intestinal MGL expression and activity are increased by high fat feeding whereas little or no changes are found in the fasted state, suggesting a potential role for MGL in dietary lipid assimilation. Materials—sn-2-[14C]Monoolein (oleoyl-1-[14C], 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. [14C]Oleoyl-CoA (oleoyl-1-[14C], 57 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Unlabeled sn-2-monoolein was obtained from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Toronto, Canada). The 3% borate impregnated thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates were purchased from Analtech (Newark, DE). Silica gel G TLC plates were obtained from Sigma. Mouse MGL cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. Cecilia Holm (Lund University), and mouse MGAT1 and 2 cDNAs were generously provided by Dr. Robert Farese (UCSF). Antibodies against mouse MGL and MGAT2 sequences were generous gifts from Dr. Daniele Piomelli (UC Irvine) and Dr. Yuguang Shi (Lilly Research Laboratory), respectively. The anit-CEL antibodies were generously provided by Dr. David Hui (University of Cincinnati). β-Actin antibody was purchased from Sigma, and mouse cyclophilin A antibody and cDNA were obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). Animals, Diets, and Tissue Collection—For each developmental regulation study, wild-type mice (C57BL/6, n = 3 at each age) from ages 6 days before birth to 3-months old were reared in the animal facility at Rutgers University. Prenatal mice were obtained from pregnant dams. The day when the vaginal plug was seen was considered as gestational day 0, with embryonic days counted thereafter. Litter size was consistent at 7–10. Animals were maintained on a 12 h light and dark cycle and fed regular chow diet (Purina Mouse Chow 5015, Purina Co., St. Louis, MO) ad libitum after weaning. For the high fat feeding studies, 3-month-old male mice (C57BL/6) were divided into two groups (n = 8 per group). Purified rodent diet (10% fat by calories, from soybean oil) was given to the control group and the high fat group was fed a 40% kcal fat diet containing the additional 30% kcal from coconut oil, rich in short chain saturated fatty acids (D12327 and D12325, respectively, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) for 3 weeks ad libitum. In a second high fat feeding protocol, female mice were divided into three groups (n = 8) and fed with either a 10% kcal fat diet, or high fat diets rich in saturated fat from lard (45 or 60% kcal) for 3 months. (D12450B, D12451, and D12492, respectively, Research Diets). For the starvation and refeeding trial, 3-month-old male mice were divided into 4 groups (n = 7 per group) as follows: fed (Purina Mouse Chow 5015, Purina Co.), starvation for 12 h, starvation for 24 h, and refeeding with a high sucrose diet (D11725, Research Diet) after a 24-h starvation (18Lewin T.M. Granger D.A. Kim J.H. Coleman R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Kim T.-S. Freake H.C. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Animals were sacrificed using CO2, and the entire small intestine from pylorus to cecum was immediately excised. For the nutritional regulation studies, the intestine was rinsed twice with saline and then the mucosa was harvested by scraping. For developmental studies, whole intestine was collected followed by rinsing. Samples were immediately frozen on dry ice and kept at –70 °C. Liver and adipose tissue (peri-renal and epididymal fat) were also collected, snap frozen on dry ice, and stored at –70 °C. Northern Blot Analysis of MGL and MGAT1 and 2 mRNA Expression—Tissues were homogenized in Solution D (4 m guanidinium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol) using several strokes of a Polytron. Total RNA was further purified by phenol extraction. For detecting MGAT2 transcript in liver, poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using a Qiagen mRNA extraction kit. 20–40 μg of total RNA or 2 μgof poly(A)+ RNA were loaded onto 1% agarose gels, separated by electrophoresis, and transferred onto nylon membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Full-length coding regions of MGL, MGAT1, and MGAT2 cDNA were labeled with 32P (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Random Prime labeling system (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were prehybridized for 1 h and hybridized for 2–3 h at 68 °C using Quik-hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blots were washed twice at room temperature with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min. An additional high temperature (65 °C) wash with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min was completed before exposing the blots to a PhosphorImager screen. Quantification was done using the Molecular Dynamics STORM scanner and Image-QuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Blots were stripped and reprobed with 18S rRNA cDNA or mouse cyclophilin A cDNA for internal loading controls. Quantitative RT-PCR for Intestinal MGL mRNA Expression—Relative MGL mRNA expression in small intestine was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (SYBR Green method). Total RNA was extracted as described above and further purified using the RNeasy clean up kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) along with DNase 1 treatment to minimize genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 μg of total RNA, random primer, RNase inhibitor and AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega Madison, WI) in a total volume of 25 μl. Primer sequences for MGL and β-actin (endogenous control) were retrieved from Primer Bank (Harvard Medical School QPCR primer data base), as follows: MGL: forward 5′-CAGAGAGGCCAACCTACTTTTC-3′, reverse 5′-ATGCGCCCCAAGGTCATATTT-3′; β-actin: forward 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′, reverse 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′. Efficiencies of PCR amplification for both primers were tested during preliminary experiments and similar PCR efficiencies were confirmed. Real time PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using an Applied Biosystems 7300 instrument. Each reaction contained 80 ng of cDNA, 250 nm of each primer, and 12.5 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a total volume of 25 μl. Relative quantification of MGL expression was calculated using the comparative Ct method normalized to β-actin. Western Blot Analysis of Protein Expression—Tissues were homogenized in 5–10 volumes of homogenization buffer on ice for 30 s. using a Wheaton tissue homogenizer (Wheaton Science, Millville, NJ), and crude tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cell debris. Homogenization buffer contained 50 mm Tri-HCl and 0.32 m sucrose (pH 8) with 0.5% (v/v) protease inhibitors (Sigma 8340). For MGAT2 detection, a total membrane fraction was obtained by further ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h at 4 °C). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). 30–50 μg of total cell protein or 5–10 μg of membrane protein were loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gels and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a semi-dry transfer system (BioRad) for 1 h at 20V. All membranes were incubated in a 5% nonfat dry milk blocking solution overnight at 4 °C and then probed with primary antibody for 1 h. Dilution of the anti-mMGL antibody was 1:5,000–10,000, and for anti-mMGAT2 dilution was 1:1,000. Dilution of the anti-CEL antibody was 1:1,000. After washing three times, blots were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate at 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h and then developed by chemiluminescence (ECL reagent, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). Blots were stripped and reprobed with mouse β-actin (Sigma) or cyclophilin A antibody (Ambion) as indicated to check the integrity of the sample and as loading controls. Quantification of protein bands was conducted using Image J software (NIH). In Vitro MGL Assay—The MGL assay was established in the laboratory based on previous reports (9De Jong B.J. Kalkman C. Halsmann W.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 1393: 119-127Google Scholar, 21Dinh T.P. Carpenter D. Leslie F.M. Freund T.F. Katona I. Sensi S.L. Kathuria S. Piomelli D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10819-10824Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar), and measures the release of fatty acid from sn-2-MG. The purity of sn-2-[14C]monoolein (labeled on the fatty acyl chain, 55 mCi/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals) was checked using 3% borate-impregnated TLC plates and a solvent system of CHCl3/acetone/methanol/acetic acid (90:5:2:0.5, v/v). The sn-2-[14C]monoolein was >90% pure. 14C-radiolabeled sn-2-monoolein was mixed with unlabeled sn-2-monoolein to obtain the desired concentrations. The mixture of 14C-radiolabeled and unlabeled sn-2-monoolein was dried under N2 gas, and 0.125 m Tris-HCl buffer containing 1.25% bovine serum albumin was added. Substrate emulsions were prepared by brief sonication (1 min) on ice. 0.4 ml of substrate emulsion containing sn-2-monoolein was allocated in each reaction tube. Samples containing 100–200 μg of protein were introduced as an enzyme source. Reaction conditions for each tissue were optimized during preliminary experiments to ensure linearity with time and protein concentration. 2.5 mmsn-2-monoolein was used for liver and adipose tissue MGL assays, and 25 μm was used for intestine samples. The reaction was initiated by adding tissue homogenate. Liver and adipose tissue samples were incubated for 5 min and intestinal samples for 10 min at 23 °C. Lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and the organic phase was subjected to TLC analysis. To monitor isomerization of substrate, 3% borate-impregnated TLC plates (Analtech, Newark, DE) were used for separation of lipids. Spontaneous isomerization to the sn-1 isomer (20–30%) was always accounted for when determining the enzyme activity. All reaction times and temperatures were optimized to minimize spontaneous isomerization during the assay. Quantification of the specific activity of 14C-labeled end products separated by TLC was done using the Molecular Dynamics STORM scanner and ImageQuaNT software. On each plate, known amounts of specific radioactivity of [14C]oleate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were spotted and used for formulating standard curves to calculate enzyme activities for each sample. In Vitro MGAT Assay—The MGAT assay followed a well established protocol based on the method of Coleman and Haynes (12Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8934-8938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Activity was measured as the incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA into diacylglycerol (DG). 25 μm oleoyl-CoA and 250 μmsn-2-monoolein (Doosan Serdary Research) were used as substrates. [14C]Oleoyl-CoA was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (57 mCi/mmol) and cold oleoyl-CoA was purchased from Sigma. The assay buffer contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm each of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine. 5 or 10 μg of membrane fraction protein, prepared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, were used as the enzyme source. The enzyme assay was initiated by adding [14C]oleoyl-CoA, and incubation was for 5 min at 25 °C. Lipids were extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and the organic phase was subjected to TLC analysis using standard silica gel plates (Sigma) and a solvent system of hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid, 70:30:1, v/v. The plates were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen to visualize incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA into neutral lipids. Specific activities found in the DG fraction plus half of the TG fractions were considered as MGAT activity (12Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8934-8938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yen C.-L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Quantification of each lipid fraction was analyzed using ImageQuaNT software. Developmental Regulation of Intestinal MGL and MGAT2—Changes in mRNA and protein expression of the two MG-metabolizing enzymes, as well as both enzyme activities were determined over the course of intestinal ontogeny. The results showed a relatively abundant expression of MGL mRNA at early developmental stages, declining thereafter to a lower but detectable level (Fig. 1A). The expression pattern for MGL protein over the same time period was not consistent with the changes in its mRNA expression. MGL protein was detected in prenatal and adult intestine but not in the suckling period (Fig. 1B). MGL activity was measured as the release of radiolabeled fatty acid from sn-2-[14C]monoolein, and it was found that activity increased throughout intestinal development, plateauing at a relatively high level after day 6 (Fig. 1C). Thus, MGL activity shows discrepancies with the expression of both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1D), particularly during the suckling period. We hypothesized that carboxyl ester lipase (CEL; also known as bile salt-stimulated lipase), another enzyme with known sn-2-monoacylglycerol hydrolytic activity, might be present in suckling intestine. The results in Fig. 1E show that CEL protein was detected in neonatal intestine at approximately equivalent levels to those in adult intestine. For intestinal MGAT2, mRNA levels were very low at day –6 but then rose and remained relatively constant from day –3 to day +90 (Fig. 2A). Protein and activity levels were also very low at day –6 and increased thereafter; both appeared to be up-regulated during the early suckling period, and declined thereafter (Fig. 2, B and C). Developmental Regulation of Hepatic MGL and MGAT2—In marked contrast to intestinal MGL, similar patterns were observed for liver MGL mRNA, protein, and activity levels. All were increased 5–10-fold during development (Fig. 3D), suggesting that transcriptional regulation is the primary mechanism of hepatic MGL expression (Fig. 3, A, B, and C). It has been reported that the MGAT1 transcript was detected in adult mouse liver by Northern analysis (22Yen C.-L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); however, we were unable to detect MGAT1 in the present studies. The reason for the discrepancy is unknown. As described below, the MGAT1 transcript was detected in adipose tissue, in agreement with Yen et al. (22Yen C.-L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The MGAT2 transcript was readily detected in 2 μg of liver mRNA, consistent with the report of Cao et al. (23Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, the present results for mRNA regulation in liver represent changes in the MGAT2 transcript during ontogeny. In contrast to the developmental pattern found for hepatic MGL, hepatic MGAT2 mRNA was detected during the pre- and post-natal stages but declined after day 6 (Fig. 4A). MGAT activity levels were generally consistent with this pattern of mRNA expression (Fig. 4B), suggesting that, as for hepatic MGL, transcription is the predominant mechanism of MGAT regulation in the liver during development. Overall, an inverse regulation of MGAT and MGL during ontogeny was found in liver (Figs. 3 and 4); however such reciprocal regulation of the two MG-metabolizing enzymes was not found in small intestine (Figs. 1 and 2). Because liver TG content has been reported to decline to low adult levels during development in the rat (24Waterman I.J. Price N.T. Zammit V.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1555-1562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 25Jamdar S.C. Moon M. Bow S. Fallon H.J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 763-770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether a similar decline is found in mouse liver. The results in Fig. 4D show that TG levels in adult mouse liver are 5-fold lower than those found in day 0 liver. Nutritional Control of Intestinal MGL and MGAT2—To examine the effect of an increased substrate supply on intestinal MGL, 3-month-old C57BL/6 male mice were fed either a high fat (40% kcal) or standard fat diet (10% kcal) for 3 weeks. Body weight was significantly elevated in the high fat fed group, along with a marked increase in total fat pad weight, nearly 4-fold greater than control (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, we found that intestinal MGL protein expression increased 2–3-fold, and significant elevations in MG hydrolysis in small intestine were observed following high fat feeding (Fig. 5C). Relative mRNA levels of MGL were determined by quantitative RT-PCR, and also showed a consistent induction although it did not reach statistical significance. A similar result was observed in a relatively long term, 3-month high fat feeding study (10, 45, or 60% kcal), though the response was somewhat blunted compared with results from the short term feeding study (results not shown). In contrast to this induction by a high fat challenge, starvation up to 24 h did not significantly alter MGL expression and activity (Fig. 5E). These results show that upon increased lipid flux to the enterocyte, MG catabolism was stimulated, but fasting did not"

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but the RNase activity is dispensable.

It lacks a hydrophobic region that could serve as a transmembrane anchor, and there is also no consensus sequence for GPI anchor addition. Nevertheless, Erns is bound to the virion and is found associated with membranes when expressed within cells (8Rümenapf T. Unger G. Strauss J.H. Thiel H.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thiel H.J. Stark R. Weiland E. Rümenapf T. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4705-4712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Weiland F. Weiland E.

We could show before that Erns of BVDV CP7 interacts with membranes through its COOH terminus and that truncation of the COOH terminus leads to abrogation of the membrane association and nearly complete secretion of the protein (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The sequence of the Erns COOH terminus contains only about 50% hydrophobic amino acid residues. For the Erns protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), it was proposed that the COOH terminus is able to form an amphipathic helix (39Langedijk J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5308-5314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Amphipathic helices are known to be able to act as membrane anchors, as was shown for a variety of cellular and viral proteins (40Brass V. Bieck E. Montserret R. Wolk B. Hellings J.A. Blum H.E.

In the present report, we analyzed the nature of the Erns membrane anchor in more detail. The results allow conclusions on the secondary structure of the carboxyl-terminal end and its interaction with membranes. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time evidence for a glycoprotein anchored in plane in the membrane by an amphipathic helix. Cells and Viruses—MDBK and PK15 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). SK6 cells were obtained from A. Summerfield (IVI, Mittelhäusern, Switzerland). BHK-21 cells were kindly provided by T. Rümenapf (Universität Giessen, Germany). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and nonessential amino acids. Vaccinia viruses MVA-T7 (49Wyatt L.S. Moss B. Rozenblatt S. Virology. 1995; 210: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and vTF 7-3 (50Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by B. Moss (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Immunofluorescence Assay—For immunofluorescence assays using selective permeabilization, cells were grown in μ-dishes (Ibidi, München, Germany), fixed with paraformaldehyde (4% in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) for 20 min at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS, permeabilized with 5 μg/ml digitonin in permeabilization buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA) for 15 min at 4 °C or 1% Triton in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and washed again twice with PBS. The cells were then incubated with the appropriate antibodies. After three washes with PBS, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-species antibodies (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) were used to detect antibodies bound to viral antigen in the immunofluorescence assays. For immunofluorescence assays after electroporation or infection of cells, cells were grown on coverslips. Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (in PBS without Mg2+ and Ca2+). Cells were then incubated as described with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. For double labeling experiments, both primary antibodies were mixed. In this case, also secondary antibodies (TRITC-labeled) (Sigma) and FITC-labeled secondary antibodies were mixed. The rabbit anti-Erns serum was kindly provided by R. Stark and H.-J. Thiel (Universität Giessen). Fluorescence analysis was done with an Axiovert microscope using ApoTome technology (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Construction of Plasmids—Construct pB-Erns was described before (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All single codon insertion or substitution constructs used in this study were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using synthetic primers and pB-Erns as template. Mutants containing insertions of more than one alanine were generated using synthetic linkers ligated into the respective single insertion construct, which were cut with the appropriate enzyme (AfeI or HindIII, depending on the construct). The sequences of primers and linkers are available on request. Mutations in the Erns gene were incorporated in the infectious clone pA/BVDV (51Meyers G. Tautz N. Becher P. Thiel H.J. Kümmerer B. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8606-8613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through a two-step cloning strategy. The sequence containing the respective mutations was transferred into a plasmid containing the BVDV sequence from a XhoI site to a NotI site using BamHI and NdeI. A larger sequence now containing the mutation was transferred into the infectious clone using restriction enzymes XhoI and NcoI. Plasmid HHBiI “w”UbiNS3 was a very kind gift of Norbert Tautz (Universität Giessen) and is a modified version of plasmid Bi-NS3 described in Ref. 52Tautz N. Harada T. Kaiser A. Rinck G. Behrens S.E. Thiel H.J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9422-9432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. This bicistronic plasmid contains the pestivirus 5′-untranslated region followed by the gene for β-glucuronidase. Downstream of this is located an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site (EMCV IRES) that initiates translation of an open reading frame composed of a ubiquitin gene and the BVDV CP7 cDNA sequence from the NS3 gene to the 3′-untranslated region. Sequences for Erns variants were amplified using primers containing BssHI and FseI restriction sites and cloned into the plasmid HHBiI “w”UbiNS3, replacing the β-glucuronidase gene. Plasmid pCSFV/ΔErns is based on a variant of the infectious clone for CSFV Alfort/Tübingen pA/CSFV (53Meyers G. Thiel H.J. Rümenapf T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1588-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and contains an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. pCSFV/ΔErns contains the full-length genome with a deletion of codons 268–490, thus lacking the Erns coding sequence. The cloned constructs were all verified by nucleotide sequencing with the BigDye terminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). Sequence analysis and alignments were done with Genetics Computer Group software (54Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar). Further details of the cloning procedure are available from the authors upon request. Expression plasmids pTM/E1-HA and pTM/E2-HA were a kind gift of L. Cocquerel and J. Dubuisson and are described in Ref. 55Cocquerel L. Op De B.A. Lambot M. Roussel J. Delgrange D. Pillez A. Wychowski C. Penin F. Dubuisson J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2893-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar. Transient Expression of Proteins in Transfected Cells—BHK-21 cells were infected with vaccinia virus MVA-T7, subsequently transfected with plasmid DNA using SuperFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and labeled with 35S-labeled amino acids as described earlier (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Membrane Fractionation of Infected and Transfected Cells—The supernatants (fraction 1) of infected and transfected cells (about 2 × 106 in 3.5-cm dishes) were removed. The cells were fractionated essentially as described previously (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 56Shmulevitz M. Duncan R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 902-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested by scraping them into 1.5 ml of PBS and then passaged 12 times through a 27-gauge needle. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 700 × g for 3 min. The pellet of this centrifugation step was collected (fraction 2), and from the supernatant, the membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 125,000 × g (55,000 rpm; rotor TLA100.3; Beckman TL100 centrifuge) for 25 min (fraction 3) (includes also mitochondria). The supernatant of this centrifugation step (fraction 4) contained the water-soluble proteins. All pellets were resuspended in 1× RIP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.6). All samples were denatured by the addition of 1% SDS and heating to 95 °C for 5 min before they were cooled on ice. Samples were sonicated and brought to the final concentration of 0.3% SDS by the addition of 1× RIP buffer before using them in immunoprecipitation experiments. Proteinase K Protection Assay—Proteins were translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega) and canine microsomal membranes (Promega) according to the manufacturers' protocols in a total volume of 25 μl. Proteins were labeled with [35S]methionine (MP Biochemicals, Eschwege, Germany). For in vitro translation, RNA was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) essentially as described before (53Meyers G. Thiel H.J. Rümenapf T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1588-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of 10 μlofthe in vitro translation samples were treated with 0.3 units of proteinase K in the presence or absence of 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice. Samples were inactivated by the addition of 2 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 mm), treated with SDS-PAGE buffer, heated to 95 °C, and cooled on ice. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was carried out essentially as described before (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). One-tenth of each fraction was used in immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of rabbit anti-Erns serum. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h and 4 °C for another 1 h, Formaldehyde-fixed Staphylococcus aureus was added, and the antibody-bound proteins were recovered by centrifugation (57Kessler S.W. Method Enzymol. 1981; 73: 442-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). SDS sample buffer was added, and the complete sample was analyzed by gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and subsequent quantification on a phosphor imager (Fujifilm imaging plate (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and Fujifilm BAS-1500 phosphor imager (Raytest)). Computer-aided determination of the intensities of the respective signals was carried out with TINA 2.0 software (Raytest). To test for quantitative precipitation, representative samples were precipitated a second time. We had already shown before that this leads to a quantitative precipitation of Erns with our Erns-specific antiserum (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The distribution of the proteins between the fractions was almost constant, with only a slight increase in the supernatant after the double precipitation. The difference between single and double precipitation was negligible for the membrane-bound protein, so that for the current project regarding only the relation of the amount of the membrane-bound protein, double precipitation was not deemed necessary. Electroporation—Electroporation was used to transfect cells with RNA. RNA was generated by in vitro transcription using T7 (for pA/BVDV based plasmids) or SP6 polymerase (for pA/CSFV-based plasmids and HHBiI “w”UbiNS3-based plasmids) essentially as described before (53Meyers G. Thiel H.J. Rümenapf T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1588-1595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmids were linearized beforehand using SmaI. SK6 (for all complementation experiments) or MDBK (for pA/BVDV-based plasmids) cells were freshly seeded into a 10.0-cm diameter dish and left to grow overnight to 100% confluence. On the day of electroporation, cells were harvested using trypsin, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 1.6 ml of PBS. 0.5 ml of this cell suspension were mixed with the appropriate RNA and electroporated using 2-mm gap cuvettes by two pulses at 200 V and 500 microfarads in a gene pulser (Bio-Rad). Cells were resuspended in 5.5 ml of medium, 2 ml were seeded in a 3.5-mm diameter dish containing a coverslip, and the rest were seeded in a second 3.5-mm diameter dish. Cells seeded onto the coverslip were incubated 20–22 h. Afterward, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were washed, fixed, and used in immunofluorescence experiments. The second part of electroporated cells was incubated for 60 h, harvested through freeze/thaw cycles, and used for infection of fresh cells. Infection of Cells—To detect the formation of infectious particles, MDBK (for pA/BVDV-based viruses) and PK15 cells (for complementation experiments) were grown to 60% confluence on coverslips. Cells were washed with standard medium without fetal calf serum or antibiotics and infected with 0.5 ml of supernatant/lysate of electroporated cells in 1 ml of medium without fetal calf serum or antibiotics. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and washed twice with PBS. Afterward, cells were incubated for 48 h under standard conditions before being used in immunofluorescence assays. Insertion of a Single Alanine Residue at Different Positions in the Erns COOH Terminus Leads to Severely Reduced Membrane Association—The pestivirus Erns protein has long been known to be secreted from infected cells and also to be associated with the virion (8Rümenapf T. Unger G. Strauss J.H. Thiel H.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3288-3295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Thiel H.J. Stark R. Weiland E. Rümenapf T. Meyers G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 4705-4712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hulst M.M. Moormann R.J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We could show before that the COOH terminus of Erns is responsible for membrane association of the protein and is also able to tether a foreign protein to membranes (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which this association is accomplished remained unclear. Secondary structure predictions suggest the formation of a helix in the BVDV Erns COOH-terminal region, and a look at the distribution of polar versus hydrophobic residues in this putative helix shows that it would display amphipathic characteristics (Fig. 1). Thus, Erns could be anchored in the membrane by an amphipathic helix. To test this hypothesis, a series of single alanine insertion mutants of Erns was established. The insertion of an alanine in the region of the putative helix would introduce a 100° turn of the region downstream of the inserted residue with respect to the region preceding the insertion. Dependent on the position of the inserted residue within the helix, the amphipathic character of the polypeptide structure would be destroyed (central location of insertion) or at least weakened (distal location of extra alanine). Expression plasmids coding for Erns proteins with single alanine insertions between amino acid positions 159 and 219 were constructed (Fig. 2A). The viral sequence was inserted downstream of an IRES under control of a phage T7 promoter. The mutated proteins were expressed in BHK-21 cells using the vaccinia MVA-T7 system. Distribution of the Erns protein in the cell and supernatant was analyzed by fractionation via differential centrifugation and subsequent immunoprecipitation, followed by protein quantification. First, the cell culture supernatant containing secreted proteins (fraction 1) was removed. Then the cells were scraped from the dish into PBS and disrupted by passage through a 27-gauge needle. From the cell lysate, the gross cell debris and nuclei were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, leading to fraction 2. From the cleared lysate the membranes, mitochondria and associated proteins (fraction 3) were collected by high speed centrifugation, leaving water-soluble proteins in the supernatant (fraction 4). Erns was precipitated from equivalent amounts of the individual fractions with a specific anti-Erns rabbit serum and detected after PAGE by autoradiography or phosphor imager analysis (Fig. 2B). The amount of Erns in each fraction was determined via measurement of the total amount of labeled Erns present in all four fractions and calculation of the percentage present in the individual fraction. As shown before, fraction 2 does not contain detectable amounts of soluble proteins (37Fetzer C. Tews B.A. Meyers G. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 11901-11913Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), so that the total amount of membrane-bound proteins was determined by combining the values of fractions 2 and 3. Wild type (WT) Erns shows a high degree of membrane association and a rather low but consistently observed level of secretion. The apparent molecular weight of the secreted protein is higher due to the changes in glycosylation that occur on the way through the ER and Golgi. On the average, 87% of WT Erns protein remained membrane-bound. In contrast to the results obtained for the WT protein, the majority of the insertion mutants showed much higher rates of secretion and in consequence reduced rates of membrane binding. Again, only low amounts of soluble intracellular protein were found (Fig. 2B). All experiments were done at least in triplicate, and the results were statist"
https://openalex.org/W2044389479,"Free-energy transfer was used to study water transport through the soil-plant system. Resistances to free-energy transfer are proportional to resistances to water transfer. Under certain conditions, the proportionality factor is 1. For a sunflower plant in moist soil, plant resistance to free-energy transfer was 30 times the soil resistance, and root-stem-leaf resistances were in a ratio of about 2 : 1 : 1, respectively. However, root and leaf resistances were equal when considered for a unit pathlength."
https://openalex.org/W2083112589,"Defective folding of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein missing Phe508 (ΔF508) is the major cause of cystic fibrosis. The folding defect in ΔF508 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator might be correctable because misfolding of a P-glycoprotein (P-gp; ABCB1) mutant lacking the equivalent residue (ΔY490) could be corrected with drug substrates or by introduction of an arginine residue into transmembrane (TM) segments 5 (I306R) or 6 (F343R). Possible mechanisms of arginine rescue were that they mimicked some of the effects of drug substrate interactions with P-gp or that they affected global folding such that all drug substrate/modulator interactions with P-gp were altered. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we tested whether arginines introduced into other TMs predicted to line the drug-binding pocket (TM1 or TM3) would affect folding. It was found that mutation of L65R(TM1) or T199R(TM3) promoted maturation of processing mutants. We then tested whether arginine suppressor mutations had local or global effects on P-gp interactions with drug substrates and modulators. The L65R(TM1), T199R(TM3), I306R(TM5), or F343R(TM6) mutations were introduced into the P-gp mutant L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), and thiol cross-linking was carried out in the presence of various concentrations of vinblastine, cyclosporin A, or rhodamine B. The presence of arginine residues reduced the apparent affinity of P-gp for vinblastine (L65R, T199R, and I306R), cyclosporin (I306R and F343R), or rhodamine B (F343R) by 4–60-fold. These results show that the arginine mutations affect a subset of drug-binding sites and suggest that they rescue processing mutants by mimicking drug substrate interactions with P-gp.

These results show that the arginine mutations affect a subset of drug-binding sites and suggest that they rescue processing mutants by mimicking drug substrate interactions with P-gp. Defective folding of a mutant membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or trafficking to its normal cellular destination is responsible for many inherited diseases. The protein usually has a deletion or substitution of an amino acid (1Sanders C.R. Kim J.K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) leading to their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum and subsequent degradation by the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation system (2Brodsky J.L.

A classic example of a genetic disease caused by an amino acid change in a membrane protein is cystic fibrosis. The most common cause of cystic fibrosis is deletion of Phe508 (ΔF508) in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; ABCC7) 2The abbreviations used are: CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; M14M, 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1,14-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate; TM, transmembrane; TMD, transmembrane domain containing either the six NH2- or COOH-terminal transmembrane segments; NBD, nucleotide-binding domain; HEK, human embryonic kidney; TPCK, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. protein. The ΔF508 mutation causes misfolding of CFTR such that the amount of mature CFTR at the cell surface is reduced from about 25% (wild type) to less than 1% (3Lukacs G.L. Kim A. Kartner N. Chang X.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25710-25718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important goal in developing a treatment for protein-folding diseases is to correct folding/trafficking defects in the mutant proteins. The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) is a useful model system for studying protein misfolding because processing mutations can be rescued with drug substrates (reviewed in Ref. 5Loo T.W. Kim D.M. Expert. Rev. Mol. Med. 2007; 9: 1-1810.1017/S1462399407000361Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). P-gp is an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein that uses ATP to transport a variety of cytotoxic compounds out of the cell (6Sauna Z.E. Kim S.V. Mol.

It has two homologous halves that are joined by a linker region (8Chen C.J. Kim J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1986; 47: 381-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). Each half has a transmembrane domain (TMD) containing six transmembrane (TM) segments and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The drug-binding pocket is at the interface between the two TMDs (9Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 10Pleban K. Kim S. Csaszar E. Peer M. Hrebicek T. Rizzi A. Ecker G.F. Chiba P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and a P-gp mutant lacking both NBDs retained the ability to bind drug substrates (11Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The drug-binding pocket is relatively large and can simultaneously bind different drug substrates (12Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39706-39710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 13Lugo M.R. Kim F.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 14020-14029Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Drug substrate binding likely occurs by an “induced fit” mechanism (14Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Deletion of residue Tyr490 (ΔY490) in P-gp, which is equivalent to Phe508 in CFTR, also results in protein misfolding (15Hoof T. Kim A. Hadam M.R. Riordan J.R. Tummler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20575-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ΔY490 P-gp mutant protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by molecular chaperones (16Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant could be rescued, however, by carrying out expression in the presence of drug substrates or modulators (pharmacological chaperones) (17Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It was not known whether drug substrates promoted maturation of P-gp processing mutants through direct interaction with the TMDs of the protein (11Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or indirectly by affecting protein folding pathways such as stress-induced changes in the levels of molecular chaperones (18Goldfarb S.B. Kim O.B. Watkins J.N. Suaud L. Yan W. Kleyman T.R. Rubenstein R.C. Proc. Nat.l Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5817-5822Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 19Harada K. Kim T. Hashimoto Y.

Recent evidence suggests that drug substrates promoted maturation of P-gp processing mutants by a direct mechanism because suppressor mutations (arginines) introduced into TM segments 5 (I306R) and 6 (F343R) also promoted maturation of the protein (21Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29436-29440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One explanation for this observation was that the arginine residues mimicked the effects of drug substrates by promoting interactions among the TM segments. A recent study on the effect of silent polymorphisms suggested that an alternative mechanism for arginine rescue was that they affected global folding events during synthesis (22Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Kim J.M. Kim I.W. Sauna Z.E. Calcagno A.M. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Science. 2007; 315: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Silent single-nucleotide polymorphisms in a gene that change codon usage would not be expected to alter structure or function of a protein because they do not change the amino acid sequence. An unexpected finding was the observation that silent polymorphisms that introduced rare codons into the MDR1 gene yielded a P-gp that was more protease-resistant than wild-type enzyme and, more importantly, exhibited altered interactions with all substrates and modulators. The likely mechanism of the rare codons was to slow the timing of co-translational folding and insertion into the membrane to change the conformation of P-gp and the structure of all its drug substrate-binding sites (22Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Kim J.M. Kim I.W. Sauna Z.E. Calcagno A.M. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Science. 2007; 315: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Arginines introduced into TMs 5 or 6 could have had a similar effect because the TM5–TM6 hairpin is critical for folding because mutations in these segments could influence distal folding events (23Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32373-32376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, packing of the TM segments appears to be the rate-limiting step in folding of ABC transporters because it is the only step that occurs post-translationally (24Kleizen B. Kim T. de Jonge H.R. Braakman I. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these mechanisms, we tested whether arginines introduced into other TM segments predicted to be less important for folding (TMs 1 and 3) would still promote maturation of processing mutants. TM1 does not appear to be critical for post-translational folding because P-gp in which TM1 is replaced by TM7 (60% of the amino acids are different) was properly folded and exhibited activity (25Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15414-15419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also, in cysteine-scanning mutagenesis studies involving the NH2-terminal half of P-gp, it was found that changes to some residues in TMs 2 and 4 but not in TM3 inhibited maturation of P-gp (26Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, TM3 also appeared to be relatively less important for folding. Because TMs 1 and 3 appear to be less important for folding of P-gp, we wanted to insert arginine residues at sites predicted to line the drug-binding pocket and test whether they promoted maturation of processing mutants and had local or global effects on the drug-binding sites. We previously showed using cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and labeling with a thiol-reactive drug substrate, methanethiosulfonate-verapamil (MTS-verapamil), that residue Leu65 lined the drug-binding pocket of P-gp (27Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). No amino acid in TM3 has yet been identified to line the drug-binding pocket. It is likely, however, that TM3 is important for drug binding because it is highly labeled with photoaffinity analogs of the drug substrate, propafenone (10Pleban K. Kim S. Csaszar E. Peer M. Hrebicek T. Rizzi A. Ecker G.F. Chiba P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, another goal of this study was to identify a specific residue in TM3 that lined the drug-binding pocket. Interaction of drug substrates such as verapamil or rhodamine B with P-gp can readily be detected because they stimulate its ATPase activity. Our initial approach to identify residues within the TM segments that line the drug-binding pocket was to utilize cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and test for inhibition of ATPase activity after reaction with thiol-reactive MTS derivatives of verapamil (9Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) or rhodamine (28Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The ATPase activity of residues predicted to line the drug-binding pocket was inhibited after labeling, and labeling could be protected with drug substrates. A consistent feature of the labeling and protection studies with thiol-reactive analogs of drug substrates was that equivalent TM segments in the two halves of the protein appeared to line the drug-binding pocket. Examples include TMs 4 and 10 (28Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), TMs 6 and 12 (28Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and TMs 1 and 7 (27Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It was shown that TM9 in the COOH-terminal half of P-gp contributes to the drug-binding pocket (28Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 30Song J. Kim P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but no evidence was found that TM3 also contributed to drug binding (i.e. inhibition of activity was not protectable by drug substrate). It was then noted that P-gp was an unusual transporter because covalent attachment of a drug substrate to the protein could also cause permanent activation of its ATPase activity (29Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was possible that labeling of a cysteine in TM3 might result in activation rather than inhibition of ATPase activity. Accordingly, we tested whether labeling of any cysteine residues introduced into TM3 would activate P-gp ATPase activity and be a candidate for testing whether replacement of the residue with an arginine would promote maturation of a processing mutant. Construction of Mutants—Cysteines at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227 in wild-type P-gp were changed to alanine to create cysteine-less P-gp (32Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Single cysteines residues were introduced at each position (residues 190–209) in TM3 in Cys-less P-gp. All of the mutants also contained a 10-histidine tag at the COOH-end to facilitate purification of P-gp by nickel-chelate chromatography (33Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For disulfide cross-linking analysis, the cDNA of mutant L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7) (34Wang Y. Kim T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) was modified to also encode the L65R, T199R, I306R, or F343R mutations. Expression of Mutants, Purification, and Measurement of ATPase Activity—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transiently transfected with the mutant P-gp cDNAs as described previously (33Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h before harvest to promote maturation of the protein. The cysteine mutants were incubated at low temperature to promote maturation because mutation of the seven endogenous cysteines in P-gp to alanines reduces the efficiency of maturation of Cys-less P-gp relative to wild-type enzyme (32Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged P-gp was isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography as described previously (33Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A sample of the isolated histidine-tagged P-gp was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml sheep brain phosphatidylethanolamine (Type II-S; Sigma) that had been washed and suspended in Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl). The sample was sonicated, and ATPase activity was measured in the absence of drug substrate or in the presence of various concentrations of rhodamine B (0.01–3 mm), verapamil (0.001–3 mm), vinblastine (0.6–60 μm), or colchicine (0.1–10 mm). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was determined (35Chifflet S. Kim A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Reaction of P-gp Mutants with MTS-Rhodamine—Histidine-tagged TM3 single cysteine mutants were expressed in thirty plates (10-cm diameter) of HEK 293 cells. The cells were then incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. The cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and then suspended in a total volume of 1.5 ml of nitrilotriacetic acid-phosphate-buffered saline buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl). The cells were solubilized by the addition of an equal volume of nitrilotriacetic acid-phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 2% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. DNA was removed from the supernatant by passage through a miniprep plasmid DNA spin column (Qiagen). Half of the supernatant (1.3 ml) was then incubated with the desired concentration of MTS-rhodamine (0.01–3 mm) for 10 min at 20 °C, whereas the remaining sample served as an untreated control. In the drug protection studies, the solubilized material was preincubated with 5 mm rhodamine B (saturating concentrations) for 10 min at 20 °C prior to labeling with 1 mm MTS-rhodamine. The samples were then cooled in an ice bath, followed by the addition of 0.15 ml of 3 m NaCl and 0.05 ml of 1 m imidazole, pH 7.0). Histidine-tagged P-gp was then isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography as described previously (33Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The recovery of P-gp was monitored by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-P-gp polyclonal antibody (33Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—The double cysteine mutants L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), L65R(TM1)/L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), T199R(TM3)/L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), I306R(TM5)/L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7), or F343R(TM6)/L339C(TM6)/F728C(TM7) were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells (32Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The membranes were prepared and suspended in Tris-buffered saline. A sample of the membrane was then incubated in the presence or absence of various concentrations of vinblastine, cyclosporin A, or rhodamine B for 5 min at 20 °C. The samples were then cooled on ice for 10 min and treated with 0.2 mm of the homobifunctional MTS cross-linker 3,6,9,12-tetraoxatetradecane-1, 14-diyl bismethanethiosulfonate (M14M, 20.8 Å) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada) for 4 min on ice (36Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol and 4% (w/v) SDS) containing 50 mm EDTA and no reducing agent. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5% polyacrylamide gels) and immunoblot analysis with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against P-gp (32Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Intramolecular disulfide cross-linking between TMD1 and TMD2 can be detected because the cross-linked product migrates with a slower mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (29Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The gel lanes were scanned, and the amount of cross-linked product was quantitated using the NIH Image program (available at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image1) and an Apple computer. Limited Proteolysis with Trypsin—HEK 293 cells expressing mutants G251V, L65R(TM1)/G251V, or wild-type P-gp were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 μm cyclosporin A for 24 h. The membranes were then prepared as described previously (37Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14671-14674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and suspended in Tris-buffered saline. The membranes were then treated for 5 min at 22 °C with various concentrations of TPCK-trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich; 12,000 benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units/mg). The reactions were stopped by the addition of lima bean trypsin inhibitor (Worthington), and the samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis. Screening TM3 Single Cysteine Mutants for Activation of ATPase Activity by Covalent Attachment of a Thiol-reactive Drug Substrate—The TM5-TM6 hairpin of P-gp (Fig. 1A) appears to play an important role in the co- and/or post-translational folding steps during synthesis because mutations introduced into these TM segments of wild-type P-gp could promote proteolytic cleavage at the extracellular side of TM2 (23Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32373-32376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, changes to the TM5-TM6 hairpin can affect distal folding events. Some changes in TM5 (I306A or G) or in TM6 (F343Y) in the ΔY490 P-gp mutant also caused the mutant protein to be unstable because cells expressing these mutants contained relatively large amounts of a 130-kDa degradation product (21Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29436-29440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). An example of the effects of Arg and Tyr changes to Phe343 in mutant ΔY490 P-gp is shown in Fig. 1B. HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type P-gp yield the mature 170-kDa protein as the major product, whereas the major product in processing mutant ΔY490 is the immature 150-kDa protein. In cells expressing mutant F343Y/ΔY490, the 130-kDa protein was the major product. By contrast, mutant F343R/ΔY490 yielded about equivalent amounts of the mature 170-kDa and immature 150-kDa proteins and very little 130-kDa product. Therefore, the presence of arginine mutations in TM5 (I306R) or TM6 (F343R) might have promoted maturation of ΔY490 P-gp by influencing distal folding events. Alterations in the timing of co-translational folding such as slowing the speed of folding can alter the structure and insertion of P-gp into the membrane. For example, it was recently shown that slowing synthesis of P-gp by introducing rare codons into the MDR1 gene yielded a protein that was more protease-resistant than that synthesized from the normal template (22Kimchi-Sarfaty C. Kim J.M. Kim I.W. Sauna Z.E. Calcagno A.M. Ambudkar S.V. Gottesman M.M. Science. 2007; 315: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (2012) Google Scholar). Arginine rescue may be a unique feature of the TM5-TM6 hairpin because this segment is critical for folding. Therefore, rescue by arginine should not be observed in TM segments predicted to be less important for folding. Two TM segments that do not appear to be critical for folding are TMs 1 and 3. When TM1 was replaced with TM7 (60% of the amino acids are different), the (TM7/TM7) mutant P-gp matured like wild-type enzyme (25Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15414-15419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Evidence that TM3 might be less important for folding comes from the results of cysteine mutagenesis studies. It was found that changes to residues in TMs 2 and 5, but not in TM3, inhibited maturation of some of the mutants (26Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The next step was then to identify residues in TM1 or TM3 that line the drug-binding pocket, for replacement with arginine and to test whether they could promote maturation of a processing mutant. To identify residues that line the drug-binding pocket of P-gp, we have used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with thiol-reactive analogs of drug substrates (9Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 28Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44332-44338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cysteines that line the drug-binding pocket are covalently modified with the drug analog and cause activation of P-gp ATPase activity. In TMs 5 and 6, residues Ile306(TM5) and Phe343(TM6) were selected for substitution with arginine because cysteines introduced at these sites caused activation of P-gp ATPase activity after covalent modification with a thiol-reactive substrate (31Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 38Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50136-50141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Residue Leu65 in TM1 also showed similar properties as covalent modification of Cys65 with MTS-verapamil activated P-gp ATPase activity (27Loo T.W. Kim M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore position 65 in TM1 was selected for introduction of an arginine residue. We then tested whether cysteines introduced at positions 190–209 of TM3 could react with MTS-verapamil to cause permanent activation of ATPase activity. We previously showed that all of the TM3 single cysteine mutants exhibited at least 85% of the activity of the parent Cys-less P-gp (9Loo T.W. Kim D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We first tested whether any of the TM3 cysteine mutants showed any change in the apparent affinity for drug substrates. The histidine-tagged mutants were isolated, mixed with lipids, and assayed for drug-stimulated ATPase activity in the presence of various concentrations of rhodamine B (0.01–3 mm), verapamil (0.001–3 mm), vinblastine (0.6–60 μm), or colchicine (0.1–10 mm). None of the mutants showed more than a 50% change in apparent affinity for any of the drug substrates when compared with Cys-less P-gp (data not shown). The next step was to treat the TM3 single cysteines mutants with MTS-verapamil. HEK 293 cells expressing histidine-tagged single cysteine mutants were solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and insoluble was material removed by centrifugation. The solubilized extracts were then treated for 10 min at 20 °C with or without 3 mm MTS-verapamil. This concentration of MTS-verapamil was sufficient to completely modify Cys65(TM1) (27Loo T.W.

Pitx1 and Pitx2 have partly redundant activities in craniofacial development, including in pituitary organogenesis, as indicated by their names. These genes also exhibit redundant activities in the control of hind limb bud growth. Recent studies have shown expression of the three Pitx genes in muscle, with Pitx3 being the most widely expressed in all skeletal muscles.

Sequences proximal to this muscle-specific exon 1 are essential and sufficient to confer muscle-specific expression in transgenic mice, they are responsive to myogenic basic helix-loop-helix regulatory factors, and they recruit these factors in vivo.

The Pitx genes play critical roles in early development of several tissues and organs. The first of these homeobox transcription factors, Pitx1 (Ptx1), was discovered for its role in cell-specific transcription of the pituitary Pomc gene (1Lamonerie T. Tremblay J.J. Lanctôt C. Therrien M. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar); on the Pomc gene, it acts as an obligate partner of the highly cell-restricted T-box transcription factor, Tpit (2Lamolet B.

Tsai J.P.Y. Couture C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Beyond their role in pituitary organogenesis and transcription as implied by their names (4Gage P.J. Suh H. Camper S.A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 5Tremblay J.J. Goodyer C.G. Drouin J. Neuroendocrinology. 2000; 71: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the Pitx genes play several roles in early development. Indeed, Pitx1 is first expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm of the posterior half of the embryo, starting as soon as posterior lateral plate mesoderm is formed at gastrulation (6Lanctôt C. Lamolet B. Drouin J. Development. 1997; 124: 2807-2817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Throughout later development, Pitx1 remains highly expressed in developing hind limb bud mesenchyme and was shown to determine hind limb identity in mice (7Lanctôt C. Moreau A. Chamberland M.

Nature. 2004; 428: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). In addition, Pitx1 controls the growth ability of hind limb mesenchyme together with Pitx2 (12Marcil, A., Dumontier,É., Chamberland, M., Camper, S. A., and Drouin, J. (2003) Development 130, 45-55Google Scholar). Pitx2 is also expressed in the lateral plate mesoderm but preferentially on the left side, where its left-specific expression is controlled by Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and/or nodal (13Wright C.V. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The left-specific Pitx2c isoform uses a different promoter than for its bilateral expression in other tissues (14Schweickert A. Campione M. Steinbeisser H. Blum M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This alternate promoter is responsible for production of Pitx2a and Pitx2b that arise through differential splicing of exon 2 (4Gage P.J. Suh H. Camper S.A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Left-specific expression is critical for left-right asymmetry and development of the lungs, heart, and stomach (14Schweickert A. Campione M. Steinbeisser H. Blum M. Mech. Dev. 2000; 90: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 15Essner J.J. Branford W.W. Zhang J. Yost H.J. Development. 2000; 127: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the heart, the left-specific isoform of Pitx2, Pitx2c, has activities that are specific or redundant with those of the bilaterally expressed isoforms Pitx2a and Pitx2b (16Liu C. Liu W. Palie J. Lu M.F. Brown N.A. Martin J.F. Development. 2002; 129: 5081-5091Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Finally, the third gene of the family, Pitx3, is expressed in the eye (17Semina E.V. Reiter R.S. Murray J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and midbrain dopaminergic neurons (18Smidt M.P. van Schaick H.S. Lanctôt C. Tremblay J.J.

In agreement with this expression, a natural mouse mutant of the Pitx3 gene promoter, the aphakia (ak) mouse, has lens developmental defect (17Semina E.V. Reiter R.S. Murray J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2109-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and in humans, Pitx3 mutations have been associated with eye dysmorphogenesis (anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis) and with congenital cataracts (19Semina E.V.

The ak mouse was also found to exhibit a severe deficit of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (20Nunes I. Tovmasian L.T. Silva R.M. Burke R.E. Goff S.P. Proc.

Neurochem. 2006; 96: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Early reports on expression profiles of Pitx genes had noted expression of Pitx1 in a small subset of muscles (6Lanctôt C. Lamolet B. Drouin J. Development. 1997; 124: 2807-2817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of Pitx2 in early myoblasts (24Logan M. Pagán-Westphal S.M. Smith D.M. Paganessi L. Tabin C.J. Cell. 1998; 94: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), and of Pitx3 in extraocular muscles, tongue and head muscles (19Semina E.V. Ferrell R.E. Mintz-Hittner H.A. Bitoun P. Alward W.L.M. Reiter R.S. Funkhauser C. Daack-Hirsch S. Murray J.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). 5V. Coulon, A. L'Honoré, J.-F. Ouimette,É. Dumontier, P. van den Munckhof, and J. Drouin, unpublished results. Muscle expression of these genes was not studied systematically until recently, as we conducted a detailed analysis of their expression patterns in early precursors and in developing muscle (25L'Honoré A. Coulon V. Marcil A. Lebel M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Gage P.J. Camper S.A. Drouin J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It thus appears that Pitx3 is expressed in all skeletal muscles. Since Pitx3 is the only member of the family to be expressed in all muscles, we have undertaken to define the mechanism of its expression and its role in muscle development. Since a natural mouse mutant of the Pitx3 gene already exists, the ak mouse, we assessed muscle expression of Pitx3 in ak mice and found it to be normal. The present report delineates a novel muscle-specific promoter within intron 1 of the Pitx3 gene that is not affected by the ak mutation. Further, we defined the muscle-specific Pitx3 promoter in transgenic mice experiments and showed that it is adequate to target gene expression in early skeletal muscle, thus mimicking expression of the endogenous gene. In normal muscle, both brain and muscle initiation sites appear to be used, but only muscle-specific exon 1m is transcribed in ak mice, in agreement with a shift of the trimethyl-lysine 4 histone H3 (H3K4me3) promoter signature in ak muscle cells. Finally, we show that Pitx3 expression is stimulated by myogenic bHLH 6The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; MRF, myogenic bHLH regulatory factor; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; RT, reverse transcription; WT, wild type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; H3K4me3, trimethyl-lysine 4 histone H3; en, embryonic day n. regulatory factors (MRFs) in a positive feedback regulatory mechanism that serves to establish the myogenic program of differentiation. Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—The protocol used (available on the World Wide Web) is from the laboratory of Dr. Janet Rossant. A rat Pitx3 cDNA EcoRI-BamHI fragment encompassing the entire translated sequence was used as probe. LacZ Staining and Immunohistochemistry—For β-galactosidase staining, 12.5-day postcoitum mouse embryos were fixed for 25 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C; rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40; and then incubated for 24 h at 30 °C (to minimize endogenous activity) in staining solution (0.4 mg/ml X-gal, 4 mm potassium ferricyanate, 4 mm potassium ferrocyanate, 4 mm MgCl2). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described (26Lanctôt C. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1416-1422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following antibodies: anti-Pitx3 polyclonal antibody (described in Ref. 22den Munckhof P. Luk K.C. Sainte-Marie L. Montgomery J. Blanchet P.J. Sadikot A.F. Drouin J. Development. 2003; 130: 2535-2542Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) and anti-MyoD monoclonal antibody (purchased from Pharmingen). RNA Analyses—Total RNA was prepared from adult mouse muscle, spleen, or e14.5 embryos with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. Purification of mRNA was performed using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) Oligotex Maxi Kit following the supplier's protocol. For RT-PCR, reverse transcription was performed with 500 ng of mRNA using a reverse oligonucleotide primer in the Pitx3 3′-untranslated region (TCACAGCCTCTCCGGACAGG), and the resultant cDNA was purified on Qiaquick columns (Qiagen), diluted 100-fold, and amplified with the following primers: reverse primer Rev/cDNA (GGAGTGCCTGCGTCCGATAA) with oligonucleotide 1 (CTCTGGGAGCTCATAGCTTG), 2 (GTGTGTGGCTGCACATGTGT), 3 (GTGTTTGTGCCTTTGGCTTC), 4 (GGGAGCGCATGTGTGAGAGA), 5 (TGTCAGAGAGAGACAGAGGAGACT), 6 (AGGGGAATGGCTAGCTCCAAAA), 7 (GGACTGAGAGAGCTGAGGTT), 8 (CCCCCACACAGAGTTCTGAA), or l,b (ACAGCCACCACCCGGAGTCT). Control reactions on 400 ng of genomic DNA were done with primers 4-8 with reverse primer Rev/gDNA (CAAGCTATGAGCTCCCAGAG). PCR products were separated on a 1.6% agarose gel. For mRNA quantitation, reverse transcription aliquots prepared as above from ak and WT e14.5 limb bud mRNA were analyzed by quantitative real time PCR (MX-3005; Stratagene, La Jolla CA). The primers used were oligonucleotides l,b and 4 with Rev/cDNA for exon 1l and exon 1m, respectively. Relative abundance is calculated by comparison with β-actin mRNA amplified with the following primers: TGATGGTGGGAATGGGTCAGAA and TCCATGTCGTCCCAGTTGGTAA. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described (27Forrester W.C. Fernandez L.A. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3003-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with modifications. Intact limb buds from e13 wild-type or ak embryos were collected in PBS and formaldehyde (final concentration 1%). After 5 min of agitation, homogenization was performed with a Dounce potter A for 10 min in cross-linking solution. Glycine (final concentration 125 mm) was added to quench excess formaldehyde. Pellets collected by centrifugation (1000 × g, 3 min) were washed twice with PBS and resuspended in Triton buffer (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and homogenized with Dounce potter B. Nuclei pellets were then resuspended in NaCl buffer (200 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in sonication buffer (0.5% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.05% NaDOC, 10 mm Tris, pH 8, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments of about 0.5-2 kb. 500 μg of sonicated chromatin was subjected to immunoprecipitation at 4 °C with 5 μg of antibodies against MyoD (Pharmingen), myogenin (Pharmingen), trimethyl-lysine 4 histone 3 (Abcam), RNA polymerase II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or matched rabbit nonimmune IgG (Sigma) as negative control. Immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A/G-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) saturated with tRNA. Beads were washed six times with the following buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Chromatin was eluted from beads with elution buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA) and purified with a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen). Quantitative real time PCR (MX-3005; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was performed with the SYBR Green kit (Qiagen). For ChIP analyses of the Pitx3 locus, the following primers (pictured in Fig. 7A) were used: A, ACAGACAGCGACAAGTGGAGAA with ATCAGAAGCGTTTGCCATCCAC; B, AGTAGCTCATGCTTTCCTTCCCAG with CAAGCGTTCTATCCGTTCCAAACC; C, AGCTCAGTTTGCAGAGTGCTTG with ATAGCACGAGGCCTCACTTACA; D, TGTCAGAGAGAGACAGAGGAGACT with CTTAGACACAGCAAGCACTTGGAC; E, TGATTCAGACTTGCGGTTGAGC with TAGCTGGTCACACCAAGCTTCA. Enrichments were calculated relative to PCR analyses (primer TCGGAGTGGAATTACCTATGTGCG with TGGTTTCACAAGATATCACACTTTCCC) of a control sequence within the POMC gene promoter that is not expressed in muscles. Transgene Constructs—Mouse Pitx3 gene sequences were cloned from a genomic 129/sv λ DASH2 phage library (1Lamonerie T. Tremblay J.J. Lanctôt C. Therrien M. Gauthier Y. Drouin J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1284-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A genomic 4-kb Pitx3 promoter fragment was inserted upstream of LacZ (from α-GSU-LacZ) (28Kendall S.K. Gordon D.F. Birkmeier T.S. Petrey D. Sarapura V.D. O'Shea K.S. Wood W.M. Lloyd R.V. Ridgway E.C. Camper S.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1420-1433PubMed Google Scholar) to create plasmid JA1639. The addition of the 3′ two-thirds of Pitx3 intron 1 yielded JA1642. JA1673 was obtained by deleting the 2.2-kb putative alternative promoter region in JA1642. For TG1704 and TG1707 transgenes, the Pitx3 4-kb promoter in TG1639 was replaced by an intronic fragment corresponding to the conserved promoter region (corresponding to -1775/+12 of the muscle promoter) with or without a less conserved 1.5-kb upstream region, respectively. Insertion of the 3-kb 5′ part of intron 1 into TG1704 yielded TG1706. All constructs were checked by restriction and sequencing; maps and sequences are available upon request. Transgenic Mice—All DNA fragments for microinjection were produced by SacII-SalI digestion and purified on agarose gel. Transgenic mice were produced as previously described (29Poulin G. Lebel M. Chamberland M. Paradis F.W. Drouin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4826-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For transient transgenics, foster mice were sacrificed at 12.5 days postcoitum, taking the day of injection as 0.5 days postcoitum. Cell Culture and Transfection—L6 and C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and transfected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for 4 h with Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's directions. Usually, for 35-mm wells, 1 μg of β-galactosidase reporter was used per well. For differentiation, cells were grown to confluence, and then medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum, and cells were maintained in culture for 24 or 48 h. In experiments to assess responsiveness to MyoD, expression vectors for both MyoD and E47 (same amount for each) were co-transfected with reporter, and reporter activity was measured 24 h post-transfection in proliferation conditions. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed in lysates with a luminometer using the Galacto-Light system (TROPIX) as described by the manufacturer or by cytochemistry using X-gal as a substrate in formaldehyde-fixed cells to correlate activity with differentiated morphology. Software—Sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW (available on the World Wide Web), and graphic genomic alignments were performed with LAGAN and VISTA (both available on the World Wide Web). The promoter prediction software is also available online. Pitx3 Is Expressed in Developing Muscles of Aphakia Mice—In order to establish expression of Pitx3 in developing muscles, we used whole mount in situ hybridization with mouse embryos at day 12.5 (e12.5) of development. This analysis revealed expression of Pitx3 in myotomes and developing muscle masses of the limbs (Fig. 1, A and B). Muscle masses of both fore limb and hind limb buds express Pitx3, and expression is also observed in forming abdominal muscle masses. It thus appears that Pitx3 is very widely expressed in most developing skeletal muscles. We provided a detailed investigation of this expression profile else-where (25L'Honoré A. Coulon V. Marcil A. Lebel M. Lafrance-Vanasse J. Gage P.J. Camper S.A. Drouin J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 307: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since the ak mouse was shown to be a promoter mutant of the Pitx3 locus (30Semina E.V. Murray J.C. Reiter R. Hrstka R.F.G.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Rieger D.K. Reichenberger E. McLean W. Sidow A. Olsen B.R. Genomics. 2001; 72: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we wanted to verify a putative defect of Pitx3 expression in muscle. Surprisingly, we found that muscle expression of Pitx3 is intact in ak embryos and that in this tissue, it appears undistinguishable from wild-type littermates (Fig. 1, C and D). In order to verify that Pitx3 protein indeed has normal expression in ak muscles and further that it is expressed in adult muscle, we performed Western blot analyses of hind limb muscles using an antibody specific for Pitx3. This analysis revealed a similar band in both wild-type and ak mice at about 38 kDa (Fig. 1E). A Muscle-specific Pitx3 Exon 1—Since the ak deletion removes the brain and eye (lens) exon 1 and the upstream region of the previously described Pitx3 gene (31Rieger D.K. Reichenberger E. McLean W. Sidow A. Olsen B.R. Genomics. 2001; 72: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we reasoned that a different exon 1 and promoter might be active in muscles and that this putative muscle exon 1 could be spliced onto a common exon 2. The quest for an alternate initiation site for muscle Pitx3 expression was facilitated by the search of genome data bases for expressed sequence tags containing Pitx3 sequences. Indeed, a BLAST search on the UCSC genome server identified a rat expressed sequence tag (BF543032) matching with exons 2 and 3 of Pitx3 but containing different exon 1 sequences (thereafter called exon 1m for “muscle”) by comparison with the already known exon 1 (hereafter called exon 1l,b for lens, brain expression). The structure of the Pitx3 mouse locus is schematically represented in Fig. 2A, showing the position of both exon 1l,b and the novel putative exon 1m; the figure also shows the position of the two genomic deletions identified in ak mice (30Semina E.V. Murray J.C. Reiter R. Hrstka R.F.G.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1575-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 31Rieger D.K. Reichenberger E. McLean W. Sidow A. Olsen B.R. Genomics. 2001; 72: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that putative exon 1m lies within a region of similar sequence conservation as those of exons 1l,b, 2, 3, and 4 (Fig. 2B). In order to pinpoint a putative transcription start site for exon 1m, the BDGP neural network promoter prediction software (32Reese M.G. Comput.

This putative start site lies within a region of high sequence conservation between mouse, rat, and human sequences (Fig. 3A). In order to validate this prediction, a series of RT-PCRs were carried out using e14.5 embryo mRNA and different primers. A common 3′ primer located in exon 2 was used in all cases, and different 5′ primers (Fig. 3A) located downstream of putative initiation (primer 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1) or just upstream of this predicted start site (primer 6, 7, or 8) were used. No RT-PCR products could be amplified using adult spleen RNA as control (data not shown), and a PCR product of the expected size was obtained with primer 5 located between putative nucleotides -6 and +18 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, no PCR product could be obtained with primer 6, which lies at positions -45 to -26 bp relative to the putative start site (Fig. 3B). In order to verify that primer 6 was active in PCR, control reactions were conducted using genomic DNA substrate; a fragment of the expected size was obtained (Fig. 3C). DNA sequencing of the RT-PCR products confirmed that this fragment contains the expected exon 1m, exon 2, and exon 3 sequences, as predicted for the proposed muscle mRNA shown in Fig. 2A. Similar results were obtained with other reverse primers. It is noteworthy that the initiator ATG codon is found in exon 2 of the Pitx3 gene; it is therefore predicted that the Pitx3 protein should be the same in muscle as in eye and midbrain. These data suggest that muscle expression of Pitx3 is driven by a promoter different from the one used in eye lens and brain, but this activity may still use the exon 1l,b initiation site. Indeed, using RT-PCR with a forward primer in exon 1l,b and the exon 2 reverse primer, it was found that the exon 1l,b is also used in muscle together with exon 1m (Fig. 3B). In order to assess the relative use of each first exon in muscle, quantitative RT-PCR was performed (Fig. 3D). This analysis revealed about 8 times more exon 1l,b-containing mRNA compared with exon 1m. In agreement with the deletion of exon 1l,b in ak mice, no PCR product corresponding to exon 1l,b sequences was detected in ak muscle, but the relative abundance of exon 1m in these tissues was increased about 2.8-fold compared with wild-type muscle (Fig. 3D). A Muscle Cell-specific Pitx3 Gene Promoter—In order to test whether the putative Pitx3 promoters are active in vivo and show the expected specificity, we tested the two predicted promoter sequences of the Pitx3 locus in transgenic mice. The promoter fragments were fused to β-galactosidase (lacZ) coding sequences, and founder e12.5 transgenic embryos were assessed for transgene expression using LacZ activity as reporter. A 4-kb promoter fragment for exon 1l,b that is expressed in eye lens and midbrain (mb) was found to be largely inactive in transgenic embryos (Fig. 4, construct F). This transgene did not exhibit any expression in lens or midbrain and exhibited only weak expression in the myotome region of only one embryo. In contrast, four of seven embryos had faint ectopic expression at unrelated sites. Stable mouse transgenic lines had been established with the same transgene previously, and they showed similar weak and inconsistent patterns of expression. Various putative promoter fragments for exon 1m were also assessed in transgenic mice, and the most consistent and strongest expression was observed with the shortest transgenic promoter fragment (construct A). This 1.6-kb promoter fragment contains two regions of high sequence conservation: a promoter-proximal region of about 350 bp and another upstream region of about 300 bp at -1450 bp (Fig. 2B). This transgene directed very strong expression in myotomes, limb, and facial muscles with very infrequent ectopic expression (Fig. 4, construct A); LacZ activity was never detected in midbrain or eye lens. The addition of more upstream sequences (constructs B and C) did not further enhance muscle expression of transgenes; in fact, expression was weaker (Fig. 4) with particular loss of expression at the level of craniofacial muscles, of the epaxial domain of the myotome, and of the most caudal somites (beyond the hind limb level). In fact, transgene expression in face muscles was only consistently observed for construct A; nine of 11 founders had facial expression, compared with three of nine for construct B and four of 17 for construct C. A short region of unconserved upstream sequences (absent in construct C) could not be tested in transgenic mice, because the presence of these sequences rendered plasmids very unstable. Since construct F conferred expression at low frequency (one of seven) in putative myogenic cells, we wanted to test whether these sequences may act in concert with the muscle-specific promoter and whether the muscle-specific sequences could act as enhancers. A transgene containing both promoters (construct D) exhibits similar muscle specificity as construct B or C; it is also less active than construct A. In agreement with the hypothesis that the highly conserved sequences around exon 1m (Fig. 2B) that are active in construct A are important for muscle-specific activity, it was observed that deletion of those sequences completely abolished transgenic promoter activity (Fig. 4, construct E). Collectively, these data clearly identify a muscle-specific promoter/enhancer upstream of exon 1m of the Pitx3 gene and indicate that this promoter is necessary and sufficient for muscle-specific expression of Pitx3. The maintenance of Pitx3 expression in ak muscles is completely consistent with the existence of separate regulatory sequences for muscle-specific expression of the gene. The Pitx3 Muscle-specific Promoter Is Active in Myoblasts and in Differentiating Muscle Cells—The early pattern of muscle expression for transgene A (Fig. 5, A and B) is extremely similar to the pattern of Pitx3 mRNA expression ("

The serine/threonine kinase WNK1 (with no K (lysine)) has recently been implicated in exocytosis and is expressed in all three of these cell types. To search for WNK1 substrates related to exocytosis, we conducted a WNK1 two-hybrid screen, which yielded Munc18c. Munc18c is known to be a key regulator of accessibility of the target membrane (t-SNARE) protein syntaxin 4 to participate in SNARE core complex assembly, although a paucity of Munc18c-binding factors has precluded discovery of its precise functions. To validate WNK1 as a new Munc18c-interacting partner, the direct interaction between WNK1 and Munc18c was confirmed using in vitro binding analysis, and endogenous WNK1-Munc18c complexes were detected in the cytosolic and plasma membrane compartments of the islet beta cell line MIN6. This binding interaction is mediated through the N-terminal 172 residues of Munc18c and the kinase domain residues of WNK1 (residues 159–491). Expression of either of these two minimal interaction domains resulted in inhibition of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, consistent with a functional importance for the endogenous WNK1-Munc18c complex in exocytosis. Interestingly, Munc18c failed to serve as a WNK1 substrate in kinase activity assays, suggesting that WNK1 functions in SNARE complex assembly outside its role as a kinase. Taken together, these data support a novel role for WNK1 and a new mechanism for the regulation of SNARE complex assembly by WNK1-Munc18c complexes.

WNK is an unusual novel member of the Ser/Thr kinase family, named WNK (with no K (lysine)), based upon its lack of an otherwise highly conserved lysine residue present within kinase core domains (1Xu B.

Although three additional WNK family members have been identified in humans, named WNK2, WNK3, and WNK4 (2Verissimo F. Jordan P.

Analyses of protein kinase activities of various WNK1 truncation mutants also revealed the presence of an autoinhibitory domain located between residues 491 and 555 (6Xu B.E. Min X. Stippec S.

In another endocrine cell type, insulin-secreting INS-1 beta cells, WNK1 has been implicated in vesicular trafficking via its ability to phosphorylate the calcium sensor protein synaptotagmin 2 (10Lee B.H.

Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Endogenous WNK1 and synaptotagmin 2 were shown to co-localize on a subset of secretory granules, and synaptotagmin 2 phosphorylation was enhanced by coexpression of WNK1 (10Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J.

Since synaptotagmin 2 is known to facilitate fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane in neuronal cells (11Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar), it is predicted that WNK1, by association, may be involved in this process as well. The identification of synaptotagmin 2 as a WNK1 substrate was made by using the unique kinase domain of WNK1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen (10Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B.E. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Using the same screening strategy, a second vesicular trafficking protein was also identified: Munc18c. Munc18c is a member of the SM (Sec1/Munc18) family of syntaxin-binding proteins and binds selectively to the syntaxin 4 isoform, whereas Munc18a and Munc18b isoforms bind to syntaxins 1–3 (12Tellman J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Like synaptotagmin 2, Munc18c functions in insulin granule fusion, such that islets from Munc18c heterozygous (+/–) mice show impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (13Oh E. Spurlin B.A. Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, distinct from syntaptotagmin 2 localization to the granule, Munc18c is a soluble ∼67-kDa protein that exists in the cytosolic compartment and also at the plasma membrane, associated with membrane proteins syntaxin 4 and Doc2β (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These differences in cellular locale of WNK1 substrates in islet beta cells suggest that WNK1 may function at multiple steps in vesicle trafficking and fusion. In addition, Munc18c functions in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 vesicle translocation and fusion in 3T3L1 adipocytes (15Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3565-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and thus may be part of the mechanism by which WNK1 participates in insulin signaling. Although the precise role of Munc18c in vesicle/granule fusion has remained elusive, in part due to the lack of predictable domain structure and paucity of interacting partners, there is consensus that it functions as a scaffold to regulate syntaxin 4 conformation and availability for participation in SNARE core complex assembly (14Ke B.

Interestingly, Munc18c function and interaction with syntaxin 4 is altered by stimulus-induced tyrosine phosphorylation (21Schmelzle K. Kane S. Gridley S. Lienhard G.E. White F.M.

Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3178-3184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), supporting the idea that Munc18c associates with a kinase, such as WNK1. In this study, we demonstrate that Munc18c is a WNK1-interacting protein and that endogenous Munc18c-WNK1 complexes are important for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via a syntaxin 4-dependent mechanism. The complex association requires the N-terminal 172 residues of Munc18c and the kinase domain of WNK1. Paradoxically, although the kinase domain of WNK1 is essential for Munc18c association, activation by autophosphorylation of WNK1 is not required. These data provide new insight into the function of WNK1 in vesicle/granule exocytosis, outside its known function as a kinase, and reveal the identity of a novel Munc18c-interacting protein.

MIN6 beta cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with 40 μg of plasmid DNA/10-cm2 dish using Transfectin (Bio-Rad) to obtain ∼50% transfection efficiency. After 48 h of incubation, cells were incubated for 2 h in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (MKRBB; 5 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 24 mm NaHCO3, 1mm MgCl2, 2mm CaCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and stimulated with 20 mm glucose. Cells were subsequently lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and lysates were cleared by microcentrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C for subsequent use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For measurement of human C-peptide release, MIN6 beta cells were transiently co-transfected with each plasmid plus human proinsulin cDNA, using transfectin with 2 μg of each DNA per 35-mm dish of cells at 50–60% confluence. Forty-eight hours later, cells were preincubated for 2 h in MKRBB buffer and stimulated with 20 mm glucose for 1 h, and human C-peptide was released into the buffer quantitated by RIA. CHO-K1 cells were cultured and electroporated as previously described (15Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

After 48 h of incubation, cleared detergent cell lysates were prepared for subsequent use in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions of beta cells were prepared as described previously (25Nevins A.K. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1944-1952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, MIN6 beta cells at 80–90% confluence were harvested into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate containing protease inhibitors) and disrupted by 10 strokes through a 27-gauge needle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min. Postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 5,500 × g for 15 min, and the subsequent supernatant was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the secretory granule fraction in the pellet. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the cytosolic fraction. Plasma membrane (PM) fractions were obtained by mixing the postnuclear pellet with 1 ml of Buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and 2 volumes of Buffer B (2 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was overlaid with Buffer A and centrifuged at 113,000 × g for 1 h to obtain an interface containing the plasma membrane fraction. The interface was collected and diluted to 2 ml with homogenization buffer for centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was collected as the plasma membrane fraction. All pellets were resuspended in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to solubilize membrane proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Antibodies were combined with cleared detergent lysate protein for 2 h at 4 °C followed by a second incubation with protein G-Plus-agarose for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to 8.5 or 12% SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunoblotting. Chemiluminescence was detected using a Chemi-Doc gel documentation system (Bio-Rad). Recombinant Proteins and Interaction Assays—Recombinant proteins GST-WNK1-(1–491) WT, GST-WNK1-(1–491) K233M, and GST-Munc18c were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography. Recombinant WNK1-(1–491) was obtained following thrombin cleavage (Novagen) of GST-WNK1-(1–491). The interaction of GST-Munc18c with thrombin-cleaved WNK1 was performed by incubating 2 μg of GST-Munc18c linked to Sepharose beads with 2 μg of recombinant WNK1 protein in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with lysis buffer, proteins were eluted from the Sepharose beads and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting. In Vitro Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed using recombinant WNK1-(1–491) and/or Munc18c proteins in 30 μl of 1× kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 10 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10mm, 10mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. GST-Munc18c and WNK1 were incubated for 15 and 30 min at 30 °C as described (10Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B.E. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped by adding 7.5 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 2 min. Reactions (20 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were evaluated for statistical significance using Student's t test. WNK1 and Munc18c Associate in MIN6 Beta Cells—The kinase domain of WNK1 was used in the pLexA-bait strain (Clontech) to screen a library of pAD42-prey strains containing rat brain cDNA, as described previously (10Lee B.H.

Munc18c was detected in this screen. To confirm the WNK1-Munc18c interaction, a truncated form of WNK1-(1–491) containing the kinase domain (amino acids 218–490) fused to a C-terminal Myc tag (Fig. 1A) was co-electroporated with full-length Munc18c fused to EGFP (Munc18c-EGFP) or EGFP vector control into CHO-K1 cells for subsequent immunoprecipitation analyses. The CHO-K1 cells have high transfection efficiency (>70%) and contain undetectable levels of endogenous Munc18c protein. Anti-Myc (WNK1) immunoprecipitation resulted in specific co-immunoprecipitation of Munc18c-EGFP (Fig. 1B), confirming the yeast two-hybrid screen and indicating that the WNK1 truncation containing the N-terminal 491 residues was sufficient to confer association with Munc18c in mammalian cells. We next sought to determine if WNK1-Munc18c complexes formed in islet beta cells. WNK1 has previously been shown to localize to insulin granules and cytosolic fractions in INS-1 beta cells (10Lee B.H. Min X. Heise C.J. Xu B.E. Chen S. Shu H. Luby-Phelps K. Goldsmith E.J. Cobb M.H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 741-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas we and others have found Munc18c localized principally to plasma membrane and cytosolic compartments, with only trace amounts in the granule fraction of MIN6 beta cells (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27Spurlin B.A. Thurmond D.C. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Given that both Munc18c and WNK1 reportedly exist in the cytosolic compartment, we investigated whether they associated in this locale. The MIN6 beta cell line was used for preparation of subcellular fractions and determination of WNK1 and Munc18c localization (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the locale of WNK1 in the INS-1 beta cells, WNK1 was found principally localized to the cytosolic (Cyt) fraction, with some presence in the storage granule (SG) and PM fractions. In the same fractions, Munc18c was also present, but its relative distribution in the cytosolic and PM fractions was reversed relative to that of WNK1. Immunodetection of the plasma membrane protein syntaxin 4 was used to validate integrity of subcellular fractionation in MIN6 beta cells (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The fractions were subsequently divided for use in parallel immunoprecipitation reactions with Munc18c and WNK1 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Munc18c antibody was capable of reproducibly co-immunoprecipitating WNK1 from the cytosolic and PM fractions (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). In two of the five cytosolic co-immunoprecipitation experiments, a glucose-induced decrease in Munc18c-WNK1 association was observed (data not shown). The lack of consistent detection of a decrease with glucose is reminiscent of that observed with Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complexes, which transiently associate/dissociate with changes in the phosphorylation state of Munc18c (22Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition, reciprocal immunoprecipitation of WNK1 similarly resulted in co-precipitation of Munc18c from the PM fraction (Fig. 2B, lane 4). Anti-Munc18c co-immunoprecipitated syntaxin from the PM fraction as expected, although anti-WNK1 failed to precipitate syntaxin 4. These data suggest that Munc18c-WNK1 complexes existed primarily in the PM and cytosolic compartments and that those located at the PM excluded syntaxin 4. Residues 1–172 of Munc18c Are Sufficient to Confer Binding to WNK1—To determine the minimal binding domain of Munc18c required for its interaction with WNK1, a series of Munc18-EGFP truncation constructs (Fig. 3A) was used as previously described (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Truncation constructs were co-electroporated with WNK1-(1–491)-Myc into CHO-K1 cells, and lysates were prepared for use in anti-Myc (WNK1) immunoprecipitation reactions. Although all four truncations of Munc18c were found to be expressed in cell lysates (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4), only the truncation containing residues 1–172 of Munc18c was capable of co-precipitating with WNK1-Myc (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–8). This indicated that the N-terminal Munc18c-(1–172) residues are sufficient to confer interaction with WNK1. Endogenous WNK1-Munc18c Complexes Are Essential for Syntaxin 4-mediated Insulin Granule Exocytosis—To determine whether WNK1-Munc18c complexes were functionally required for insulin secretion, we used the minimal binding domain of Munc18c (residues 1–172) to competitively inhibit formation of endogenous WNK1-Munc18c complexes. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that 10-fold more Munc18c-(1–172) truncation protein was precipitated by WNK1-Myc compared with full-length Munc18c and that its overexpression reduced endogenous WNK1-Munc18c complex formation (n = 4; data not shown), suggesting its utility as a competitive inhibitor. Moreover, this small fragment of Munc18c fails to bind to syntaxin 4 (22Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and thus should not perturb that association. MIN6 cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-Munc18c-(1–172) or pcDNA3.1 vector control together with human proinsulin cDNA, and effects upon glucose-stimulated human C-peptide were assessed. Human C-peptide, cleaved from expressed human proinsulin, is synthesized and packaged in the MIN6 beta cells yet is immunologically distinct from endogenous mouse C-peptide and serves as a reporter of secretion from transfectable cells (29Kashima Y.

An Cohen J. Antinozzi J. A McGarry.P. D Newgard.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6479-6484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). MIN6 cells transfected with vector control showed 141% of basal human C-peptide secretion in the response to glucose, whereas cells expressing Munc18c-(1–172) had significantly reduced glucose-stimulated secretion (Fig. 4A). Expression of Munc18c-(1–172) was without effect upon basal secretion (0.13 ± 0.02 ng/mg protein for Munc18c-1–172 versus 0.12 ± 0.01 ng/mg for control, n = 4). These data indicated that the endogenous WNK1-Munc18c complexes were functionally required for glucose-stimulated secretion but not necessarily for maintenance of basal insulin levels. To investigate the mechanism of this alteration in function, we assessed SNARE complex assembly (syntaxin-VAMP association) in MIN6 cell lysates from cells expressing Munc18c-(1–172)-EGFP or EGFP vector control. As we have shown previously (14Ke B. Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21786-21797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Oh E. Thurmond D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17624-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), glucose stimulation for 5 min increased the co-immunoprecipitation of VAMP2 granules with syntaxin 4 in lysates from vector-expressing cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). However, MIN6 cells overexpressing Munc18c-(1–172)-EGFP exhibited significantly less syntaxin 4-VAMP2 association, under both basal and glucose-stimulated conditions (Fig. 4B,"

We reported previously that EZI/Zfp467, a 12 zinc finger motif-containing protein, localizes predominantly in the nucleus, yet the underlying mechanism still remains elusive. Here we constructed a series of mutant forms of EZI and examined their subcellular localization. The results delineated a non-canonical nuclear localization signal in the region covering the 9th to the 12th zinc fingers, which was necessary for nuclear accumulation of EZI as well as sufficient to confer nuclear localizing ability to a heterologous protein. We also found that the N-terminal domain of EZI is necessary for its nuclear export, the process of which was not sensitive to the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B. An interaction proteomics approach and the following co-immunoprecipitation experiments identified the nuclear import receptor importin-7 as a molecule that associated with EZI and, importantly, short interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of importin-7 expression completely abrogated nuclear accumulation of EZI. Taken together, these results identify EZI as a novel cargo protein for importin-7 and demonstrate a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling mechanism that is mediated by importin-7-dependent nuclear localization and CRM1-independent nuclear export.

Subcellular distribution of cellular proteins is a foundation for the molecules to exert their proper functions and hence for normal biological reactions to occur. Although some proteins may diffuse freely in the cells, many are destined to localize in a specific subcellular compartment. To achieve proper subcellular localization, such a protein encodes some intrinsic signal, as well as often requires cognate cellular machinery to support its translocation. Thus, identification of such a signal and machinery is a fundamental issue to understand the molecular mechanism whereby a protein exerts its functions. In eukaryotic cells, the nucleus and the cytoplasm are separated by the nuclear membrane. As protein synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm, nuclear proteins must cross the nuclear membrane through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) 4The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; siRNA, short interfering RNA; aa, amino acid; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export sequence; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; LMB, leptomycin B; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein.4The abbreviations used are: NPC, nuclear pore complex; siRNA, short interfering RNA; aa, amino acid; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export sequence; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; LMB, leptomycin B; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein. to enter the nucleus. Likewise, some nuclear proteins are exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, in such occasions as recycling of signal transducers, withdrawal of transcription factors, or transport of RNA molecules. Although small particles (less than around 20-30 kDa) are capable of passing through the NPC freely by passive diffusion, larger molecules require an energy-dependent mechanism mediated by specific nuclear import and export machineries to translocate between the nucleus and cytoplasm (1Görlich D. Kim U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar, 2Chook Y.M. Kim G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). It is well established that many, if not all, of these processes depend on the functions of the karyopherin family proteins, which can be largely subdivided into the karyopherin α/importin α and karyopherin β/importin β/exportin subfamilies (hereafter referred to as importin α and karyopherin β subfamilies, respectively) based on their structural as well as functional characteristics (3Pemberton L.F. Kim B.M. Traffic. 2005; 6: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Among several distinct mechanisms for nuclear import, the so-called canonical (or classical/conventional) pathway is the best characterized (1Görlich D. Kim U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The substrate proteins (or cargos) conveyed via this pathway possess a characteristic monopartite or bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) composed of one or two cluster(s) of basic amino acid residues. Those canonical NLSs are specifically recognized by one of the members of the importin α subfamily. The importin αs have a binding site for importin/karyopherin β1 (hereafter referred to as importin β), a member of the karyopherin β subfamily, which can also interact with the NPC. Thus, the ternary complex formed by the cargo, importin α, and importin β docks to the NPC and then translocates into the nucleoplasm (1Görlich D. Kim U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). After entering the nucleus, the process is terminated by binding of the GTP-bound form of Ran (RanGTP) and subsequent dissociation of the complex. The other mechanisms for nuclear import include those mediated by a single species of karyopherin βs (single-receptor pathways), by heterodimeric complexes of karyopherin βs (co-receptor pathways), or by direct interaction of a cargo to the NPC without any involvement of the karyopherin family proteins (4Nakielny S. Kim G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Compared with the canonical nuclear import pathway, however, the targeting signals and molecular mechanisms for those noncanonical nuclear import pathways are not well understood, nor is the nature of the cargos governed therein. Of note, importin-7 (also known as RanBP7) is a member of the karyopherin β subfamily (5Görlich D. Kim M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and functions as a nuclear import receptor in importin α-independent, noncanonical pathways (6Jäkel S. Kim D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Molecules homologous to mammalian importin-7 have been found in yeasts and fruit flies and are known to function in both species as a nuclear import receptor (7Rosenblum J.S. Kim L.F. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Brune C. Kim S.E. Fischer N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Weis K.

Kim S.E. Denhez F. Melnick M.B. Brower D.L. Perkins L.A. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This evolutionary conservation, together with the fact that importin-7 exists as highly abundantly as importin-β in the cells examined (5Görlich D. Kim M. Bischoff F.R. Kutay U. Bork P. Hartmann E. Prehn S. Izaurralde E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 65-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), strongly suggests physiological importance of importin-7, yet only a few cargo molecules conveyed by this import receptor have so far been identified, including ribosomal protein L23a (rpL23a), histone H1, and the HIV reverse transcriptase complex (6Jäkel S. Kim D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 11Jäkel S. Kim W. Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Schwamborn K. Doenecke D. Görlich D.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3675-3685Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In active nuclear export processes, proteins with a specific nuclear export sequence (NES) form a ternary complex with an exportin/karyopherin β and RanGTP in the nucleus (13Yoneda Y. Kim M. Nagoshi E. Miyamoto Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1999; 24: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The complex can then translocate to the cytoplasm, where GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, and the NES-containing protein is released. The exportin-RanGDP complex diffuses back to the nucleus where GDP is exchanged to GTP by Ran-guanine nucleotide exchange factors. This process is also energy-dependent as it consumes one GTP per cycle. To date, the best known nuclear export mechanism concerns the short, leucine-rich type of NES, initially identified in the HIV Rev protein, and its binding to the exportin CRM1/Xpo1 (14Fornerod M. Kim M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). This CRM1-dependent nuclear export can be specifically and efficiently inhibited by the drug LMB (15Nishi K. Kim M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like nuclear import pathways, nuclear export pathways other than this canonical one are poorly characterized. We previously identified a gene encoding a novel zinc finger protein, EZI, which is also referred to as ZNF467 (in human) or Zfp467 (in mouse) in data bases (16Nakayama K. Kim K.W. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6174-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The deduced mouse EZI product is of 594 amino acids (aa) in size and contains a zinc finger domain composed of 12 repeats of C2H2-type zinc finger motifs. The zinc finger domain is flanked by an N-terminal and a short C-terminal domain, neither of which contains any known structural motif nor does it show obvious homology to other proteins. Although the physiological role of EZI is still largely unknown, it can interact through its N-terminal domain with the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and potentially enhance STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation. The characteristic feature of EZI is that it localizes predominantly in the nucleus, and our previous study revealed that the zinc finger domain is crucial for its nuclear localization (16Nakayama K. Kim K.W. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6174-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, a mutant form of EZI lacking the zinc finger domain failed to translocate into the nucleus. As this mutant still contains the intact N-terminal domain and thus binds to STAT3, it can sequester STAT3 in the cytoplasm and interferes with its nuclear translocation, leading to inhibition of STAT3 signaling. This strongly suggests that the subcellular distribution of EZI is critical for properly eliciting its function, yet the intrinsic signal(s) and the regulatory machinery that together dictate the localization of EZI still remain elusive. In this study, we address the molecular mechanism whereby EZI localizes in the nucleus. By using a series of deletion and point mutants, we mapped a noncanonical NLS in a portion of the zinc finger domain, which was both necessary and sufficient for nuclear localizing activity. We also found that EZI shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and that its nuclear export is mediated by the N-terminal region via a CRM1-independent mechanism. Finally, importin-7 was identified to be a molecule that physically interacts with EZI, and knockdown experiments using siRNA against importin-7 revealed that this nuclear import receptor is essential for nuclear localization of EZI. Plasmid Construction—The wild type (full-length; 594 aa) as well as all the mutant forms of EZI used were expressed using the eukaryotic expression vector pME18S with Myc epitope tag fused at their N termini, unless otherwise indicated. The constructs for the full-length and two kinds of deletion mutants (EZI-C and FΔZF) were described previously (16Nakayama K. Kim K.W. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6174-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this study we renamed EZI-C and FΔZF as ΔC and ΔZF1-7, respectively, for consistency with the other mutants. The other deletion mutants were generated by standard procedures based on PCR with appropriately designed primers. The MutNLS8 mutant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The exact portions contained in each of the mutants are as follows: ΔN, aa residues 162-594; ΔZF, 1-161 plus 564-594; ΔC, 1-564; ΔZF1-7, 1-161 plus 378-594; ΔZF8-12, 1-378 plus 565-594; ZF1-7, 162-378; ZF8-12, 377-564; MutNLS8, 1-594 with the 447RHRR450 to 447AAAA450 substitutions; ΔZF8, 1-378 plus 454-594; ΔZF9-12, 1-452 plus 565-594; ZF9-12, 453-564; ZF10/11/12, 481-564; ZF9/11/12, 453-480 plus 509-564; ZF9/10/12, 453-508 plus 537-564; ZF9/10/11, 453-536; ΔZF9/10, 1-452 plus 509-594; ΔZF11/12; 1-508 plus 565-594; ΔZF9, 1-452 plus 481-594; ΔZF10, 1-480 plus 509-594; ΔZF11, 1-508 plus 537-594; ΔZF12, 1-536 plus 565-594; ΔN143, 144-594; and ΔN91, 92-594. To express LacZ fusion products, we first subcloned a DNA fragment containing the LacZ coding region (corresponding to the C-terminal 1015 aa), derived from the pCH110 vector, into pME18S with the Myc tag. The resultant vector, pME18SmycLacZ, was designed to contain tandem BglII-NheI-SalI cloning sites between the Myc tag and the LacZ coding region. For the ZF9 LacZ, ZF10 LacZ, ZF11 LacZ, and ZF12 LacZ constructs, synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to each of the zinc finger motifs (ZF9, aa residues 457-483; ZF10, 485-511; ZF11, 512-539; and ZF12, 541-567) were annealed and inserted into the NheI- and SalI-digested pME18SmycLacZ. For ZF9-12 LacZ, a fragment corresponding to the four zinc finger motifs (aa residues 453-564) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the BglII- and SalI-digested pME18SmycLacZ. The full-length cDNA clone for mouse Mybbp1a (I.M.A.G.E. cDNA, clone ID 5363740) was obtained from Invitrogen, and the entire coding region was subcloned into the pME18S vector with FLAG tag at the N terminus. The HA-Hic-5 construct in pCG-N-BL vector was a generous gift from Dr. Mori (Showa University, Tokyo, Japan) (17Shibanuma M. Kim J.R. Ishino K. Sakamoto N. Hishiki T. Yamaguchi K. Mori K. Mashimo J. Nose K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1158-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To prepare the expression construct for hnRNP A1, the entire coding region of mouse hnRNP A1 (321 aa) was amplified by PCR, cleaved with EcoRI and NotI pre-designed in the primers, and inserted between the EcoRI and NotI sites of the pcDNA3 vector with the Myc tag at the N terminus. The full-length (wild type) cDNA for human importin-7 was amplified by PCR from a 293T cell-derived cDNA sample. The K61D mutation (changing the corresponding codon AAA to GAT) was introduced by PCR-based methods using appropriately designed primers and the wild type importin-7 cDNA as a template. The wild type and K61D mutants were each subcloned into the pME18S vector with FLAG tag at their N termini. Integrity of the constructs, in particular all the sequences derived from PCR amplifications, was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—The following antibodies were commercially obtained and used in this study: mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (sc-40), mouse anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody F-7 (sc-7392), and goat anti-actin I-19 (sc-1616) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 and mouse anti-importin β (clone 31H4) were from Sigma; and, goat anti-RANBP7/importin-7 (IMG-3131) was from Imgenex (San Diego). Rabbit polyclonal anti-EZI antibody was raised and prepared as follows. A fragment of EZI cDNA corresponding to the first 430 amino acids was subcloned into the pET-32a (Novagen) and pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs) vectors to produce His tag fusion (His-EZI) and maltose-binding protein-tag fusion (MBP-EZI) recombinants, respectively. Recombinant proteins were overexpressed in the BL-21 CodonPlus (DE3) Escherichia coli strain (Stratagene) and affinity-purified using HisBind purification kit (Merck) and amylose resin (New England Biolabs) for His-EZI and MBP-EZI, respectively. His-EZI was used for immunization (Suka-flat; Saitama, Japan), and the anti-EZI antibody was affinity-purified using MBP-EZI coupled to NHS-activated HP column (GE Healthcare). Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. HeLa cells and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Equitech) and antibiotics. Transient transfection into NIH3T3 cells was carried out using Lipofectamine transfection reagent with Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 4 × 104 cells were seeded on a coverslip (diameter, 18 mm; Matsunami Glass, Japan) put in a well of 12-well plates. After 24 h of incubation, the cells were transfected with 0.8 μg of plasmid DNA using 2 μl of Lipofectamine and 8 μl of the Plus reagent. The cells were further cultured for 24 h before being subjected to analyses, unless otherwise indicated. Transient transfection into COS-7 cells was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in a 100-mm plate and, 24 h later, transfected with 6 μg of plasmid DNAs using 18 μl of FuGENE 6. After 48 h of culture, the cells were harvested and then subjected to co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunofluorescence Analysis—For indirect immunofluorescence analysis to detect subcellular localization of the expressed proteins, cells on the coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then blocked with ImmunoBlock™ (DS Pharma Biomedical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). To detect Myc-tagged, FLAG-tagged, and hemagglutinin-tagged proteins, cells were first incubated with the corresponding monoclonal antibodies and subsequently with the rhodamine-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) unless otherwise indicated. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). The coverslips were mounted on glass slides (Matsunami Glass) and then observed using Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope. Images were taken using a CCD camera (model C4742-95-12ER; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) with Aqua Cosmos 2.0 software, and further processed using Adobe Photoshop CS software. To quantitatively evaluate subcellular localization of the expressed proteins, the relative staining intensities in the nucleus and cytoplasm were monitored and scored for more than 100 cells per each transfection, according to a 5-grade criterion as follows: exclusive staining in the cytoplasm; staining in the cytoplasm exceeding that in the nucleus; equivalent staining in the nucleus and the cytoplasm; staining in the nucleus exceeding that in the cytoplasm; and exclusive staining in the nucleus. The relative number of the cells for each category per total number of the cells examined were calculated and expressed in percentage. The values shown in figures represent mean ± S.D. of duplicate assays. Inter-species Heterokaryon Assay—The inter-species heterokaryons composed of NIH3T3 and HeLa cells were prepared according to the procedure described by Cáceres et al. (18Cáceres J.F. Kim G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 4 × 104 NIH3T3 cells were seeded on coverslips put in 12-well plates and transfected with constructs to be assayed for shuttling ability. Twenty four h posttransfection, the cells were overlaid with an equal number of untransfected HeLa cells for 3 h in the presence of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). When the CRM1-dependent nuclear export pathway was to be inhibited, the cells were treated additionally with 30 ng/ml LMB (LC Laboratories) 3 h before cell fusion. The cells on the coverslips were then covered with a solution of 50% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche Applied Science) for 2 min to induce cell fusion. The solution was replaced with culture medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, as well as 30 ng/ml LMB when necessary, and further incubated for 5 h before fixation. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The NIH3T3 cells transfected with siRNAs were lysed in TNE buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), and the whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore). The membranes were subjected to Western blot analyses with anti-importin β or anti-RANBP7/importin-7 antibody, as well as with anti-β-actin antibody to confirm equal loadings. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, COS-7 cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged human importin-7 and Myc-tagged EZI (3 μg for each). For mock transfections, either of the constructs was replaced with the empty vector to adjust the total amount of plasmids. The cells were lysed in TNE buffer to prepare whole cell extracts, which were then used for immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody. The precipitated proteins as well as whole cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG and anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies. RNA Interference—For RNA interference experiments, synthetic siRNA (obtained as Stealth™ select RNA interference from Invitrogen) targeting mouse importin β (target sequence, 5′-GAGUUGCAGCUGGUCUACAAAUUAA-3′), mouse importin-7 (5′-GGGCAUUGAUCAGUGUAUACCAUUA-3′), or control siRNA without any target sequence in mouse genome (Stealth™ RNAi negative control, Medium GC duplex; Invitrogen) was transfected into NIH3T3 cells using RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) with the reverse transfection protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. We initially tested several experimental conditions with different time courses, and we found that the efficient and maximal level of inhibition for expression of importin β and importin-7 proteins could be achieved 72 and 48 h post-transfection, respectively, with 10 μm of the siRNA. To examine the effect of importin knockdown on nuclear localization of EZI, cells were initially treated with the siRNAs and, after 48 h (for importin-β) or 24 h (for importin-7) of incubation, further transfected with the expression construct for the full-length (Myc-tagged) EZI. Twenty four h later, nuclear localization of EZI was examined by immunofluorescent staining as described above. In importin-7 rescue experiments, FLAG-tagged human importin-7 was co-expressed with Myc-tagged EZI and detected with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. EZI was co-immunostained using rabbit anti-EZI antibody, in combination with AlexaFluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (A21206; Invitrogen). EZI Has a Nuclear Localization Signal in the Zinc Finger Domain—To clarify the mechanism that regulates the nuclear localization of EZI, we set out to perform mutational analyses of this protein. Plasmids for expressing a series of deletion mutants of mouse EZI (Fig. 1A) as Myc epitope-tagged proteins were constructed and transfected into mouse NIH3T3 cells. Distribution of the expressed proteins, either in the nucleus or the cytoplasm, or both, were analyzed by immunofluorescent staining using anti-Myc antibody, followed by quantitative evaluation. As the nuclear localization analysis in our previous study was rather qualitative (16Nakayama K. Kim K.W. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6174-6184Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we first tested whether the requirement of the zinc finger domain for nuclear localization could be confirmed to be quantitatively significant. As shown in Fig. 1B, the wild type EZI, as well as two mutant forms of this molecule, ΔN and ΔC lacking the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains, respectively, showed predominant localization in the nucleus. In contrast, the ΔZF mutant lacking all the 12 zinc finger motifs failed to do so. Thus, the zinc finger domain was confirmed to be necessary for the nuclear localization of EZI. To determine which zinc finger motif(s) is responsible for mediating nuclear localization of EZI, the zinc finger domain was dissected into two parts and separately analyzed. Thus, internal deletion mutants lacking either the N-terminal part (ΔZF1-7) or the C-terminal part (ΔZF8-12) of the zinc finger domain were generated, and subcellular localization of these proteins was examined. We found that the ΔZF1-7 mutant was capable of localizing predominantly in the nucleus, whereas that ΔZF8-12, like ΔZF, showed a clear defect in nuclear localization (Fig. 1C). Thus, the C-terminal half of the zinc finger domain, containing the 8th to the 12th zinc fingers, was suspected to be necessary for nuclear localizing activity. To test whether this subdomain is sufficient for the activity, we also employed mutants containing either the N-terminal part (ZF1-7) or the C-terminal part (ZF8-12) of the zinc finger domain. As shown in Fig. 1C, the ZF8-12 mutant was capable of localizing in the nucleus, and unexpectedly, ZF1-7 also showed the apparent nuclear localizing pattern. Nevertheless, together with the fact that ΔZF8-12 but not ΔZF1-7 has a defect in nuclear localization, we assumed that the ZF8-12 subdomain contains a signal that is functionally required for the nuclear localization of full-length EZI. In contrast, the ZF1-7 subdomain, although by itself showing a cryptic nuclear localizing activity, can be dispensable in the context of the full-length molecule. The RHRR Sequence in the 8th Zinc Finger Does Not Confer Nuclear Localization—In parallel to the experimental approach to dissect EZI and identify its NLS, an attempt was made to predict possible subcellular localization of this molecule as well as responsible signals/sequences involved, by employing the bioinformatics algorithm PSORT II. Based on this program, the full-length EZI was predicted to be a nuclear protein with one NLS sequence, 447RHRR450, which can be found in the 8th zinc finger motif (ZF8). This led us to hypothesize that the predicted RHRR sequence was responsible for the NLS activity found in ZF8-12 as mentioned above, and this notion was examined by using two types of EZI mutants. The MutNLS8 mutant contains four alanine substitutions specifically at the RHRR sequence, whereas ΔZF8 lacks the entire ZF8 motif (Fig. 1A). Surprisingly, both of these mutants accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 1D), indicating that RHRR is not necessarily required for nuclear localization of EZI, nor does it account for the NLS activity. In stark contrast to the lack of contribution of ZF8, the remaining four zinc finger motifs, ZF9-12, was found to be critical for nuclear localization of EZI, as an internal deletion mutant lacking these motifs (Fig. 1A, ΔZF9-12) showed predominant cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, the ZF9-12 mutant, composed only of these motifs, was still capable of localizing in the nucleus (Fig. 1D), thereby indicating that ZF9-12 is necessary and sufficient for the NLS activity. The Entire ZF9/10/11/12 Motifs Are Important for EZI Nuclear Localization—To further pinpoint the NLS sequence in the ZF9-12 region, we constructed the ΔZF9/10 and ΔZF11/12 mutants, each lacking two of the four zinc finger motifs in the full-length context. Both of these mutants showed a significant defect in nuclear localization (data not shown). Thus, we next deleted each of the four zinc finger motifs in the ZF9-12 region, resulting in the ΔZF9, ΔZF10, ΔZF11, and ΔZF12 mutants (Fig. 2A), and we examined their effects on nuclear localization of EZI. As shown in Fig. 2B, all of the four mutants showed diffuse distribution patterns, with apparent and significant staining observed in the cytoplasm. We also tested the effect of the same deletions in the context of ZF9-12, using the mutants ZF10/11/12, ZF9/11/12, ZF9/10/12, and ZF9/10/11. Even though all of these mutants still retain the ability to localize preferentially in the nucleus, partial yet significant defects were apparently observed when compared with the complete nuclear localization of ZF9-12 (Fig. 2C; compare with Fig. 1D). These results suggest that all of the four zinc finger motifs comprising the ZF9-12 are req"

The formation of the ternary product complex was initiated with a 6-ns laser pulse, which allowed the product release steps to be kinetically accessed for the first time. Subsequent absorbance changes associated with the release of the NADP+ and chlorophyllide products from the enzyme could be followed on a millisecond timescale. This has facilitated a detailed kinetic and thermodynamic characterization for the interconversion of all the various bound and unbound product species. Initially, NADP+ is released from the enzyme in a biphasic process with rate constants of 1210 and 237 s–1. The rates of both phases show a significant dependence on the viscosity of the solvent and become considerably slower at higher glycerol concentrations. The fast phase of this process exhibits no dependence on NADP+ concentration, suggesting that conformational changes are required prior to NADP+ release. Following NADP+ release, the NADPH rebinds to the enzyme with a maximum rate constant of ∼72 s–1. At elevated temperatures (>298 K) chlorophyllide is released from the enzyme to yield the free product with a maximum rate constant of 20 s–1. The temperature dependencies of the rates of each of these steps were measured, and enthalpies and entropies of activation were calculated using the Eyring equation.

A comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic scheme for these final stages of the reaction mechanism is presented. The light-driven enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR; EC 1.3.1.33) 3The abbreviations used are: POR, protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase; Pchlide, protochlorophyllide; Chlide, chlorophyllide.3The abbreviations used are: POR, protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase; Pchlide, protochlorophyllide; Chlide, chlorophyllide. is an excellent model system for studying the role of protein dynamics and thermodynamics in enzyme catalysis and more generally, the mechanism and time-scales of enzymatic proton and hydride transfers (1Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 642-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). POR catalyzes the light-dependent trans addition of hydrogen across the C17=C18 double bond of the D-ring of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) to produce chlorophyllide (Chlide), which is a key reaction within the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway and the subsequent assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus (Fig. 1A) (1Heyes D.J.

Res. 2004; 81: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Significant progress in understanding and solving the catalytic mechanism of the reaction has been made in recent years, which has consequently opened up exciting new areas in enzymology by exploring temperature ranges and very fast timescales that are generally not experimentally accessible with the majority of enzymes (5Lebedev N. Kim M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9954-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 6Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2003; 10: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). During the reaction a hydride is transferred from the pro-S face of the nicotinamide ring of NADPH to the C-17 position of the Pchlide molecule (10Valera V. Kim M. Wessler A.N. Richards W.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Begley T.P. Kim H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 111: 3095-3096Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and a conserved Tyr residue has been proposed to donate a proton to the C-18 position (12Wilks H.M. Kim M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The close proximity of a conserved Lys residue is thought necessary to lower the apparent pKa of the phenolic group of the Tyr, allowing deprotonation to occur at physiological pH (12Wilks H.M. Kim M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As POR is light-driven, the ternary enzyme-substrate complex can be formed in the “dark”, prior to catalysis, thus removing the diffusive components from the kinetic analyses. Catalysis can then be triggered by illumination, using low temperatures to slow down Pchlide reduction and trap intermediates in the reaction pathway. Consequently, a number of catalytic steps, involving the initial photochemistry followed by a series of dark reactions, have been identified, and this has resulted in a detailed understanding of the entire catalytic cycle (6Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The initial light-driven step, which can occur below 200 K, results in the formation of a non-fluorescent intermediate with a broad absorbance band at 696 nm (6Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). By using a combination of EPR, ENDOR, and Stark spectroscopies, in conjunction with low temperature absorbance spectroscopy, this intermediate was shown recently to be a charge-transfer complex resulting from hydride transfer from the NADPH molecule to the C17 position of Pchlide (13Heyes D.J.

This then facilitates the protonation of the C18 position of Pchlide from the protein during the first of the dark reactions (13Heyes D.J. Kim P. Rigby S.E. J. Palacios M.A. van Grondelle R. Hunter C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26847-26853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The remaining dark steps only occur close to, or above, the “glass transition” temperature of proteins, implying a role for domain movements and/or reorganization of the protein for these stages of the catalytic cycle (7Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These latter catalytic events have been shown to represent a series of ordered product release and cofactor binding events. First, NADP+ is released from the enzyme and is replaced by the NADPH coenzyme. This is followed by release of the Chlide product and subsequent binding of the Pchlide substrate to complete the catalytic cycle (Fig. 1B) (8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition to using low temperature regimes to trap and observe catalytic intermediates, POR has also been analyzed using ultrafast pulses of light (9Heyes D.J. Hunter Kim van Stokkum I. H. M. van Grondelle R. Groot M. L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Catalysis was triggered with a 50-fs laser pulse, and the subsequent reaction dynamics were followed in real time by using ultrafast pump-probe absorption spectroscopy. The product state in its excited state was proposed to form with time constants of 3 and 400 ps, demonstrating that the chemistry in the reaction appeared to occur on an ultrafast timescale (9Heyes D.J. Hunter Kim van Stokkum I. H. M. van Grondelle R. Groot M. L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, following these very fast chemical events there is currently a lack of kinetic data on the subsequent product release events in the catalytic cycle that occur on a much slower timescale. Therefore, in this paper we have used laser flash techniques to kinetically disentangle the chemistry from the product release steps and have followed the interconversion of the various bound/unbound Chlide product species. Catalysis has been triggered using a 6-ns laser pulse, leading to the formation of the ternary POR-NADP+-Chlide product complex and facilitating the measurement of absorbance changes associated with the release of NADP+ and Chlide from the enzyme. In addition, measurements have been carried out over a range of temperatures to obtain both thermodynamic and kinetic data for these later steps in the catalytic cycle. Sample Preparation—Recombinant POR from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The Pchlide and Chlide pigments were produced and purified as described previously (8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). NADPH/NADP+ was obtained from Melford. Laser Flash Photolysis—For laser photoexcitation experiments, 1-ml samples containing 30 μm POR, 100 μm NADPH, and 10 μm Pchlide in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Genapol, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol were excited at 450 nm by using an optical parametric oscillator of a Q-switched Nd-YAG laser (Brilliant B, Quantel) in a cuvette of 1-cm path length. The energy output of each laser pulse was up to 200 mJ and pulses were 6–8 ns in duration. Spectral transients were recorded at 670, 681, and 685 nm using an Applied Photophysics LKS-60 flash photolysis instrument with the detection system at right angles to the incident laser beam. The probe light (150 watt xenon lamp) was passed through a monochromator before and after passage through the sample. Absorbance changes were measured using a photomultiplier tube, and kinetic transients were typically collected over 50 ms to 5 s. Experiments were averaged three times and repeated at various temperatures between 5–55 °C by using a circulating water bath (Fisherbrand) and at a range of glycerol and NADP+ concentrations. Absorbance spectra were measured before and after laser photoexcitation by transferring the cuvette to a Cary 50 UV/visible spectrophotometer (Varian) and recording data between 300–800 nm. Data from photoexcitation experiments were analyzed and fitted to appropriate exponential functions using SigmaPlot (Systat Software). In temperature dependence studies the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters were obtained by fitting the data to the Eyring equation as described previously (14Basran J. Kim M.J. Scrutton N.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 15Basran J. Kim S. Sutcliffe M.J. Scrutton N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6234-6242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Kinetic Overview of the Product Release Steps—The catalytic reaction of POR has been triggered by using a 6-ns laser pulse tuned to the Soret region of the Pchlide absorbance spectrum. As the POR-NADP+-Chlide ternary product complex, with a characteristic absorbance peak at 681 nm (8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is formed on a very fast timescale (9Heyes D.J. Hunter Kim van Stokkum I. H. M. van Grondelle R. Groot M. L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 491-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) we are able to follow the subsequent slower product release processes on the millisecond to second timescales by monitoring the absorbance changes associated with the various bound and unbound Chlide forms. Kinetic transients have been measured at wavelengths associated with POR-NADP+-Chlide (681 nm), POR-Chlide (670 nm), POR-NADPH-Chlide (685 nm), and free Chlide (670 nm), which are formed after the faster chemical steps (8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows a typical transient that is observed at 670 nm, which reveals the formation and interconversion of all of the various product states in the reaction pathway. The predominant signal appears to arise from the initial increase in absorbance at 670 nm as the NADP+ is released from the POR-NADP+-Chlide ternary product complex to form a POR-Chlide state. This is accompanied by a simultaneous large decrease in absorbance at 681 nm (Fig. 2B). The transients at both of these wavelengths can be fitted to a biphasic process with similar rate constants, confirming that they represent the same kinetic event. Following the release of NADP+ the absorbance at 670 nm decreases, with a concomitant increase at 685 nm (Fig. 2C) as the NADPH substrate rebinds to the enzyme to form a POR-NADPH-Chlide complex. Finally, there is slower increase at 670 nm, together with a decrease at 685 nm, to yield the unbound or “free” Chlide product (Fig. 2C). Subsequently, to characterize these events in more detail we have carried out a thorough kinetic and thermodynamic investigation of each step and have summarized the results in Table 1.TABLE 1Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the product release steps of PORProduct release eventMaximum kobsΔH‡ΔS‡s-1kJ mol-1J K-1 mol-1NADP+ release (fast)1210 ± 90.869.52 ± 6.1234.30 ± 3.01NADP+ release (slow)236.5 ± 6.270.76 ± 6.8921.21 ± 2.21NADPH rebinding71.6 ± 7.566.27 ± 3.05-0.0083 ± 0.0005Chlide release20.4 ± 1.470.34 ± 6.16-5.30 ± 0.54 Open table in a new tab Characterization of the NADP+ Release Step—Following catalysis and the formation of the ternary product complex the NADP+ is released from the enzyme in a reaction that is represented by a decrease in absorbance at 681 nm and an increase in absorbance at 670 nm. Kinetic transients at each of these wavelengths reveal that this step is a biphasic process with the fast phase contributing ∼25% of the overall amplitude of the absorbance change. The rates of both phases have been measured over a range of temperatures from 5–50 °C by fitting to a double exponential function (Fig. 3A). Maximal rates are achieved at ∼50 °C with observed rate constants of 1280 ± 93.6 and 199 ± 2.8 s–1 at 670 nm and 1210 ± 90.8 and 236.5 ± 6.2 s–1 at 681 nm. To obtain more detailed thermodynamic information the data were refitted in the form of an Eyring plot of ln (kobs/T) versus 1/T (Fig. 3B). The enthalpy of activation, ΔH‡, was calculated from the slope of each plot, and the entropy of activation, ΔS‡, was calculated by extrapolation to the ordinate axis for each of the phases (Table 1). We also studied the effect of increasing NADP+ concentration on the rate of both kinetic phases. There is only a minor or negligible dependence on the rate of the fast phase of the absorption decrease at 681 nm (Fig. 4A, inset). In contrast, the rate of the slower phase becomes considerably reduced at higher NADP+ concentrations and therefore exhibits a significant NADP+ dependence (Fig. 4A). Neither phase of the absorbance decrease at 681 nm shows any apparent dependence on NADPH nor Chlide concentrations (data not shown). As it has previously been suggested that protein motions are required for these stages of catalysis (7Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), it might be expected that increases in the viscosity of the solvent would affect the rate constants associated with NADP+ release. Fig. 4B shows the effect of increasing glycerol concentrations on the rate of both phases of the absorption decrease at 681 nm. There is a significant reduction in both rates as the viscosity increases, resulting in an approximate 200-fold reduction at 70% glycerol. Characterization of NADPH Binding—After the release of NADP+ the NADPH coenzyme is able to rebind to the enzyme. This results in a decrease in absorbance at 670 nm and a simultaneous increase in the absorbance band at 685 nm as the POR-Chlide-state is converted to the POR-NADPH-Chlide ternary complex. Both of these absorbance changes are monophasic giving a single rate constant, which we have subsequently measured over a range of temperatures (Fig. 5A). A maximal rate is achieved at ∼45 °C of 71.6 ± 7.5 s–1. An Eyring plot of ln (kobs/T) v 1/T (Fig. 5B) provides more detailed thermodynamic information for this step, and the calculated parameters are summarized in Table 1. We observed no apparent dependence on NADPH, NADP+, or Chlide concentrations on the rate of absorbance increase at 685 nm. Characterization of the Chlide Release Step—The final step in the catalytic cycle of POR is the release of the Chlide product. During this step the absorbance band at 685 nm (reporting on the presence of the POR-Childe-NADPH complex) disappears, and the free form of Childe accumulates, indicated by an absorption increases at 670 nm. Again, the decrease in absorbance at 685 nm and the absorbance increase at 670 nm are kinetically linked and can both be fitted to single rate constants. However, the temperature dependence of this step reveals that it can only proceed above 25 °C with a maximal rate achieved at ∼55 °C of 20.4 ± 1.4 s–1(Fig. 6). The Eyring plot for this process has allowed the calculation of the enthalpy and entropy of activation to be +70.34 ± 6.16 J K–1 mol–1 and –5.30 ± 0.54 J K–1 mol–1, respectively. The light-driven enzyme POR has previously been shown to be an important model system for studying aspects of enzyme mechanism (1Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 642-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with the identification of a number of reaction intermediates allowing the entire catalytic cycle to be resolved (6Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Wilks H.M. Hunter C.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11145-11150Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have now used laser flash methods to measure the kinetics of the slower product release steps in the reaction, which have previously been suggested to require protein motions to proceed (7Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Catalysis has been initiated by laser irradiation at 450 nm to form the ternary POR-NADP+-Chlide product complex with a characteristic absorbance band at 681 nm. Consequently, this species undergoes a series of product release and substrate-rebinding events before a new catalytic cycle can begin. Each of these steps has a distinct spectroscopic signal and has now been studied in more detail, resulting in the complete kinetic and thermodynamic scheme depicted in Fig. 7. Initially, NADP+ is released from the ternary product complex in what appears to be a biphasic process. The rates of formation of the POR-Chlide species, absorbing at 670 nm, mirrored the disappearance of the POR-NADP+-Chlide complex at 681 nm, confirming that both of these spectral events represent the same kinetic process. Maximal rates of 1210 and 237 s–1 were measured at 50 °C with enthalpies of activation calculated to be +69.5 and +70.8 kJ mol–1 and entropies of activation calculated to be 34.3 and 21.2 J K–1 mol–1. These kinetic and thermodynamic parameters are the first such values to be calculated for the product release steps of POR and will therefore prove to be invaluable in analyzing site-directed mutants and species variants in the future. Importantly, a dependence on NADP+ concentration could only be observed for the second phase of the NADP+ release step, with a negligible detectable effect on the first phase. This suggests that the first phase represents a conformational change or a reorganization of the protein, which then facilitates the release of the products and substrate rebinding during the subsequent steps. This is in agreement with previous low temperature work, which revealed that these stages of the reaction could only proceed above the glass transition temperature of proteins, suggesting that protein motions or domain movements are required (7Heyes D.J. Kim A.V. Hunter C.N. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Heyes D.J. Kim C.N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 8265-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The effects of any possible protein dynamics and conformational changes were investigated further by measuring rates of absorbance decrease at 681 nm at increasing solvent viscosities. A significant dependence on the glycerol concentration was observed for both phases of NADP+ release suggesting that solvent viscosity played an important role in this process. It is widely accepted that viscosity can significantly influence and control the conformational changes of a protein, and it has been demonstrated that the dynamics of a protein are considerably slower in a high viscosity solvent (16Beece D. Kim L. Frauenfelder H. Good D. Marden M.C. Reinisch L. Reynolds A.H. Sorensen L.B. Yue K.T. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5147-5157Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 17Ansari A. Kim C.M. Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Eaton W.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1796-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 18Dirama T.E. Kim G.A. Sokolov A.P. J. Chem. Phys. 2005; 122: 244910Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the slower rates observed during the first phase of NADP+ release at higher solvent viscosities are caused by a reduction in the rate of the conformational changes in the enzyme that are now proposed to be required. It is also known that the solvent viscosity will influence the rate at which a product can dissociate from the active site of an enzyme (19Sierks M.R. Kim C. Zaw M. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and hence, at higher viscosities the NADP+ product is released at much slower rates during the second phase. Following NADP+ release, NADPH coenzyme rebinds to the enzyme to form a POR-NADPH-Chlide complex in a single step with a maximal rate of ∼72 s–1. Eyring analysis for this rebinding event suggests that the contribution of the entropy term is minimal in this process. No dependence on NADPH concentration was observed although we noted that in these laser photoexcitation experiments the initial concentration of NADPH was relatively high to ensure that prior to catalysis all of the Pchlide substrate was in the ternary substrate complex form. As the enzyme also has a high affinity for NADPH (18Dirama T.E. Kim G.A. Sokolov A.P. J. Chem. Phys. 2005; 122: 244910Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 19Sierks M.R. Kim C. Zaw M. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) it is perhaps not surprising that a dependence on the NADPH concentration is not observed. The final stage of the catalytic cycle is the release of the final product, Chlide. This can only occur at higher temperatures with a maximal rate of 20.4 s–1 at 55 °C. The rates of this step are faster than the overall kcat value for the reaction, which has been previously determined from steady-state measurements to be ∼0.2 s–1 (20McFarlane M.J. Kim C.N. Heyes D.J. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2005; 4: 1055-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 21Heyes D.J. Kim G.E. M. Reid R.J. Hunter C.N. Wilks H.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 483: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This suggests that the product release events are not rate-limiting in the overall catalytic cycle. We suggest, therefore, that substrate binding and any associated conformational changes or protein rearrangements to form the catalytically active ternary substrate complex are rate-limiting. In conclusion, as a light-activated enzyme POR offers unique opportunities over the many “thermally activated” enzymes in that the product release events can be kinetically disentangled from the preceding substrate binding and chemical steps. Hence, for the first time we have been able to kinetically and thermodynamically characterize all of these latter product release steps for POR by using novel laser excitation techniques, thus advancing our general understanding of the entire catalytic cycle. This work further illustrates the importance of this light-driven enzyme as a model system for studying enzyme mechanism."

Mediator complex is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional cofactor, which plays an essential role in positive and negative gene regulation. Distinct Mediator subunit composition is thought to contribute to gene regulation specificity based on the interaction of specific subunits with subsets of transcription factors. Here we report that down-regulation of Med28 expression in NIH3T3 cells results in a significant induction of several genes associated with smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of MED28 represses expression of SMC genes, in concordance with our knockdown data. More importantly, multipotent mesenchymal-derived murine precursors can transdifferentiate into SMCs when Med28 is down-regulated. Our data also show that Med28 functions as a negative regulator of SMC differentiation in concert with other Mediator subunits including Med6, Med8, and Med18 within the Mediator head module. Our results provide strong evidence that MED28 may function as a scaffolding protein by maintaining the stability of a submodule within the head module and that components of this submodule act together in a gene regulatory program to suppress SMC differentiation. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that the mammalian Mediator subunit MED28 functions as a repressor of SMC differentiation, which could have implications for disorders associated with abnormalities in SMC growth and differentiation, including atherosclerosis, asthma, hypertension, and smooth muscle tumors.

We previously identified a novel protein, which we named magicin, as a specific binding partner for the cytoskeletal neurofibromatosis 2 tumor suppressor protein merlin. These two proteins interact in vitro and in vivo and colocalize beneath the plasma membrane. Magicin is a ∼24-kDa protein expressed in many cell lines and tissues. Similar to merlin, magicin associates with the actin cytoskeleton as determined by cofractionation, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Our results suggest a role for magicin in receptor-mediated signaling at the cell surface and its possible involvement in the regulation of cytoskeletal reorganization (1Wiederhold T. Kim M.F. James M. Neujahr R. Smith N. Murthy A. Hartwig J. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8815-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our recent work also documents that magicin associates with Src-family kinases such as Fyn, Src, and Lck and is phosphorylated by Lck in the T lymphocyte leukemia Jurkat cell line upon CD3 stimulation (2Lee M.F. Kim R.L. Beyer K.S. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 348: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Magicin was independently identified as a differentially expressed gene in endothelial cells and named endothelial-derived gene (EG-1) (3Liu C. Kim L. Shao Z.M. Beatty P. Sartippour M. Lane T.F.

EG-1 expression is elevated in several tumors, and overexpression of EG-1 increases cell proliferation (4Lu M. Kim L. Maul R.S. Sartippour M.R. Norris A. Whitelegge J. Rao J.Y. Brooks M.N.

Surprisingly, and more importantly, magicin was also identified as a subunit (MED28) within the mammalian Mediator complex, which functions in the nucleus to regulate transcription (6Brower C.S. Kim S. Tomomori-Sato C. Kamura T. Pause A. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Malik S. Lane W.S. Sorokina I. Roeder R.G. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Mediator complex, originally identified in yeast, was subsequently isolated in mammalian cells comprising 30 subunits. Mediator is an important component of the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery and plays a crucial role in the activation and repression of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis (8Conaway R.C. Kim S.

Thus magicin, which we will hereafter refer to as MED28, may serve as a multifaceted adaptor/scaffolding protein to relay cellular signals to the cytoskeleton and from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus. Mediator exists in at least two forms, differing mainly by the presence or absence of a negative regulatory submodule consisting of cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), 3The abbreviations used are: CDK8, cyclin-dependent kinase 8; SMC, smooth muscle cell; SM-MHC, smooth muscle-myosin heavy chain; SM-αActin, smooth muscle-αActin; SM-γActin, smooth muscle-γActin; CRP1, cysteinrich protein 1; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; h, human; KD, knockdown. cyclin C, MED12, and MED13 (9Malik S.

Different Mediator subunits are targets for interactions with various DNA-binding transcriptional activators. Mediator complexes with the same subunit composition are proposed to have distinct activities through interactions with different transcriptional activation domains (10Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem.

Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In addition, studies addressing the functions of the intact mammalian Mediator complex, as well as individual subunits, are beginning to emerge (13Stumpf M. Kim C. Krotschel M. van Essen D.

Nature. 2006; 442: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether MED28 plays a role in controlling specific transcriptional programs and to determine putative target genes regulated by MED28, we performed whole genome expression profiling of Med28 RNAi knockdown in NIH3T3 cells and observed that Med28 suppression results in a significant induction of many genes involved in smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation. Overexpression of MED28 represses the expression of SMC genes consistent with our RNAi knockdown data. Intriguingly, our results also show that Med28 suppression in the multipotent mesenchymal-derived murine precursor cell line C2C12 results in transdifferentiation into SMCs, a differentiation pathway not previously associated with this cell line. Furthermore, induction of SMC differentiation by Med28 knockdown involves destabilization of several other subunits in the mammalian Mediator head module. The results presented here demonstrate for the first time that mammalian Mediator subunit MED28 functions as a repressor of SMC differentiation, and this observation could have wide medical implications since abnormalities in SMC growth and differentiation are linked to many disorders, including atherosclerosis, asthma, hypertension, and smooth muscle tumors. Reagents and Antibodies—Human full-length MED28 (hMED28) was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) plasmid, as well as the CSCW2 lentiviral plasmid. The CSCW2 vector, packaging, and viral supernatants were provided through the Neuroscience NINDS, National Institutes of Health, Vector Core at Massachusetts General Hospital. For RNAi, SMARTpool® reagents were obtained from Dharmacon RNA Technologies and included murine Med28 (NM_ 025895; catalog number M-063448-00) and Med6 (NM_027213; catalog number M-055846-00), individual siRNA reagent for murine Med28 (accession number D-063448-02), as well as non-targeting siControl (catalog number D-001206-13-05). Primary antibodies used included the anti-MED28 antibodies Tim3 (rabbit polyclonal) and 7E1 (mouse monoclonal), which have been previously described (1Wiederhold T. Kim M.F. James M. Neujahr R. Smith N. Murthy A. Hartwig J. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8815-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); M2 (anti-FLAG monoclonal; Sigma), MED6, CDK8, and SM22α/transgelin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); SM-γActin (MP Biomedicals); GAPDH (Chemicon); and SM-αActin, α-tubulin, and normal rabbit serum (Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for MED8, MED17, and MED18 were a kind gift from Drs. R. C. Conaway and J. W. Conaway, and a second MED17 rabbit polyclonal antibody was a kind gift from Dr. R. G. Roeder. Secondary antibodies included horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for Western analysis and Alex Fluor 594-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and Cy3-donkey anti-mouse for immunofluorescence. Cell Culture—The mouse fibroblast line NIH3T3 was maintained in Iscove’s Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). The multipotent, mesenchymal-derived C2C12 line was cultured at ≤60% confluency in growth medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) to prevent myoblast differentiation. Transfection and Infection—All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, utilizing reverse transfection methods to increase transfection efficiency. For rescue experiments, C2C12 cells were transfected with either small interfering control or siRNA-mMed28 plus GFP-hMED28 plasmid. Transfections were harvested at 48 (for NIH3T3) and 72 h (for C2C12) after transfection. Lentiviral infections were carried out in NIH3T3 cells using low titer viral supernatants of either CSCW2 vector alone or hMED28-CSCW2 at a multiplicity of infection of 100 transforming units/cell. At 72 h after infection, cells were analyzed for enhanced GFP expression and fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted by the Analytical and Quantitative Cytology Core Facility at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Nuclear Fractionation, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Isolation of nuclear fractions was carried out using a modification of the Dignam et al. method (28Dignam J.D. Kim R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9168) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was carried out as described previously (1Wiederhold T. Kim M.F. James M. Neujahr R. Smith N. Murthy A. Hartwig J. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8815-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, for endogenous co-IP of Med28 and Med6, NIH3T3 lysates were incubated with anti-MED28 (Tim3), anti-MED6, or normal rabbit serum (as control), along with protein A (MED28 and normal rabbit serum)- or protein G (MED6)-Sepharose (Roche Diagnostics). For co-IP from NIH3T3 nuclear extracts (containing 0.42 m NaCl), extracts were diluted with an equal volume of Dignam Buffer A and then subjected to co-IP using anti-CDK8, anti-MED7, anti-MED17, anti-MED8, and normal rabbit serum as a negative control. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (1Wiederhold T. Kim M.F. James M. Neujahr R. Smith N. Murthy A. Hartwig J. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8815-8825Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, lysates were quantitated, and equal amounts (50–100 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose Trans-Blot transfer medium (Bio-Rad), and incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Expression Profiling—Total RNA was harvested using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality control of the RNA (Agilent bioanalyzer) and hybridization on mouse 430 2.0 chips from Affymetrix were performed by the MGH Cancer Center DNA Microarray Core Facility. The results were analyzed using the GeneSifter software (vizXlabs) and the GeneChip® operating software (GCOS) from Affymetrix. Real-time RT-PCR and Standard RT-PCR—First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out to analyze Med28 expression, as well as the SM differentiation cofactor cysteine-rich protein 1 (CRP1) (Csrp1) and SM differentiation markers including SM22α (Tagln), SM-αActin (Acta2), and SM-γActin (Actg2). To perform real-time RT-PCR, first-strand cDNA was combined with iQ SYBR Green supermix (Bio-Rad) and mouse sequence-specific primers for Med28, CRP1, SM22α, SM-αActin, and SM-γActin, as well as the control housekeeping gene GAPDH. Reactions were carried out using a Bio-Rad iCycler and analyzed with MYiQ detection system and software. Fold changes in gene expression were calculated using the comparative CT (threshold cycle) method. Standard RT-PCR using mouse-specific primers was also carried out for 27–35 cycles to visualize changes in expression for Med28, SM22α, SM-γActin, SM-αActin, CRP1, and GAPDH, as well as the definitive smooth muscle marker SM-myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC). Primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1. Mouse-specific primers for SM-MHC have been previously described (29Moretti A. Kim L. Nakano A. Lam J.T. Bernshausen A. Chen Y. Qyang Y. Bu L.

Knockdown of Med28 in NIH3T3 Cells Reveals Up-regulation of a Set of SMC Genes—In an earlier study where we isolated MED28 (magicin) as a novel merlin-interacting protein, we observed Med28 in association with the actin cytoskeleton of the mouse neuronal (Cath. a-differentiated) cell line as determined by cofractionation, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy (1Wiederhold T.

MED28 has also been identified as a subunit of the mammalian Mediator complex functioning in the nucleus as a transcriptional co-regulator (6Brower C.S. Kim S. Tomomori-Sato C. Kamura T. Pause A. Stearman R. Klausner R.D. Malik S. Lane W.S. Sorokina I. Roeder R.G. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10353-10358Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 7Sato S. Kim C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y. Washburn M.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus MED28 is a unique Mediator subunit with possible functions both in the cytoskeleton and in the nucleus. In an effort to identify the genes that are regulated by MED28, we compared the gene expression profiles in NIH3T3 cells where Med28 expression was knocked down by RNAi, versus a non-targeting siRNA control, by microarray analysis. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Med28 was carried out (see “Experimental Procedures“) in triplicate, and effectiveness of RNAi was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). Expression profiling employing the Affymetrix mouse expression array 430 2.0 revealed 39 genes that displayed at least a 2-fold change in expression (p < 0.05) upon knockdown of Med28 (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Interestingly, among the most significant changes, we observed a striking up-regulation of SMC-related genes, including Tagln (SM22α), Actg2 (SM-γActin), and Cnn2 (calponin2), after Med28 suppression (Fig. 1B). Further RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR analyses confirmed the increased expression of several SMC genes in Med28 knockdown cells (Fig. 1C, left panel). In addition, we examined NIH3T3 cells where MED28 was stably overexpressed and observed down-regulation of the respective SMC genes, confirming that regulation of SMC genes by Med28 is bona fide and specific (Fig. 1C, right panel). Western blot analyses of Med28 knockdown and overexpressed cells were consistent with RT-PCR results (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that MED28 normally functions as a negative regulator of smooth muscle differentiation. Med28 Suppression in C2C12 Cells Induces Transdifferentiation into Smooth Muscle Cells—To study the effect of Med28 suppression in a more relevant cell type, we examined the expression of Med28 in a primary rat vascular smooth muscle cell line as well as multipotent mesenchymal-derived murine myoblast precursors (C2C12). Since the expression of Med28 was very low in rat vascular smooth muscle cells, we chose C2C12 cells for subsequent experiments. Consistent with results obtained with NIH3T3 cells, suppression of Med28 in C2C12 cells also resulted in the up-regulation of SM22α, SM-αActin, CRP1, and SM-γActin, as revealed by Western blotting and RT-PCR (Fig. 2, A and B). The SM-specific transcript encoding SM-MHC also showed an up-regulation by RT-PCR, further confirming that the expression of Med28 negatively regulates SM-specific genes (Fig. 2B). Both myogenin and MyoD, markers associated with skeletal muscle differentiation, did not increase upon Med28 knockdown (data not shown). More interestingly, C2C12 cells where Med28 was down-regulated by RNAi exhibited a distinct large and flattened cell morphology resembling smooth muscle cells (Fig. 2C, panel b) when compared with cells transfected with non-targeting control siRNA (Fig. 2C, panel a). Immunofluorescence analysis of SM-αActin further confirmed the presence of smooth muscle cells in Med28 knockdown C2C12 cells (Fig. 2C, panel d) when compared with control cells (Fig. 2C, panel c). Our data therefore clearly demonstrate for the first time that Med28 suppression can result in transdifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into smooth muscle cells. In addition, up-regulation of SM-MHC, a definitive marker of smooth muscle cells, confirms that the observed morphology following Med28 suppression is that of smooth muscle cells and not myofibroblasts. Exogenous Expression of MED28 Rescues the SM Morphology Induced by Med28 Knockdown in C2C12 Cells—To determine whether the observed morphology changes were in fact due to down-regulation of Med28, we carried out rescue experiments by co-transfecting mouse-specific siRNA of Med28 along with GFP-tagged hMED28. Overexpression of GFP-hMED28 partially rescued the smooth muscle morphology induced by Med28 knockdown in C2C12 cells (Fig. 2D, panels a and b). GFP-negative cells (Fig. 2D, panel d, dashed oval) clearly revealed the smooth muscle cell morphology (Fig. 2D, panel c, dashed oval; actin-phalloidin staining), whereas GFP-positive cells, representing hMED28 overexpression, displayed a wild-type morphology (Fig. 2D, panels c and d, arrows). These results further confirm that MED28 functions as a repressor of smooth muscle differentiation in these cells. MED28 Acts within a Submodule of the Mediator to Suppress SM Cell Fate—Since MED28 is present both in the nucleus and in the cytosol associated with the cytoskeleton, we raised the question whether the negative regulation of SMC differentiation by Med28 is dependent or independent of its function as a mammalian Mediator subunit. Employing an anti-MED28 antibody developed in-house, first we examined the association of Med28 with representative mammalian Mediator subunits Med6, Med17, Med8 and Cdk8 in NIH3T3 cells and found that Med28 can co-immunoprecipitate at the endogenous levels with Mediator subunits of head module (Med6, Med17, Med8) and a kinase module component (Cdk8) (supplemental Fig. S1). We next examined whether Med28 suppression influenced the cellular levels of selected Mediator complex subunits in C2C12 cells. Interestingly, we observed a consistent down-regulation of head module components, including Med6, Med8, and Med18, in Med28 knockdown cells (Fig. 3A). Levels of Med17, another head module subunit, did not change. In addition, Cdk8, a subunit of the kinase module, revealed a trend toward down-regulation (Fig. 3A). We therefore raised the question whether suppression of another Mediator subunit, down-regulated upon Med28 knockdown, also results in up-regulation of SMC differentiation markers. We chose Med6 as a representative to carry out siRNA-mediated suppression in C2C12 cells and observed that Med6 suppression, similar to Med28 suppression, resulted in up-regulation of SM-αActin and SM22α expression (Fig. 3B) along with other SMC markers including SM-MHC (Fig. 3C). Similar to Med28 knockdown, Med6 down-regulation resulted in transdifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into smooth muscle cells (Fig. 3D, panels a and b). Taken together, these results suggest that Med28 functions as a negative regulator of SMC differentiation in concert with Med6 and perhaps other subunits within the head module. Our results support the idea that Med28 may function as a scaffolding protein by maintaining the stability of a submodule within the head module. The highly conserved, multiprotein Mediator complex functions as a bridge between transcription factors bound at upstream promoter elements/enhancers and RNA polymerase II/general initiation factors at the core promoter (8Conaway R.C.

Sci. 2005; 30: 235-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Mammalian Mediator is composed of at least 30 subunits and, similar to yeast Mediator, is organized into subcomplexes and modules (9Malik S. Kim R.G. Trends Biochem.

Biol. 2006; 13: 895-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). MED28, which we originally identified as a merlin interactor (magicin), is established as one of the head module subunits (16Chadick J.Z. Kim F.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 264-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 17Paoletti A.C. Kim T.J. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Zhu D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18928-18933Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Our results presented here show that knockdown of Med28 induces expression of several SMC markers including SM-MHC, and overexpression of MED28 represses SMC gene expression. More importantly, multipotent myoblast cells can transdifferentiate into smooth muscle cells when Med28 is down-regulated. Furthermore, Med28 knockdown results in down-regulation of at least three other subunits in the head module as well as Cdk8, a subunit in the kinase module. A significant decrease in Med6 and Med8 in Med28 knockdown cells is suggestive of a possible physical interaction between these subunits. A similar phenomenon has been reported previously in cell extracts deficient for Drosophila Trap80, where two other subunits, dMed6 and Trfp, were down-regulated, suggesting a physical association between these subunits (18Gu J.Y. Kim J.M. Song E.J. Mizuguchi G. Yoon J.H. Kim-Ha J. Lee K.J. Kim Y.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27154-27161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our results for the first time demonstrate that a submodule within the mammalian Mediator complex could function in a highly specific manner to repress smooth muscle differentiation. Our data also suggest that MED28 may function as a scaffolding protein by maintaining the stability of this submodule, and the dosage of MED28 may be critical for this submodule to effectively repress smooth muscle differentiation. Mediator complex is believed to be required for transcription of genes involving the RNA polymerase II machinery. However, the presence of specific subunits appears to determine the regulation of distinct expression programs via interactions with relevant gene-specific transcriptional activators. The possibility of subunit composition of the Mediator complex as a determinant for tissue specificity of gene expression has also been raised (9Malik S. Kim R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Wang S. Kim K. Roeder R.G. Hankinson O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13593-13600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Many Mediator subunits play a crucial role in the activation of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis through interactions with transcriptional activators, RNA polymerase II, general transcription factors, and other cofactors. However, Mediator complex also has the ability to function in transcriptional repression when associated with kinase module subunits such as MED12, MED12L, MED13, MED13L, CDK8-CycC, and CDK8L (9Malik S. Kim R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 10Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 235-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The association of different kinase modules with Mediator is thought to regulate a distinct subset of genes (7Sato S. Kim C. Parmely T.J. Florens L. Zybailov B. Swanson S.K. Banks C.A. Jin J. Cai Y. Washburn M.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 685-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 20Naar A.M. Kim D.J. Zhai W. Nogales E. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1339-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A very recent report that quantitated the abundance of subunits in human Mediator showed that Mediator preparations purified through FLAG-tagged MED28 contained substantially higher levels of kinase module components and significantly less RNA polymerase II (17Paoletti A.C. Kim T.J. Tomomori-Sato C. Sato S. Zhu D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18928-18933Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Our data, demonstrating for the first time that MED28 functions as a repressor of SMC differentiation, are in concordance with this report and support the idea that the presence of the kinase module could play a role in this negative regulation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that MED28 can switch between an active and a repressive form dictated by conformational or cellular specificity as shown in the case of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (C/EBPβ), a transcription factor, which differentially binds to transcriptionally active or inactive Mediator complexes as determined by a Ras-induced structural alteration (21Mo X. Kim E. Xu H. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 241-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). An additional possibility that cannot be ruled out is that MED28 may in fact function in an activator pathway, promoting the expression of an SMC repressor and thus indirectly acting as a repressor of SMC genes. SMCs are very heterogeneous and arise throughout development from multiple types of progenitors. They are highly plastic and can readily switch between proliferative and differentiated states in response to extracellular cues. Abnormalities in SMC growth and differentiation are implicated in a variety of disorders such as atherosclerosis, vascular restenosis following angioplasty, hypertension, and smooth muscle tumors (22Owens G.K. Kim M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle contractile genes are activated by serum-response factor, a transcription factor that binds CArG box elements within SMC gene promoters and recruits myocardin and/or myocardin-related transcription factors to stimulate transcription of SMC contractile genes (23Wang D.Z. Kim E.N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Myocardin-related transcription factors are localized in the cytoplasm and translocate to the nucleus in response to Rho/actin signaling (24Parmacek M.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 633-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The presence of MED28 in the actin-cytoskeleton and in the nucleus raises the question whether nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation of MED28 could also play a role in controlling its function in SMC repression. In addition to activation, coordinated repression of SMC genes is necessary for the phenotypic switching of SMCs, and recent studies have implicated several repressor pathways (25Kawai-Kowase K. Kim G.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C59-C69Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor-BB is a potent inhibitor of SMC differentiation, and among several transcription factors, Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and phosphorylated Elk1 play a crucial role in platelet-derived growth factor-mediated SMC suppression (25Kawai-Kowase K.

Another recent study has identified PRISM (for PR domain in smooth muscle), a novel zinc finger protein, as a transcriptional repressor of smooth muscle cells (27Davis C.A. Kim M.

Our results presented here add MED28 and associated Mediator subunits to the growing list of SMC repressors and raises the question whether MED28 can either suppress the expression of myocardin family members and/or interfere with serum-response factor binding to CArG elements.

Exosite binding drives substrate affinity and is independent of the bond being cleaved. The pathway for cleavage is determined by large differences in Vmax for cleavage at the two sites within intact prothrombin. By fluorescence binding studies in the absence of catalysis, we have assessed the ability of the individual cleavage sites to engage the active site of Xa within prothrombinase at equilibrium. Using a panel of recombinant cleavage site mutants, we show that in intact prothrombin, the Arg320 site effectively engages the active site in a 1:1 interaction between substrate and enzyme. In contrast, the Arg271 site binds to the active site poorly in an interaction that is ∼600-fold weaker. Perceived substrate affinity is independent of active site engagement by either cleavage site. We further show that prior cleavage at the 320 site or the stabilization of the uncleaved zymogen in a proteinase-like state facilitates efficient docking of Arg271 at the active site of prothrombinase. Therefore, we establish direct relationships between docking of either cleavage site at the active site of the catalyst, the Vmax for cleavage at that site, substrate conformation, and the resulting pathway for prothrombin cleavage. Exosite tethering of the substrate in either the zymogen or proteinase conformation dictates which cleavage site can engage the active site of the catalyst and enforces the sequential cleavage of prothrombin by prothrombinase.

Exosite tethering of the substrate in either the zymogen or proteinase conformation dictates which cleavage site can engage the active site of the catalyst and enforces the sequential cleavage of prothrombin by prothrombinase. Thrombin, the key effector product of the coagulation cascade, is produced by specific proteolysis of the zymogen precursor, prothrombin (1Jackson C.M. Nemerson Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 765-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The physiologically relevant catalyst for this reaction is considered to be prothrombinase, a complex that assembles through reversible interactions between the serine proteinase, factor Xa, and the cofactor protein, factor Va on membranes containing acidic phospholipids (2Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 3Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fundamental role of this reaction system in normal hemostasis is evident from profound bleeding associated with deleterious mutations in any one of its components (4Camire R.M. Pollack E.S.

Prothrombinase acts specifically on prothrombin and is not known to catalyze cleavage of other coagulation zymogens at an appreciable rate. A series of studies have established a predominant role for interactions between extended surfaces on prothrombinase (exosites) and its protein substrate, independent of the active site of the catalyst, in determining function (6Krishnaswamy S. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Exosite binding drives substrate affinity and confers specificity by restricting the action of factor Xa within prothrombinase to protein substrate species that can engage the enzyme complex in this way (6Krishnaswamy S. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2005; 3: 54-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Docking of residues flanking the cleavage site in the substrate to the active site of factor Xa within prothrombinase occurs in a second, intramolecular binding step that contributes little to substrate affinity but has instead been proposed to affect the Vmax for bond cleavage (7Orcutt S.J. Pietropaolo C. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46191-46196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thrombin formation requires proteolytic cleavage of prothrombin following Arg271 and Arg320 (Scheme I, reaction 1). 2Residue numbers in prothrombin represent those obtained by consecutive numbering of the 579 residues in the mature protein. When catalyzed by prothrombinase, the reaction occurs through two sequential enzyme-catalyzed reactions that proceeds largely via initial cleavage of prothrombin at Arg320 followed by subsequent cleavage at Arg271 (8Krishnaswamy S.

Although recent studies indicate that some intermediate produced via the alternate pathway can be detected (11Kim P.Y. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 10.1074/jbc.M701781200Google Scholar), it is clear that both cleavage sites in prothrombin are accessible to externally added proteinase, yet prothrombinase preferentially recognizes and cleaves Arg320 in the intact zymogen (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mechanisms that enforce enzymic specificity and restrict the action of prothrombinase to prothrombin must impact the ability of the enzyme to discriminate between the two bonds within the substrate itself. Studies with a series of activation site mutants as well as the two possible intermediates of prothrombin activation have only recently provided a potential quantitative explanation for the long standing problem of the essentially ordered action of prothrombinase on prothrombin (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In otherwise intact prothrombin, Arg320 is cleaved with a ∼30-fold greater Vmax than Arg271 and prior cleavage at Arg320 to produce mIIa corrects the Vmax for subsequent cleavage at Arg271 (Scheme I, reactions 2–4). Whereas this provides a kinetic explanation for the largely ordered cleavage of prothrombin, its molecular basis has been shown to likely relate to the conformational transition associated with the conversion of the zymogen to proteinase that accompanies cleavage at Arg320 (13Bianchini E.P. Orcutt S.J. Panizzi P. Bock P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10099-10104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All possible substrate species regardless of the availability of a cleavage site bind with equivalent affinity and in a mutually exclusive manner to prothrombinase (Scheme I) (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This is in line with the conclusion that all substrate species bind to the enzyme in a comparable way through exosite interactions that are independent of the cleavage site or the active site of the enzyme (14Boskovic D.S. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38561-38570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It follows that the observed differences in Vmax must arise from differences in the ability of the two sites to engage the active site of the catalyst that is somehow influenced by whether the substrate is a zymogen or a proteinase (15Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The unexpected and untested relationship between substrate binding at the active site and the perceived rate constant for catalysis is a key feature of the current model proposed for the ordered action of prothrombinase on prothrombin. The Circe Effect provides a formal consideration of the strategies by which enzymes may utilize the intrinsic binding energy of the substrate to affect the rate constant for catalysis (16Jencks W.P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 219-410PubMed Google Scholar). However, this relationship is typically inferred through negative findings and has proved difficult to establish experimentally with an unambiguous mechanistic basis (16Jencks W.P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1975; 43: 219-410PubMed Google Scholar, 17Jencks W.P. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 145-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Furthermore, kinetic approaches, such as those that have been used to frame our ideas, are notorious for yielding interpretations that can be greatly affected by the model and assumptions chosen for analysis. We now directly examine the previously proposed relationship between binding and catalysis. Our approach employs equilibrium binding measurements in the absence of catalysis to provide a model-independent assessment of the ability of the individual cleavage site prothrombin derivatives to dock at the active site of factor Xa within prothrombinase.

Factors Va and Xa were produced by preparative activation of factor V by thrombin or factor X by RVVXCP followed by re-purification and quality control as previously detailed (7Orcutt S.J.

Recombinant wild type human prothrombin (IIWT), prothrombin containing Gln in place of Arg at position 320 (IIQ320), prothrombin containing Gln in place of Arg at position 271 (IIQ271), and prothrombin containing Gln in place of Arg at both positions 271 and 320 (IIQQ) (Scheme I) were expressed in HEK293 cells on a large scale, purified, and characterized as described (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recombinant factor X containing Ala in place of Ser at position 195 4Residue 195 in factor Xa is identified based on chymotrypsinogen numbering of the catalytic domain sequence (43Padmanabhan K. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Park C.H. Bode W. Huber R. Blankenship D.T. Cardin A.D. Kisiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 947-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of the cDNA encoding wild type factor X, expressed in HEK293 cells, and purified as described for other recombinant factor X mutants (22Camire R.M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14322-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This factor X derivative was activated with RVVXCP and the resulting XaS195A was purified by affinity chromatography using soybean trypsin inhibitor Sepharose (Sigma) (24Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing and quantitative chemical analysis of 4-carboxyglutamic acid content established that XaS195A and all recombinant derivatives of prothrombin possessed a correctly processed N terminus with 4-carboxyglutamic acid content that was indistinguishable from that of their counterparts purified from plasma. IIQ320 was converted to mIIa and catalytically inactivated by preparative cleavage using ecarin in the presence of FPR-CH2Cl followed by purification as described (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). IIQ320 was conformationally activated using Met-SC1–325-His6 and stabilized in a proteinase-like state by covalent inactivation with FPR-CH2Cl followed by dissociation of Met-SC1–325-His6 and purification of the conformationally stabilized FPR-IIQ320 adduct as described (13Bianchini E.P.

All prothrombin derivatives and XaS195A were exchanged into Assay Buffer by centrifugal gel-filtration before use. Protein concentrations were determined by using the following molecular weights and extinction coefficients (E280, mg-1 cm2): Xa and XaS195A, 45,300, 1.16 (25Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5253-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); Va, 173,000, 1.78 (26Toso R. Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21643-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); all recombinant II variants and mIIa, 72,000, 1.47 (27Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Steady State Fluorescence Measurements—All fluorescence measurements were performed using a PTI QuantaMaster fluorescence spectrophotometer (Photon Technology International) using 0.5 × 0.5-cm quartz cells maintained at 25 °C. Samples (0.5 ml) were mixed manually with a polystyrene paddle following additions to the cuvette and before each measurement. Ratiometric emission spectra were collected by scanning the emission monochromator between 350 and 450 nm using λEX = 320 nm with long pass filters (LP 345, CVI Laser) in the emission beam. Equivalence between multiple emission scans was used to rule out trivial effects due to photobleaching during the measurement period. The spectra presented are averages of three emission scans. Ratiometric measurements of fluorescence intensity following incremental additions of titrant were conducted using λEX = 320 nm and λEM = 374 nm with a long pass filter (LP 345, CVI Laser) in the emission beam. Intensities were obtained from the average signal calculated by integration for 30 s. Binding of pAB to Xa and Prothrombinase—Fluorescence titrations were conducted using four reaction mixtures (0.5 ml each): A, buffer alone; B, 1 μm Xa; C, 1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS; and D, 1 μm Xa, 1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS. Equal microliter additions were made to each sample using a repeating microsyringe (Hamilton) to achieve the indicated concentration of pAB and fluorescence intensity was recorded. All intensities were corrected for dilution (maximum of 7.5%) and the signals from A and C were used to calculate correction factors for the inner filter effect (28Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient for pAB at the exciting wavelength (6320 m-1 cm-1) and the fitted effective pathlength were applied to all four sets of measurements to derive the corrected fluorescence signal (FAcorr, FBcorrr, FCcorr, and FDcorr). The signal arising from the interaction between Xa and pAB was obtained from FBcorr - FAcorr and that for the interaction between prothrombinase and pAB was obtained from FDcorr - FCcorr. Each value was then divided by the corrected fluorescence signal from 1 μm pAB to aid the direct comparison of fluorescence intensity observed with different enzyme species. Equivalent experiments were performed with XaS195A. Displacement of pAB from Prothrombinase by Prothrombin Variants—Three reaction mixtures (0.5 ml each) were used for these measurements: A (no probe), 1 μm XaS195A, 1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS, and 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl; B (no enzyme), 1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS, 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl, and 25 μm pAB; C (experimental), 1 μm XaS195A, 1.2 μm Va, 200 μm PCPS, 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl, and 25 μm pAB. Emission spectra were collected before and after the addition of the indicated concentrations of the prothrombin variant. For titrations, steady state intensity was measured 5 and 10 min after incremental additions of the indicated prothrombin variant. All emission spectra were corrected for dilution (maximum 6%) and spectra from samples B and C were corrected for scatter using reaction A. The resulting spectra from B and C were normalized by setting the peak of spectrum B (free probe) to 1. In intensity titrations, fluorescence intensity was corrected for scatter and expressed in terms of the fluorescence of free pAB using, FOBS/FP,Free=(FC−FA)/(FB−FA)where the subscripted terms for F indicate the fluorescence intensities measured for reactions A, B, and C. To accommodate minor variations in FOBS/FP,Free from systematic error in experiments conducted over several months, all titration curves were normalized to a reference data set with FOBS/FP,Free = 1.371 in the absence of added prothrombin. Control experiments documented that the inclusion of 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl was without affect on the binding of pAB to XaS195A but was sufficient to abrogate any detectable cleavage of the prothrombin variants by trace contaminating active proteinase over the extended period of the experiment. Titrations were discontinued if the scattering signal was unexpectedly high or if the samples turned visibly turbid. Problems associated with turbidity and high scattering were minimized by the use of PCPS within 2 days of preparation. Kinetic Studies of IIQ271 Cleavage—Initial velocity studies of IIQ271 cleavage were conducted as previously detailed (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures in assay buffer and maintained at 25 °C, containing 0.3 μm IIQ271, 27.5 μm PCPSLUV, 31 nm Va, and increasing concentrations of either IIQQ or IIQ320 were initiated with 0.02 nm Xa. Samples were quenched at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 3 min and product formation was assessed discontinuously as described (15Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), to yield the initial, steady state rate of IIQ271 cleavage. Data Analysis—Representative results from two or more experiments, typically done with different protein preparations, are presented throughout. Data were fitted by the indicated equations using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (30Bevington P.R. Robinson K.D. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences, 2nd Ed. 1992; (pp. , McGraw-Hill, New York): 161-166Google Scholar). Fitted constants are presented ±95% confidence limits. Analysis according to Scheme II was performed by combining the numerical solution of multiple equilibria with non-linear error minimization using Dynafit (31Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar), obtained as a generous gift from Petr Kuzmic (BioKin, Pullman, WA). In this case, errors in the parameters reflect linear approximations of 95% confidence limits. In all experiments with prothrombinase, the concentrations of Va and PCPS were chosen to saturably incorporate all Xa (or XaS195A) into prothrombinase based on measured equilibrium constants and stoichiometries (32Buddai S.K. Toulokhonova L. Bergum P.W. Vlasuk G.P. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26689-26698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, the concentration of prothrombinase was considered equal to the limiting concentration of factor Xa. The rationale for using PCPSLUV in activity measurements at subnanomolar concentrations of enzyme has been described (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This approach permits the use of saturating concentrations of phospholipid yet minimizes kinetic complexity associated with non-productive binding of substrate to vesicles lacking enzyme (12Orcutt S.J. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54927-54936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Fluorescence titrations to assess pAB binding assumed a stoichiometry of 1 mol of pAB bound per mol of enzyme at saturation. Analysis as previously described (29Betz A. Vlasuk G.P. Bergum P.W. Krishnaswamy S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) yielded fitted values for Kd and the maximal fluorescence change at saturation (ΔFMAX/FFree), which reflects the -fold increase in fluorescence that accompanies the binding of pAB to enzyme. Analysis according to Scheme II assumed KE,S = Km (or Ki), with KE,S fixed at 260 nm, which represents an average of the affinity terms listed in Scheme I. KE,P was fixed at the measured value of 50 μm, 1 mol of P was assumed to be bound per mol of E at saturation and α was assumed to be equal to 1 based on previous kinetic studies (15Krishnaswamy S. Betz A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12080-12086Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, the fluorescence yields of P bound to either E or ES were assumed to be equal. Fitting according to Scheme II with these constraints provided estimates for Ks* and the fluorescence signals for free and enzyme-bound P normalized on a molar basis. Division of these two fluorescence yields along with the propagation of the individual errors provided a fitted value for ΔFMAX/FFree equivalent to the term derived from the pAB binding studies. In titrations with a saturable decrease in normalized fluorescence to 1, uncertainty in the stoichiometry for the binding of S to E was accommodated by also fitting the concentration of E. This approach is valid because the fixed concentration of E was substantially greater than KE,S. The stoichiometry determined in this way was fixed in titrations that produced only a small change in fluorescence. Although Ks* was robustly determined within these constraints, the fitted value of Ks* was found to be highly correlated with the assumption that EP and EPS exhibit identical fluorescence properties. For this reason, we have deliberately qualified fitted values of Ks* as upper or lower limit estimates without ascribing significance to fitted confidence limits in this parameter. Experimental Strategy—We pursued studies with XaS195A and pAB to develop a strategy assessing the ability of the substrate to engage the active site but in the absence of catalysis. This approach is based on the extensive literature in the serine proteinase field establishing that mutation of the catalytic serine (Ser195) or its chemical conversion to dehydroalanine abolishes catalysis without impacting, in a major way, binding interactions at the active site (33Ako H. Foster R.J. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 34Vincent J.P. Peron-Renner M. Pudles J. Lazdunski M.

The use of pAB as a reversible fluorescent probe for the S1 pocket 5Nomenclature of Schechter and Berger (44Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4763) Google Scholar). of arginine-specific serine proteinases, including Xa, has been established in numerous studies (28Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because pAB and other ligands cannot simultaneously be bound at the S1 site, probe binding and dissociation, inferred from fluorescence, has been used extensively to characterize reaction pathways between inhibitors and proteinases (28Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5452-5461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of pAB to the active site of Xa in solution or to the active site of factor Xa within prothrombinase was accompanied by a large and saturable increase in probe fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1).
