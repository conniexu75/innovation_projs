https://openalex.org/W1973418567,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)–B–deficient mouse embryos were found to lack microvascular pericytes, which normally form part of the capillary wall, and they developed numerous capillary microaneurysms that ruptured at late gestation. Endothelial cells of the sprouting capillaries in the mutant mice appeared to be unable to attract PDGF-Rβ–positive pericyte progenitor cells. Pericytes may contribute to the mechanical stability of the capillary wall. Comparisons made between PDGF null mouse phenotypes suggest a general role for PDGFs in the development of myofibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2134893181,"Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease, a fatal neurovisceral disorder, is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived cholesterol. By positional cloning methods, a gene (NPC1) with insertion, deletion, and missense mutations has been identified in NP-C patients. Transfection of NP-C fibroblasts with wild-type NPC1 cDNA resulted in correction of their excessive lysosomal storage of LDL cholesterol, thereby defining the critical role of NPC1 in regulation of intracellular cholesterol trafficking. The 1278-amino acid NPC1 protein has sequence similarity to the morphogen receptor PATCHED and the putative sterol-sensing regions of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase."

Specific cleavage of laminin-5 (Ln-5) by matrix metalloprotease–2 (MMP2) was shown to induce migration of breast epithelial cells. MMP2 cleaved the Ln-5 γ2 subunit at residue 587, exposing a putative cryptic promigratory site on Ln-5 that triggers cell motility. This altered form of Ln-5 is found in tumors and in tissues undergoing remodeling, but not in quiescent tissues. Cleavage of Ln-5 by MMP2 and the resulting activation of the Ln-5 cryptic site may provide new targets for modulation of tumor cell invasion and tissue remodeling."

https://openalex.org/W2019016101,"Previous studies of short-term plasticity in central nervous systems synapses have largely focused on average synaptic properties. In this study, we use recordings from putative single synaptic release sites in hippocampal slices to show that significant heterogeneity exists in facilitation and depletion among synapses. In particular, the amount of paired-pulse facilitation is inversely related to the initial release probability of the synapse. We also examined depletion at individual synapses using high frequency stimulation, and estimated the size of the readily releasable vesicle pool, which averaged 5.0 +/- 3.0 quanta (n = 13 synapses). In addition, these experiments demonstrate that the release probability at a synapse is directly correlated with the size of its readily releasable vesicle pool."
https://openalex.org/W1974185766,"Alagille syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by intrahepatic cholestasis and abnormalities of heart, eye and vertebrae, as well as a characteristic facial appearance. Identification of rare AGS patients with cytogenetic deletions has allowed mapping of the gene of 20p12. We have generated a cloned contig of the critical region and used fluorescent in situ hybridization on cells from patients with submicroscopic deletions to narrow the candidate region to only 250 kb. Within this region we identified JAG1, the human homologue of rat Jagged1, which encodes a ligand for the Notch receptor. Cell-cell Jagged/Notch interactions are known to be critical for determination of cell fates in early development, making this an attractive candidate gene for a developmental disorder in humans. Determining the complete exon-intron structure of JAG1 allowed detailed mutational analysis of DNA samples from non-deletion AGS patients, revealing three frame-shift mutations, two splice donor mutations and one mutation abolishing RNA expression from the altered allele. We conclude that AGS is caused by haploinsufficiency of JAG1."

https://openalex.org/W2168016965,"An integrated human-mouse positional candidate approach was used to identify the gene responsible for the phenotypes observed in a mouse model of Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C) disease. The predicted murine NPC1 protein has sequence homology to the putative transmembrane domains of the Hedgehog signaling molecule Patched, to the cholesterol-sensing regions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), and to the NPC1 orthologs identified in human, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The mouse model may provide an important resource for studying the role of NPC1 in cholesterol homeostasis and neurodegeneration and for assessing the efficacy of new drugs for NP-C disease."
https://openalex.org/W2054290966,"Dysregulation of oncogenes by translocation to the IgH locus (14q32) is a seminal event in the pathogenesis of B-cell tumours. In multiple myeloma (MM), translocations to the IgH locus have been reported at an incidence of 20-60%. For most translocations, the partner chromosome is unknown (14q+); for the others, a diverse array of chromosomal partners have been identified, with 11q13 (cyclin D1) the only chromosome that is frequently involved. Recently, we developed a Southern-blot assay that detects translocation breakpoint fragments in most MM tumours, including those with no translocation detected by conventional karyotyping. In a continuing analysis of translocation in 21 myeloma cell lines and primary tumours, we show that the novel, karyotypically silent translocation t(4;14)(p16.3;q32.3) is present in five lines and at least three of ten primary tumours. The chromosome-4 breakpoints are clustered in a 70-kb region centromeric to the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3), the apparent dysregulated oncogene. Two lines and one primary tumour with this translocation selectively express an FGFR3 allele containing activating mutations identified previously in thanatophoric dwarfism. We propose that after the t(4;14) translocation, somatic mutation during tumour progression frequently generates in FGFR3 protein that is active in the absence of ligand."

https://openalex.org/W2066592391,"Long-term facilitation of the sensory to motor synapse in Aplysia requires gene expression. While some transcription factors involved in long-term facilitation are phosphorylated by PKA, others lack PKA sites but contain MAP Kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation sites. We now show that MAPK translocates into the nucleus of the presynaptic but not the postsynaptic cell during 5-HT-induced long-term facilitation. The presynaptic nuclear translocation of MAPK is also triggered by elevations in intracellular cAMP. Injection of anti-MAPK antibodies or of MAPK Kinase inhibitors into the presynaptic cell blocks long-term facilitation, without affecting basal synaptic transmission or short-term facilitation. Thus, MAPK appears to be specifically recruited and necessary for the long-term form of facilitation. This mechanism for long-term plasticity may be quite general: cAMP also activated MAPK in mouse hippocampal neurons, suggesting that MAPK may play a role in hippocampal long-term potentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2145936933,"Two distinct forms of long-term depression (LTD), one dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and the other dependent on the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), are shown to coexist in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells of juvenile (11–35 day-old) rats. Both forms were pathway specific and required membrane depolarization and a rise in postsynaptic Ca2+. mGluR-LTD, but not NMDAR-LTD, required the activation of T-type Ca2+ channels, group 1 mGluRs, and protein kinase C, while NMDAR-LTD, but not mGluR-LTD, required protein phosphatase activity. NMDAR-LTD was associated with a decrease in the size of quantal excitatory postsynaptic currents, whereas for mGluR-LTD there was no change in quantal size, but a large decrease in the frequency of events. NMDAR-LTD, but not mGluR-LTD, reversed NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation, and NMDAR-LTD was unaffected by prior saturation of mGluR-LTD. These findings indicate that NMDAR-LTD and mGluR-LTD are mechanistically distinct forms of synaptic plasticity."

Purified PFK-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase from bovine heart is a mixture of two isoforms (M r 58,000 and 54,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels). The M r 54,000 protein is an alternatively spliced form, lacking phosphorylation sites for protein kinases. Recombinant enzymes corresponding to theM r 58,000 (BH1) and M r54,000 (BH3) forms were expressed and used as substrates for phosphorylation. The recombinant BH1 isoform was phosphorylated by p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70s6k), mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1, and protein kinase B (PKB), whereas the recombinant BH3 isoform was a poor substrate for these protein kinases. Treatment with all protein kinases activated PFK-2 in the recombinant BH1 preparation. Phosphorylation of the recombinant BH1 isoform correlated with PFK-2 activation and was reversed by treatment with protein phosphatase 2A. All the protein kinases phosphorylated Ser-466 and Ser-483 in the BH1 isoform, but to different extents: p70s6k preferentially phosphorylated Ser-466, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 and PKB phosphorylated Ser-466 and Ser-483 to a similar extent. We propose that PKB is part of the insulin signaling cascade for PFK-2 activation in heart.

Rider M.H. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). For example, in perfused rat hearts, glycolysis and Fru-2,6-P2 concentrations were increased in parallel after stimulation by adrenalin (2Hue L. Blackmore P.F. Shikama H. Robinson-Steiner A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4308-4313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and insulin (3Rider M.H. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or by increasing the work load (4Depre C. Rider M.H. Veitch K. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13274-13279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both adrenalin and the work load increased Fru-2,6-P2 by activating 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2), the enzyme responsible for Fru-2,6-P2 synthesis. This activation resulted from phosphorylation by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or by the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, probably at the same sites (4Depre C. Rider M.H. Veitch K. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13274-13279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin treatment also activated PFK-2 both in rat heart in vivo (3Rider M.H. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and in isolated rat cardiomyocytes (5Lefebvre V. Méchin M.-C. Louckx M.P. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22289-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To clarify the mechanism of this insulin-induced activation of PFK-2, we have studied the effects of thein vitro phosphorylation of heart PFK-2 by protein kinases of the insulin signaling cascades. On hormone binding, the activation of the insulin receptor causes autophosphorylation at several tyrosine residues. This leads to the docking of the insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 and their phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues by the receptor. Adaptor proteins containing SH2 domains are recruited, which in turn can lead to the activation of at least two signaling pathways. One of these leads to the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, via the adaptor proteins Grb2/Sos and involving the activation of Ras and Raf (6Saltiel A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: E375-E385PubMed Google Scholar). As a consequence, the mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase-1 (MAPKAP kinase-1) (also called p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, RSK-2, or p90 rsk (7Lavoinne A. Erickson E. Maller J.L. Price D.L. Avruch J. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)) becomes activated. Another pathway involves activation of the lipid kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, through recruitment of its p85 regulatory subunit and the downstream activation of p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70s6k) (8Chung J. Grammer T.C. Lemon K.P. Kazlauskas A. Blenis J. Nature. 1994; 370: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Finally, a third pathway has recently been described, which also involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation (9Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar) and which results in the activation of protein kinase B (PKB) (also known as Akt/RAC (11Belacossa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 244-247Google Scholar, 12Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar)) (10Coffer P.J. Woodgett J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 210: 475-481Crossref Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Heart PFK-2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-2) differs from the other isozymes of the bifunctional enzyme (13Hue L. Rider M.H. Rousseau G.G. Pilkis S.J. Fructose 2,6-Bisphosphate. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1990: 173-192Google Scholar). The various PFK-2/FBPase-2 isozymes are homodimers and are known as the liver, skeletal muscle, heart, testis, and brain isozymes, and for most, the subunit molecular weight varies between 50,000 and 60,000. The rat gene for the heart isozyme contains 16 exons, one of which (exon 15) codes for a stretch of 64 amino acids containing phosphorylation sites for PKA and protein kinase C (14Darville M.I. Chikri M. Lebeau E. Hue L. Rousseau G.G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In bovine heart, two alternatively spliced forms have been described (15Rider M.H. Van Damme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H. Rousseau G.G. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Sakata J. Uyeda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), migrating withM r values of 58,000 and 54,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (15Rider M.H. Van Damme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H. Rousseau G.G. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Peptide sequence analysis revealed that the M r 54,000 form lacks phosphorylation sites for PKA (Ser-466 and Ser-483) and protein kinase C (Ser-466 and Thr-475), which are encoded by exon 15 and thus present in theM r 58,000 form (15Rider M.H. Van Damme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H. Rousseau G.G. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Rider M.H. Van Damme J. Vertommen D. Michel A. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 310: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The situation in bovine heart is further complicated by the fact that four different mRNAs have been characterized (18Vidal H. Crepin K.M. Rider M.H. Hue L. Rousseau G.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). One (B3) lacks exon 15 and is therefore similar to the M r 54,000 form. The other three (B1, B2, and B4) contain exon 15 and could correspond to theM r 58,000 form. They differ from each other by minor differences located in domains devoid of any regulatory or catalytic activities (18Vidal H. Crepin K.M. Rider M.H. Hue L. Rousseau G.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, in rat heart, four mRNA species have been found (19Chikri M. Rousseau G.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8876-8884Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), but information on the existence of the corresponding proteins is lacking since the heart PFK-2/FBPase-2 protein has not been purified for sequencing from this species. In this work, we have studied the effects of phosphorylation by several protein kinases on PFK-2 activity of the heart isozyme. With the native bovine heart preparations of PFK-2/FBPase-2 as substrate, the effect of phosphorylation on PFK-2 activity could be partially masked because the preparations contain about twice as much of the shortM r 54,000 form as the completeM r 58,000 form (15Rider M.H. Van Damme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H. Rousseau G.G. Vandekerckhove J. Hue L. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, we mainly investigated the effects of phosphorylation on PFK-2 activity of the recombinant BH1 and BH3 forms. The former is a complete isoform and corresponds to the M r 58,000 form, whereas the latter lacks the sequence encoded by exon 15 and thus corresponds to the short M r 54,000 form. The protein kinases tested were p70s6k, MAPKAP kinase-1, and PKB. The effects of phosphorylation on PFK-2 activity were compared with those induced by PKA. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Corp. Activated MAPKAP kinase-1 (350 units/ml), from rabbit skeletal muscle (20Sutherland C. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Eur J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and activated p70s6k (14 units/ml), from the livers of cycloheximide-treated rats (21Leighton I.A. Dalby K.N. Caudwell F.B. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), were purified as described. Activated PKBα (0.64 units/ml) was purified from insulin-like growth factor-1-stimulated 293 cells overexpressing the protein (22Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P. Reece C. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutathione was removed from the PKB preparation by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7, 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% (w/v) Brij 35. The catalytic subunits of PKA (800 units/ml) (23Reimann E.M. Beham R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A; 11,000 units/ml) (24Cohen P. Alemany S. Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J. Stralfors P. Tung H.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 390-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) were purified from bovine heart as indicated. Activated MAPK (11 units/ml) was kindly donated by Dr. J. Goris (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium). Native bovine heart PFK-2/FBPase-2 was purified from slaughterhouse tissue (15Rider M.H. Van Damme J. Lebeau E. Vertommen D. Vidal H.

Stroobant (Ludwig Institute, Brussels, Belgium). Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose gel was obtained from QIAGEN Inc. All other biochemicals were from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. The B1 and B3 PFK-2/FBPase-2 cDNAs were cloned in pBluescript II KS+phagemid (called BH1 and BH3 here) and introduced into the expression vector pET3a (18Vidal H. Crepin K.M. Rider M.H. Hue L. Rousseau G.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The C-terminally polyhistidine-tagged form of BH1, called BH1(His)6, was constructed from the single-stranded form of the phagemid containing the BH1 cDNA following the same procedure as described for the liver isozyme (26Vertommen D.

The cDNA encoding BH1(His)6 was then introduced into the expression vector pET3a as described (18Vidal H. Crepin K.M. Rider M.H. Hue L. Rousseau G.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The BH1 and BH3 isoforms of bovine heart PFK-2/FBPase-2 were expressed and purified as described (26Vertommen D. Bertrand L.

Following concentration by ultrafiltration, the preparations were dialyzed against 200 volumes of a buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm potassium phosphate, 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin and stored at −80 °C. BH1(His)6 was expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) pLysE. Culture and lysis were as described above. Purification on Ni2+/nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was carried out as described (26Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Sontag B. Di Pietro A. Louckx M. Vidal H. Hue L. Rider M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17875-17880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the preparations were stored at −80 °C. For measurement of the changes in kinetic properties induced by phosphorylation, preparations of bovine heart PFK-2/FBPase-2 were incubated with 1 mm MgATP at 30 °C in phosphorylation buffer containing 10 mm MOPS, pH 7, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 μm PKI (except where PKA was studied), and each protein kinase as indicated in the figure and table legends. After 60 min, the reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm potassium phosphate, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (stop buffer) and chilled in ice. Aliquots were taken for PFK-2 or FBPase-2 assay. For each protein kinase, phosphorylation had reached a maximum when the kinetic studies were carried out. For measurements of 32P incorporation, the bovine heart PFK-2/FBPase-2 preparations were incubated as described above with 0.1 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity of 250 cpm/pmol) and each protein kinase as indicated in the figure legends. The MAPKAP kinase-1 and PKA preparations were diluted prior to use in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% (w/v) Brij 35, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The reactions were terminated by diluting aliquots (5 μl) with 15 μl of stop buffer before boiling for 1 min with 5 μl of 5% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 65 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8 (sample buffer), for SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) on 12.5% (w/v) acrylamide minigels. To determine 32P incorporation, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried, and bands corresponding to PFK-2/FBPase-2 were counted in a Hewlett-Packard Instant Imager together with spotted dried aliquots of the diluted (1:500) stock solution of [γ-32P]MgATP used in the phosphorylation experiments. Stoichiometries of 32P incorporation (mol/mol of subunit) were calculated from the amount of protein loaded onto the gel as quantified by the ninhydrin method (see below), and the molecular weights of the PFK-2/FBPase-2 subunits which were taken as 61,520 for BH1(His)6 and 53,909 for BH3.

The mass spectrometer was a LASERMAT 2000 (Finnigan MAT Ltd., San Jose, CA), and masses were calculated from 20–30 cumulated spectra. Edman microsequencing was performed with an Applied Biosystems 477A gas-phase sequencer equipped with a phenylthiohydantoin detector. Solid-phase sequencing of peptides was carried out as described (32Stokoe D. Campbell D.G. Nakielny S. Hidaka H. Leevers S.J. Marshall C. Cohen P.

Kinetic constants were calculated by computer fitting of the data to a hyperbola describing the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear least-squares regression. The two recombinant isoforms of bovine heart PFK-2/FBPase-2, BH1 and BH3, were compared with the native enzyme purified from bovine heart myocardium. Analysis of the purified recombinant BH1 and BH3 preparations by SDS-PAGE revealed that they contained major bands of M r 58,000 and 54,000, respectively, each one corresponding to the two forms of native bovine heart PFK-2/FBPase-2 (data not shown). However, truncated forms of BH1 were also observed, which have been noted previously (35Abe Y. Minami Y. Li Y. Nguyen C. Uyeda K.

Electroblotting and N-terminal microsequencing of the intact and truncated proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gels gave the same amino acid sequence, SGNPASSSEQ, suggesting that truncation resulted from the loss of a C-terminal fragment.

Evoked EPSPs with rapid time course (half duration = 4 ms; 34 degrees C) were generated at multiple synaptic contacts established on the interneuron dendrites close to the soma. The underlying postsynaptic conductance change showed a submillisecond rise and decay, due to the precise timing of glutamate release and the rapid deactivation of the postsynaptic AMPA receptors. Simulations based on a compartmental model of the interneuron indicated that the rapid postsynaptic conductance change determines the shape and the somatodendritic integration of EPSPs, thus enabling interneurons to detect synchronous principal neuron activity."
https://openalex.org/W1966354110,"alpha-Latrotoxin is a potent stimulator of neurosecretion. Its action requires extracellular binding to high affinity presynaptic receptors. Neurexin I alpha was previously described as a high affinity alpha-latrotoxin receptor that binds the toxin only in the presence of calcium ions. Therefore, the interaction of alpha-latrotoxin with neurexin I alpha cannot explain how alpha-latrotoxin stimulates neurotransmitter release in the absence of calcium. We describe molecular cloning and functional expression of the calcium-independent receptor of alpha-latrotoxin (CIRL), which is a second high affinity alpha-latrotoxin receptor that may be the major mediator of alpha-latrotoxin's effects. CIRL appears to be a novel orphan G-protein-coupled receptor, a member of the secretin receptor family. In contrast with other known serpentine receptors, CIRL has two subunits of the 120 and 85 kDa that are the result of endogenous proteolytic cleavage of a precursor polypeptide. CIRL is found in brain where it is enriched in the striatum and cortex. Expression of CIRL in chromaffin cells increases the sensitivity of the cells to the effects of alpha-latrotoxin, demonstrating that this protein is functional in coupling to secretion. Syntaxin, a component of the fusion complex, copurifies with CIRL on an alpha-latrotoxin affinity column and forms stable complexes with this receptor in vitro. Interaction of CIRL with a specific presynaptic neurotoxin and with a component of the docking-fusion machinery suggests its role in regulation of neurosecretion."

Dihydroconiferyl alcohol, a monomer not normally associated with the lignin biosynthetic pathway, is the major component of the mutant's lignin, accounting for approximately 30 percent (versus approximately 3 percent in normal pine) of the units. The level of aldehydes, including new 2-methoxybenzaldehydes, is also increased. The mutant pines grew normally indicating that, even within a species, extensive variations in lignin composition need not disrupt the essential functions of lignin."

https://openalex.org/W2051827768,"Parallel fiber synapses onto Purkinje neurons in acute cerebellar slices undergo long-term depression (LTD) when presynaptic activity coincides with postsynaptic depolarization. These electrical inputs can be respectively replaced by nitric oxide (NO) and Ca2+ photolytically released inside the Purkinje neuron, showing that these two messengers are sufficient for LTD induction. NO acts via cGMP production because inhibitors of guanylate cyclase prevent LTD but can be circumvented by photoreleased cGMP combined with Ca2+ elevation. Three inhibitors of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, Rp-8Br-PET-cGMPS, KT5823, and a novel pseudosubstrate peptide, all block LTD. LTD induction permits <10 ms gap between NO release and Ca2+ elevation, whereas 200-300 ms is allowed between uncaged cGMP and Ca2+ increase. This surprising difference in timing precision can be explained either by tighter localization and faster decay of cGMP when generated by NO rather than uncaging, or by two independent coincidence detectors in series."
https://openalex.org/W2004429279,"The objective of the present study was to determine if a neuron that expresses multiple glutamate receptors targets the same receptors to all glutamatergic postsynaptic populations, or if the receptors are differentially targeted to specific postsynaptic populations. As a model for this study, we chose the fusiform cell of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. This neuron expresses multiple glutamate receptors and receives two distinct glutamatergic inputs: parallel fibers synapse on apical dendrites, and auditory nerve fibers synapse on basal dendrites. Pre- and postembedding immunocytochemistry were combined with retrograde tracing to identify the receptors expressed on postsynaptic membranes of parallel fiber and auditory nerve synapses. Most receptors were found at both populations of synapses, but the AMPA receptor subunit, GluR4, and the metabotropic receptor, mGluR1α, were found only at the auditory nerve synapse. These results demonstrate that glutamate receptors are targeted to specific postsynaptic populations of glutamatergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2019920766,"Phospholipase C (PLC) is the focal point for two major signal transduction pathways: one initiated by G protein-coupled receptors and the other by tyrosine kinase receptors. Active PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) into the two second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacyl glycerol (DAG). DAG activates protein kinase C, and InsP3 mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores via the InsP3 receptor. Changes in [Ca2+]i regulate the function of a wide range of target proteins, including ion channels, kinases, phosphatases, proteases, and transcription factors (Berridge, 1993). In the mouse, there are three InsP3R genes, and type 1 InsP3R mutants display ataxia and epileptic seizures (Matsumoto et al., 1996). In Drosophila, only one InsP3 receptor (InsP3R) gene is known, and it is expressed ubiquitously throughout development (Hasan and Rosbash, 1992; Yoshikawa et al., 1992; Raghu and Hasan, 1995). Here, we characterize Drosophila InsP3R mutants and demonstrate that the InsP3R is essential for embryonic and larval development. Interestingly, maternal InsP3R mRNA is sufficient for progression through the embryonic stages, but larval organs show asynchronous and defective cell divisions, and imaginal discs arrest early and fail to differentiate. We also generated adult mosaic animals and demonstrate that phototransduction, a model PLC pathway thought to require InsP3R, does not require InsP3R for signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2021749851,"Green fluorescent protein fused to human chromogranin B or neuropeptide Y was expressed in PC12 cells and caused bright, punctate fluorescence. The fluorescent points colocalized with the endogenous secretory granule marker dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Stimulation of live PC12 cells with elevated [K+], or of permeabilized PC12 cells with Ca2+, led to Ca2+-dependent loss of fluorescence from neurites. Ca2+ stimulated secretion of both fusion proteins equally well. In living cells, single fluorescent granules were imaged by evanescent-wave fluorescence microscopy. Granules were seen to migrate; to stop, as if trapped by plasmalemmal docking sites; and then to disappear abruptly, as if through exocytosis. Evidently, GFP fused to secreted peptides is a fluorescent marker for dense-core secretory granules and may be used for time-resolved microscopy of single granules."
https://openalex.org/W2116243606,"Small structural perturbations in the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) were made in order to evaluate the contribution of precise substrate alignment to the catalytic power of an enzyme. The reaction trajectory of IDH was modified (i) after the adenine moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate was changed to hypoxanthine (the 6-amino was changed to 6-hydroxyl), and (ii) by replacing Mg2+, which has six coordinating ligands, with Ca2+, which has eight coordinating ligands. Both changes make large (10(-3) to 10(-5)) changes in the reaction velocity but only small changes in the orientation of the substrates (both distance and angle) as revealed by cryocrystallographic trapping of active IDH complexes. The results provide evidence that orbital overlap produced by optimal orientation of reacting orbitals plays a major quantitative role in the catalytic power of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2056967947,"The nucleotide sequence for a putative chemokine receptor, termed TER1, ChemR1, or CKR-L1, was recently obtained by a polymerase chain reaction-based cloning technique. It encodes a protein of 355 amino acids that shows 32–45% sequence identity with human chemokine receptors. The gene was localized on human chromosome 3p21–24, the site for the genes for the five known CC chemokine receptors, suggesting that the natural ligand may be a CC chemokine. We have stably expressed this receptor in murine pre-B cells 300-19 and have tested their responsiveness to 20 human chemokines and some other potential agonists. The CC chemokine I-309 was the only agonist that selectively induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization and chemotaxis in receptor-transfected 300-19 cells. Stromal cell-derived factor 1, which binds to murine CXCR4 expressed in parental as well as transfected 300-19 cells, served as positive control in the functional screening. The interaction of I-309 with TER1 was of high affinity as shown by125I-I-309 binding (K d of 1.2 nm) and transient [Ca2+] i changes at subnanomolar concentrations of agonist. Migration responses in receptor-transfected 300-19 cells was typically bimodal with maximal activity at 10 nm of I-309. These data demonstrate that TER1 (ChemR1 or CKR-L1) is the receptor for I-309, and we propose to call this receptor CCR8 in agreement with the current nomenclature for chemokine receptors. The expression of CCR8 in blood leukocytes and lymphocytes was analyzed by Northern blot. No transcripts were found in RNA from freshly isolated blood neutrophils, monocytes, cultured macrophages, and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T lymphocytes, and a faint hybridization signal corresponding to the RNA species of 4 kb was obtained only with RNA from interleukin-2-treated T lymphocytes. CCR8 is unusual for its selectivity for a single chemokine, previously shown only for CXCR1 and CXCR4, which bind interleukin-8 and stromal cell-derived factor 1, respectively.

Chemokines are produced locally at sites of inflammation and infection and regulate the recruitment of leukocytes and lymphocytes (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv.

All chemokines contain four conserved cysteines linked by disulfide bonds, and two subfamilies, CXC and CC chemokines, are defined on the basis of the first two cysteines, which are separated by one amino acid or are adjacent. Generally, chemokines act on more than one type of leukocyte and in vitro responses include chemotaxis, enzyme release from intracellular stores, oxygen radical formation, shape change through cytoskeletal rearrangement, generation of lipid mediators, and induction of adhesion to endothelium or extracellular matrix proteins (1Baggiolini M.

Similar to chemokines, the nine human chemokine receptors are divided into two subfamilies, the CXC chemokine receptors (CXCR) and the CC chemokine receptors (CCR), based on their selectivity for either CXC or CC chemokines. Ligand cross-selectivity, i.e. CXCRs that bind CC chemokines orvice versa, is not observed. Chemokine receptors consist of 350–368 amino acids and sequence identity among members of the two receptor subfamilies are 36–77 and 46–74%, respectively. Most chemokine receptors recognize more than one chemokine and many chemokines, including IL-8, 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Mig, monokine induced by interferon-gamma; IP10, interferon-gamma inducible 10 kDa protein; NAP-2, neutrophil-activating protein-2; ENA78, epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78; GROα, growth-related peptide alpha; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2; SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor 1; PF4, platelet factor 4; TCA3, T cell activation protein 3; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; TARC, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine; HCC-1, hemofiltrate-derived CC chemokine 1; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte(s); AM, acetoxymethylester; PHA, phytohemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: IL, interleukin; Mig, monokine induced by interferon-gamma; IP10, interferon-gamma inducible 10 kDa protein; NAP-2, neutrophil-activating protein-2; ENA78, epithelial-derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78; GROα, growth-related peptide alpha; GCP-2, granulocyte chemotactic protein-2; SDF-1, stromal cell-derived factor 1; PF4, platelet factor 4; TCA3, T cell activation protein 3; RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted; TARC, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine; HCC-1, hemofiltrate-derived CC chemokine 1; MCP, monocyte chemotactic protein; MIP, macrophage inflammatory protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PBL, peripheral blood lymphocyte(s); AM, acetoxymethylester; PHA, phytohemagglutinin. RANTES, MIP-1α and the MCPs, bind to more than one receptor. Several reports have described cDNAs for so-called orphan chemokine receptors for which no ligand has been identified. Burkitt's lymphoma-derived receptor 1 and monocyte-derived receptor 15 are amino-terminal splicing variants of a gene expressed in monocytes, lymphocytes, and tissue cells (6Dobner T. Wolf I. Emrich T. Lipp M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2795-2799Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Barella L. Loetscher M. Tobler A. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 773-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The Epstein-Barr virus-infected Burkitt's lymphoma receptor EBI1 shows 40% sequence identity with the IL-8 receptors and is expressed exclusively in B and T cell lines (8Birkenbach M. Josefsen K. Yalamanchili R. Lenoir G. Kieff E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The chemokine β receptor-like protein CMKBRL1 (9Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 673-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), also known as V28 (10Raport C.J. Schweickart V.L. Chantry D. Eddy Jr., R.L. Shows T.B. Godiska R. Gray P.W. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), shows higher similarity to known CCRs than CXCRs. The most recent orphan receptor, referred to as TER1 (11Napolitano M. Zingoni A. Bernardini G. Spinetti G. Nista A. Storlazzi C.T. Rocchi M. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2759-2763PubMed Google Scholar), ChemR1 (12Samson M. Stordeur P. Labbé O. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 3021-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), or CKR-L1 (13Zaballos A. Varona R. Gutiérrez J. Lind P. Márquez G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 846-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), shares 32–45% sequence identity with chemokine receptors. Its gene is co-localized with the genes for all five known CC chemokine receptors on human chromosome 3 band p21–24 (14Samson M. Soularue P. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Genomics. 1996; 36: 522-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that TER1 (ChemR1 or CKR-L1) is the receptor for the CC chemokine I-309. In stably transfected mouse pre-B cells this receptor mediated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization andin vitro migration in response to I-309, whereas no other of 20 human chemokines tested was active. In accordance with the new nomenclature rules for chemokine receptors, we have named the I-309 receptor CCR8. The CXC chemokines Mig, IP10, IL-8, GROα, NAP-2, GCP-2, ENA78, SDF-1, PF4, the CC chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, I-309, HCC-1, TARC, and the neuropeptide NPY were chemically synthesized according to established protocols (15Clark-Lewis I. Moser B. Walz A. Baggiolini M. Scott G.J. Aebersold R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3128-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Somatostatin, substance P, and calcitonin were purchased from Sigma. C5a and C3a were a gift of Dr. C. A. Dahinden (Clinical Immunology, University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland). CCR8 DNA was generated by PCR with primers TER1SE and TER1AS corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of TER1 (11Napolitano M. Zingoni A. Bernardini G. Spinetti G. Nista A. Storlazzi C.T. Rocchi M. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2759-2763PubMed Google Scholar) and cDNA from IL-2-stimulated PBL as amplification template (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The primers TER1SE, 5′-TTATGTGTCTCTGTGACCAG, and TER1AS, 5′-TAGTCTTCATTGATCCTCAC, correspond to positions 327–346 and 1425–1444 in the published sequence and span the entire coding region for TER1 of 355 amino acids. PCR amplifications were performed in total volumes of 30 μl, containing 1 × PCR buffer including 1.5 mmMgCl2 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 μl of cDNA preparation, 0.4 μm primers, and 400 μmdNTPs. To start DNA synthesis 1.2 units of Taq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added after cDNA denaturation and allowed to progress for 30 cycles (1 min at 50 °C, 45 s at 72 °C, and 15 s at 95 °C) in a master cycler 5330 (Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz, Inc.). The 1118-base pair DNA fragments were cloned in Gene Scribe-Z vector pTZ18R (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), sequenced, and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector SRαpuro (provided by Dr. F. Arenzana-Seisdedos, Pasteur Institut, Paris, France). To generate stable transfectants, 5 × 106mouse pre-B cells 300-19 in 400 μl of electroporation buffer were transfected with 20 μg of linearized SRαpuro-CCR8 plasmid DNA as described (17Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Puromycin-resistant 300-19 clones were established by limited dilution culturing in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and screened for CCR8 expression by RNA Dot-blot analysis. 10-μg samples of total RNA were examined from freshly isolated human blood monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, cultured macrophages, and activated T cells by Northern blot analysis as described (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 18Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) using a 32P-labeled CCR8 DNA insert (109 cpm/μg DNA) corresponding to the 620-base pair fragment defined by positions 327 and 946 in the published sequence (11Napolitano M. Zingoni A. Bernardini G. Spinetti G. Nista A. Storlazzi C.T. Rocchi M. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2759-2763PubMed Google Scholar) as hybridization probe. As internal control, a 2-μg sample of total RNA from CCR8-transfected 300-19 cells was included. Synthetic I-309 was iodinated with Bolton and Hunter reagent (Amersham Corp.) as instructed by the supplier. Briefly, 0.4 nmol of peptide ligand in 25 μl of 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.5, were added to 1 mCi of 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter reagent and incubated on ice for 25 min. To stop the labeling reaction, 200 μl of 0.2 m glycine, pH 8.5, were added, and the mixture was kept on ice for a further 5 min. Iodinated peptide was separated from 125I-labeled Bolton and Hunter reagent by gel filtration chromatography (Bio-Gel P-6 DG, Bio-Rad). Binding of 125I-I-309 to CCR8 transfected 300-19 cells and analysis of bound radioligand were performed as described (17Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Bindability of three independently labeled 125I-I-309 preparations was 12–18%. Changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ) were measured in cells loaded with fura-2/AM by incubation for 25 min at 37 °C with 0.1 nmol of fura-2/AM per 106 cells in a buffer containing 136 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 5 mm glucose, and 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4. After centrifugation, loaded cells were resuspended in the same buffer (3 × 106 cells/ml) and stimulated with the indicated chemokine at 37 °C, and the [Ca2+] i -related fluorescence changes were recorded (19von Tscharner V. Prod'hom B. Baggiolini M. Reuter H. Nature. 1986; 324: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In vitro migration of CCR8-transfected and parental 300-19 cells was assessed in 48-well chambers (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD) using collagen IV-precoated polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate membranes (Nucleopore) with 5-μm pores (18Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1% pasteurized plasma protein solution (Swiss Red Cross Laboratory, Bern, Switzerland) was used to dissolve the chemokines (lower wells) and to dilute the cells (105 of 300-19-CCR8 cells/upper well). Following incubation for 120 min at 37 °C under CO2-buffered conditions, the membrane was removed, and the adherent cells were fixed, stained, and quantified in five randomly selected fields at 1,000-fold magnification in triplicate wells. The orphan receptor TER1 shares 39–45% identical amino acids with CC chemokine receptors and only 32–34% with CXC chemokine receptors. The highest similarity of 45% is found with CCR4 (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar, 4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Many structural features that distinguish chemokine receptors from other G-protein-coupled serpentine receptors are found in TER1, notably the extended DRY motif in the second intracellular loop (DRYLA(V/I)VHA(T/V)), H(S/C)CXNPXXYXF in the seventh transmembrane domain, and YLLNLA(L/I)SDL in transmembrane domain 2, which is more conserved in CC chemokine receptors (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar, 4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 5Murphy P.M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For functional characterization, DNA containing the coding region for TER1 was generated by PCR and used for transfection of the mouse pre-B cell line 300-19. Cell clones with stable expression of TER1 mRNA (300-19-CCR8) were examined for responses to 20 human chemokines and other potential agonists (Table I), and changes in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+] i ) that are typical for chemokine receptor signaling were monitored. Of all proteins listed in Table I, only SDF-1 and I-309 were active in 300-19 cells expressing the receptor. I-309 induced typical transient [Ca2+] i changes in receptor-transfected but not in parental cells, demonstrating that the previous orphan receptor is selective for the CC chemokine I-309, which we have termed CCR8 in keeping with the current chemokine receptor nomenclature (Fig. 1 a). The interaction of CCR8 with I-309 is of high affinity, as judged by the rapid increases in the [Ca2+] i changes and responses to subnanomolar concentrations of agonist. The CXC chemokine SDF-1 is selective for the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and known to induce chemokine responses in cells expressing the murine homologue of CXCR4 (20Oberlin E. Amara A. Bachelerie F. Bessia C. Virelizier J.L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Schwartz O. Heard J.M. Clark-Lewis I. Legler D.F. Loetscher M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. Nature. 1996; 382: 833-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar, 21Bleul C.C. Farzan M. Choe H. Parolin C. Clark-Lewis I. Sodroski J. Springer T.A. Nature. 1996; 382: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). Thus, [Ca2+] i responses to SDF-1 in parental (not shown) and CCR8-transfected 300-19 cells that express murine CXCR4 are considered as positive control for functional integrity of these cells to chemokine stimulation. Selectivity of I-309 for CCR8 is further documented in Ca2+cross-desensitization experiments (Fig. 1 b). Stimulation of leukocytes with chemokines generally results in transient unresponsiveness to those chemokines, which bind to the same receptor (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar). Stimulation of CCR8-expressing 300-19 cells with 100 nm I-309 completely abolished a second response to I-309. By contrast, stimulation with I-309 did not prevent a second response to 100 nm of SDF-1 and vice versa responsiveness to I-309 was not affected by initial stimulation with SDF-1, indicating that SDF-1 was not interacting with CCR8.Table IProtein agonists tested for activity on CCR8-expressing 300-19 cellsCC chemokinesCXC chemokinesOther agonistsI-309IL-8C3aRANTESGROαC5aMCP-1NAP-2CalcitoninMCP-2GCP-2NPYMCP-3ENA78SomatostatinMCP-4MigSubstance PEotaxinIP10MIP-1αSDF-1MIP-1βPF4HCC-1TARCActivity of agonists at 100 nm was determined by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization on CCR8-transfected 300-19 cells. Open table in a new tab Activity of agonists at 100 nm was determined by intracellular Ca2+ mobilization on CCR8-transfected 300-19 cells. The prototypical response in vitro of chemokines in leukocytes is chemotactic migration, which is routinely measured in chemotaxis microchambers (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar, 2Schall T.J. Bacon K.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 865-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Results in Fig.2 demonstrate that CCR8 was very efficient in mediating transfected 300-19 cell migration in response to I-309, whereas, as expected, no effects were seen in parental cells. Responses to increasing concentrations of I-309 were bimodal, which is characteristic for chemokines as opposed to agonists with chemokinetic activity, and maximal migration was observed at 10 nm. 300-19 cells expressing CCR8 bound radiolabeled I-309 with high affinity (Fig. 3). Scatchard analysis of the specifically bound 125I-I-309 revealed 1.5 × 104 binding sites per cell and a binding constant (K d ) of 1.2 nm (inset in Fig. 3). Unspecifically bound material was in the range of 30–60% of total cell-associated radioactivity, which could not be reduced by alternative radioiodination protocols or changes in the binding conditions. No specific 125I-I-309 binding was observed with parental (untransfected) 300-19 cells. The cDNAs for I-309 and its murine homologue TCA3 were cloned as T cell activation-dependent gene products by subtractive hybridization (22Miller M.D. Hata S. De Waal Malefyt R. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2907-2916PubMed Google Scholar, 23Burd P.R. Freeman G.J. Wilson S.D. Berman M. DeKruyff R. Billings P.R. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3126-3131PubMed Google Scholar). I-309 and TCA3 were shown to be readily expressed in activated (concanavalin A, PHA, and phorbol myristate acetate) T cell and natural killer cell lines but not in resting T cell lines (22Miller M.D. Hata S. De Waal Malefyt R. Krangel M.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 2907-2916PubMed Google Scholar, 23Burd P.R. Freeman G.J. Wilson S.D. Berman M. DeKruyff R. Billings P.R. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3126-3131PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vicari A.P. Zlotnik A. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 71-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Transcripts for I-309/TCA3 were not detected in B lymphoid and myeloid cell lines and in many organs, suggesting that activated T cells are the primary sites of I-309/TCA3 production. Recombinant proteins were available for almost 10 years; however, reports on I-309 and TCA3 function are sparse and in part controversial. Chemotactic activity was described with monocytes and the monocytic cell line THP-1 and tissue cells including mesangial and smooth muscle cells (25Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 26Luo Y. D'Amore P.A. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2143-2148PubMed Google Scholar, 27Luo Y. Laning J. Devi S. Mak J. Schall T.J. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4616-4624PubMed Google Scholar, 28Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 742-748PubMed Google Scholar). As opposed to many CC chemokines, I-309 and TCA3 were reported to be inactive on cultured T cell and natural killer cell lines (29Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 30Loetscher P. Seitz M. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 322-327PubMed Google Scholar). Although no responses were seen with I-309 in human neutrophils (25Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), TCA3 was found to be an attractant of murine neutrophils (27Luo Y. Laning J. Devi S. Mak J. Schall T.J. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4616-4624PubMed Google Scholar, 31Devi S. Laning J. Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5376-5383PubMed Google Scholar, 32Laning J. Kawasaki H. Tanaka E. Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4625-4635PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to chemotaxis, TCA3 was reported to mediate enzyme release, oxygen metabolite production and adhesion to fibrinogen in neutrophils and macrophages, and stimulation of growth and adhesion to fibrinogen in smooth muscle and mesangial cells (26Luo Y. D'Amore P.A. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2143-2148PubMed Google Scholar,28Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 742-748PubMed Google Scholar, 31Devi S. Laning J. Luo Y. Dorf M.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 5376-5383PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, I-309 was found to prevent dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in cultured murine thymic lymphoma cells (33Van Snick J. Houssiau F. Proost P. Van Damme J. Renauld J.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2570-2576PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of CCR8 mRNA was examined by Northern blot analysis in total RNA from human blood cells. As shown in Fig. 4, none of the cells was positive for CCR8 transcripts, including freshly isolated blood neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and PBL. As positive control, 2 μg of total RNA from a CCR8-expressing 300-19 cell clone was included. The experimental conditions were such that transcripts for other chemokine receptors were readily detected, as previously reported for the IL-8 receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2) and the RANTES/MIP-1α receptors (CCR1) in neutrophils (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 17Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), CCR1 and the MCP-1 receptor (CCR2) in monocytes (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), and CXCR4 in all types of leukocytes (34Loetscher M. Geiser T. O'Reilly T. Zwahlen R. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 232-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lack of detectable CCR8 transcript expression in neutrophils and lymphocytes is in full agreement with the reported inactivity of I-309 in these cells (25Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, lack of CCR8 transcripts in monocytes is in striking contrast to the reported I-309-induced monocyte responses. This discrepancy was not due to differences in the I-309 preparations used because our synthetic I-309 was identical in sequence to the reported recombinant protein (25Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and synthetic and recombinant I-309 were equally potent as stimuli of CCR8-expressing 300-19 cells. The reported chemotactic activity on monocytes (25Miller M.D. Krangel M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2950-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) is much weaker than the activity observed in the present study on CCR8-expressing 300-19 cells, suggesting that monocytes may express a receptor with lower affinity for I-309. Except for CXCR4, which is ubiquitously expressed in circulating blood cells and blood cell precursors, freshly isolated PBL have low to undetectable levels of mRNA for any chemokine receptor and do not respond to the corresponding chemokines (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 17Moser B. Barella L. Mattei S. Schumacher C. Boulay F. Colombo M.P. Baggiolini M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 18Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). However, culturing of PBL for several days in the presence of IL-2 results in expansion of CD45RO+ T cells with strong expression of receptors, as recently demonstrated for CCR1, CCR2, and CXCR3 (16Loetscher P. Seitz M. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 18Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). By contrast, treatment of PBL with IL-2 did not affect CCR8 expression, and in addition, PHA treatment for 3 days failed to induce receptor expression (Fig. 4). Only faint hybridization signals corresponding to mRNA species of approximately 4 kilobases were occasionally observed in IL-2 cultured PBL, indicating donor to donor variation in CCR8 expression. Here, we have shown that CCR8-transfected 300-19 cells responded to I-309 with high potency and efficacy, suggesting that natural target cells for I-309 might respond equally well. The primary target cells for chemokines are leukocytes and lymphocytes that express the corresponding receptors in quantities large enough for ready detection in total RNA by Northern blot analysis (1Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2252) Google Scholar, 4Gerard C. Gerard N.P. Curr. Opin.

Similar to CXCR3, the receptor for the CXC chemokines IP10 and Mig (18Loetscher M. Gerber B. Loetscher P. Jones S.A. Piali L. Clark-Lewis I. Baggiolini M. Moser B. J. Exp.

The faint CCR8 mRNA hybridization signals, as observed in the RNA from some IL-2-treated T cell cultures, suggests that I-309 may act on a subpopulation of activated T cells. Molecular probes for CCR8 will now facilitate the identification of the natural target cells and thus help to advance our understanding of I-309 function in inflammation and disease. We thank Dr. P. Loetscher for providing RNA from monocytes and macrophages. Recombinant I-309 was a kind gift of Dr. J.-C. Renauld (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium).

https://openalex.org/W2087973535,"The synaptic growth that accompanies 5-HT-induced long-term facilitation of the sensory to motor neuron connection in Aplysia is associated with the internalization of apCAM at the surface membrane of the sensory neuron. We have now used epitope tags to examine the fate of each of the two apCAM isoforms (membrane bound and GPI-linked) and find that only the transmembrane form is internalized. This internalization can be blocked by overexpression of transmembrane constructs with a single point mutation in the two MAPK consensus sites, as well as by injection of a specific MAPK antagonist into sensory neurons. These data suggest MAPK phosphorylation at the membrane is important for the internalization of apCAMs and, thus, may represent an early regulatory step in the growth of new synaptic connections that accompanies long-term facilitation."

https://openalex.org/W2010585318,"The organizer of the amphibian gastrula provides the neurectoderm with both neuralizing and posteriorizing (transforming) signals. In zebrafish, transplantations show that a spatially distinct transformer signal emanates from tissues other than the organizer. Cells of the germring (nonaxial mesendoderm) posteriorized forebrain progenitors when grafted nearby, resulting in an ectopic hindbrain-like structure; in contrast, cells of the organizer (axial mesendoderm) caused no posterior transformation. Local application of basic fibroblast growth factor, a candidate transformer in Xenopus , caused malformation but not hindbrain transformation in the forebrain. Thus, the zebrafish gastrula may integrate spatially distinct signals from the organizer and the germring to pattern the neural axis."
https://openalex.org/W2046990960,"Adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are regulators of development in many organisms. Dictyostelium uses cAMP as an extracellular chemoattractant and as an intracellular signal for differentiation. Cells that are mutant in adenylyl cyclase do not develop. Moderate expression of the catalytic subunit of PKA in adenylyl cyclase–null cells led to near-normal development without detectable accumulation of cAMP. These results suggest that all intracellular cAMP signaling is effected through PKA and that signals other than extracellular cAMP coordinate morphogenesis in Dictyostelium."
https://openalex.org/W2038752487,"Most sensory systems encode external signals into action potentials for transmission to the central nervous system, but little is known about the cost or efficiency of this encoding. We measured the information capacity at three stages of encoding in the neurons of a spider slit-sense mechanoreceptor organ. For the receptor current under voltage clamp, the capacity was ∼1400 bits/s, but when the neuron was allowed to generate a receptor potential, nonlinear membrane processes improved the capacity to >2000 bits/s. Finally, when action potentials were produced, the capacity dropped to ∼200 bits/s, or ∼14% of the receptor current capacity. These measurements provide a quantitative estimation of the cost of encoding analog signals into action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W1976320202,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels are important in visual and olfactory transduction, and possibly in other neuronal functions. These channels have a complex permeability to Ca2+ ions that may be important in their cellular functions. They are composed of two different subunits, alpha and beta, that have been cloned and expressed, but the beta subunit alone cannot be activated by cyclic nucleotides, confounding the analysis of its characteristics. However, we found that nitric oxide can activate the homomeric expressed beta subunit, and the resulting channel possesses many properties of the L-type Ca2+ channels, including high permeability to Ca2+ ions and sensitivity to Ca2+ channel blockers. Thus, the Ca2+ permeability characteristics of native channels are mostly conferred by properties of the beta subunit, and the beta subunit alone can act as a NO-sensitive Ca2+ channel. A nearly identical conductance activated by NO is present in the membrane of rat vomeronasal neurons, indicating that homomeric beta channels exist in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2013679258,"BOB.1/OBF.1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is constitutively expressed in B cells and interacts with the Oct1 and Oct2 transcription factors. Upon activation of Jurkat T cells and primary murine thymocytes with phorbol esters and ionomycin, BOB.1/OBF.1 expression and transactivation function were induced. BOB.1/OBF.1 was phosphorylated at Ser 184 both in vivo and in vitro, and this modification was required for inducible activation. Mutation of Ser 184 also diminished transactivation function in B cells, suggesting that the activating phosphorylation that is inducible in T cells is constitutively present in B cells. Thus, BOB.1/OBF.1 is a transcriptional coactivator that is critically regulated by posttranslational modifications to mediate cell type–specific gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2043363785,"We have tested whether the orientation of axons sprouting from bipolar dorsal root ganglion neurons is influenced by diffusible cues from surrounding tissues. Surface ectoderm, dermomyotome, and notochord exert strong chemorepulsion on axons growing in collagen gels, operating at separations beyond those found in vivo and active in cocultures of chick and mouse tissues. Basal and alar plates of the neural tube are devoid of activity, as is the posterior-half-sclerotome, which repels in a contact-dependent manner. When ganglia are sandwiched between dermomyotome and notochord placed at a distance, axon growth is channeled in a bipolar trajectory. These results show that gradients of diffusible repulsion molecules flanking axon pathways can generate linear patterns of axon growth. We suggest that such “surround repulsion” may function generally, in concert with contact-dependent guidance mechanisms, to guide axons in the developing nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2004468892,"Glial cells in the brain express neurotransmitter receptors and can respond appropriately to application of exogenous neurotransmitters such as glutamate. However, activation of receptors by endogenous, synaptically released transmitter has been difficult to demonstrate directly. Using cell-pair recording in cerebellar cultures from embryonic mouse, it is shown that activation of a cerebellar granule neuron can give rise to a rapid inward current in an adjacent glial cell. This current is mediated by activation of Ca2+-permeable AMPA/kainate receptors and is largely independent of glutamate reuptake or gap junctional coupling. Furthermore, prolonged stimulation of the granule neuron at 4 Hz can give rise to long-term potentiation (LTP) of the glial synaptic current that has similar properties to LTP of granule neuron-Purkinje neuron synaptic transmission--its induction is independent of postsynaptic depolarization, postsynaptic Ca2+ influx, or glutamate receptor activation but requires presynaptic Ca2+ influx. These findings suggest a model in which cerebellar LTP is both induced and expressed presynaptically and therefore may be detected by either neuronal or glial postsynaptic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082157468,"In vertebrates, the presence of multiple heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) indicates that these factors may be regulated by distinct stress signals. HSF3 was specifically activated in unstressed proliferating cells by direct binding to the c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb). These factors formed a complex through their DNA binding domains that stimulated the nuclear entry and formation of the transcriptionally active trimer of HSF3. Because c-Myb participates in cellular proliferation, this regulatory pathway may provide a link between cellular proliferation and the stress response."

An unresolved question is whether the membranous amino acid residues considered so far are the only ones that are directly involved in translocation of cations. Recently, in H+,K+-ATPase Swarts et al. (27Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. de Boer M. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

In most P-type ATPase alignments, these residues have been proposed to reside in a cytosolic loop (L6–7), between the 6th and 7th transmembrane segment (Ref. 6Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim.

This raises the question whether, due to some special elaboration of structure or mechanism for cation transport, these residues are essential in H+,K+-ATPase only. In the present communication we report data which suggest that this is not the case, since by a combined protein-chemical and site-directed mutagenesis approach we have obtained evidence that the homologous residues in SR Ca2+-ATPase are also intimately involved in Ca2+ binding and ATPase activity. Furthermore, since in Ca2+-ATPase this region is accessible to proteolytic attack, its predicted organization as a cytoplasmic loop seems to be warranted. These results therefore emphasize the possible contribution of non-membranous regions to the control of cation binding to the ATPases.Figure 1Amino acid alignments of the M6-L6/7 region of P-type ATPases.

This mixture was preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of 5 mm NaN3, 0.05 μg/ml bafilomycin A, 0.1 mm ammonium molybdate as inhibitors of other ATPases and 0.1 μm N-aminocaproic acid, 0.1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2.8 mmβ-mercaptoethanol as antiproteases. After addition of 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 0.1 mg/ml pyruvate kinase (Boehringer Mannheim, catalog no. 109045), the reaction was started by the addition of 1 mm Na2ATP. Thapsigargin (1 μg/ml) was added after 100 s, and the rate of hydrolysis was followed for an additional 100 s. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was calculated as the difference between the slopes obtained in the presence and in the absence of thapsigargin and was corrected for a small background activity obtained with control yeast light membranes. It has previously been documented in a number of investigations that changes of electrophoretic mobility in Ca2+-containing SDS gels can be used for the detection of Ca2+-binding proteins or peptides (57Klee C.B.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1986: 65-99Google Scholar). Examples of such changes in migration rate are shown in Fig. 2, A and B, where it can be seen that calmodulin in a Ca2+-containing gel (lane 4, Fig. 2 B) migrates at a much faster rate than in a gel containing 0.1 mm EGTA (lane 4, Fig. 2 A). Intact Ca2+-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum (lanes 2) moves slightly faster in the presence of Ca2+ than in its absence (compare with the 95-kDa molecular mass marker). A more pronounced increase in migration rate is noted for fragment B (lanes 3), the C-terminal polypeptide (sequence 506–994) produced by tryptic cleavage of Ca2+-ATPase, which co-migrates with the N-terminal fragment A in the presence of EGTA but not in the presence of Ca2+. Fragment A is further cleaved to A1 (peptide 199–505) and A2 (peptide 1–198). Some increase in migration rate in the presence of Ca2+ is observed for A2 (compare with the 20-kDa molecular mass marker), whereas A1 is not affected by Ca2+ (compare with the 30-kDa molecular mass marker). The effect of Ca2+on the migration rate of Ca2+-binding proteins and some of their peptide fragments is due probably to retention of a more compact and native-like structure in the presence of SDS, resulting from the binding of Ca2+ (49Garrigos M. Deschamps S. Viel A. Lund S. Champeil P. Møller J.V. le Maire M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 61Campbell K.P. Entman M.L. Van Winckle W.B.

Chem. 1984; 259: 6248-6252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 2, C and D, we show that still shorter C-terminal Ca2+-ATPase fragments produced by proteolysis with proteinase K (p28C, p27C, and p20C) also change their mobility in Ca2+-containing gels, whereas other fragments (p29/30, p19C) are unaffected by the presence of Ca2+. As illustrated in Fig. 3, p20C starts at Gly-808, a residue which was predicted to be close to the C-terminal border of the M5/M6 transmembrane region, and extends to the C-terminal Gly-994 while p19C starts at Asp-818 (therefore in the L6–7 loop) and also ends at Gly-994. Thus a marked difference in peptide behavior in SDS gels is observed after removal of only 10 amino acids from p20C (Fig.3 B). The Ca2+-dependent change in migration rate of p20C is observed not only in the mixture of peptides obtained after limited proteolysis (lanes 3, Fig. 2,C and D), but also after isolation of p20C by electroelution from the gel and renewed electrophoresis (lanes 4), indicating that Ca2+ binding is an intrinsic property of the peptide. After electroelution p19C is still unaffected by the presence of Ca2+ in the gel (lanes 5). 45Ca2+ overlay of proteins (52Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem.

Deschamps S. Viel A. Lund S. Champeil P. Møller J.V. le Maire M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For instance this strategy has been successfully used to localize a Ca2+-binding region which does not contain an EF-hand motif in the cardiac Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (65Levitsky D.O. Nicoll D.A. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22847-22852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig.4 A we show the results of a45Ca2+ overlay experiment performed on purified p20C and p19C. In these experiments, the 20-kDa molecular mass marker, trypsin inhibitor (lane 3), also binds45Ca2+ (49Garrigos M. Deschamps S. Viel A. Lund S. Champeil P. Møller J.V. le Maire M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 52Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), providing a convenient reference in this region of the gel. It is clear that only p20C binds45Ca2+ (Fig. 4 A, lane 1), while p19C is not labeled (lane 2), although present in comparable amounts, as seen by Coomassie Blue staining of the blot (Fig. 4 B). Note that these experiments are performed after extensive washing of the membrane with a non-ionic and non-denaturing detergent, C12E8, which should help to remove SDS. In addition, 45Ca2+ overlay is performed at low Ca2+ concentration (10–15 μm) and in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, which suggests that the partially refolded binding site in p20C has retained some specificity for Ca2+ over Mg2+. The combined demonstration of a Ca2+-dependent change in migration rate and of 45Ca2+ overlay labeling is a good indication of Ca2+ binding by p20C and not by p19C. However, this does not necessarily imply that Ca2+ is bound at functionally important sites. By inspection of the 808–818 sequence we have noticed some resemblance with the Ca2+ binding site of α-lactalbumin, a binding site which in this protein is confined to a short segment (amino acid residues 82–88; cf. Fig. 1 C). In this sequence the Ca2+ binding site is formed by three carboxylic groups of aspartic acid residues and two carbonyl groups, located in a loop, and two adjoining helical regions. Preliminary attempts with molecular modeling of the Ca2+-ATPase 808–818 sequence by energy minimization according to the α-lactalbumin Ca2+ binding site suggested that the side chains of Asp-813 and Asp-818, together with the peptide carbonyl group between Asp-815 and Ile-816 could be involved in Ca2+ binding to the L6–7 loop. 2T. Menguy and J. Smith, unpublished observations. We then took advantage of the functional expression of Ca2+-ATPase in yeast (53Centeno F. Deschamps S. Lompré A.M. Anger M. Moutin M.J. Dupont Y. Palmgren M. Møller J.V. Falson P. le Maire M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) to test the activity of two cluster mutants in this region, i.e.D813A/D818A (ADA) and D813A/D815A/D818A (AAA). Note that residues Asp-813 and Asp-815 correspond to residues found to be important in the case of the H+,K+-ATPase (Fig. 1 A). After purification of a light membrane fraction from the ATPase-expressing yeasts, we verified by Western blotting and densitometric measurements that mutant and wild type ATPases had been expressed to the same extent (data not shown). To quantify ATP hydrolysis, we used a coupled system and followed the disappearance of NADH in the absence or presence of thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of SERCA ATPase. In Fig. 5 we present histograms of specific Ca2+-ATPase activity based on several experiments. It is seen that activity in the double mutant activity is reduced by more than 90 %, and activity in the triple mutant drops to a negligible level, comparable to that seen after mutation to glutamine of the essential glutamate in M4 (E309Q; Ref. 16Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). These activity measurements do not point to any particular mechanism for inactivation, but phosphorylation experiments suggest that the Ca2+binding step is indeed affected by the mutations. The insetof Fig. 5 shows that phosphorylation by [32P]Pi, while inhibited by Ca2+at 126 μm and 1000 μm for wild type ATPase and SR + control yeast membranes, is still possible for the ADA mutant despite these high Ca2+ concentrations. Based on the rationale of Clarke et al. (16Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), for the six mutations cited in the introduction, this shows that the ADA mutant is Ca2+-insensitive. Our study demonstrates the involvement of the region corresponding to the L6–7 loop in the reaction mechanism of Ca2+-ATPase. It should be noted that this region is fairly well conserved, in particular among type IIA ATPases. Therefore the previous findings with the corresponding residues in H+,K+-ATPase (27Swarts H.G.P. Klaassen C.H.W. de Boer M. Fransen J.A.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. J. Biol.

However, in contrast with the interpretation proposed for H+,K+-ATPase in the latter work, there is convincing evidence for cytosolic exposure of this region in Ca2+-ATPase, since it is an easy target for proteolytic cleavage (37Juul B. Turc H. Durand M.L. Gomez de Gracia A. Denoroy L. Møller J.V. Champeil P. le Maire M. J. Biol.

We suggest that residues of the L6–7 loop could be involved in the initial processes of Ca2+ transport. Specifically, they could act as a site for ion approach (68Or E. David P. Shainskaya A.

https://openalex.org/W2005069341,"The Drosophila cell-surface molecule connectin mediates cell-cell adhesion in vitro, and its expression pattern in vivo fits well with an adhesion role in the embryonic neuromuscular system. However, connectin mutants do not show dramatic neuromuscular defects, and ectopic expression studies so far have not supported an adhesion role. Here, we demonstrate that connectin mutants do have a phenotype; the normally connectin-positive pleural muscles fail to adhere closely together. An in vivo adhesion role is supported by misexpression studies, which result in excessive adhesion of normally connectin-negative muscles. Misexpression also causes defects in axon pathfinding. While a previous study interpreted similar defects as indicating a repulsion role for connectin, we argue that the phenotypes are consistent with connectin's adhesion role."

To understand the rules of recognition and interaction between the components which constitute systems of the new family, it is important to define the functional domains involved in the transduction of a signal by these components. Localization and characterization of the dimerization and the phosphorylation sites on BglG is also important for the elucidation of the mechanism by which phosphorylation affects the dimeric state of a protein. In this paper we report that identification of the phosphorylated residue on BglG, the response regulator of the bgl system, as histidine 208. Mapping of the phosphorylated histidine was carried out in two steps: the first step defined the protein region to which the phosphorylation site maps; the second step defined the specific histidine which is phosphorylated. In the first step we introduced factor Xa cleavage sites to BglG. Proteolysis after in vitrophosphorylation with radioactive phosphate allowed the localization of the phosphorylation site to the last 111 residues of the protein. In the second step we mutated the three histidines located in this region, each at a time, to arginines and followed the ability of the mutants to be in vivo regulated and in vitro phosphorylated by BglF. The ability of all the BglG mutant derivatives used in this study to fold correctly was deduced from various assays that monitored their ability to function as transcriptional antiterminators. Our protocol for the localization of the BglG phosphorylation site can be adopted and applied to localize phosphorylation sites of other proteins. The following E. coli K12 strains were used: K38 (HfrC thi λ+); AE304-7 and AE304-9, both carry a defective bglG gene and an activating mutation in bglR (20Mahadevan S. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); MA152 and MA200, both carry abgl′-lacZ fusion on their chromosome (λ bglR7 bglG′ lacZ + lacY +), but while the first is Δbgl, the second is bgl +(20Mahadevan S.

Salmonella typhimurium strain LJ144 (cpd-401, cysA1150/F′198), contains thepts operon on an E. coli plasmid, F′198, and thus produces increased levels of Enzyme I, HPr, and Enzyme IIAglc (21Saier Jr., M.H. Feucht B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7078-7080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pT712 and pT713, containing the phage T7 late promoter, and plasmid pGP1-2, carrying the T7 RNA polymerase gene under control of the λCI857 repressor, were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Plasmid pT7OAC-F carries the entire bglFgene cloned downstream of the T7 promoter in pT712; plasmid pT7FH-G carries the entire bglG gene cloned downstream of the T7 promoter in pT713 (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Plasmid pMN25 carries the entire bglGgene cloned in pBR322 (20Mahadevan S. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following plasmids were constructed by introducing insertion or base substitution mutations (see the details of the mutagenesis below) into the bglG gene in plasmid pT7FH-G. pCQ-G1 and pCQ-G2 encode for BglG with an insertion of factor Xa cleavage site, Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg, between amino acids 113 and 114 and amino acids 167 and 168, respectively. pCQ-G4, pCQ-G5 and pCQ-G6 encode for BglG with His-208, His-219, and His-278 mutated to Arg, respectively. Enriched media, M9 salts, and M63 salts minimal media were prepared essentially as described by Miller (22Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratry, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The minimal medium used for [35S]methionine labeling was the same as that used by Tabor and Richardson (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) with 0.4% succinate as the carbon source. The minimal medium used for [3H]tryptophan labeling was the same as that used for [35S]methionine labeling, except that it lacked tryptophan rather than lacking methionine and cysteine. Ampicillin (200 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) were included in the media when growing strains which contain plasmids that confer resistance to either one of these antibiotics. MacConkey arbutin plates were prepared as described previously (24Schaefler S. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93 (2nd Ed.): 254-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MacConkey lactose plates were prepared from lactose MacConkey agar (Difco). Factor Xa was obtained from New England Biolabs. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Rotem Industries Ltd. (Beer-Sheva, Israel). [35S]Methionine (1200 Ci/mmol) was obtained from DuPont. [3H]Tryptophan (33 Ci/mmol) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. PEP, 2The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine. pyruvic acid, and pyruvate kinase were obtained from Sigma. [32P]PEP was prepared and separated from [32P]ATP as described before (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). All manipulations with recombinant DNA were carried out by standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes and other enzymes used in recombinant DNA experiments were purchased commercially and were used according to the specifications of the manufacturers. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by overlap extension with polymerase chain reaction as described by Ho et al. (26Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar). To mutate the bglGgene in plasmid pT7FH-G to its alleles that encode for BglG derivatives containing the factor Xa cleavage site insertion (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg), the following primers were used: 5′ATTGAAGGGCGCCTGCTGCCCAACCC3′ and 5′GGCGCCCTTCAATCACGTTTTGCTGAAAG3′ to create pCQ-G1 with the insertion introduced between codons 113 and 114 of the bglGgene; 5′ATAGAGGGCCGGGGAAATATGGAGGATG3′ and 5′CCGGCCCTCTATGCTCATTTGGGCACT3′ to create pCQ-G2 with the insertion introduced between codons 167 and 168 of the bglGgene. To mutate the bglG gene in plasmid pT7FH-G to its alleles that encode for BglG derivatives containing an arginine instead of a certain histidine, the following primers were used: 5′GACTGGTTACGCGTCTGAAG3′ and its complement to create pCQ-G4 encoding BglG whose His-208 is replaced by Arg; 5′CGTATTCTTGAACGGGCCTCA3′ and its complement to create pCQ-G5 encoding BglG whose His-219 is replaced by Arg; 5′CAAAGAACGTTAACACCTGCAG3′ and its complement to create pCQ-G6 encoding BglG whose His-278 is replaced by Arg. The mutations introduced new sites for restriction enzymes which were useful during the screening for the mutant plasmids. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence determinations. Assays for β-galactosidase activity were carried out as described by Miller (22Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratry, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimal medium which was supplied with 0.4% succinate as a carbon source. Cell extracts enriched for various BglG and membrane fractions enriched for BglF were prepared as described before (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The proteins were expressed from their respective genes cloned under T7 promoter control in plasmids pT7FH-G, pCQ-G1, pCQ-G2, pCQ-G4, pCQ-G5, pCQ-G6, and pT7OAC-F. Expression of T7 RNA polymerase, specified by plasmid pGP1-2 which is compatible with the above plasmids, was induced thermally. The E. coli K38 strain was used as a host. A soluble fraction fromS. typhimurium LJ144, which overproduces Enzyme I and HPr, was prepared as described by Begley et al. (27Begley G.S. Hansen D.E. Jacobson G.R. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5552-5556Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of BglF, present in membrane fractions, in the presence of [32P]PEP and an S. typhimurium LJ144 cytoplasmic fraction (used as the source of Enzyme I and HPr), was carried out as described by Amster-Choderet al. (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the various BglG derivatives was carried out by incubating cellular extracts enriched for these proteins with mixtures containing prephosphorylated BglF, as described by Amster-Choder et al. (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells containing plasmids carrying different bglG alleles (encoding the various BglG derivatives) under the control of the phage T7 promoter were induced and labeled with either [35S]methionine or [3H]tryptophan in the presence of rifampicin as described by Tabor and Richardson (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). Labeling times were 2 min or 60 min when labeling with [35S]methionine or [3H]tryptophan, respectively. [32P]BglG was separated from [32P]BglF, a membrane protein, by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was fractionated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the wet gel was exposed to an x-ray film at 4 °C. A gel slice containing the 32P-labeled BglG band was excised, and the protein was extracted from it by incubation in factor Xa buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2) for 2 h at 37 °C. Purified [35S]BglG was obtained by the same procedure. To purify [3H]BglG, [35S]BglG was used as a marker for the [3H]BglG position on gel, due to the inability to detect 3H-labeled proteins after autoradiography without prior enhancement. This procedure was applied for the purification of all isotope-labeled BglG derivatives. Proteolysis with factor Xa was carried out by incubating 50–100 μg of the purified radioactively labeled proteins with 15 μg/ml factor Xa and 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in factor Xa buffer at 23 °C for 6 h. Reactions were terminated by 1% EDTA. Proteins were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in electrophoresis sample buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Electrophoresis of proteins was carried out on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). Alternatively, Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gels with 4% stacking gel, 10% spacer gel, and 16.5% separating gel, prepared as described by Schagger and von Jagow (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar), were used when indicated. Samples were fractionated alongside prestained low or mid-range protein molecular weight markers (Amersham). After electrophoresis, gels with3H-labeled proteins were fixed by 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 30 min, followed by H2O wash for 30 min, and then enhanced with 0.5 m salicylic acid, 0.5m NaOH, and 1% glycerol for 30 min (30Chamberlain J.P. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 132-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). All gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film at −70 °C. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of two forms of BglG in vivo, phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated, implying that there is a single phosphorylated species of BglG (4Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1990; 249: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated residue on BglG was identified as a histidine.1 As a first step toward the localization of the phosphorylated histidine on BglG, we attempted to identify the region on BglG that contains this histidine. To do that, we took advantage of the idea that a cleavage site for a specific protease can be inserted into proteins by in vitro manipulations (31Benhar I. Engelberg-Kulka H. Gene. 1991; 103: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Our plan was to engineer BglG mutants, each containing a factor Xa site located asymmetrically in the protein, to enable cleavage of the mutant proteins to two fragments of different sizes. Cleavage of these mutant BglG derivatives following their in vitro phosphorylation is expected to give only one 32P-labeled fragment in each case, due to the phosphorylation of BglG on a single residue. The ability of the engineered BglG derivatives to fold correctly, dimerize, bind RNA, and antiterminate bgl transcription can be verified by testing their ability to complement a chromosomal mutation in the bglG gene and enable β-glucoside utilization by the mutant strains, when expressed from a plasmid. We first introduced a factor Xa site between amino acids 113 and 114 of BglG by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures”) to generate MG1. As shown in the experimental design scheme, presented in Fig. 1, the site was introduced asymmetrically to enable cleavage of the mutant protein to two polypeptides, “a” and “b,” consisting of 117 amino acids and 165 amino acids, respectively. Indeed, incubation of 35S-labeled MG1 with factor Xa resulted in the appearance of two labeled protein fragments with molecular masses corresponding to those expected for peptides a and b, respectively (Fig. 2, lane 2). The stronger intensity of b relative to a is due to the higher methionine content in the former. The two fragments did not appear when wild-type BglG was incubated with factor Xa (Fig. 2, lane 1). In addition, incubation of both wild-type BglG and MG1 with factor Xa resulted in nonspecific cleavage that generated slightly shortened derivatives of these proteins (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and2). However, this did not interfere with the identification of the specific cleavage products, a and b. In vitrophosphorylation of MG1 prior to proteolysis with factor Xa resulted in the appearance of one 32P-labeled fragment, the b fragment (Fig. 2, lane 3). To indisputably identify the slower migrating fragment as polypeptide b, the C-terminal fragment, we took advantage of the fact that all tryptophans in BglG are clustered in fragment b. Thus, cleavage of BglG, which was labeled with [3H]tryptophan, by factor Xa is expected to generate only one labeled fragment, the b fragment. The results presented in Fig.3 demonstrate that indeed [3H]tryptophan-labeled MG1 generates only one labeled fragment, the slower migrating fragment, after incubation with factor Xa (Fig. 3, lane 2). This is in contrast to the two labeled fragments produced by factor Xa proteolysis of [35S]MG1 (Fig. 3, lane 1). Thus, this experiment verifies the identification of the slower migrating fragment as polypeptide b. The results obtained with MG1 indicate that the phosphorylation site resides in the last 165 amino acids of BglG. The possibility that MG1 is misfolded and thus phosphorylated differently from wild type was ruled out by the demonstrated ability of MG1 to complementbglG strains the same as wild type (TableI).Table IIAbility of BglG mutated in either one of its last histidines to antiterminate transcription of a chromosomal bgl-lacZ fusionPlasmidPlasmid-encoded BglG derivativePhenotype on MacConkey-lactose medium2-aExpression of the bgl-lacZ fusion was partly determined by colony color on MacConkey-lactose plates: +, red colonies; −, white colonies.β-Galactosidase activity2-bThe values represent the average of four independent measurements.unitspT7132-cpBR322 behaved as pT713 (not shown).−2pMN25BglG (wild type)+87pCQ-G4MG4 (H208R)+85pCQ-G5MG5 (H219R)+153pCQ-G6MG6 (H278R)+247The experiment was carried out in MA152 which is Δbgl and carries a bgl-lacZ transcription fusion.

Open table in a new tab The experiment was carried out in MA152 which is Δbgl and carries a bgl-lacZ transcription fusion. The ability of the plasmid-encoded BglG derivatives to enable lacZ expression was assayed. Complementation was indicated by colony color on MacConkey salicin plates: +, strong complementation (bright red colonies); −, no complementation (white colonies). We next constructed MG2 that contains a factor Xa site in a position different from MG1. This was accomplished by introducing a factor Xa site between amino acids 167 and 168. Cleavage of MG2 with factor Xa is expected to generate two fragments, “c” and “d,” consisting of 171 amino acids and 111 amino acids, respectively (see Fig. 1). Incubation of 35S-labeled MG2 with factor Xa resulted indeed in the appearance of two labeled fragments with molecular masses corresponding to those expected for peptides c and d (Fig. 2,lane 4). Proteolysis of in vitro phosphorylated MG2 with factor Xa yielded one 32P-labeled fragment, the d fragment (Fig. 2, lane 5). MG2, like MG1, strongly complemented bglG strains (Table I). Based on the results with MG1 and MG2, we could conclude that the phosphorylation site resides in the last 111 amino acids of BglG. We subsequently constructed three mutants of BglG, each with one of the three C-terminal histidines of BglG (His-208, His-219, and His-278, marked asasterisks in Fig. 1) mutated to an arginine, to generate MG4 (H208R), MG5 (H219R), and MG6 (H278R). These mutants were checked for their ability to complement bglG strains (Table I). The plasmid-encoded MG4, MG5, and MG6 mutants strongly complemented the chromosomal mutation in the bglG gene (the same as wild-type BglG) and enabled growth of the mutant strains on β-glucosides. The results of this analysis suggest that these mutants can form dimers, bind to BglG target site on the RNA, and lead to antitermination ofbgl transcription. To directly demonstrate the ability of the three His to Arg mutants to antiterminate transcription, we made use of strain MA152 which is deleted for the bgl operon and carries a chromosomalbgl′-lacZ fusion (20Mahadevan S. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lacZ gene is not expressed in this strain, because transcription terminates at thebgl terminator, located upstream of the lacZgene. Expression of plasmid-encoded BglG renders the lacZexpression in this strain constitutive, due to this protein's ability to prevent transcription termination. The ability of plasmid-encoded MG4, MG5, and MG6 to antiterminate transcription and enablelacZ expression in MA152 was tested by observing the color of the colonies containing these plasmids on MacConkey lactose plates and by measuring the β-galactosidase levels produced by the cells expressing them. As shown in Table II, all three mutants behaved like wild type in their ability to enable lacZexpression. These results indicate that all three mutants perform like wild type and antiterminate transcription at the bgl-lacZfusion. After verifying that the three His to Arg mutant proteins do not differ from wild-type BglG in their activity, we aimed at studying their ability to be phosphorylated by BglF. Phosphorylation of BglG by BglF was shown before to be the reason for the negative effect that BglF exerts on BglG activity (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, as one approach to determine which histidine on BglG is phosphorylated by BglF, we tested the effect of the three missense mutations in BglG on its ability to be negatively regulated by BglF in vivo. To address this question we made use of strain MA200 which carries the same chromosomalbgl′-lacZ fusion as MA152, but is also Bgl+(20Mahadevan S. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of lacZ in this strain is inducible,i.e. β-galactosidase is produced only upon the relief of BglF inhibition by the addition of β-glucosides to the growth medium. Expression of a plasmid-encoded BglG mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by BglF renders lacZ expression in this strain constitutive, i.e. independent of β-glucoside addition. We tested the effect of plasmid-encoded MG4, MG5, and MG6 onlacZ expression in MA200 by the same methods employed to study their effect in MA152, i.e. colonies color on MacConkey lactose plates and β-galactosidase activity measurements. The results of these tests are summarized in Table III. MG6 behaved like wild-type BglG and did not enable lacZexpression in the absence of β-glucosides, while MG4 and MG5 led to constitutive expression of lacZ, independent of β-glucoside addition to the medium. Hence, MG4 and MG5 are not subjected to negative regulation by BglF in vivo. This observation suggested to us that the phosphorylated residue on BglG is either His-208 (mutated in MG4) or His-219 (mutated in MG5) .Table IIIThe effect of BglF on the antitermination activity of BglG mutantsPlasmidPlasmid-encoded BglG derivativePhenotype on MacConkey-lactose medium3-aPhenotypes on the MacConkey-lactose plates are represented as in Table II.β-Galactosidase activity3-bThe values represent the average of four independent measurements.−Inducer+Inducer3-cβ-Methylglucoside (10 mm) was used as the inducer.−Inducer+InducerunitspT7133-dpBR322 behaved as pT713 (not shown).−+590pMN25BglG (wild type)−+980pCQ-G4MG4 (H208)++7949pCQ-G5MG5 (H219R)++8880pCQ-G6MG6 (H278R)−+866The experiment was carried out in MA200 which is Bgl+ and carries a bgl-lacZ transcriptional fusion.

The effect of the chromosome-encoded BglF on the transcription antitermination activity of the plasmid-encoded BglG derivatives was assayed. Another approach we applied to determine which of the histidines in BglG is phosphorylated by BglF, was to test the ability of the His to Arg mutants to be phosphorylated by BglF in vitro. We have shown before that BglF, phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of [32P]PEP, Enzyme I, and HPr, can transfer a phosphoryl group to BglG (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We added extracts of cells overproducing the different BglG derivatives, wild type and mutants, to mixtures containing prephosphorylated BglF, and further incubated them. Aliquots removed after 1, 5, and 15 min were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography, and the results are presented in Fig. 4. MG6, mutated in histidine 278, was phosphorylated in vitro at the same pattern as wild-type BglG (compare lanes 3–5 with lanes 12–14 in Fig. 4). No phosphorylation occurred in the case of MG4, which is mutated in histidine 208 (Fig. 4, lanes 6–8). MG5, mutated in histidine 219, was phosphorylated by BglF, albeit, at a slightly reduced rate than the wild-type protein (Fig. 4, lanes 9–11). A control with BglG incubated in a phosphorylation system lacking BglF (lanes 1 and 2) rules out the possibility of a direct phosphorylation of BglG by the phosphotransferase system general proteins. Hence, MG4 is the only His to Arg mutant that fails to be both in vivo regulated andin vitro phosphorylated by BglF. These results indicate that histidine 208 is the amino acid which is phosphorylated on BglG. The phosphorylated amino acid on the response regulator of thebgl system, BglG, was recently identified as a histidine residue.1 In this study we used a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches to map the phosphorylated histidine on BglG. We first defined the protein region to which the phosphorylation site maps by introducing a protease cleavage site to two locations in the protein, enabling its proteolysis to well defined fragments. Phosphorylation of a protein containing an engineered cleavage site with radioactive phosphate followed by its proteolysis results in the appearance of one radioactively labeled fragment, the one on which the phosphorylated residue resides. Hence, by constructing two mutant BglG proteins (MG1 and MG2), each containing a factor Xa cleavage site at a different location, we could locate the phosphorylated histidine to last 111 residues. This part of the protein contains three histidines, which we mutated, each at a time, to arginine, the residue which is most similar to histidine. To determine which histidine is the phosphorylated one, we followed the mutants' ability to be negatively regulated by BglF in vivo on one hand and to be phosphorylated by BglF in vitro on the other hand. A mutation in histidine 208 prevented both in vivoregulation and in vitro phosphorylation of the mutant protein by BglF. We therefore concluded that histidine 208 constitutes the phosphorylation site on BglG. A mutation in histidine 219, located near the phosphorylation site, enabled phosphorylation of the mutant protein in vitro but affected its ability to be negatively regulated in vivo. The close proximity of this mutation to the phosphorylation site seems to provide a satisfying explanation for this effect. Ample precautions were taken to ensure that the histidine to arginine mutants are otherwise identical to the wild-type protein. These proteins were shown to strongly complement a mutation in thebglG gene and enable β-glucoside utilization. Their transcriptional antitermination activity was also demonstrated directly by their ability to express a lacZ gene fused downstream to the bgl transcriptional terminator. As part of the precautions, this ability was assayed in two different ways. Passing all these hurdles requires that the mutant proteins fold, dimerize, bind RNA, and antiterminate transcription the same as the wild-type protein. These strict demands for the performance of the mutant proteins validate the conclusions regarding the phosphorylation behavior of these mutants. The method used by us for the localization of the phosphorylated residue on BglG can be applied to map phosphorylation sites on other proteins. Insertion mutagenesis, to introduce a protease cleavage site, or base substitutions, to change residues which are candidates for phosphorylation sites, can be accomplished quickly and efficiently by polymerase chain reaction nowadays. In case the protein of interest is available as a purified polypeptide, mutagenesis of individual suspected residues is not required. Rather, the introduction of a proteolytic site into the protein, which enables sequencing by Edman degradation from internal positions (31Benhar I. Engelberg-Kulka H. Gene. 1991; 103: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), should enable the identification of the phosphorylated residue. The bgl system represents a new family of bacterial regulatory systems involved in signal transduction (1Amster-Choder O. Wright A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 51: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Transduction of a signal by this system involves reversible phosphorylation of the BglG response regulator on a histidine residue by the BglF membrane-bound sensor (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1990; 249: 540-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).1 Other systems in various organisms were suggested to affiliate to this new family (11Aymerich S. Steinmetz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10410-10414Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 12Arnaud M. Vary P. Zagorec M. Klier A. Debarbouille M. Postma P. Rapoport G. J.

Ehrlich S.D. Chopin A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5681-5685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation events involved in signal transmission by these systems are not well defined yet. Mapping of the phosphorylation site in BglG is an important step toward the definition and the characterization of the functional domains involved in the communication between sensors and regulators of this novel family of sensory systems. Comparison of the sequence around the BglG phosphorylation site with the respective sequences of its known homologues, e.g. SacY, SacT, and LicT in Bacillus subtilis and BglR in Lactobacillus lactis, reveals that the phosphorylated histidine in BglG, His-208, and the residues flanking it are conserved in all these proteins. It is worth mentioning that the other two histidines that we mutated in BglG, His-219 and His-278, are not conserved in these homologues. The bgl system was the first example of a reversible phosphorylation modulating a specific and well characterized conformational change in a transcription factor, in this case a change in the oligomeric state of BglG which controls its activity. Whereas non-phosphorylated BglG is a dimer that can bind RNA and antiterminate transcription, phosphorylated BglG is an inactive monomer (6Amster-Choder O. Wright A. Science. 1992; 257: 1395-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Mapping and characterizing the nature of both the dimerization and the phosphorylation sites on BglG is important for the elucidation of the mechanism by which phosphorylation affects the dimeric state of a protein. Studies of the BglG dimerization domain are underway. Mutant derivatives of BglG have been described that do not respond to negative regulation by BglF. These mutants, BglG33 and BglG4, led to constitutive expression of the bgl operon in vivo(20Mahadevan S. Reynolds A.E. Wright A. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Prasad I. Schaefler S. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 120: 638-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and showed little or no phosphorylation by BglF in vitro (3Amster-Choder O. Houman H. Wright A. Cell. 1989; 58: 847-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mutations have been shown to map to Asp-100 and His-160, respectively. 3J. Lopilato, M. R. Diaz-Torres and A. Wright, personal communication. The identification of histidine 208 as BglG phosphorylation site suggests that these mutations are in other sites involved in BglG-negative regulation and phosphorylation. Whether they are part of the site which is recognized by the kinase and interacts with it or they are part of a phosphorylation module composed of residues remote from each other in the primary sequence but brought to close vicinity during folding awaits future structural studies.
