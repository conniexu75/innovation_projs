https://openalex.org/W2089127919,"Structural maturation of fiber tracts in the human brain, including an increase in the diameter and myelination of axons, may play a role in cognitive development during childhood and adolescence. A computational analysis of structural magnetic resonance images obtained in 111 children and adolescents revealed age-related increases in white matter density in fiber tracts constituting putative corticospinal and frontotemporal pathways. The maturation of the corticospinal tract was bilateral, whereas that of the frontotemporal pathway was found predominantly in the left (speech-dominant) hemisphere. These findings provide evidence for a gradual maturation, during late childhood and adolescence, of fiber pathways presumably supporting motor and speech functions."

Arabidopsis thaliana plants with loss-of-function mutations in the CLAVATA (CLV1 , 2 , and 3) genes have enlarged meristems and generate extra floral organs. Genetic analysis indicates that CLV1 , which encodes a receptor kinase, acts with CLV3 to control the balance between meristem cell proliferation and differentiation. CLV3 encodes a small, predicted extracellular protein. CLV3 acts nonautonomously in meristems and is expressed at the meristem surface overlying the CLV1 domain. These proteins may act as a ligand-receptor pair in a signal transduction pathway, coordinating growth between adjacent meristematic regions."

Several mutants with increased sensitivity were obtained, which exhibited an altered structure of teichoic acids, major components of the Gram-positive cell wall. The mutant teichoic acids lacked d-alanine, as a result of which the cells carried an increased negative surface charge. The mutant cells bound fewer anionic, but more positively charged proteins. They were sensitive to human defensin HNP1–3, animal-derived protegrins, tachyplesins, and magainin II, and to the bacteria-derived peptides gallidermin and nisin. The mutated genes shared sequence similarity with thedlt genes involved in the transfer of d-alanine into teichoic acids from other Gram-positive bacteria. Wild-type strains bearing additional copies of the dlt operon produced teichoic acids with higher amounts of d-alanine esters, bound cationic proteins less effectively and were less sensitive to antimicrobial peptides. We propose a role of thed-alanine-esterified teichoic acids which occur in many pathogenic bacteria in the protection against human and animal defense systems.

The broad range of antimicrobial peptides tolerated distinguishes them from the highly specific self-protection systems of lantibiotic-producing staphylococcal strains (11Peschel A. Götz F. J.

Physiol. 1988; 29: 233-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Teichoic acids of the various Gram-positive species are highly variable in the use of alditol groups (glycerol or ribitol) and in modifications of the alditol with glycosyl residues or d-alanine. The highly charged teichoic acids are essential for viability and seem to be involved in the control of cell shape, autolytic enzymes, and magnesium ion concentration within the cell envelope (13Pooley H.M. Karamata D. Ghuysen J.-M. Hakenbeck R. Bacterial Cell Wall. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands1994Google Scholar, 15Bierbaum G. Sahl H.-G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In an attempt to understand the mechanisms by which staphylococci resist antimicrobial peptides, we isolated gallidermin-sensitiveStaphylococcus xylosus and Staphylococcus aureusmutants, analysis of which revealed that the absence ofd-alanine esters from teichoic acids leads to increased sensitivity toward cationic antimicrobial peptides.DISCUSSIONThe dltABCD genes of S. aureus, S. xylosus, L. casei, and B. subtilis are similar in sequence and organization. Studies in L. caseihave demonstrated a role of DltA as ad-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase (Dcl), which activates d-alanine by hydrolysis of ATP and transfers it to the phosphopantetheine cofactor of a specificd-alanine carrier protein (Dcp), which is encoded bydltC (33Debabov D.V. Heaton M.P. Zhang Q. Stewart K.D. Lambalot R.H. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2869-3876Crossref Google Scholar, 34Heaton M.P. Neuhaus F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The hydrophobic DltB is indispensable for d-alanine incorporation into teichoic acids and may be involved in the transfer of activated d-alanine across the cytoplasmic membrane (35Perego M. Glaser P. Minutello A. Strauch M.A. Leopold K. Fischer W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15598-15606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). The essential role of DltD and the presence of a putative N-terminal signal peptide suggest an involvement in the transfer ofd-alanine from the membrane carrier to teichoic acids (Fig.4).The increased sensitivity of S. aureus and S. xylosus dlt mutants toward a variety of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides provides evidence for a role of the d-alanine substituents in the protection of the bacteria against these substances. Inactivation of dlt genes caused considerably lower minimal inhibitory concentrations of (i) host defense peptides with β-sheet structure and disulfide bridges, such as human defensin HNP1–3, protegrins from porcine leukocytes, and tachyplesins from horseshoe crab hemocytes; (ii) the linear peptide magainin II from amphibian skin; and (iii) the bacteria-derived lantibiotics gallidermin and nisin, which contain thioether bridges. Since the common structural feature of these molecules is a positive net charge, and since the sensitivity toward neutral gramicidin D was the same in the wild-type and the dlt mutants, we propose that the basis for increased sensitivity is an altered electrostatic interaction of the peptides with the mutant cells. The teichoic acid backbone is highly charged by deprotonized phosphate groups, and esterification withd-alanine causes a reduction of the net negative charge by introduction of basic amino groups (Fig. 4). Accordingly, the S. aureus and S. xylosus dlt mutants, whose teichoic acids are devoid of d-alanine, bound lower amounts of negatively charged green fluorescent protein but higher amounts of positively charged cytochrome c and gallidermin, while strains with increased d-alanine content showed the opposite behavior. Increased accumulation of antimicrobial peptides in the vicinity of the cytoplasmic membrane is therefore very likely to be the basis for the higher sensitivity of the dlt mutants.Cationic properties are necessary for the initial interaction of membrane-damaging peptides with the negatively charged membrane surface (38Shai Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 460-464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Reduction of the negative cell envelope charge by incorporation of d-alanine may thus be regarded as a multiple drug protection mechanism. A similar observation has been made with Gram-negative bacteria whose resistance to the cationic peptides polymyxin B and protamine was caused by a reduction of the anionic nature of the lipopolysaccharide (39Nummila K. Kilpeläinen I. Zähringer U. Vaara M. Helander I.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Bacteria have to cope with antimicrobial peptides in many environments. The production of bacteriocin-like molecules such as gallidermin or nisin is a prevalent strategy among microorganisms to inhibit the growth of competing strains (7Nes I.F. Diep D.B. Havarstein L.S. Brurberg M.B. Eijsink V. Holo H. Antonie Leeuwenhoek. 1996; 70: 113-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 8Sahl H.-G. Jack R.W. Bierbaum G. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1995; 13: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). For bacteria such as staphylococci, which live in intimate contact with humans and animals, mechanisms protecting against host defense peptides are of particular benefit. Accordingly, a correlation between the capacity of S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococci to cause endocarditis, and the in vitro resistance to defensin-like platelet microbicidal proteins has been demonstrated (10Wu T. Yeaman M.R. Bayer A.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms by which bacteria are able to circumvent the human defense systems has a great impact on the treatment of infections and the search for new antimicrobial agents. To our knowledge, the study presented here describes the first mechanism conferring resistance to host defense peptides in a Gram-positive organism. d-Alanine-esterified teichoic acids occur in many Gram-positive human pathogens including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and listeria (14Fischer W. Adv. Microbiol.

For bacteria such as staphylococci, which live in intimate contact with humans and animals, mechanisms protecting against host defense peptides are of particular benefit. Accordingly, a correlation between the capacity of S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and streptococci to cause endocarditis, and the in vitro resistance to defensin-like platelet microbicidal proteins has been demonstrated (10Wu T. Yeaman M.R. Bayer A.S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms by which bacteria are able to circumvent the human defense systems has a great impact on the treatment of infections and the search for new antimicrobial agents. To our knowledge, the study presented here describes the first mechanism conferring resistance to host defense peptides in a Gram-positive organism. d-Alanine-esterified teichoic acids occur in many Gram-positive human pathogens including staphylococci, streptococci, enterococci, and listeria (14Fischer W. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1988; 29: 233-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and our study raises the question whether the d-alanine esters or further resistance systems against host defense peptides contribute to the virulence and persistence of these bacteria.

The transport of holes into AlQ 3 caused a decrease in its fluorescence quantum efficiency, thus showing that cationic AlQ 3 species are unstable and that their degradation products are fluorescence quenchers. These findings explain the success of different approaches to stabilizing OLEDs, such as doping of the hole transport layer, introducing a buffer layer at the hole-injecting contact, and using mixed emitting layers of hole and electron transporting molecules."

Calcium is the most abundant cation in the human body, but less than 1% is present in ionic form in the extracellular compartment (1).

Daily dietary intake is less than 1000 mg of which only 30% is absorbed in the intestinal tract. This percentage is significantly enhanced during growth, pregnancy, and lactation by increased levels of circulating 1,25-(OH)2D3. Although there is a continuous turnover of bone mass, there is no net gain or loss of Ca2+from bone in a young and healthy individual. This implicates that healthy adults excrete maximally 300 mg Ca2+ in the urine to balance intestinal Ca2+ uptake and that the remaining filtered load of Ca2+ has to be reabsorbed by the kidney. Recently, the mechanism by which extracellular Ca2+ is sensed by the parathyroid gland was elucidated by cloning of the Ca2+-sensing receptor (1van Os C.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Transepithelial Ca2+ transport is a three-step process consisting of passive entry across the apical membrane, cytosolic diffusion facilitated by 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent calcium-binding proteins (calbindins), and active extrusion across the opposing basolateral membrane mediated by a high affinity Ca2+-ATPase and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (6Friedman P.A. Gesek F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Until now, the molecular mechanism responsible for Ca2+ entry into small intestinal and renal cells, which serve as the influx pathways into the extracellular Ca2+pool, is still elusive (6Friedman P.A. Gesek F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 429-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONHere, we report the expression cloning, tissue distribution, immunolocalization, and functional characterization of the apical Ca2+ influx channel, which is expressed solely in proximal small intestine, the distal part of the nephron, and placenta. In analogy to the recently cloned amiloride-sensitive and aldosterone-dependent epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) (10Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), present in the apical membrane of sodium-transporting epithelia, this novel epithelial Ca2+ channel was named ECaC. By screening for maximal 45Ca2+ influx activity in oocytes a single 2.8-kilobase pair cDNA was isolated from a directional cDNA library prepared from poly(A)+RNA of rabbit distal tubular cells. The ECaC cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2190 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 730 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of 83 kDa (M r 83,000) (Fig. 1A). Hydropathy analysis suggests that ECaC contains three structural domains: a large hydrophilic amino-terminal domain of 327 amino acids containing three ankyrin binding repeats and several potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, suggesting an intracellular location; a six transmembrane-spanning domain with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and an additional hydrophobic stretch between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 indicative of an ion pore region; and a hydrophilic 151-amino acid carboxyl terminus containing potential protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1B).A protein data base search revealed only a significant homology of less than 30% between ECaC and the recently cloned capsaicin receptor (VR1) (11Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6938) Google Scholar), the transient receptor potential (TRP)-related ion channels (12Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and olfactory channels (13Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capsaicin receptor is a nonselective cation channel and functions as a transducer of painful thermal stimuli (11Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6938) Google Scholar). Members of the TRP family have been proposed to mediate the entry of extracellular Ca2+ into cells in response to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (12Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These proteins resemble ECaC with respect to their predicted topological organization and the presence of multiple NH2-terminal ankyrin repeats (14Michaely P. Bennet V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). There was also striking amino acid sequence similarity between ECaC, VR1, and TRP-related proteins within and adjacent to the sixth transmembrane segment, including the predicted area that may contribute to the ion permeation path (Fig. 1C) (15Hardie R.C. Minke B. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 61: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Outside these regions, however, ECaC shares only 20% sequence similarity with VR1 and TRP family members, suggesting a distant evolutionary relationship among these channels.High stringency Northern blot analysis of ECaC transcripts revealed prominent bands of ∼3 kb in small intestine, kidney, and placenta (Fig. 2). We found that in the intestine ECaC mRNA expression was highest in duodenum, decreased in jejunum, and absent in ileum and colon. ECaC mRNA expression in kidney and placenta was comparable with jejunum. In addition, ECaC transcripts in lung, skeletal muscle, stomach, heart, liver, spleen, and brain were undetectable. Most important is that expression of ECaC coincides with that of calbindin-D9K in intestine and placenta and calbindin-D28K in kidney (16Wasserman R.H. Fullmer C.S. Chung W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. II. Academic Press, New York1982: 175-216Google Scholar, 17Gross M. Kumar R. Am. J.

Molecular mass standards (in kilobases) are indicated on theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Immunofluorescence staining revealed that in kidney ECaC is abundantly present along the apical membrane in the majority of cells lining the distal part of the nephron including distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct, where it colocalizes with calbindin-D28K (Fig. 3). This part of the nephron is the site of PTH- and 1,25-(OH)2D3-regulated transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption (18Suki W.N. Rouse D. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. I. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 472-515Google Scholar).Figure 3Immunohistochemistry of ECaC in rabbit kidney. Kidney cortex sections were double stained with anti-ECaC antiserum (A, C) and anti-calbindin-D28K (B, D). Localization of ECaC in distal convoluted tubules (A) and cortical collecting ducts (C) is restricted to the apical region of the cell and colocalizes with calbindin-D28K. The cells in the collecting duct lacking ECaC were also calbindin-D28K-negative and are, therefore, most likely intercalated cells. Note the absence of immunopositive staining of ECaC in the surrounding glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules, and thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Bar denotes 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)By functional expression of ECaC in Xenopus oocytes we observed that the 45Ca2+ uptake was linear for at least 2 h (Fig. 4) and increased with increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations between 0.01 and 2.0 mm with an apparent affinity for Ca2+ of ∼0.2 mm (Fig.5 C). This is well within the range of physiologically relevant extracellular calcium concentrations. As shown in Fig. 5 A, trivalent and divalent cations inhibited 45Ca2+ influx in the following rank order of potency: La3+ > Cd2+ > Mn2+, while Ba2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ had no effect. It is striking that Ba2+and Sr2+, which are highly permeant in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (19Hagiwara S. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 331: 231-252Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), do not interfere with ECaC. In addition, the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists and depolarization with 50 mm KCl were without effect. VR1, to which ECaC has the highest homology, shows a relative low permeability to monovalent ions such as Na+ (11Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6938) Google Scholar). In a double labeling experiment, ECaC-injected oocytes did not exhibit a significant Na+ influx (0.88 ± 0.05 and 0.95 ± 0.05 nmol·h−1·oocyte−1 for ECaC and water-injected oocytes, respectively; n = 29 oocytes;p > 0.2), while displaying a markedly increased Ca2+ influx. In humans metabolic acidosis induces hypercalciuria (18Suki W.N. Rouse D. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. I. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 472-515Google Scholar, 20Sutton R.A.L. Wong N.M.L. Dirks J.H. Kidney Int. 1979; 15: 520-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and here we demonstrate that acidification of the extracellular medium to pH 5.9 significantly inhibits45Ca2+ influx (Fig. 5, A andB). If extrapolatable to the in vivo situation this effect could well be the molecular explanation of acidosis-induced calciuresis. Taken together, these characteristics indicate that ECaC is distinct from previously described Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, the above described pharmacological and functional properties of ECaC are identical to those of Ca2+ transport across the monolayers (Fig. 5, C and D), providing evidence that the protein is a major constituent of the transcellular Ca2+ transport system in renal cells. Together with the previous finding that the Ca2+ influx rate at the apical membrane of renal distal cells is tightly coupled to transepithelial Ca2+ flux over a wide range of transport rates (21Raber G. Willems P.H.G.M. Lang F. Nitsche R. van Os C.H. Bindels R.J.M. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), this suggests that the apical Ca2+ influx is the rate-limiting step in transcellular Ca2+ transport. Moreover, this implicates that hormonal regulation of a single influx pathway, i.e. ECaC, may control the rate of transcellular Ca2+ transport.Figure 445Ca2+ uptake in oocytes expressing ECaC as a function of time.

Statistical significance (*, p < 0.05) was determined by analysis of variance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In humans, approximately 4% of the population suffers from idiopathic hypercalciuria with the characteristics of autosomal dominant transmission (22Asplin J.R. Favus M.J. Coe F.L. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. II. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1893-1935Google Scholar). In some of the affected individuals, hypercalciuria is secondary to hyperabsorption of Ca2+ (22Asplin J.R. Favus M.J. Coe F.L. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. II. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1893-1935Google Scholar). Gain of function mutations in ECaC or its dysregulation may well be the cause of absorptive hypercalciuria. The present elucidation of ECaC allows to study these possibilities with molecular genetic approaches. Calcium is the most abundant cation in the human body, but less than 1% is present in ionic form in the extracellular compartment (1).

Calcium and Cell Function. II. Academic Press, New York1982: 175-216Google Scholar, 17Gross M. Kumar R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F195-F209PubMed Google Scholar).Immunofluorescence staining revealed that in kidney ECaC is abundantly present along the apical membrane in the majority of cells lining the distal part of the nephron including distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct, where it colocalizes with calbindin-D28K (Fig. 3). This part of the nephron is the site of PTH- and 1,25-(OH)2D3-regulated transcellular Ca2+ reabsorption (18Suki W.N. Rouse D. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. I. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 472-515Google Scholar).Figure 3Immunohistochemistry of ECaC in rabbit kidney. Kidney cortex sections were double stained with anti-ECaC antiserum (A, C) and anti-calbindin-D28K (B, D). Localization of ECaC in distal convoluted tubules (A) and cortical collecting ducts (C) is restricted to the apical region of the cell and colocalizes with calbindin-D28K. The cells in the collecting duct lacking ECaC were also calbindin-D28K-negative and are, therefore, most likely intercalated cells. Note the absence of immunopositive staining of ECaC in the surrounding glomeruli, proximal convoluted tubules, and thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. Bar denotes 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)By functional expression of ECaC in Xenopus oocytes we observed that the 45Ca2+ uptake was linear for at least 2 h (Fig. 4) and increased with increasing extracellular Ca2+ concentrations between 0.01 and 2.0 mm with an apparent affinity for Ca2+ of ∼0.2 mm (Fig.5 C). This is well within the range of physiologically relevant extracellular calcium concentrations. As shown in Fig. 5 A, trivalent and divalent cations inhibited 45Ca2+ influx in the following rank order of potency: La3+ > Cd2+ > Mn2+, while Ba2+, Mg2+, and Sr2+ had no effect. It is striking that Ba2+and Sr2+, which are highly permeant in voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (19Hagiwara S. Ohmori H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1982; 331: 231-252Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), do not interfere with ECaC. In addition, the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonists and depolarization with 50 mm KCl were without effect. VR1, to which ECaC has the highest homology, shows a relative low permeability to monovalent ions such as Na+ (11Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6938) Google Scholar). In a double labeling experiment, ECaC-injected oocytes did not exhibit a significant Na+ influx (0.88 ± 0.05 and 0.95 ± 0.05 nmol·h−1·oocyte−1 for ECaC and water-injected oocytes, respectively; n = 29 oocytes;p > 0.2), while displaying a markedly increased Ca2+ influx. In humans metabolic acidosis induces hypercalciuria (18Suki W.N. Rouse D. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. I. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 472-515Google Scholar, 20Sutton R.A.L. Wong N.M.L. Dirks J.H. Kidney Int. 1979; 15: 520-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and here we demonstrate that acidification of the extracellular medium to pH 5.9 significantly inhibits45Ca2+ influx (Fig. 5, A andB). If extrapolatable to the in vivo situation this effect could well be the molecular explanation of acidosis-induced calciuresis. Taken together, these characteristics indicate that ECaC is distinct from previously described Ca2+ channels. Furthermore, the above described pharmacological and functional properties of ECaC are identical to those of Ca2+ transport across the monolayers (Fig. 5, C and D), providing evidence that the protein is a major constituent of the transcellular Ca2+ transport system in renal cells. Together with the previous finding that the Ca2+ influx rate at the apical membrane of renal distal cells is tightly coupled to transepithelial Ca2+ flux over a wide range of transport rates (21Raber G. Willems P.H.G.M. Lang F. Nitsche R. van Os C.H. Bindels R.J.M. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), this suggests that the apical Ca2+ influx is the rate-limiting step in transcellular Ca2+ transport. Moreover, this implicates that hormonal regulation of a single influx pathway, i.e. ECaC, may control the rate of transcellular Ca2+ transport.Figure 445Ca2+ uptake in oocytes expressing ECaC as a function of time.

Statistical significance (*, p < 0.05) was determined by analysis of variance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In humans, approximately 4% of the population suffers from idiopathic hypercalciuria with the characteristics of autosomal dominant transmission (22Asplin J.R. Favus M.J. Coe F.L. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. II. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1893-1935Google Scholar). In some of the affected individuals, hypercalciuria is secondary to hyperabsorption of Ca2+ (22Asplin J.R. Favus M.J. Coe F.L. Brenner B.M. The Kidney. II. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1996: 1893-1935Google Scholar). Gain of function mutations in ECaC or its dysregulation may well be the cause of absorptive hypercalciuria. The present elucidation of ECaC allows to study these possibilities with molecular genetic approaches. Here, we report the expression cloning, tissue distribution, immunolocalization, and functional characterization of the apical Ca2+ influx channel, which is expressed solely in proximal small intestine, the distal part of the nephron, and placenta. In analogy to the recently cloned amiloride-sensitive and aldosterone-dependent epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) (10Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar), present in the apical membrane of sodium-transporting epithelia, this novel epithelial Ca2+ channel was named ECaC. By screening for maximal 45Ca2+ influx activity in oocytes a single 2.8-kilobase pair cDNA was isolated from a directional cDNA library prepared from poly(A)+RNA of rabbit distal tubular cells. The ECaC cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2190 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 730 amino acids with a predicted relative molecular mass of 83 kDa (M r 83,000) (Fig. 1A). Hydropathy analysis suggests that ECaC contains three structural domains: a large hydrophilic amino-terminal domain of 327 amino acids containing three ankyrin binding repeats and several potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, suggesting an intracellular location; a six transmembrane-spanning domain with two potential N-linked glycosylation sites and an additional hydrophobic stretch between transmembrane segments 5 and 6 indicative of an ion pore region; and a hydrophilic 151-amino acid carboxyl terminus containing potential protein kinase A and C phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1B). A protein data base search revealed only a significant homology of less than 30% between ECaC and the recently cloned capsaicin receptor (VR1) (11Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6938) Google Scholar), the transient receptor potential (TRP)-related ion channels (12Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and olfactory channels (13Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capsaicin receptor is a nonselective cation channel and functions as a transducer of painful thermal stimuli (11Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D. Nature. 1997; 389: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (6938) Google Scholar). Members of the TRP family have been proposed to mediate the entry of extracellular Ca2+ into cells in response to depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores (12Zhu X. Jiang M. Peyton M. Boulay G. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Cell. 1996; 85: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These proteins resemble ECaC with respect to their predicted topological organization and the presence of multiple NH2-terminal ankyrin repeats (14Michaely P. Bennet V. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 127-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). There was also striking amino acid sequence similarity between ECaC, VR1, and TRP-related proteins within and adjacent to the sixth transmembrane segment, including the predicted area that may contribute to the ion permeation path (Fig. 1C) (15Hardie R.C. Minke B. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 61: 371-376Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Outside these regions, however, ECaC shares only 20% sequence similarity with VR1 and TRP family members, suggesting a distant evolutionary relationship among these channels. High stringency Northern blot analysis of ECaC transcripts revealed prominent bands of ∼3 kb in small intestine, kidney, and placenta (Fig. 2). We found that in the intestine ECaC mRNA expression was highest in duodenum, decreased in jejunum, and absent in ileum and colon. ECaC mRNA expression in kidney and placenta was comparable with jejunum. In addition, ECaC transcripts in lung, skeletal muscle, stomach, heart, liver, spleen, and brain were undetectable. Most important is that expression of ECaC coincides with that of calbindin-D9K in intestine and placenta and calbindin-D28K in kidney (16Wasserman R.H. Fullmer C.S. Chung W.Y.

Here we examined the mechanism of TNF in preventing neuronal death in primary hippocampal neurons. TNF protected neurons against hypoxia- or nitric oxide-induced injury, with an increase in the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x as determined by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis. Treatment of neurons with an antisense oligonucleotide to bcl-2 mRNA or that to bcl-x mRNA blocked the up-regulation of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x expression, respectively, and partially inhibited the neuroprotective effect induced by TNF. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly inhibited hypoxia- or nitric oxide-induced neuronal death. To examine the possible involvement of a transcription factor, NFκB, in the regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression in TNF-treated neurons, an adenoviral vector capable of expressing a mutated form of IκB was used to infect neurons prior to TNF treatment. Expression of the mutant NFκB completely inhibited NFκB DNA binding activity and inhibited both TNF-induced up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression and neuroprotective effect. These findings indicate that induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression through NFκB activation is involved in the neuroprotective action of TNF against hypoxia- or nitric oxide-induced injury.

Med. 1996; 2: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Cell culture studies have shown that TNF can protect cultured neurons against glucose deprivation-induced injury and excitatory amino acid toxicity, by stabilizing intracellular calcium concentration (1Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments using mice deficient in TNF receptors demonstrated that endogenous TNF protects neurons against ischemic and excitotoxic insults, with induction of an antioxidative pathway (2Bruce A.J.

However, the exact mechanisms by which TNF protects neurons are largely unknown.Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is activated by a variety of cytokines including TNF (3Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 649-681Crossref Scopus (5540) Google Scholar) and is thought to be a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, response to infection, and stress. Conventional NFκB is a heterodimer that consists of p50 and p65 subunits. The activity of NFκB is strictly regulated by one of the IκB inhibitory proteins, such as IκBα or IκBβ, which forms a complex with NFκB and keeps NFκB in the cytoplasm (3Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 649-681Crossref Scopus (5540) Google Scholar). When cells receive signals that activate NFκB, IκBs are phosphorylated and degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (5Baeurle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Coincident with IκB degradation, activated NFκB translocates to the nucleus and participates in the transactivation of a variety of genes, including genes for inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules (5Baeurle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar).Recently, dominant negative mutations of IκBα that are not phosphorylated and therefore not proteolyzed have been reported (6Brockmann J.A. Scherr D.C. McKinsy T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Le W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Traenckner E.B.M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). One such protein is a mutant IκBα that contains serine-to-alanine mutations at amino acids 32 and 36, which inhibit signal-induced phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα. This form of mutant IκB has been used to demonstrate that inhibition of NFκB induces apoptosis through a variety of cancer agents (8Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 9Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar).Several pathways are emerging that depend on external stimuli to signal key molecules in the induction or the prevention of apoptosis. One such pathway is regulated by the expression of the proto-oncogenebcl-2 family, whose members include bcl-2,bcl-x, and bax. Bcl-2 is an intracellular protein that localizes to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear envelope (10Monaghan P. Robertson D. Amos T.A.S. Dyer M.J.S. Mason D.Y. Greaves M.F. J.

Cell. 1991; 67: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The bcl-x gene also functions to regulate cell death. Bcl-x transcripts are alternatively spliced into a long and short form or a form lacking the transmembrane domain (15Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 4388-4398PubMed Google Scholar). The long form (bcl-x L) suppresses cell death, whereas the short form (bcl-x S) acts directly as a dominant interfering bcl-2 and bcl-x L antagonist, favoring apoptosis (15Boise L.H.

Bax forms a dimer with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL and prevents the death repressor activity of these anti-apoptotic proteins (17Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Iries S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E.

On the other hand, Bax expression is increased in degenerating neurons in the ischemic brain (22Isenmann S. Stoll G. Schroeter M. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bahr M. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which expression of thebcl-2 family members is controlled is unknown.In this report, we found increased expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x upon stimulating primary neurons with TNF. Furthermore, inhibition of NFκB activation by adenovirus- mediated overexpression of the mutant form of IκB abolished the up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression and the neuroprotective effect induced by TNF.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 in neurons can prevent or delay cell death induced by a variety of stimuliin vitro (37Garcia I.

Overexpression of Bcl-xL also protects sympathetic neurons from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor deprivation (39Frankowski H. Missotten M. Fernandez P.A. Martinou I. Michel P. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1919-1921Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously showed decreased levels of Bcl-2 expression in hypoxia- and nitric oxide-induced neuronal apoptosis (35Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Nunez G. Tohyama M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Tohyama M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 58: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x are induced primarily in neurons destined to survive following focal ischemia (22Isenmann S. Stoll G. Schroeter M. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bahr M. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and global ischemia (21Chen J. Graham S.H. Nakayama M. Zhu R.L. Jin K. Stetler A. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the endogenous levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x regulate neuronal survival. Our present data demonstrated that TNF protects neurons against hypoxia- and nitric oxide-induced toxicity and up-regulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression. Pretreatment of neurons with Bcl-2 or Bcl-x antisense ODN which inhibits up-regulation of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x expression, respectively, significantly inhibits the neuroprotective effect induced by TNF, indicating that either Bcl-2 and Bcl-x induction is involved in the neuroprotective action of this cytokine. Simultaneous addition of both the antisense ODN, which inhibits up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression, seems to additively but not synergistically inhibit TNF-induced neuroprotection. Evidence taken from previous studies suggests that Bax actively promotes cell death, unless it is bound by either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (17Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Iries S. Iwama N. Boise L.H.

Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Thus, the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x seems to be critical for cell survival. Therefore, TNF-induced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x might antagonize the pro-apoptotic function of Bax, whose expression was unchanged by TNF. Moreover, the present finding that overexpression of Bcl-2 protects neurons supports this anti-apoptotic protein as a critical factor for neuronal protection against hypoxia- or nitric oxide-induced injury. Production of TNF has been investigated in an ischemic brain injury model (40Uno H. Matsuyama T. Akita H. Nishimura H. Sugita M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Matab. 1997; 17: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), in which the cytokine is rapidly synthesized in the brain. Enhanced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x has also been documented in neurons that are destined to survive after ischemic brain injury (21Chen J. Graham S.H. Nakayama M. Zhu R.L. Jin K. Stetler A. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be that TNF produced by resident brain cells up-regulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression in neurons and thereby protects them from ischemic injury.Most cells including neurons express specific receptors for TNF. Two receptors have been characterized and designated TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). In the present study, human TNF, which activates TNFR1 but not TNFR2 in rodent cells (41Barbara J.A. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Ostade X.V. Vandenable P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression and protected hippocampal neurons against hypoxia- and NO-induced cytotoxicity. TNFR1 is linked to a signal transduction pathway involving a sphingomyelinase that induces release of ceramide, which then results in activation of the transcription factor NFκB (42Kolesnick R. Golde D,W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). We here demonstrated that TNF-α induced NFκB activity in cultured hippocampal neurons as determined by gel shift assay, in agreement with a previous report by Mattson et al. (43Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Our experiments using Ad5IκB showed that inhibition of NFκB activation completely abolished the neuroprotective effect and inhibited the induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression in TNF-treated cells. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect and up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression induced by TNF are mediated by activation of NFκB.The relation between NFκB and apoptosis was elucidated recently by studies demonstrating that inhibition of NFκB, either by the IκB super repressor (8Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 9Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar) or in Rel A (p65) knock-out cells (44Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar), results in increased apoptosis. Contrary to these reports, it has been shown that NFκB activation induces apoptosis in certain cells (45Bessho R. Matsubara K. Kubota M. Kuwakado K. Hirota H. Wakazono Y. Lin Y.W. Okuda A. Kawai M. Nishikomori R. Heike T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1883-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 46Abbadie C. Kabrun N. Bouali F. Smardova J. Stehelin D. Vandenbunder B. Enrietto P.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 899-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) including bone marrow cells and leukemia cells. It is not known at present if NFκB activation is involved in promoting apoptosis in some cells and if it is responsible for preventing apoptosis in other cells. Regarding neuronal cells, it has been reported that activation of NFκB protected hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, using κB decoy DNA approach (43Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and that inhibition of NFκB in PC12 cells by exposure to κB decoy DNA or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate induced apoptosis that could not be prevented by nerve growth factor (47Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These findings, together with our present observations, indicate that the NFκB signaling cascade is closely involved in prevention of apoptosis in neuronal cells.Based on our current understanding of the roles of NFκB activation in the regulation of apoptosis, gene expression of proteins that exert anti-apoptotic effects may be involved. We demonstrated here that up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression induced by TNF is completely inhibited by IκB super repressor, indicating that Bcl-2 and Bcl-x are among the gene targets of NFκB. The bcl-2and bcl-x genes have complex structures, and the promoters have not been well characterized. Recently, the presence of NFκB site has been demonstrated in the promoters of human bcl-2 andbcl-x (48Dixon E.P. Stephenson D.T. Clemens J.A. Little S.P. Brain Res. 1997; 776: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression that we have observed to be mediated by NFκB in neurons is probably related to an analogous site in the rat bcl-2 andbcl-x promoter, respectively.In addition to bcl-2 and bcl-x, expression of other genes may be induced by TNF through NFκB activation. Recently, it has been reported that the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase is induced by TNF, which is abolished by κB decoy DNA, in hippocampal neurons (43Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the present study, the neuroprotective effect of TNF was blocked more potently by IκB super repressor than by antisense ODN against bcl-2 andbcl-x, in both of which TNF-induced up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression was completely blocked. This suggests that other proteins that exert a cytoprotective effect may be induced by NFκB activation in TNF-treated neurons.In summary, our findings demonstrated that induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression through NFκB activation is involved in the neuroprotective effect of TNF. In addition, our finding that inhibition of NFκB activation by expression of a mutant form of IκB more potently abolishes the neuroprotective effect of TNF than inhibition of TNF-induced up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression by the antisense ODN suggests that other genes responsible for anti-apoptotic activity are induced by NFκB activation. Identification of the genes will certainly help to understand the regulation of neuronal survival and to design new therapeutic strategies for acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by increased levels of a variety of inflammatory cytokines. Among them, the role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 1The abbreviations used are:TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Ad, adenovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; NO, nitric oxide; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; TNFR2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotides.1The abbreviations used are:TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Ad, adenovirus; HA, hemagglutinin; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; NO, nitric oxide; NFκB, nuclear factor κB; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; SNP, sodium nitroprusside; TNFR1, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; TNFR2, tumor necrosis factor receptor 2; ANOVA, analysis of variance; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotides.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 2Bruce A.J. Boling W. Kindy M.S. Peschon J. Kraemer P.J. Carpenter M.K. Holtsberg F.W. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Cell culture studies have shown that TNF can protect cultured neurons against glucose deprivation-induced injury and excitatory amino acid toxicity, by stabilizing intracellular calcium concentration (1Cheng B. Christakos S. Mattson M.P. Neuron. 1994; 12: 139-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments using mice deficient in TNF receptors demonstrated that endogenous TNF protects neurons against ischemic and excitotoxic insults, with induction of an antioxidative pathway (2Bruce A.J. Boling W. Kindy M.S. Peschon J. Kraemer P.J. Carpenter M.K. Holtsberg F.W. Mattson M.P. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms by which TNF protects neurons are largely unknown. Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that is activated by a variety of cytokines including TNF (3Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 649-681Crossref Scopus (5540) Google Scholar) and is thought to be a key regulator of genes involved in inflammation, response to infection, and stress. Conventional NFκB is a heterodimer that consists of p50 and p65 subunits. The activity of NFκB is strictly regulated by one of the IκB inhibitory proteins, such as IκBα or IκBβ, which forms a complex with NFκB and keeps NFκB in the cytoplasm (3Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 4Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 649-681Crossref Scopus (5540) Google Scholar). When cells receive signals that activate NFκB, IκBs are phosphorylated and degraded through a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway (5Baeurle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Coincident with IκB degradation, activated NFκB translocates to the nucleus and participates in the transactivation of a variety of genes, including genes for inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and cell adhesion molecules (5Baeurle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Recently, dominant negative mutations of IκBα that are not phosphorylated and therefore not proteolyzed have been reported (6Brockmann J.A. Scherr D.C. McKinsy T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Le W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Traenckner E.B.M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). One such protein is a mutant IκBα that contains serine-to-alanine mutations at amino acids 32 and 36, which inhibit signal-induced phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation of IκBα. This form of mutant IκB has been used to demonstrate that inhibition of NFκB induces apoptosis through a variety of cancer agents (8Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 9Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar). Several pathways are emerging that depend on external stimuli to signal key molecules in the induction or the prevention of apoptosis. One such pathway is regulated by the expression of the proto-oncogenebcl-2 family, whose members include bcl-2,bcl-x, and bax. Bcl-2 is an intracellular protein that localizes to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and the nuclear envelope (10Monaghan P. Robertson D. Amos T.A.S. Dyer M.J.S. Mason D.Y. Greaves M.F. J.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to enhance cell survival by inhibiting apoptosis under diverse conditions in a variety of cell types (12Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar, 13Hockenbery D.M. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schriber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J.

Cell. 1991; 67: 879-888Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). The bcl-x gene also functions to regulate cell death. Bcl-x transcripts are alternatively spliced into a long and short form or a form lacking the transmembrane domain (15Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nunez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2912) Google Scholar, 16Fang W. Rivard J.J. Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4388-4398PubMed Google Scholar). The long form (bcl-x L) suppresses cell death, whereas the short form (bcl-x S) acts directly as a dominant interfering bcl-2 and bcl-x L antagonist, favoring apoptosis (15Boise L.H.

Mueller D.L. Behrens T.W. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4388-4398PubMed Google Scholar). Bax forms a dimer with Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL and prevents the death repressor activity of these anti-apoptotic proteins (17Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Iries S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E.

Graham S.H. Nakayama M. Zhu R.L. Jin K. Stetler A. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) brain injury. On the other hand, Bax expression is increased in degenerating neurons in the ischemic brain (22Isenmann S. Stoll G. Schroeter M. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bahr M. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which expression of thebcl-2 family members is controlled is unknown.

Cell. 1993; 75: 899-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) including bone marrow cells and leukemia cells. It is not known at present if NFκB activation is involved in promoting apoptosis in some cells and if it is responsible for preventing apoptosis in other cells. Regarding neuronal cells, it has been reported that activation of NFκB protected hippocampal neurons against oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, using κB decoy DNA approach (43Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and that inhibition of NFκB in PC12 cells by exposure to κB decoy DNA or pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate induced apoptosis that could not be prevented by nerve growth factor (47Taglialatela G. Robinson R. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These findings, together with our present observations, indicate that the NFκB signaling cascade is closely involved in prevention of apoptosis in neuronal cells.Based on our current understanding of the roles of NFκB activation in the regulation of apoptosis, gene expression of proteins that exert anti-apoptotic effects may be involved. We demonstrated here that up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression induced by TNF is completely inhibited by IκB super repressor, indicating that Bcl-2 and Bcl-x are among the gene targets of NFκB. The bcl-2and bcl-x genes have complex structures, and the promoters have not been well characterized. Recently, the presence of NFκB site has been demonstrated in the promoters of human bcl-2 andbcl-x (48Dixon E.P. Stephenson D.T. Clemens J.A. Little S.P. Brain Res. 1997; 776: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression that we have observed to be mediated by NFκB in neurons is probably related to an analogous site in the rat bcl-2 andbcl-x promoter, respectively.In addition to bcl-2 and bcl-x, expression of other genes may be induced by TNF through NFκB activation. Recently, it has been reported that the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase is induced by TNF, which is abolished by κB decoy DNA, in hippocampal neurons (43Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the present study, the neuroprotective effect of TNF was blocked more potently by IκB super repressor than by antisense ODN against bcl-2 andbcl-x, in both of which TNF-induced up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression was completely blocked. This suggests that other proteins that exert a cytoprotective effect may be induced by NFκB activation in TNF-treated neurons.In summary, our findings demonstrated that induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression through NFκB activation is involved in the neuroprotective effect of TNF. In addition, our finding that inhibition of NFκB activation by expression of a mutant form of IκB more potently abolishes the neuroprotective effect of TNF than inhibition of TNF-induced up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression by the antisense ODN suggests that other genes responsible for anti-apoptotic activity are induced by NFκB activation. Identification of the genes will certainly help to understand the regulation of neuronal survival and to design new therapeutic strategies for acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated that overexpression of Bcl-2 in neurons can prevent or delay cell death induced by a variety of stimuliin vitro (37Garcia I. Martinou I. Tsujimoto Y. Martinou J.C. Science. 1992; 258: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 38Allsopp T.E. Wyatt S. Paterson H.F Davies A.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 295-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) and in vivo (19Dubois-Dauphin M. Frankowski H. Tsujimoto Y. Huarte J. Martinou J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3309-3313Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 20Martinou J.C. Dubois-Dauphin M. Staple J.K. Rodriguez I. Frankowski H. Missotten M. Albertini P. Talabot D. Catsicas S. Pietra C. Huarte J. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1017-1030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Bcl-xL also protects sympathetic neurons from apoptosis induced by nerve growth factor deprivation (39Frankowski H. Missotten M. Fernandez P.A. Martinou I. Michel P. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1919-1921Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In addition, we previously showed decreased levels of Bcl-2 expression in hypoxia- and nitric oxide-induced neuronal apoptosis (35Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Nunez G. Tohyama M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Tohyama M. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 58: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcl-2 and Bcl-x are induced primarily in neurons destined to survive following focal ischemia (22Isenmann S. Stoll G. Schroeter M. Krajewski S. Reed J.C. Bahr M. Brain Pathol. 1998; 8: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and global ischemia (21Chen J. Graham S.H. Nakayama M. Zhu R.L. Jin K. Stetler A. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the endogenous levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x regulate neuronal survival. Our present data demonstrated that TNF protects neurons against hypoxia- and nitric oxide-induced toxicity and up-regulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression. Pretreatment of neurons with Bcl-2 or Bcl-x antisense ODN which inhibits up-regulation of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x expression, respectively, significantly inhibits the neuroprotective effect induced by TNF, indicating that either Bcl-2 and Bcl-x induction is involved in the neuroprotective action of this cytokine. Simultaneous addition of both the antisense ODN, which inhibits up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression, seems to additively but not synergistically inhibit TNF-induced neuroprotection. Evidence taken from previous studies suggests that Bax actively promotes cell death, unless it is bound by either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (17Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Iries S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.C. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 94: 5113-5118Google Scholar, 18Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). Thus, the ratio of Bax to Bcl-2 and Bcl-x seems to be critical for cell survival. Therefore, TNF-induced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x might antagonize the pro-apoptotic function of Bax, whose expression was unchanged by TNF. Moreover, the present finding that overexpression of Bcl-2 protects neurons supports this anti-apoptotic protein as a critical factor for neuronal protection against hypoxia- or nitric oxide-induced injury. Production of TNF has been investigated in an ischemic brain injury model (40Uno H. Matsuyama T. Akita H. Nishimura H. Sugita M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Matab. 1997; 17: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), in which the cytokine is rapidly synthesized in the brain. Enhanced expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x has also been documented in neurons that are destined to survive after ischemic brain injury (21Chen J. Graham S.H. Nakayama M. Zhu R.L. Jin K. Stetler A. Simon R.P. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1997; 17: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be that TNF produced by resident brain cells up-regulates Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression in neurons and thereby protects them from ischemic injury. Most cells including neurons express specific receptors for TNF. Two receptors have been characterized and designated TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2). In the present study, human TNF, which activates TNFR1 but not TNFR2 in rodent cells (41Barbara J.A. Smith W.B. Gamble J.R. Ostade X.V. Vandenable P. Tavernier J. Fiers W. Vadas M.A. Lopez A.F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression and protected hippocampal neurons against hypoxia- and NO-induced cytotoxicity. TNFR1 is linked to a signal transduction pathway involving a sphingomyelinase that induces release of ceramide, which then results in activation of the transcription factor NFκB (42Kolesnick R. Golde D,W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). We here demonstrated that TNF-α induced NFκB activity in cultured hippocampal neurons as determined by gel shift assay, in agreement with a previous report by Mattson et al. (43Mattson M.P. Goodman Y. Luo H. Fu W. Furukawa K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 49: 681-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Our experiments using Ad5IκB showed that inhibition of NFκB activation completely abolished the neuroprotective effect and inhibited the induction of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression in TNF-treated cells. These results indicate that the neuroprotective effect and up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x expression induced by TNF are mediated by activation of NFκB. The relation between NFκB and apoptosis was elucidated recently by studies demonstrating that inhibition of NFκB, either by the IκB super repressor (8Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 9Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar), results in increased apoptosis. Contrary to these reports, it has been shown that NFκB activation induces apoptosis in certain cells (45Bessho R. Matsubara K. Kubota M. Kuwakado K. Hirota H. Wakazono Y. Lin Y.W. Okuda A. Kawai M.

https://openalex.org/W1978679499,"The role of localized instability of the actin network in specifying axonal fate was examined with the use of rat hippocampal neurons in culture. During normal neuronal development, actin dynamics and instability polarized to a single growth cone before axon formation. Consistently, global application of actin-depolymerizing drugs and of the Rho-signaling inactivator toxin B to nonpolarized cells produced neurons with multiple axons. Moreover, disruption of the actin network in one individual growth cone induced its neurite to become the axon. Thus, local instability of the actin network restricted to a single growth cone is a physiological signal specifying neuronal polarization."

Thus, the characteristic activities of caspase-9 are context-dependent, and its activation may not recapitulate conventional caspase activation mechanisms. To explore this hypothesis we produced recombinant forms of procaspase-9 containing mutations that disabled one or both of the interdomain processing sites of the zymogen. These mutants were able to activate downstream caspases, but only in the presence of cytosolic factors. The mutant with both processing sites abolished had 10% of the activity of wild-type, and was able to support apoptosis, with equal vigor to wild-type, when transiently expressed in 293 cells. Thus caspase-9 has an unusually active zymogen that does not require proteolytic processing, but instead is dependent on cytosolic factors for expression of its activity.

Apoptosis, the ordered dismantling of animal cells that results in their death and removal from the organism, requires specific proteolysis of a subset of cellular proteins, mediated by caspases. Many apoptotic responses are initiated by activation of the apical caspases-8 or -9; the former by recruitment to ligated cell surface receptors belonging to tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 family (1Boldin M.P.

Activation of either of these two initiator caspases can lead to activation of the executioner caspase-3 (casp-3), by direct proteolysis of the casp-3 precursor (4Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar, 5Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Indeed all caspase zymogens are thought to be activated by limited proteolysis within a linker segment which results in generation of the characteristic large and small subunits of the catalytically active enzyme. Thus it has been specifically demonstrated that casp-1, -3, -7, and -8 gain marked increases in activity after proteolytic processing (6Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T.

As pointed out by Neurath (10Neurath H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the zymogens are stored in an inactive form to prevent adventitious proteolysis before it is needed at the required site of action. Frequently protease zymogens are activated by other proteases, in a cascade mechanism that results in either amplification or localization to specific sites. There are few exceptions to the rule that zymogen activation requires proteolysis, and these exceptional zymogens, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), usually have specific allosteric modulators that allow them to become active at the required site, without proteolysis.The initiator casp-8 has some of these exceptional properties. Casp-8 initiates apoptotic signaling induced by specific ligation of death receptors (reviewed in Refs. 11Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar and 12Ware C.F. Santee S. Glass A. Thomson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press Ltd., San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Recruitment of procasp-8 to the cytosolic face of ligated Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 results in its autoactivation by a mechanism involving clustering of zymogen molecules (9Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The zymogen possesses ∼1% of the activity of the activated enzyme, and it is hypothesized that this small amount of activity of the zymogen is sufficient to drive cleavage of clustered casp-8 zymogen molecules to the active form. Thus casp-8 has a zymogenicity ratio of 100 (defined as the ratio of the activity of the enzyme to the zymogen). Nevertheless, proteolysis of the casp-8 zymogen is thought to be required for its activation (9Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).In light of the casp-8 activation studies, it has been hypothesized that the initiator caspases, including caspases-8 and -9 (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) andCaenorhabditis elegans CED-3, share a common mechanism of activation (15Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This would require clustering zymogens that possess a small amount of activity in their single chain forms, with production of the active protease dependent on proteolytic processing of the zymogen. In turn, this would mean that preventing proteolysis of the zymogen in the interdomain linker should inactivate apoptotic signal transmission. We tested this hypothesis for casp-9 by utilizing a cell-free system (16Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar) that allows dissection of the requirements for zymogen activation.

As pointed out by Neurath (10Neurath H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the zymogens are stored in an inactive form to prevent adventitious proteolysis before it is needed at the required site of action. Frequently protease zymogens are activated by other proteases, in a cascade mechanism that results in either amplification or localization to specific sites. There are few exceptions to the rule that zymogen activation requires proteolysis, and these exceptional zymogens, such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), usually have specific allosteric modulators that allow them to become active at the required site, without proteolysis. The initiator casp-8 has some of these exceptional properties. Casp-8 initiates apoptotic signaling induced by specific ligation of death receptors (reviewed in Refs. 11Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar and 12Ware C.F. Santee S. Glass A. Thomson A. The Cytokine Handbook. 3rd Ed. Academic Press Ltd., San Diego, CA1998Google Scholar). Recruitment of procasp-8 to the cytosolic face of ligated Fas or tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 results in its autoactivation by a mechanism involving clustering of zymogen molecules (9Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The zymogen possesses ∼1% of the activity of the activated enzyme, and it is hypothesized that this small amount of activity of the zymogen is sufficient to drive cleavage of clustered casp-8 zymogen molecules to the active form. Thus casp-8 has a zymogenicity ratio of 100 (defined as the ratio of the activity of the enzyme to the zymogen). Nevertheless, proteolysis of the casp-8 zymogen is thought to be required for its activation (9Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 13Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 319-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In light of the casp-8 activation studies, it has been hypothesized that the initiator caspases, including caspases-8 and -9 (14Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar) andCaenorhabditis elegans CED-3, share a common mechanism of activation (15Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This would require clustering zymogens that possess a small amount of activity in their single chain forms, with production of the active protease dependent on proteolytic processing of the zymogen. In turn, this would mean that preventing proteolysis of the zymogen in the interdomain linker should inactivate apoptotic signal transmission. We tested this hypothesis for casp-9 by utilizing a cell-free system (16Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4433) Google Scholar) that allows dissection of the requirements for zymogen activation.

Sequence data of 18 S ribosomal DNA genes from non–fast evolving species of acoels and other metazoans reveal that this group does not belong to the Platyhelminthes but represents the extant members of the earliest divergent Bilateria, an interpretation that is supported by recent studies on the embryonic cleavage pattern and nervous system of acoels. This study has implications for understanding the evolution of major body plans, and for perceptions of the Cambrian evolutionary explosion."

The gadolinium oxide film has a cubic structure isomorphic to manganese oxide and is (110)-oriented in single domain on the (100) gallium arsenide surface. The gadolinium oxide film has a dielectric constant of approximately 10, with low leakage current densities of about 10 –9 to 10 –10 amperes per square centimeter at zero bias. Typical breakdown field is 4 megavolts per centimeter for an oxide film 185 angstroms thick and 10 megavolts per centimeter for an oxide 45 angstroms thick. Both accumulation and inversion layers were observed in the gadolinium oxide–gallium arsenide metal oxide semiconductor diodes, using capacitance-voltage measurements. The ability to grow thin single-crystal oxide films on gallium arsenide with a low interfacial density of states has great potential impact on the electronic industry of compound semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2021896470,"Prion propagation involves the conversion of cellular prion protein (PrP C ) into a disease-specific isomer, PrP Sc , shifting from a predominantly α-helical to β-sheet structure. Here, conditions were established in which recombinant human PrP could switch between the native α conformation, characteristic of PrP C , and a compact, highly soluble, monomeric form rich in β structure. The soluble β form (β-PrP) exhibited partial resistance to proteinase K digestion, characteristic of PrP Sc , and was a direct precursor of fibrillar structures closely similar to those isolated from diseased brains. The conversion of PrP C to β-PrP in suitable cellular compartments, and its subsequent stabilization by intermolecular association, provide a molecular mechanism for prion propagation."
https://openalex.org/W2170466742,"Tomographic imaging indicates that slabs of subducted lithosphere can sink deep into Earth's lower mantle. The view that convective flow is stratified at 660-kilometer depth and preserves a relatively pristine lower mantle is therefore not tenable. However, a range of geophysical evidence indicates that compositionally distinct, hence convectively isolated, mantle domains may exist in the bottom 1000 kilometers of the mantle. Survival of these domains, which are perhaps related to local iron enrichment and silicate-to-oxide transformations, implies that mantle convection is more complex than envisaged by conventional end-member flow models."
https://openalex.org/W2008543045,"It is shown that in the low-temperature (0.37 kelvin) environment of superfluid helium droplets, long-range dipole-dipole forces acting between two polar molecules can result in the self-assembly of noncovalently bonded linear chains. At this temperature the effective range of these forces is on the nanometer scale, making them important in the growth of nanoscale structures. In particular, the self-assembly of exclusively linear hydrogen cyanide chains is observed, even when the folded structures are energetically favored. This suggests a design strategy for the growth of new nanoscale oligomers composed of monomers with defined dipole (or higher order) moment directions."
https://openalex.org/W1978701756,"Recent evidence indicates that nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a transcription factor critically important for immune and inflammatory responses, is activated by a protein kinase cascade. The essential features of this cascade are that a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) activates an IκB kinase (IKK) that site-specifically phosphorylates IκB. The IκB protein, which ordinarily sequesters NF-κB in the cytoplasm, is subsequently degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, thereby allowing the nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Thus far, only two MAP3Ks, NIK and MEKK1, have been identified that can activate this pathway. We now show that MEKK2 and MEKK3 can in vivoactivate IKK-α and IKK-β, induce site-specific IκBα phosphorylation, and, relatively modestly, activate an NF-κB reporter gene. In addition, dominant negative versions of either IKK-α or IKK-β abolish NF-κB activation induced by MEKK2 or MEKK3, thereby providing evidence that these IKKs mediate the NF-κB-inducing activities of these MEKKs. In contrast, other MAP3Ks, including MEKK4, ASK1, and MLK3, fail to show evidence of activation of the NF-κB pathway. We conclude that a distinct subset of MAP3Ks can activate NF-κB.

NF-κB, prototypically a heterodimer of p50 and p65 subunits, is sequestered in the cytoplasm of most cell types by virtue of its association with a family of inhibitor molecules, the IκBs. Upon exposure to a wide variety of agents, including the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, lipopolysaccharide, oxidative stress, and the HTLV-I Tax protein, the IκB protein is phosphorylated at its N terminus. In the case of IκBα, the most extensively studied IκB isoform, this phosphorylation occurs at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (3Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U.

The initial indications were that the IKK complex can be activated in vitro by the MAP3K MEKK1 (MAPK/ERK kinase kinase 1) (7Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) and that the complex, activated either in vitro by MEKK1 or in vivo by exposure of cells to TNF-α can be inactivated by phosphatase treatment (7Lee F.S.

Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). Additional work then demonstrated that (i) mutation of potential phosphoacceptor residues to alanine in the activation loop of IKK-α or IKK-β abrogated activity (12Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Therefore, an important conceptual advance in our understanding of NF-κB regulation is that it can be activated by protein kinase cascade, the core elements of this cascade being a MAP3K and an IKK (7Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 10Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M.

Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). These findings have already begun to provide a framework for understanding how NF-κB can be activated by diverse stimuli. For example, compelling evidence has been presented to show that NIK mediates the NF-κB-inducing activity of TNF-α (17Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V. Wallach D. Nature. 1997; 385: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 18Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These findings moreover raise the possibility that yet other MAP3Ks might activate NF-κB. MAP3Ks were originally identified as components of signaling cascades in which a MAP3K phosphorylates and activates a MAP2K, which in turn phosphorylates and activates a MAPK; the latter include the mitogen-activated ERK and the stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK, also known as stress-activated protein kinase) and p38 families (19Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar).

As shown in Fig.1 A, under conditions where overexpression of the positive controls MEKK1 and NIK induces activation of the NF-κB reporter gene, overexpression of MEKK3 (as reported previously; Ref. 31Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Brown K. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2668-2674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and, to a lesser extent, MEKK2 induces activation as well. ΔMEKK4, ASK1, and MLK3 did not induce activation in either these cells (Fig. 1 A) or the murine fibroblast cell line L929 (data not shown) but as expected did induce robust activation of coexpressed JNK1 in HeLa cells (data not shown). NIK and MEKK1 activate NF-κB by inducing the site-specific phosphorylation of IκB. In the case of IκBα, this phosphorylation, which occurs at Ser-32 and Ser-36, is manifested by slower mobility when IκBα is examined by SDS-PAGE (3Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 4Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Hall S.M. McKinsey T.A. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether MEKK2 and MEKK3 might act through the same mechanism, HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression vectors for Flag-tagged wild-type or phosphorylation-defective (S32A/S36A) IκBα and expression vectors for MEKK2, MEKK3, or empty expression vector. The Flag-tagged IκBα was then immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies and examined by Western blotting with anti-IκBα antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 B, MEKK2 and MEKK3 both induce the appearance of a more slowly migrating IκBα species (top panel, lanes 3 and 5, upper bands) that is abolished when an S32A/S36A IκBα mutant is examined (lanes 4 and 6), consistent with this species being N-terminally phosphorylated IκBα. ΔMEKK4, ASK1, and MLK3 did not induce the appearance of this more slowly migrating species (data not shown). This IκBα species was examined further by reprobing this blot with antibodies specific for phospho-Ser-32 IκBα. As shown in Fig. 1 B (bottom panel,lanes 3 and 5), the slower migrating IκBα species induced by MEKK2 or MEKK3 is immunoreactive with these antibodies. We conclude that MEKK2 and MEKK3 can induce site-specific, N-terminal phosphorylation of IκBα in vivo. Both MEKK1 and NIK induce site-specific phosphorylation of IκB by activating IKK-α and IKK-β. To examine whether MEKK2 or MEKK3 acts by the same mechanism, HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for Flag-tagged IKK-α, IKK-β, or JNK1 and expression constructs for MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, NIK, or MLK3. The IKK or JNK was then immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag antibodies, and the kinase activities of the immunoprecipitated proteins were measured by using as substrates GST fused to the N terminii of IκBα (residues 5–55) or c-Jun (residues 1–79), respectively, in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 2, (A andB, top panels), not only do MEKK1 (lane 2) and NIK (lane 5) activate IKK-α and IKK-β activity, as reported previously (10Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z.

Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), but MEKK2 and MEKK3 do so as well (lanes 3 and 4). Immunoblot analysis reveals comparable IKK expression levels (Fig. 2, Aand B, lower panels). Furthermore, the MEKK2- or MEKK3-activated IKK-α and IKK-β display the expected substrate specificity, because a S32A/S36A double mutation in the IκBα substrate abolishes phosphorylation of the latter (data not shown). As a negative control, MLK3 does not significantly activate either IKK but does activate JNK (Fig. 2, A, B, andC, upper panels, lane 6) as expected (28Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19025-19028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). ASK1 and ΔMEKK4 likewise activate JNK but neither IKK-α nor IKK-β (data not shown). NIK, in contrast, activates both IKKs but not JNK (Fig. 2, A, B, and C, upper panels, lane 5) as reported previously (14Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 18Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The potencies of MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, and NIK in activating IKK-α, IKK-β, or an NF-κB reporter gene were analyzed in more detail (Fig.3). All four MAP3Ks induce dose-dependent increases in the activities of coexpressed IKK-α or IKK-β. In the case of coexpressed IKK-α, the dose response curves are roughly comparable (Fig. 3 A; see also Fig. 2 A). In the case of coexpressed IKK-β, NIK is a somewhat less potent activator than the other MAP3Ks (Fig.3 B). In contrast, NIK is a substantially more potent activator of an NF-κB reporter gene than the other three MAP3Ks (Fig.3 C). For example, the NF-κB reporter gene activity induced by 40 ng of NIK expression vector is comparable or even greater than that induced by 4000 ng of expression vector for either MEKK1, MEKK2, or MEKK3. The experiments described above indicate that MEKK2 and MEKK3 can activate both IKK-α and IKK-β in vivo. To examine whether this activation is functionally significant, HeLa cells were cotransfected with expression constructs for MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, or empty expression vector, expression constructs for dominant negative, catalytically inactive IKK-α (K44A), IKK-β (K44A), or empty expression vector, and an NF-κB reporter gene. As shown in Fig.4, under conditions where activation of the NF-κB reporter gene induced by MEKK1 is almost completely inhibited by dominant negative IKK-α or dominant negative IKK-β (13Nakano H. Shindo M. Sakon S. Nishinaka S. Mihara M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3537-3542Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 14Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), that induced by either MEKK2 and MEKK3 is completely abolished. This therefore provides evidence that IKK-α and IKK-β mediate the NF-κB inducing activity of MEKK2 and MEKK3. Here we identify two additional, previously cloned MAP3Ks: MEKK2 and MEKK3, which now join NIK and MEKK1 as activators of IKK and NF-κB, thereby enlarging our framework for understanding NF-κB activation. Such knowledge is essential to providing a foundation for understanding how NF-κB can be activated by such a wide variety of stimuli. That a distinct subset of NF-κB-inducing MAP3Ks exists is highlighted by the fact that other MAP3Ks identified as activators of the JNK and/or p38 pathways, such as MEKK4, ASK1, and MLK3, fail to activate NF-κB. Titration experiments reveal that MEKK2 and MEKK3 are comparable in potency to NIK in activating coexpressed IKK-α or IKK-β but are substantially less potent than NIK in activating an NF-κB reporter gene (Fig. 3). Possible factors that might contribute to this apparent discrepancy include the following: (i) MEKK2 and MEKK3 might activate intracellular pathways that inhibit the NF-κB pathway and therefore could be relatively less effective in activating an NF-κB reporter gene; (ii) NIK might activate other components of the NF-κB pathway besides IKK and thus could be relatively more potent in activating an NF-κB reporter gene; and (iii) overexpressed IKK might respond less sensitively than endogenous IKK to coexpressed MAP3K and therefore might not accurately reflect activation of the NF-κB pathway (33Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In any case, relative potencies in transient overexpression assays cannot be used as the sole criterion for assessing physiologic significance. A particularly pertinent example is provided by the fact the HTLV-I protein Tax activates NF-κB through MEKK1 (15Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M. Gaynor R. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) despite the fact that this MAP3K, like MEKK2 or MEKK3, is substantially less potent than NIK in activating an NF-κB reporter gene (14Lee F.S. Peters R.T. Dang L.C. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9319-9324Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 18Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Ayres T.M. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). MEKK2 and MEKK3, like other MAP3Ks, contain both catalytic and noncatalytic domains. The catalytic domains of MEKK2 and MEKK3 share 96% homology, consistent with the fact that both can activate NF-κB, whereas their noncatalytic domains are 65% homologous (20Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliot E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). MEKK2 is activated by treatment of cells by epidermal growth factor (34Fanger G.R. Johnson N.L. Johnson G.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4961-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In addition, MEKK2 and MEKK3 bind 14-3-3 proteins, an interaction that is mediated at least in part through their catalytic domains but that does not modulate their JNK-inducing activities (35Fanger G.R. Widmann C. Porter A.C. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3476-3483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Further experimentation will be required to determine the detailed mechanism by which MEKK2 and MEKK3 activate IKK-α and IKK-β. NIK activates IKK-α by inducing phosphorylation of Ser-176 in the activation loop of the latter (16Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-177 and/or Ser-181 in IKK-β is essential for its activity, because a double S176A/S181A mutation abolishes activity (12Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar). Therefore, MEKK2 and MEKK3 might directly phosphorylate these IKK residues, particularly because these residues are components of canonical MAP2K activation loop motifs (SXXXS) (12Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar) that might be predicted to be substrates for MAP3Ks. It is worth noting, however, that definitive experimental evidence that either NIK or MEKK1 directly induce IKK-α or IKK-β catalytic activity has yet to be reported. The fact that many MAP3Ks have the capacity to activate distinct pathways now raises the problem of how specificity in signaling pathways is achieved. One example of this is provided by the observation that Tax activates MEKK1 and induces potent NF-κB activity (15Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S. Mercurio F. Barbosa M. Cobb M. Gaynor R. Cell. 1998; 93: 875-884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) but only modest JNK activity (15Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T. Xu S.

Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Thus, the relative capacities of a MAP3K to activate distinct signaling pathways may be modulated in a manner that is stimulus-specific. We are grateful to Drs.

TNF itself was originally identified as an activity that degrades blood vessels within solid tumors, thereby causing necrotic death by hypoxia, a phenomenon called hemorrhagic necrosis (12Carswell E.A.

Blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells that play a role in modulation of blood pressure, immune function, and inflammation. Proliferation of endothelial cells is one step in the multi-step process of angiogenesis, the mechanism by which blood vessels are formed. Not surprisingly, major inducers of angiogenesis in vivo, such as Vascular EndothelialGrowth Factor (VEGF) and basicFibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), also promote proliferation of cultured endothelial cells (13Rusnati M.

Recently, agonistic antibodies to FAS, a member of the family of TNF receptors, have been shown to induce capillary formation in vivo, although this effect was heparin dependent, implicating a requirement for heparin-binding growth factors; no direct effects on cultured endothelial cells were reported (28Biancone L. Martino A.D. Orlandi V. Conaldi P.G. Toniolo A. Camussi G. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, data presented here support the hypothesis that a recently discovered TNF ligand family member, TWEAK, is a direct inducer of angiogenesis by the dual criteria that 1) picomolar concentrations of TWEAK promote proliferation of normal endothelial cells in tissue culture and that 2) TWEAK induces angiogenesis in an in vivo rat cornea model with potency similar to bFGF and VEGF. Normal human aortic endothelial cells, normalHuman Umbilical VeinEndothelial Cells (HUVEC), normalHuman Dermal MicrovasculatureEndothelial Cells (HMVEC-d), AorticSmooth Muscle Cells (AOSMC), and neonatal Normal Human DermalFibroblasts (NHDF-neo) were obtained from Clonetics Corp. (San Diego, CA). Normal human brain microvasculature endothelial cells were obtained from Applied Cell Biology Research Institute (Kirkland, WA). Basal media and growth factor supplements were purchased from Clonetics Corp. and used as recommended by the manufacturer. All endothelial cells, except HMVEC-d, were grown in endothelial base medium containing the following growth factors and supplements: bovine brain extract, hydrocortisone, and 2% fetal bovine serum. HMVEC-d were cultured in endothelial base-2 medium containing the following growth factors and supplements: hydrocortisone, bFGF, VEGF, R3-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, heparin, and EGF with 10% fetal bovine serum. AOSMC were grown in smooth muscle base medium containing bFGF, EGF, dexamethasone, and 5% fetal bovine serum, and NHDF-neo were grown in fibroblast base medium containing insulin, FGF, and 2% serum. Cells were trypsinized and seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 1500 cells per well into medium with reduced serum and growth factors. Media for endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts were, respectively, endothelial base medium with bovine brain extract and 1% serum, smooth muscle base medium 3 with 0.5% FGF and 0.5% serum, and fibroblast base medium with FGF and 1% serum. Indicated factors were added at the time of cell seeding. Rabbit anti-human VEGF neutralizing antibodies were purchased from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ) and incubated with the indicated factors 30 min prior to cell seeding. After incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 5 days in a humidified chamber, cell density was determined by replacing the medium with 100 μl of 0.4 μm calcein AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) in medium lacking serum. Diesterase activity was measured by fluorescence in a cytofluor 2300 system (Millipore, Bedford MA) using an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm. Unless otherwise indicated, each data point represents the average value over four wells with standard deviation between the wells used to create error bars. Photographs were taken at ×100 magnification on a microscope with a mercury light source filtered through an excitation filter of 450–490 nm with 520 nm emission. Soluble TWEAK protein was engineered as follows. The leader sequence from the UL4 protein of cytomegalovirus (amino acids 1–27) followed by a synthetic octapeptide FLAG epitope (29Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V.L. Liggy R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L,. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar) and the extracellular domain of human TWEAK (amino acids 98–249) were placed in the pcDNA3 expression plasmid multiple cloning site (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This construct was used to create a stably expressing clone in Chinese hamster ovary cells by selection with G418 from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). 500 ml of conditioned medium from this clone was incubated with 500 μl of M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Kodak, Rochester, NY) overnight at 4 °C on a rotator wheel. Beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm MgCl2. TWEAK was eluted in 1 ml of 1 mm FLAG peptide (Kodak, Rochester, NY) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm MgCl2to remove FLAG peptide. The apparent molecular mass of the resulting protein as calculated by SDS-PAGE analysis was approximately 24 kDa, which is somewhat larger than the predicted molecular mass of 18 kDa after cleavage of the signal peptide. The concentration of the purified protein was estimated to be 500 μg/ml based onA 280 nm measurement. RNase protection assays were performed by PharMingen (San Diego, CA) using their RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase protection assay system. Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC treated with 50 ng/ml TNF-α (Collaborative Biomedical, Bedford MA), 50 ng/ml soluble TWEAK, or left untreated for 9 h with RNAeasy (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). RNA samples were subjected to RNase protection analysis using the human angiogenesis multiprobe set (catalog number 45606P), which contains templates for the following RNA transcripts: FLT1, FLT4, TIE, thrombin receptor, TIE2, CD31, endoglin, angiopoietin, VEGF, and VEGF-C; and the housekeeping genes L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. RNA was also subjected to analysis using the hCK4 template set (catalog number 45034P) which contains templates for the chemokines IL-3, IL-7, GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-6, SCF, LIF, OSM, and the housekeeping genes L32 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The probes were labeled with [α -32P]UTP using T7 RNA polymerase. 3 × 106 cpm of labeled probe was hybridized to 5 μg of total RNA for 16 h at 56 °C. mRNA probe hybrids were treated with RNase mixture and phenol-chloroform extracted. Protected hybrids were resolved on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel and read on a STORM 860 phosphoimager, and the bands were quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA). TWEAK, bFGF, or VEGF was mixed with equal volumes of 12% hydron (Sigma). Ten μl of the mixture were pipetted into the tip of a sterile Teflon rod. After drying for 1–2 h, the pellets were stored at 4 °C. A small (approximately 2 mm) incision at 1 mm from the center of the cornea was performed on anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Using a curved iris spatula, an intrastromal pocket was made to a distance of 1 mm from the limbus, the circular blood vessels that surround the cornea. A single pellet was implanted, containing the indicated factors. Antibiotic ointment (Neosporin) was applied post-surgery to the operated eye to prevent infection and decrease inflammation. Seven days later, neovascularization was measured through slitlamp biomicroscopy (Nikon NS-1) connected to an image analysis system (Leica QWin). Angiogenesis was calculated by measuring the area of new blood vessels. This experimental protocol was approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. To determine the concentration range in which TWEAK is biologically active, various concentrations of TWEAK were used to treat HMVEC-d cultures. Cells were grown in serum and growth factor-rich medium and then split into medium with reduced serum and growth factors (Fig.1) with or without TWEAK. Under these conditions, cells that were not treated with TWEAK adhered to the plate but did not proliferate and did begin to die at day 2 to 3. Cells that were treated with TWEAK proliferated and continued to grow over the 5-day period of the assay. Similar results were obtained using direct cell counting as a means of quantifying the effect of TWEAK treatment on cell number. Photographs of cells treated with or without 50 ng/ml TWEAK are shown in Fig. 2, Band C, respectively. Although TWEAK was originally identified as an apoptosis-inducing factor, under these conditions TWEAK reduces the serum and growth factor requirements for HMVEC-d proliferation at a concentration which is consistent with that of other angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF. This is not without precedent because other TNF family members such as FAS ligand can either induce apoptosis or proliferation depending upon experimental conditions (30Alderson M.R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2231-2253Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar).Figure 2TWEAK does not increase RNA transcript levels of genes involved in angiogenesis. Five μg of total RNA were subjected to RNase protection analysis using radiolabeled probes for several genes involved in angiogenesis (A) and cytokines (B). Protected fragments were resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. In each panel, lanes labeledA, T, and U indicate samples treated with TNF-α, samples treated with TWEAK, or untreated samples, respectively. Undigested probes are labeled along theleft.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further investigate the activity of TWEAK, several other types of primary cells were tested. HUVEC and three types of microvasculature cells (normal human aortic endothelial cells, human brain microvasculature endothelial cells, and HMVEC-d) were tested along with AOSMC and NHDF-neo. As shown in Table I, TWEAK appears to be active on the endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells tested, but no effect was observed on the dermal fibroblasts. Endothelial and smooth muscle cells are both components of vascular tissue and have similar basal growth requirements. They are highly responsive to serum, and respond to some of the same growth factors, such as EGF (31Carpenter G. Wahl M. Sporn I.M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors.

However, NHDF-neo cells did not show TWEAK-induced proliferation. This may imply that, like VEGF, TWEAK has some specificity as a vascular growth factor (37Thomas K.A. J. Biol.

Circulation. 1998; 97: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) have been shown to induce expression of VEGF in a variety of cultured cells, which may account in part for their role in angiogenesis. To test whether TWEAK's effect is mediated through induction of other genes involved in angiogenesis, we subjected RNA from HUVEC treated for 9 h with 50 ng/ml of TWEAK, 50 ng/ml of TNF-α or untreated to RNase protection analysis with probes for various genes involved in angiogenesis. Fig. 2 and Table II show the results of these experiments. Each band was quantified by densitometry and normalized to GAPDH levels (Table II). RNA levels of several of the genes tested were modulated by TNF-α treatment. Cytokines GM-CSF, M-CSF, IL-6, and SCF were up-regulated in TNF-α treated cells. Thrombin receptor transcript levels decreased after TNF-α treatment as described previously (42Conway E.M. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). TWEAK, however, did not appear to significantly alter transcript levels of several genes involved in angiogenesis such as VEGF, either of the VEGF receptors (flt1/VEGFR or Flt4/VEGFR3), angiopoietin, or it's receptor TIE, TIE2, thrombomodulin, endoglin, or CD31. Furthermore, TWEAK did not affect transcript levels of the cytokines tested with the possible exceptions of IL-6 and OSM.Table IITable represents the angiogenesis (Fig. 2A) and the cytokine panels (Fig. 2B)flt1flt4TIEThrombin receptorTIE2CD31EndoglinAngiopVEGFVEGF-CL32GAPDHAngiogenesisTNF-α0.500.640.560.680.840.640.60ND0.77ND0.851.0TWEAK0.921.091.020.970.901.071.05ND1.06ND0.751.0IL3IL7GM-CSFM-CSFIL6SCFLIFOSML32GAPDHCytokineTNF-αNDND20.6010.124.041.77ND1.781.01.0TWEAKNDND2.471.201.660.97ND1.780.901.0Radiolabeled fragments from Fig. 2 were quantified using a STORM860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA).

Open table in a new tab Radiolabeled fragments from Fig. 2 were quantified using a STORM860 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA). The values were normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) levels and are presented as ratio of experimental sample to untreated. To confirm the results of the RNase protection assay, we used VEGF neutralizing antibodies to test whether the proliferative effect of TWEAK is mediated by VEGF. HMVEC cultures were split into reduced serum and growth factor medium supplemented with growth factors and anti-VEGF neutralizing antibodies as indicated. Cell number was quantitated by calcein fluorescence after 5 days. The data in Fig.3 show that while TWEAK and VEGF are both able to stimulate proliferation of HMVEC-d, VEGF neutralizing antibody eliminates VEGF induced proliferation, but does not significantly reduce TWEAK-induced proliferation. The slight decrease in cell number in cultures treated with anti-VEGF antibody and TWEAK as compared with TWEAK alone may reflect the action of endogenous VEGF in the HMVEC sample. The inability of neutralizing antibodies against VEGF to significantly block TWEAK-induced proliferation of HMVEC cells demonstrates that TWEAK-induced proliferation does not require VEGF. Given the proliferative effect of TWEAK on cultured endothelial cells, TWEAK was also tested for its ability to induce angiogenesis in vivoby placing TWEAK-containing pellets in rat corneas and measuring neovascularization after 7 days. Fig.4 A summarizes the effect of pellets coated with the indicated amounts of TWEAK, bFGF, or implanted with vehicle only. These results demonstrate that TWEAK induces neovascularization comparable with that induced by similar concentrations of bFGF. Fig. 4 B shows the results of the analogous experiment comparing TWEAK to VEGF. Again, the ability of the two proteins to induce neovascularization is approximately equivalent. Representative slitlamp micrographs of rat corneas 7 days after implantation of growth factor-free, VEGF-containing, bFGF-containing, and TWEAK-containing pellets are shown in Fig. 4, C,E, D, and F, respectively. The minor winding vessels between the control pellet and the large circular limbus vein surrounding the cornea (Fig. 4 C) are part of the iris and can be distinguished from the straighter vessels of the cornea (Fig. 4, D–F) by their morphology. These data provide clear evidence that TWEAK can promote angiogenesis in vivo. Many TNF ligands are able to induce cytokine production from their target cells (43Beutler B. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 625-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). TWEAK has been shown to induce IL-8 secretion in three cell lines, HT29 (colon), A375 (melanoma), and WI-38 (fibroblast) (1Chicheportiche Y. Bourdon P.R. Xu H. Hsu Y.M. Scott H. Hession C. Garcia I. Browning J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32401-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated whether TWEAK can induce secretion of IL-8, IL-6, and GM-CSF in HUVEC. Although stimulation with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 28 h increased production of all three cytokines, TWEAK induced only small increases in IL-8 and GM-CSF, and there was no increase in IL-6 (data not shown). In addition, because many members of the TNF ligand family co-stimulate T-cells (3Smith C.A. Farrah T. Goodwin R.G.

Cell. 1993; 73: 447-456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), TWEAK was also tested for this activity. Although a strong increase in tritiated thymidine uptake was seen with anti-CD3 treated T-cells co-stimulated with anti-CD28, no increase was seen in cells co-stimulated with TWEAK (data not shown). In conclusion, these data show that TWEAK has a proliferative effect on a variety of endothelial cells and AOSMC in culture. In vivostudies in rat corneas demonstrate that TWEAK is a strong inducer of angiogenesis. Given the importance of the TNF family in many immune responses, and the contribution of vascular endothelium to immune processes such as inflammation, it is not surprising that TNF ligands can affect vascular tissue. However, data presented here show that TWEAK has a more direct effect on angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation than has previously been ascribed to any other member of the TNF family. The magnitude of this response is similar to more thoroughly characterized angiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF.

In this study, we investigated the effects on top1 of an abundant base damage generated by various oxidative stresses: 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). Using purified eukaryotic top1 and oligonucleotides containing the 8-oxoG modification, we found a 3–7-fold increase in top1-mediated DNA cleavage when 8-oxoG was present at the +1 or +2 position relative to the cleavage site. Another oxidative lesion, 5-hydroxycytosine, also enhanced top1 cleavage by 2-fold when incorporated at the +1 position of the scissile strand. 8-oxoG at the +1 position enhanced noncovalent top1 DNA binding and had no detectable effect on DNA religation or on the incision step. top1 trapping by 8-oxoG was markedly enhanced when asparagine adjacent to the catalytic tyrosine was mutated to histidine, suggesting a direct interaction between this residue and the DNA major groove immediately downstream from the top1 cleavage site. Altogether, these results demonstrate that oxidative base lesions can increase top1 binding to DNA and induce top1 cleavage complexes.

Pyrimidines also undergo oxidation in vivo and can lead to potential mutagenic derivatives such as 5-hydrocycytosine (5-ohC) (15Feig D.I. Sowers L.C. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this study we have investigated the effect of 8-oxoG on eukaryotic topoisomerase I (top1) using purified enzyme and oligonucleotides containing a unique top1 cleavage site (24Bonven B.J. Gocke E.

DNA topoisomerases play a critical role in DNA metabolism by changing the topological state of DNA (26Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic top1 is an essential (27Morham S.G. Kluckman K.D. Voulomanos N. Smithies O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6804-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 28Hsieh T. Lee M.P. Brown S.D.

It catalyzes a reversible transesterification reaction by forming a covalent 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond between a DNA strand and an enzyme tyrosine residue (Tyr723 for human top1) while leaving a 5′-hydroxyl terminus downstream to the cleavage site (31Champoux J.J.

These reversible cleavage complexes are the key catalytic intermediates that permit relaxation of DNA supercoiling and recombination. top1 inhibitors such as camptothecin and its derivatives inhibit the religation of the top1 cleavage complexes (32Chen A.Y.

DNA modifications such as uracil mismatches, abasic sites, nicks, and vinyl chloride adducts can also trap top1 cleavage complexes and in some cases lead to the formation of irreversible cleavage complexes also referred to as “suicide complexes” (25Pourquier P.

In this report, we show for the first time that 8-oxoG can promote formation of top1 cleavage complexes by increasing top1 binding to DNA. We also demonstrate the influence of the amino acid residue immediately flanking the catalytic tyrosine by using various top1 mutants including an asparagine-to-serine mutant that was previously found to induce camptothecin resistance (39Fujimori A. Harker W.G. Kohlhagen G. Hoki Y. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1339-1346PubMed Google Scholar). These findings further extend the broad variety of DNA lesions affecting top1 activity and provide novel details on the interactions of specific residues of eukaryotic top1 with DNA. High pressure liquid chromatography purified control and 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotides were purchased from The Midland Certified Reagent Company (Midland, TX). 5-ohC-containing oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′: GATCTAAAAGACTT5-ohCGAAAAATTTTTAAAAAAGATC, GATCTTTTTTAAAAATTTTTC5-ohCAAGTCTTTTAGATC, and GATCTTTTTTAAAAATTTTT5-ohCCAAGTCTTTTAGATC) were synthesized as described previously (18Wang D.

Camptothecin (CPT) was provided by Drs. Wani and Wall (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). 10-mm aliquots of CPT were stored at −20 °C, thawed, and diluted to 1 mm in Me2SO just before use. 3′ Labeling was performed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with [α-32P]cordycepin as described previously (41Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Labeling mixtures were subsequently centrifuged through a G25 Sephadex column to remove excess unincorporated nucleotide. Radiolabeled single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were annealed to the same concentration of unlabeled complementary strand in 1× annealing buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Annealing mixtures were heated to 95 °C and slowly chilled overnight to room temperature. Overexpression of the human recombinant top1 was performed in Sf9 insect cells using a baculovirus virus construct containing the top1 full-length cDNA (42Zhelkovsky A.M. Moore C.L. Protein Expres. Purif. 1994; 5: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from infected Sf9 cells 4 days after infection as described previously (25Pourquier P. Pilon A.A.

Human top1 was purified from nuclear extracts using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA). 50 μl of beads were placed into microcentrifuge tubes and washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 3 mm MnCl2, 50 mm KCl). 500 μl of nuclear extract were incubated with beads for 30 min at 4 °C and washed two times with 300 μl of the wash buffer. Endogenous top1 was eluted with wash buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. Human recombinant top1 was eluted with wash buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed 3 h with 30 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol. Bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml) and glycerol (30% v/v) were added to the purified top1, and aliquots were stored at −20 °C. Yeast top1 extracts were performed as described previously. Proteins have been corrected for concentration by Western blotting, and the standard catalytic activity of all mutants was checked in standard assays. A baculovirus construct expressing the yeast mutant, top1Y727F, was constructed from plasmid YCpGAL1-top1Y727F (43Megonigal M.D. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol.

Purification of recombinant yeast top1Y727F protein from infected Sf9 insect cells was essentially as described (44Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Parker L.H. Madden K.R. Champoux J.J. J. Biol.

DNA substrates (approximately 50 fmol/reaction) were incubated with yeast or human recombinant top1 or nuclear extracts for 30 min at 25 °C in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Reactions were stopped by adding SDS (final concentration, 0.5%). For reversal experiments, the SDS stop was preceded by the addition of NaCl (0.5 m for 30 min at 25 °C for standard reactions or 0.35 m NaCl at 4 °C for reversal kinetics). Before loading of the electrophoresis, 3.3 volumes of Maxam Gilbert loading buffer (98% formamide, 0.01 m EDTA, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanol, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) were added to reaction mixtures. 16% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (7 m urea) were run at 40 V/cm at 50 °C for 2–3 h and dried on 3MM Whatman paper sheets. Imaging and quantitations were performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). 3′-Labeled DNA substrates (approximately 25 fmol/reaction) were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of yeast top1Y727F mutant protein (final volume, 20 μl) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (47Cheng C. Wang L.K. Sekigushi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8263-8269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and 50 ng of double-stranded poly dI-dC DNA (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. 10 μl of 3× neutral loading buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 30% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) were added to each reaction before loading into a 6% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE. Electrophoresis was for 2 h at 100 V in 0.25× TBE buffer. Imaging and quantitations were performed using a PhosphorImager. In this study, we investigated the effects of the abundant oxidative lesion 8-oxoG on top1 activity and how CPT would affect top1-DNA interactions under such conditions. For this purpose, we used oligonucleotides derived from a Tetrahymenaribosomal DNA sequence (24Bonven B.J. Gocke E. Westergaard O. Cell. 1985; 41: 541-551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) containing a single top1 cleavage site that had been previously mutated to maximize top1 sensitivity to camptothecin and its derivatives (25Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26441-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,48Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 7200-7206Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). We first studied the effect of 8-oxoG incorporation at the +1 position of the scissile strand (X in Fig. 1 A) on top1-mediated cleavage using purified recombinant human enzyme. Replacement of G by 8-oxoG at the +1 position enhanced cleavage 3–5-fold (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 2 and 7). The same increase (approximately 6-fold) was observed when 8-oxoG was paired with A as it would be after polymerase misincorporation (Fig.1 C, compare lanes 2 and 12). By contrast, 8-oxoG at the +1 position of the nonscissile strand (Y in Fig. 1 A) did not affect top1-mediated DNA cleavage (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 17 and22). These results are consistent with our previous finding that DNA alterations at this +1 position can trap top1 and increase DNA cleavage (36Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38Pourquier P. Bjornsti M.-A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27245-27249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, top1 cleavage is reversible, leading to religation of the DNA strand. The top1 cleavage/religation equilibrium can be shifted toward religation by increasing the salt concentration (48Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 7200-7206Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the case of the 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotides, top1 cleavage remained reversible after the addition of 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 1 C,lanes C). Similar results were obtained when 5-ohC was used as a modified base. When introduced at the +1 position of the scissile strand, 5-ohC enhanced top1 cleavage approximately 2-fold (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 2and 7). However, 5-ohC failed to affect top1 activity when it was incorporated at the +1 (or the +2) position of the nonscissile strand opposite to G (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 17and 22 to lane 12). Interestingly, both the 8- oxo and the 5-hydroxy group of the oxidized +1 base on the scissile strand occupy the same region of the DNA major groove (Fig.1 B, middle panel, and Fig. 2 A,right panel). Together, these results indicate that presence of an additional oxygen group in the DNA major groove on the +1 base of the scissile strand selectively enhances the formation of top1 cleavage complexes. Because we previously hypothesized that CPT traps top1 cleavage complexes by interacting with the +1 purine of the top1 cleavage site (49Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we tested whether the 8-oxoG and 5-ohC substitutions at the +1 position would affect the activity of CPT. Fig. 1 C shows that the 8-oxoG modifications had no effect on top1 sensitivity to CPT when 8-oxoG was paired to C (lane 9). Cleavage was also salt-reversible (compare lanes 9 and 10). However, when 8-oxoG was paired to A, CPT was not able to further enhance top1 cleavage (compare lanes 14 and 12). Fig.2 B also shows the lack of effect of 5-ohC on CPT activity (lane 9). These results demonstrate the potency of 8-oxoguanine and 5-hydroxycytosine to trap top1 reversibly when present 3′ to the top1 cleavage site on the scissile strand (+1 position). We next studied the influence of the position of the 8-oxoG by replacing the guanines present in the immediate vicinity of the top1 site (Fig.3 A). 8-oxoG at the +2 position on the scissile strand also led to reversible top1 trapping (Fig.3 B), and top1 cleavage was increased to approximately the same extent (4–6-fold) as for the 8-oxoG at the +1 position (Fig.1 C). By contrast, incorporation of 5-ohC at the +2 position of the nonscissile strand did not increase the formation of top1 cleavage complexes (Fig. 2 C, compare lanes 12 and22). When the guanine at the −3 position of the nonscissile strand (lower strand) was replaced by 8-oxoG, cleavage at the normal site remained detectable (Fig. 3 B). However, a new cleavage site was observed two bases upstream (Fig. 3 B, open arrowhead). This observation is consistent with our previous studies showing that the presence of uracil, abasic site, or of a nick at the −2 position of the nonscissile strand all induced this new top1 cleavage upstream to the normal cleavage site (25Pourquier P. Pilon A.A. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Sharma A. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26441-26447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 36Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the 8-oxoG was incorporated at position −1 relative to the new cleavage site. We also tested the effect of this 8-oxoG incorporation at the −3 position of the nonscissile strand on possible top1-induced cleavage on the lower strand and did not detect any cleavage of this strand (data not shown). CPT remained active at the pre-existing top1 cleavage site in the oligonucleotide with 8-oxoG at positions +2 and −3 (comparelanes D and B) and CPT-induced cleavage was reversible (compare lanes E and D). However, CPT did not increase top1-mediated cleavage at the new site (Fig.3 B, compare lanes 7 and 9). We have previously described the same lack of CPT activity when an abasic site was present at the −3 position (36Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that 8-oxoG can enhance top1 cleavage when present at the +1 or +2 position relative to a pre-existing top1 site and that it can induce new top1 cleavages. To assess the manner by which 8-oxoG enhanced top1 cleavage, we first performed kinetic experiments with the substrates shown in Fig. 1. Cleavage was enhanced in the 8-oxoG oligonucleotide after 1 min and reached a plateau at about 3–5-fold the cleavage level measured in the control oligonucleotide (Fig.4 A). top1-mediated DNA religation was studied at 0 °C after addition of 0.35 mNaCl (Fig. 4 B). Under these conditions, religation is slower than at 37 °C and in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl (48Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 7200-7206Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As a comparison, we used the control oligonucleotide in the presence of CPT, because enhancement of top1 cleavage by CPT is known to result from inhibition of religation of top1 cleavage complexes (48Tanizawa A. Kohn K.W. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1995; 43: 7200-7206Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After NaCl addition, cleavage was reversed in the case of 8-oxoG after 1 min, whereas CPT-induced cleavage remained detectable for more than 1 h. When compared with the control oligonucleotide in the absence of CPT, religation rates were comparable, as 80% of the cleavage complexes reversed after 5 s (data not shown). Thus, 8-oxoG at the +1 position does not appear to mimic the effect of CPT, e.g.to inhibit top1-mediated DNA religation. To investigate the effects of 8-oxoG on the induction of DNA cleavage by top1, we used a partially single-stranded 19-mer oligonucleotide, also referred to as suicide substrate, containing the 8-oxoG at the +1 position relative to the top1 cleavage site (Fig.5). Once top1 becomes covalently attached to the 3′ DNA terminus, it releases a 5′-hydroxyl hexamer (35Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 50Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower strand was phosphorylated at its 5′-end to prevent intramolecular religation (41Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 50Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8620-8627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, using this oligonucleotide, cleavage can be studied under single turnover conditions (51Wang L.K. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3909-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows that the presence of 8-oxoG at the +1 position did not increase top1 cleavage rate as compared with the control oligonucleotide. Cleavage appeared even slightly slower in the case of the 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. 5C). This result demonstrates that the increase in top1 cleavage complexes observed at equilibrium (such as in Fig.1 C) was not due to an increased rate of DNA cleavage. We next investigated the effect of 8-oxoG on the formation of noncovalent top1-DNA complexes using a yeast top1 mutant where the catalytic tyrosine 727 was mutated to phenylalanine (top1Y727Fp). This catalytically inactive mutant cannot perform the incision step but is still able to bind the top1 consensus sequence (52Eng W. Pandit S.D. Sternglanz R. J. Biol.

Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we found that increasing concentrations of top1Y727Fp produced an increase in noncovalent top1-DNA complexes (Fig. 6 A). More efficient top1Y727Fp binding was observed with the oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoG rather than G at the +1 position (Fig. 6 A, compare lanes 2–5 between the G:C (control) and the 8-oxoG:C oligonucleotides)). Quantitation of the top1-DNA complexes indicated about a 3-fold increase with the highest concentrations of enzyme (Fig. 6 A, lanes 5) and about 7-fold with the lowest concentrations (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2). Incorporation of 5-ohC at the +1 position of the nonscissile strand, however, did not enhance top1Y727Fp DNA binding under the same conditions (Fig. 6 B). Thus, enhancement of top1 cleavage by incorporation of 8-oxoG appears related to enhanced binding of top1 to the 8-oxoG-containing DNA. Eukaryotic top1s vary in size across species but share highly conserved amino acids sequences especially in the vicinity of the catalytic tyrosine in the carboxyl terminus region (29Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) (Fig.7 A). We investigated the contribution of the asparagine immediately flanking the catalytic tyrosine for the enhancement of top1 cleavage complex by 8-oxoguanine. For this purpose, we used three different yeast top1 mutants where asparagine 726 was mutated to histidine, aspartic acid, or serine. Each of the partially purified mutant proteins was tested with the control oligonucleotide and with oligonucleotides containing an 8-oxoG at the +1 or the +2 position (Fig. 7 B). With wild-type top1 and the asparagine to serine mutant protein, cleavage complexes were almost undetectable with the control oligonucleotide (G:C at +1 position). In contrast, when asparagine was mutated to aspartic acid or histidine, top1 cleavage complexes were enhanced significantly, although the overall percentage of DNA cleavage was below 5% (Fig. 7 C). Incorporation of 8-oxoG at the +1 or +2 positions led to a marked increase in top1-mediated cleavage for wild-type yeast top1, which confirms our previous findings using the human recombinant enzyme (Fig.1 C). Enhancement of cleavage was also observed when the asparagine was mutated to histidine or serine (Fig. 7, B andC). When 8-oxoG was incorporated at the +2 position of the scissile strand, only the histidine mutant led to marked enhancement of top1-induced DNA cleavage (approximately 13-fold increase as compared with the control oligonucleotide). Thus, replacement of the asparagine immediately adjacent to the catalytic tyrosine of top1 by histidine enhances DNA cleavage in 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotides. This study shows for the first time that 8-oxoG, which is one of the most abundant oxidative DNA lesions in mammalian cells (5Park E.-M. Shigenaga M.K. Degan P. Korn T.S. Kitzler J.W. Wehr C.M. Kolachana P. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3375-3379Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), can induce the formation of reversible top1-linked DNA single-stranded breaks. In general, an increase of top1-mediated cleavage complexes results from a shift in the cleavage/religation equilibrium. Until the present study, enhanced top1 cleavage by DNA damages (base mismatches, abasic sites, or vinyl chloride adducts; Refs. 36Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W.

By contrast, in this study we found that 8-oxoG paired with C at the +1 position enhanced top1 cleavage complexes by increasing the binding of top1 to DNA. We also found that oxidation of cytosine +1 on the scissile strand (5-ohC, another oxidative damage found to be mutagenic in vivo; Refs. 15Feig D.I. Sowers L.C. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 3578-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) similarly enhanced top1-mediated DNA cleavage. This effect on top1 is remarkably specific because we did not detect any significant change in cleavage or binding when 8-oxoguanine or 5-hydroxycytosine were incorporated at the +1 position on the nonscissile strand. Because replacement of G by 8-oxoG in DNA does not change base pairing or overall DNA structure (7Lipscomb L.A. Peek M.E. Morningstar M.L. Verghis S.M. Miller E.M. Rich A. Essigmann J.M. Williams L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 1995: 719-723Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar), increased top1 binding is probably due to the presence of the nucleophilic 8-oxo group in the vicinity of the cleaved strand in the DNA major groove. As shown in Fig. 1 B, oxidation of G converts the 7 position from hydrogen bond acceptor to donor and the 8 position from a weak hydrogen bond donor to a strong hydrogen acceptor, O8 (7Lipscomb L.A. Peek M.E. Morningstar M.L. Verghis S.M. Miller E.M. Rich A. Essigmann J.M. Williams L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 1995: 719-723Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bond donor/acceptors within the DNA major groove are probably essential for recognition by DNA repair enzymes such as the DNA glycosylase, MutM (7Lipscomb L.A. Peek M.E. Morningstar M.L. Verghis S.M. Miller E.M. Rich A. Essigmann J.M. Williams L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 1995: 719-723Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because the hydroxy group of 5-ohC and the 8-oxo group of 8-oxoG are occupying approximately the same position in the DNA major groove and because both enhance top1 cleavage complexes, it is plausible that they exert their activity by the same mechanism. We propose that the differential arrangement of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors within the major groove enhances top1 binding to 8-oxoG or 5-ohC-containing DNA. Based on the recently published crystallographic structure of a top1-DNA complex (56Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G.J. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 57Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), asparagine 722 in human top1 (and the corresponding Asn726 in yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae; Fig. 7 A) is a plausible hydrogen bond donor for the O8 of 8-oxoguanine. Asparagine 722 is pointed roughly in line with the +1 base on the scissile strand (57Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Changing asparagine 722 to histidine would probably enhance a potential interaction with 8-oxoG because the 5-membered ring would probably bring the amino group even closer to the oxygen, which would be covalently bonded to the carbon 8 of guanine. 5L. Stewart, personal communication. It is also possible that the asparagine to histidine mutation increases the reactivity of the adjacent catalytic tyrosine. A frequent in vivo DNA modification is the incorporation of an A opposite 8-oxoG by DNA polymerases. This lesion is mutagenic. top1-mediated DNA cleavage was further enhanced when 8-oxoG was paired to A at the +1 position. 8-oxoG:A base pair is in an syn-anti-conformation, resulting in the protrusion of the 8-oxo group in the minor grove of the DNA and altered hydrogen bonding (Ref. 7Lipscomb L.A. Peek M.E. Morningstar M.L. Verghis S.M. Miller E.M. Rich A. Essigmann J.M. Williams L.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 1995: 719-723Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B). Moreover, 8-oxoG:A base pairing was able to inhibit top1-mediated religation in the absence of CPT, whereas 8-oxoG:C could not (data not shown). We previously reported that DNA mismatches at the +1 position of a top1 cleavage site reversibly enhance top1-mediated cleavage complexes (36Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 58Yeh Y.-C. Liu H.-F. Ellis C.A. Lu A.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15498-15504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the case of the 8-oxoG:A, we propose that DNA structural distortions and inhibition of religation contribute to top1 trapping. CPT has been shown to interact with the +1 base immediately downstream of the top1 cleavage site (49Pommier Y. Kohlhagen G. Kohn F. Leteurtre F. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8861-8865Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This interaction has been suggested to inhibit DNA religation by top1 and thus to trap the top1 cleavage complexes. We found that CPT remained inhibitory when 8-oxoG was paired with C at the +1 position. However, the CPT activity was markedly decreased when 8-oxoG was paired to A at this same position. We previously reported such a decrease of CPT activity in the case of mismatches or abasic sites at this +1 position, whereas wobble base pairing such as that of G:U did not reduce CPT activity (36Pourquier P. Ueng L.-M. Kohlhagen G. Mazumder A. Gupta M. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7792-7796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These results suggest the importance of base pairing at the +1 position for CPT activity. These results are also consistent with the selective interaction of camptothecin at the top1-DNA interface with the +1 base pair. It is also interesting that the top1 trapping effect of 8-oxoG was observed with crude nuclear extracts from leukemia cells (data not shown). This result suggests that top1 can recognize the 8-oxoG modifications in the presence of other nuclear proteins and can efficiently compete for binding. Induction of top1 cleavage complexes by oxidized bases could potentially lead to DNA damage and cell death (as in the case of CPT) or possibly to recombination and mutagenic effects. The potential role that specific DNA repair pathways play in the processing of these lesions has yet to be established. We thank Drs. Lance Stewart and Kurt W. Kohn for discussions and suggestions during the course of these studies."

Post-translational modifications are essential for the membrane targeting of Ras proteins and many other proteins containing a “CAAX sequence” at their C terminus (1Clarke S. Vogel J.P.

CAAX proteins terminate with the amino acids -C-A-A-X, where the “C” is a cysteine, the two “A” residues are usually aliphatic amino acids, and the “X” can be one of several amino acids. CAAX proteins undergo three sequential enzymatic post-translational modifications. First, either a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenoid lipid is attached to the thiol group of the cysteine residue by cytosolic protein prenyltransferases (5Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). In general, the cysteine is geranylgeranylated when the Xresidue is a leucine or a phenylalanine; otherwise, the protein is farnesylated (6Finegold A.A. Johnson D.I. Farnsworth C.C. Gelb M.H.

Second, the last three amino acids of the protein (i.e. the -AAX) are removed by a specific endoprotease; this step is prenylation-dependent and is thought to take place on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (8Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Finally, the C group of the prenylcysteine is methylated by an endoplasmic reticulum-associated methyltransferase (1Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 9Clarke S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 10Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In addition to these three processing events, some CAAXproteins, including Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras4A, and N-Ras, can be further modified by palmitoylation of upstream cysteine residues (11Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). The mammalian prenyltransferase enzymes responsible for farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of the CAAX proteins have been defined (2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev.

However, progress in defining the mammalian enzymes for the middle step of the triad, the endoproteolysis step, has been limited. Enzymatic activities capable of carrying out the endoproteolysis step have long been recognized (10Clarke S. Annu. Rev.

However, only very recently have specific molecules been linked to that step, and virtually all of this progress has occurred in yeast. Two genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, RCE1 and AFC1, have been shown to be involved in the proteolytic processing of several yeast CAAX proteins (19Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 20Tam A. Nouvet F.J. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Rce1p (for Ras anda-factor-converting enzyme) is essential for cleaving the C-terminal three amino acids of a yeast Ras protein, Ras2p, and is active in processing the yeast mating pheromone a-factor (19Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 20Tam A. Nouvet F.J. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) carries out two successive proteolytic processing steps for the precursor to a-factor: cleavage of the C-terminal three amino acids from the farnesylated precursor and the subsequent cleavage of 7 amino acids from the N-terminal portion of the protein (20Tam A. Nouvet F.J. Fujimura-Kamada K. Slunt H. Sisodia S.S. Michaelis S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 21Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J.

Afc1p does not process yeast Ras2p (19Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), nor does it process human farnesyl-Ki-Ras in an in vitro assay (8Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For several years, it has been clear that the prenylation of CAAX proteins, particularly the Ras proteins, is critical for plasma membrane targeting and for biological function (11Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 23Jackson J.H. Cochrane C.G. Bourne J.R. Solski P.A. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3042-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). However, the functional importance of the proteolysis and methylation steps has been less obvious. Those “post-prenylation” steps may simply render prenylated proteins more hydrophobic and thereby enhance their membrane affinity (24Silvius J.R. l'Heureux, F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 25Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that those processing steps could enhance the stability of some prenylated proteins (26Hrycyna C.A. Clarke S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 281-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In any case, several studies have suggested that the post-prenylation processing steps might be important for the function of the Ras proteins. For example, a mutant Ki-Ras4B that was prenylated but not further processed exhibited reduced transforming activity when expressed in 3T3 fibroblasts (27Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Graham S.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Moreover, inRCE1-deficient yeast (rce1Δ), Ras2p was mislocalized to the cytosol and internal membranes, and the yeast were protected from the heat sensitivity elicited by the expression of a mutationally activated Ras2p. Interestingly, rce1Δ yeast grew as well as wild-type cells under normal conditions, despite the defect in Ras processing (19Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The fact that blocking Rce1p-mediated CAAX protein proteolysis appeared to attenuate the biological effects of an activated yeast Ras protein without affecting the growth of yeast under normal conditions has led to speculation that inhibiting the proteolysis step might be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating human cancers caused by mutationally activated Ras proteins (19Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 28Gelb M.H. Science. 1997; 275: 1750-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to define the mammalian enzyme responsible for Ras endoproteolytic processing and to gain insights into the physiologic consequences of blocking that processing step. At the time that the RCE1 gene was identified in yeast, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) 1The abbreviations used are:EST, expressed sequence tag; ES, embryonic stem; kb, kilobase(s); En , embryonic day n ; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FTase, farnesyltransferase. containing sequence homology to that gene existed within the mouse EST data bases. To determine whether these ESTs represented a bona fide functional homologue of the yeast gene with a role in the processing of mammalian Ras proteins, the mouse ESTs were used to identify a large genomic clone spanning the mouse gene (designated Rce1), which was then disrupted by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we describe the phenotype of Rce1-deficient mice and provide evidence that Rce1 is essential for the proteolytic processing of the mammalian Ras proteins. We also show thatRce1-deficient cells are defective in the proteolytic cleavage of other prenylated proteins, establishing a broader role for the product of the Rce1 gene in the processing of CAAX proteins. An XREFdb query of GenBankTM sequences with the yeast RCE1 coding sequences identified two mouse EST matches: I.M.A.G.E. clones 331228 (0.8 kb) and 608689 (1.1 kb) (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). These ESTs shared 71% amino acid homology and 52% identity with several portions of the yeastRCE1 gene in a region spanning amino acids 147–257. DNA sequencing and restriction mapping revealed that the mouse ESTs contained overlapping sequences spanning the majority of the mouseRce1 cDNA. Screening of a bacterial artificial chromosome library of strain 129/Sv mouse genomic DNA (Research Genetics) with the 1.1-kb EST identified a clone (427 J 4) that spanned the mouse Rce1 gene. An RNA Master Blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to identify the tissues that expressed theRce1 gene. The blot was probed with a 223-base pairRce1 cDNA fragment (corresponding to amino acids 136–210), which was amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) with oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTGCCCTTGTGACCTGACAGATGG-3′ and 5′-GAGTGGGCAGGTGAACACAGCAGG-3′. To assess the relative levels ofRce1 gene expression in different tissues, the blot was analyzed with a phosphorimager (Fuji Bio-Imaging Analyzer, BAS 1000 with MacBAS; Fuji Medical Systems, Stamford, CT). A sequence replacement gene-targeting vector was constructed from a 10.5-kb BamHI fragment of the bacterial artificial chromosome that spanned theRce1 gene. The vector was constructed in the plasmid pKSloxPNT (29Hanks M. Wurst W. Anson-Cartwright L. Auerbach A.B. Joyner A.L. Science. 1995; 269: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) (provided by Dr. A. Joyner), which contains polylinker restriction sites, a thymidine kinase gene (tk), and a neomycin resistance gene (neo) flanked by loxPsites. The 5′ arm of the vector, 3.8 kb long, contained the promoter sequences of the Rce1 gene and all of the coding sequences located 5′ to an Eco47III site within an exon of theRce1 gene (corresponding to amino acid 115 of the protein); the 3′ arm (on the 3′ side of the neo) extended from anEcoRV site located within the last exon of the gene (within the 3′-untranslated sequences of the mRNA) to an EcoRI site located ∼3.6 kb 3′ to the gene. Thus, the neoreplaced the Eco47III–EcoRV segment of theRce1 gene, which codes for the C-terminal two-thirds of the protein (amino acids 115–329). This vector was electroporated into mouse ES cells, and targeted colonies were identified by Southern analysis of XbaI-cleaved genomic DNA with a 1-kbEcoRI–BamHI probe located 3′ to the sequences in the gene-targeting vector. Two targeted ES cell clones were used to generate Rce1-deficient mice, according to published techniques (30McMahon A.P. Bradley A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1073-1085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). All mice described here had a mixed genetic background (∼50% C57BL/6 and ∼50% 129/Sv). The mice were weaned at 21 days of age, housed in a barrier facility with a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a chow diet containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Timed matings were established with Rce1 +/− males and females as described previously (31Farese Jr., R.V. Cases S. Ruland S.L. Kayden H.J. Wong J.S. Young S.G. Hamilton R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pregnant female mice were euthanized between 10.5 and 20.5 days post coitus. After dissection of the embryo and fetal membranes from the uterus, embryos were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and fetal membranes were used for genotyping. The embryos were sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined by light microscopy. To isolate primary embryonic fibroblasts,Rce1 +/− intercrosses were established, and pregnant females were sacrificed at 11.5 days post coitus. Fetal membranes were used for genotyping. The embryos were incubated in 5.0 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 8 h at 4 °C, followed by a 20-min incubation at 37 °C. After removal from the trypsin solution, the embryos were mechanically disrupted by repeated pipetting in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, penicillin-streptomycin (all from Life Technologies), and 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma; final concentration, 100 μm). The debris was allowed to settle, and the cell suspension was removed, diluted to 25 ml with medium, and plated in T150 flasks. Approximately 1 × 107 cells were obtained from each embryo. The cells were grown in an incubator with 7% CO2 at 37 °C. To immortalize the fibroblasts, cells were passaged according to a 3T6 protocol (32Todaro G.J. Green H. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 299-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (2011) Google Scholar), in which cells are harvested and counted every 3 days and replated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. To prepare cell lysates of primary embryonic fibroblasts, confluent cells were harvested from a 100-mm plate in 0.5 ml of RIPA lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and disrupted by sonication for 10 s in a Branson model 400 sonifier (duty cycle constant, output control 0.3; Danbury, CT). To obtain whole embryo lysates, E14.5 mouse embryos were isolated from pregnantRce1 +/− females that had been mated with aRce1 +/− male. The embryos were homogenized in 3.0 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Digene Diagnostics, Beltsville, MD) containing 1% SDS and 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol for 15 s with a Kinematica Polytron (Brinkman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The samples were then heated to 95 °C for 5 min and loaded onto an SDS/10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoretic transfer of the proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, Western blots performed with the “pan-Ras” monoclonal antibody Ab-4 (i.e. binds to N-Ras, Ki-Ras, and Ha-Ras; Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY) or the Ki-Ras-specific monoclonal antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Science), followed by an incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibody binding was detected with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To immunoprecipitate the Ras proteins from fibroblasts or from the tissues of mouse embryos, lysates (200 μg of embryo lysate protein or the complete lysate from a 100-mm plate of confluent fibroblasts) were adjusted to 1.0 ml with RIPA buffer and pre-cleared by an incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) or protein G-agarose beads (Boeringher Mannheim) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with 5 μg of Y13–259 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), a pan-Ras-specific rat monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were then incubated with protein A- or protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and centrifuged for 5 min at 12,500 × g. After three washes with RIPA buffer, the pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of sample buffer. Immunoprecipitates were size-fractionated on an SDS/10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel, and Western blots were performed with either antibody Ab-4 or Ab-1. To determine whether the C terminus of Ras was methylated in Rce1 +/+ andRce1 −/− embryonic fibroblasts, we used a modification of the base-labile methylation assay described by Clarkeet al. (1Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100-mm dishes containing approximately 2.5 × 106 fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of 1 mCi ofl-[methyl-3H]methionine (80 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [35S]cysteine (>1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum in a 7% CO2 incubator for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, scraped from the dish with a rubber policeman into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged at 500 × g. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.0 ml of RIPA lysis buffer and disrupted by sonification, as described above. Ras proteins were then immunoprecipitated with antibody Y13–259, and the immunoprecipitate was size-fractionated on an SDS/10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed in isopropanol, water, and acetic acid (25:65:10, v/v), soaked for 30 min in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and dried in a vacuum oven at 80 °C. The dried gel was imaged with a phosphorimager, and the area corresponding to the Ras band was excised and used to quantify the amount of [3H]methanol released by base hydrolysis of the cysteine methyl esters. The gel slice was placed in a 1.5-ml capless microcentrifuge tube, mixed with 200 μl of 2 m NaOH, and lowered into 20-ml scintillation vial containing 6 ml of Safety-Solve II counting fluor (RPI) fluid. The vial was then capped and incubated at 55 °C; within the capped vial, the [3H]methanol released from the cysteine methyl esters diffuse into the fluor, whereas the labeled protein remains in the gel slice. After 24 h, the microcentrifuge tubes were removed, and the radioactivity in the vials was counted. CAAX endoprotease activities were measured using a coupled assay. Recombinant prenyl proteins were first used as substrates in a proteolysis assay in which the protease source was membranes from eitherRce1 +/+ or Rce1 −/−fibroblasts. The degree of specific proteolytic processing of the prenyl proteins was then determined by quantifying their ability to be methylated by the yeast prenyl protein carboxymethyltransferase STE14 produced in Sf9 cells. Substrate proteins containing a CAAX sequence were expressed in Escherichia coli, prenylated in vitro with recombinant protein farnesyltransferase or protein geranylgeranyltransferase, and either purified (in the case of farnesyl-Ki-Ras and geranylgeranyl-Ki-Ras) or simply concentrated as a mixture of prenylated protein, nonprenylated protein, and the prenyltransferase (33Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Ki-Ras, N-Ras, and Rap-1B were modified at the N terminus with a hexahistidine tag, whereas Gγ1 and Ha-Ras were unmodified. To prepare membranes fromRce1 +/+ and Rce1 −/−embryonic fibroblasts, cells were lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min to remove cellular debris and nuclei, the membrane fraction was ultracentrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1.5 h and resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl at protein concentrations of 10–25 mg/ml. To assay for the prenyl protein-specific protease, prenyl protein substrates and membrane fractions were mixed in 50 μl of a 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmMgCl2. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the proteolysis reactions were stopped, and the methyltransferase reactions were initiated by adding a mixture (20 μl) containing 5 mm NaHPO4, 87.5 mm EDTA, a variety of protease inhibitors (300 μm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm1,10-phenanthroline), 20 μg of Sf9/STE14 membranes, and 17.5 μm[3H]S-adenosylmethionine (1.5 Ci/mmol). After a 20-min incubation at 37 °C, the methylation reaction was terminated by adding 0.5 ml of 4% SDS. Bovine brain cytosol (50 μg of protein) was added as a carrier protein, and the mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, whereupon the proteins were precipitated by adding 0.5 ml of 30% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were collected on glass fiber filters (for the Ras proteins and Rap1B) or nitrocellulose filters (for Gγ1), and the extent of proteolysis was determined by quantifying 3H incorporation by scintillation counting. To determine the degree of membrane association of Ras, subcellular fractionation of primary cells and transformed cells was performed as described (34Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Jordan J.D. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 195-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For each sample, 100-mm dishes containing confluent fibroblasts were washed with ice-cold PBS, and cells were collected in 1.0 ml of PBS and centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min. Cell pellets were swelled with 1225 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μm dithiothreitol) and placed on ice for 10 min. Cells were disrupted with an ice-cold Dounce tissue homogenizer, after which 225 μl of 1 m NaCl was added. A total of 450 μl of this solution (“total lysate”) was transferred to a microfuge tube and set aside. The remaining 1000 μl was transferred to a polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tube and spun at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fluid (S100, representing the cytosolic fraction) was transferred to a new microcentrifuge tube; the pellet (P100, representing the membrane fraction) was resuspended in 850 μl of hypotonic buffer and 150 μl of 1 m NaCl. Next, 50 μl of 10 × Hi-SDS RIPA buffer was added to total lysate sample, and 110 μl was added to the S100 and P100 fractions. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a new microfuge tube, and immunoprecipitations, gel fractionations, and Western blot detection of the Ras proteins were performed as described earlier. To further assess the association of the Ras proteins with the mbranes of Rce1 −/− and Rce1 +/+embryonic fibroblasts, we prepared an enhanced green fluorescent protein-Ki-Ras fusion protein in which the last 18 amino acids corresponded to the mouse Ki-Ras sequence. Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to the last 18 amino acids of mouse Ki-Ras (5′-AATTCTGGTAAAAAGAAGAAAAAGAAGTCAAAGACAAAGTGTGTAATTATGTAGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCTACATAATTACACACTTTGTCTTTGACTTCTTTTTCTTCTTTTTACCAG-3′) were annealed and ligated into the vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which had been cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI. The plasmids were then sequenced to verify that the sequence of the oligonucleotide was in frame with that of the green fluorescent protein. Rce1 −/− and Rce1 +/+embryonic fibroblasts were transfected with either 2.0 μg of the the parental green fluorescent protein plasmid (EGFP)-Ki-Ras construct or the EGFP with SuperFect Reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were fixed in 4% formalin 24–28 h after transfection, mounted, and viewed by confocal microscopy. Rce1 +/− mice were intercrossed to produce Rce1 −/−,Rce1 +/−, and Rce1 +/+embryos. Pregnant females were sacrificed on day 14.5–15.5 post coitus, and the embryos were removed. Fetal livers were transferred to 1 ml of Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum. Single-cell suspensions were prepared by drawing the livers through progressively smaller needles (a 22-gauge needle × 2 followed by a 25-gauge needle × 2). DNA was extracted from the remaining embryonic tissues, and a polymerase chain reaction-based assay was used to determine Rce1 genotypes before adoptive transfer. A total of 2–10 × 106 mononuclear cells were injected into the tail veins of recipients previously subjected to 1000 centigrays of total body irradiation. This irradiation protocol destroys recipient hematopoiesis and is associated with >95% survival of animals engrafted with wild-type fetal liver cells. Complete blood counts were performed monthly for at least 4 months after adoptive transfer. The genotype of circulating blood cells was assessed by Southern blot analysis. To assess the growth of colonies derived from colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, mononuclear cells from fetal livers were plated on the same day that they were harvested in duplicate 35-mm plates (5 × 104 cells/plate) in fully supplemented Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) medium containing 0.8% methylcellulose, 30% fetal calf serum, and l-glutamine. The fetal liver cells and recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor were added directly to the methylcellulose-containing medium, and the solution was mixed thoroughly before plating. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Colonies derived from granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units were counte"

Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) 1The abbreviations used are:AP, alkaline phosphatase.1The abbreviations used are:AP, alkaline phosphatase. is a homodimeric metalloenzyme catalyzing the nonspecific hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters into inorganic phosphate and an alcohol. The overall structure is approximately 100 Å × 50 Å × 50 Å with the active sites 30 Å apart from each other on opposite sides of the molecule. Each active site contains two tightly bound zinc ions (Zn1and Zn2) and one magnesium ion. The three closely spaced metal binding sites trace a triangle with the two zinc ions 4 Å apart and the magnesium binding site approximately 5 Å from Zn2and 7 Å from Zn1. The active site pocket shown in Fig. 1(top panel) with bound inorganic phosphate is shallow and, in addition to the three metal ions, is lined by Arg-166 and Ser-102.Based on the structure of the enzyme with phosphate bound, Kim and Wyckoff (1Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) have proposed the reaction mechanism shown in SchemeFS1. The free enzyme interacts with a phosphomonoester (ROP) to form the Michaelis enzyme-substrate complex (E·ROP). This complex breaks down upon nucleophilic attack of Ser-102 on the phosphate group of the substrate forming the covalent phospho-enzyme intermediate (E-P). This covalent intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed into the noncovalent enzyme-phosphate complex (E·Pi). As predicted by the mechanism, the reaction proceeds with overall retention of configuration at the phosphorus center. The two consecutive in-line displacement steps are postulated to have trigonal bipyramidal transition states.Figure FS1Mechanism of the E. colialkaline phosphatase reaction. Mechanism is based on the x-ray crystal structure of the enzyme with inorganic phosphate bound in the active site (1Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol.

Vanadate, an oxyanion of pentavalent vanadium, readily adopts a five-coordinate geometry resembling the proposed transition state in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction of alkaline phosphatase. In fact, vanadate has been used as a transition state analog in several enzyme-catalyzed reactions including phosphomonoester hydrolysis by rat acid phosphatase and ribonucleotide phosphodiester hydrolysis by ribonuclease A (2Borah B. Chen C. Egan W. Miller M. Wlodawer A. Cohen J.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Vihko P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Vanadate is isostructural and isoelectronic with phosphate, a product, and a competitive inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase (4Crans D.C. Keramidas A.D. Drouza C. Phosphorous Sulfur Silicon. 1996; 109–110: 245-248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Unlike the phosphate ion, vanadate can form stable five-coordinate species (4Crans D.C. Keramidas A.D. Drouza C. Phosphorous Sulfur Silicon. 1996; 109–110: 245-248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) allowing it to serve as a transition state analog for both the acquisition of phosphate and its release in the catalytic reaction of alkaline phosphatase. This paper describes the five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal complex of vanadate in the active site of alkaline phosphatase as directly observed in a high resolution x-ray crystal structure refined at 1.9 Å resolution.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESE. coli alkaline phosphatase was isolated as described previously (5Chaidaroglou A. Brezinski D.J. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8338-8343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). E. coli SM547 cells transformed with the plasmid pEK48 were used as the host strain for expression of wild-type alkaline phosphatase. The concentration of purified enzyme was determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.71 cm2 mg−1.Alkaline phosphatase activity in the presence and absence of ammonium vanadate was measured spectrophotometrically usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate (6Garen A. Leventhal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 38: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). A 10 mm stock solution of ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3) was prepared by dissolving the material in hot water followed by pH adjustment to 8.0 upon cooling. The K i value for NH4VO3inhibition of wild-type E. coli AP was determined from the double-reciprocal plot shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2Double-reciprocal plot of the activity ofE. coli alkaline phosphatase in the presence of increasing concentrations of vanadate: ●, no NH4VO3; ○, 5 μm NH4VO3; ×, 10 μmNH4VO3; and ▪, 20 μm NH4VO3.From the kinetic data a K i of 12 μmwas calculated for vanadate inhibition of AP. Assays were carried out at 25 °C in 1.0 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The formation ofp-nitrophenolate was monitored at 410 nm, and the specific activity is reported in units of μmol/min/mg.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Wild-type alkaline phosphatase was crystallized by vapor diffusion as described previously (7Murphy J.E. Tibbitts T.T. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Crystals were transferred into a stabilizing buffer containing 65% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 1 mmZnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and Tris buffer adjusted to a pH of 7.5. Initially, a high Tris concentration (1m) was used to complex residual phosphate carried by the enzyme. After three buffer exchanges with high Tris, the crystals were transferred into stabilizing solution containing low Tris (100 mm) and gradually introduced to the vanadate ion (NH4VO3). The crystal of the wild-type enzyme was soaked in stabilizing buffer containing a final concentration of 100 μm vanadate (approximately 8 ×K i) before mounting in a glass capillary for data collection.The diffraction data were collected using two area detectors (Area Detector Systems, San Diego, CA), driven by a VAX ALPHA 3300 computer and linked to Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator operated at 50 kV and 150 mA using the Crystallographic Facility in the Chemistry Department of Boston College. Diffraction data for the AP-vanadate complex were collected to 1.90 Å. A total of 93722 unique reflections were obtained from measurements with an average redundancy of 2.8 (Table I). Merging of the reflections was accomplished using the software provided by Area Detector Systems. After correction for Lorentz and polarization effects, a scale factor was calculated for multiple measurements and symmetry-related reflections.

XPLOR V. 3.1 (8Brunger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) and IMPLOR (Polyvision, Inc. Hopedale, MA) were used to refine the coordinates. Using the initial (Fo − Fc) map and VO4 coordinates obtained from the structure of rat acid phosphatase (Protein Data Bank code 1RPT), vanadate was modeled into electron density in the active sites. In the initial modeling stage, the Oγ Ser-102 was within bonding distance to the vanadium atom, and the three equatorial oxygen atoms were coplanar with the vanadium atom. Water ligands to the metal ions were included in the second refinement cycle. In this cycle, the enzyme-vanadate structure was further refined by positional refinement, temperature factor refinement, and simulated annealing. In the final refinement step, a covalent serine-vanadate group was defined. The refinements were carried out using the Silicon Graphics Indigo II computers at Boston College. An automated water placement feature of IMPLOR was used to add solvent water molecules based on the difference Fourier map (Fo − Fc), their distance from surrounding residues, and their temperature factors. Refinement statistics for the AP-vanadate structure are reported in Table I. The coordinates for the AP-vanadate structure have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank as 1B8J.RESULTSVanadate in its monomeric and oxidized form (VO43−) is a strong competitive inhibitor of wild-type AP (4Crans D.C. Keramidas A.D. Drouza C. Phosphorous Sulfur Silicon. 1996; 109–110: 245-248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 9Lopez V. Stevens T. Lindquist R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In agreement with the previous experiments, kinetic data obtained for the wild-type enzyme in the presence of vanadate follow a competitive trend. From the double-reciprocal data shown in Fig. 2, an inhibition constant of 12 μm was determined for vanadate. Vanadate binds as tightly to AP as inorganic phosphate having a reported K ivalue of 10 μm (10Reid T.W. Wilson I.B. Boyer P. 3rd Ed. Enzymes. 4. Academic Press, New York1971: 373-415Google Scholar). A higher molecular weight vanadate species not accounted for in the determination could raise the observedK i value.In the x-ray crystal structure of the complex refined at 1.9 Å resolution, the vanadium ion is clearly bound in the active site of AP with five-coordinate geometry. The omit map (Fig.1, bottom panel) shows the trigonal bipyramidal structure of vanadate when bound in its complex with AP. A summary of the important bond angles and bond lengths in the AP-vanadate complex is provided in TableII.Table IIBond distances and bond angles for AP-vanadate complexEnzyme-vanadate interactionBond distance (subunit A/subunit B)ÅAxial interactionsOγ (Ser-102)…VO4 (vanadium atom)1.72 /1.70H2-O (axial water)…VO4(vanadium atom)1.92 /1.88Equatorial interactionsaEquatorial oxygen atoms are distinguished by the subscripts A, B, and C.Zn1…OA–VO42.06 /2.08Zn2…OA–VO42.18 /2.14NH2 (Arg-166)…OB–VO43.03 /2.96NH2(Arg-166)…OC–VO42.74 /2.84Bond angle (subunit A/subunit B)degreesAxial interactionsH2O (axial water)…Oγ(Ser-102)…V(vanadium atom)172 /169Equatorial interactionsaEquatorial oxygen atoms are distinguished by the subscripts A, B, and C.OA…V(vanadium atom)…OB119 /116OA…V(vanadium atom)…OC120 /122OB…V(vanadium atom)…OC121 /122a Equatorial oxygen atoms are distinguished by the subscripts A, B, and C. Open table in a new tab In the AP-vanadate complex, Ser-102 and a Zn1-coordinated water molecule occupy the axial positions. The axial groups are separated by 172 and 169 ° in active sites A and B, respectively. Based upon bond lengths, Ser-102 is covalently bound to the vanadium center in both active sites of AP (1.72 Å in subunit A and 1.70 Å in subunit B). The covalent bond distance of this axial interaction is equivalent to the three covalent equatorial vanadium-oxygen bonds. In contrast, the interaction between the vanadium atom and the oxygen of the axial hydroxyl ligand is slightly longer (1.92 Å in subunit A and 1.88 Å in subunit B). In both sites, the bond length is approximately 0.15–0.2 Å longer than covalent interactions of vanadium with the Oγ of Ser-102 and the three equatorial oxygen atoms (average 1.75 Å). The close proximity of this oxygen ligand to the vanadium atom indicates significant bond formation at this axial position. In comparison, the distance between the Zn1 ligand and the oxygen atom of the coordinated hydroxyl group is a much longer interaction (2.41 Å in active site A and 2.39 Å in active site B). The equatorial plane of the complex is defined by the three oxygen atoms spaced 120 ° apart. The guanidinium group of Arg-166 forms two strong hydrogen bonds to two equatorial oxygen atoms of vanadate. The third oxygen atom of vanadate in the equatorial plane appears to be positioned to form equally strong interactions with both zinc ions.DISCUSSIONSeveral mechanistic proposals have been advanced based upon details in the 2.0 Å structure of the wild-type enzyme with inorganic phosphate (1Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Although the phosphate ion is tetrahedral, the spatial arrangement of contacts to the zinc ions and Arg-166 is consistent with an in-line mechanism involving a five-coordinate species. The observed orientation of phosphate appears to place Ser-102 in an expected axial position for nucleophilic attack at the phosphorus center. Zn2 is proposed to coordinate the hydroxyl group of Ser-102 activating the Oγ oxygen for nucleophilic attack. A metal-oxygen interaction between Zn1 and the phosphate is approximately opposite the Ser-102 nucleophile and could occupy the other axial position. The position of Zn1 is consistent with its dual role in the proposed mechanism of AP to coordinate the negatively charged leaving group of the substrate (RO−) in the first displacement step and then activate an incoming nucleophile in the second displacement step by lowering the pK a of a coordinated water molecule. The remaining interactions of phosphate with Zn2 and the guanidinium group of Arg-166 bisect the axial plane defined by Ser-102 and Zn1. Although the trigonal interaction is not planar, such an arrangement could conceivably form the equatorial plane in a five-coordinate species.In the H331Q mutant alkaline phosphatase (12Murphy J.E. Stec B. Ma L. Kantrowitz E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the stability of the noncovalent E·Pi complex is shifted in favor of the covalent phospho-enzyme intermediate E-P at pH 7.5 allowing the phosphoseryl catalytic intermediate to be captured in a crystal structure of the mutant. In the 2.3 Å structure of the H331Q enzyme (12Murphy J.E. Stec B. Ma L. Kantrowitz E.R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 618-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the Oγ oxygen of Ser-102 is within bonding distance of the phosphorus atom, and continuous electron density joins the two groups. A water molecule coordinated to Zn1 is clearly observed in the x-ray crystal structure. This water molecule directly opposite Ser-102 is ideally positioned for a nucleophilic attack on the phosphoserine intermediate (Fig. 1, middle panel). Comparison of the E-P intermediate and the E·Pi complex clearly shows the inversion of configuration about the tetrahedral phosphorus atom of the phosphate group. The x-ray crystal structure of alkaline phosphatase in the presence of vanadate provides a way to visualize the five-coordinate transition state postulated in the E-P to E·Pi conversion.The trigonal bipyramidal complex of vanadate in the active site of AP provides details on the formation and breakdown of the axial coordination of the phosphorus atom as the covalently bound species is converted into inorganic phosphate. In both active sites, the AP-vanadate complex is more closely associated to the Ser-102 nucleophile (Table II). In fact, Ser-102 is rotated toward vanadate assuming the same orientation observed in the covalent phosphoseryl intermediate of the E-P complex (Fig. 1, middle panel). The Oγ oxygen of Ser-102 moves approximately 0.8 Å to form the transition state from the noncovalent complex based on the respective structures of AP with vanadate and phosphate. In the AP-vanadate complex, the longer interaction between the coordinated hydroxyl occupying the second axial position and vanadium indicates a weaker complex in this direction despite the constraints used in the refinement (Table II). The strength of this axial interaction is most likely influenced by Zn1. The weak but evident interaction between Zn1 and this axial oxygen atom is consistent with the role of this metal ion in activating a water molecule for attack on the phosphoseryl intermediate. In fact, the axial hydroxyl group of vanadate is nearly superimposable with a phosphate oxygen atom in the structure of the noncovalent E·Pi complex. In contrast, the covalent E-P intermediate of the H331Q structure shows the potential nucleophilic water molecule fully coordinated to Zn1 (2.2 Å) and approximately 3.6 Å away from the collapsed phosphorus center. The pathway of the nucleophilic water molecule can be traced from the three structures (Fig. 1). Initially, it is fully bound by Zn1 (2.2 Å) in the E-P intermediate. In the AP-vanadate structure the Zn1-OH distance increases (2.4 Å) with significant bonding between this oxygen atom and the vanadium center. In the E·Pi complex, the oxygen atom is covalently attached to the phosphorus atom to form inorganic phosphate. From examining these three x-ray crystal structures, the axial bonding properties of the AP-vanadate complex are clearly intermediate between those of the E-P intermediate and the E·Pi complex.The motions required for the formation and breakdown of the transition state are minimal on the part of the enzyme. Comparison of the AP-vanadate complex with the noncovalent E·Pi complex shows that active site residues move only slightly to accommodate the transition state. To setup for nucleophilic attack, the side chain hydroxyl of Ser-102 rotates approximately 0.8 Å into the active site toward vanadate. In the E·Pi complex, the side chain is rotated away from the ion. Arg-166, on the other hand, is almost in the same position in both the ground state structure represented by the E·Pi complex and the transition state structure represented by the AP-vanadate complex. Once the covalent E-P intermediate is formed, the Arg-166 side chain shifts slightly back (∼0.5 Å) into the active site to maintain its interactions with the oxygen atoms of the covalently bound phosphate. Because very little change takes place in the enzyme, the similar binding constants observed for phosphate and vanadate can be expected despite the fact that the latter is a transition state analog. The structure of the AP-vanadate complex shows that only minor changes in the positions of Ser-102 and Arg-166 are required in the catalytic reaction and the active site arrangement is optimized for stabilization of a trigonal bipyramidal species.The bond distances of the vanadate ion, although not identical to those of phosphate, provide an accurate picture of the crucial structural elements involved in transition state stabilization. Furthermore, the increased bond distances of about 0.2 Å (13Pauling L. The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1960: 251Google Scholar) in the vanadate ion compared with the phosphate ion simulate the bond formation and breakage taking place in the transition state of the phosphatase reaction lending further support to the importance of this model study. From the AP-vanadate crystal structure, both zinc ions and Arg-166 clearly play an important role in transition state stabilization. Zn1 stabilizes the five-coordinate intermediate while also activating a water molecule for its hydrolysis. The structure of the AP-vanadate complex is the third and final structure in a set depicting the conversion of the phospho-enzyme intermediate into the noncovalent enzyme-phosphate complex. The structure of the AP-vanadate complex serves as a direct and convincing model for the five-coordinate transition state in the catalytic reaction of AP and supports the mechanism proposed by Kim and Wyckoff (1Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) based on the x-ray crystal structure of AP with inorganic phosphate. Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (AP) 1The abbreviations used are:AP, alkaline phosphatase.1The abbreviations used are:AP, alkaline phosphatase. is a homodimeric metalloenzyme catalyzing the nonspecific hydrolysis of phosphate monoesters into inorganic phosphate and an alcohol. The overall structure is approximately 100 Å × 50 Å × 50 Å with the active sites 30 Å apart from each other on opposite sides of the molecule. Each active site contains two tightly bound zinc ions (Zn1and Zn2) and one magnesium ion. The three closely spaced metal binding sites trace a triangle with the two zinc ions 4 Å apart and the magnesium binding site approximately 5 Å from Zn2and 7 Å from Zn1. The active site pocket shown in Fig. 1(top panel) with bound inorganic phosphate is shallow and, in addition to the three metal ions, is lined by Arg-166 and Ser-102. Based on the structure of the enzyme with phosphate bound, Kim and Wyckoff (1Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) have proposed the reaction mechanism shown in SchemeFS1. The free enzyme interacts with a phosphomonoester (ROP) to form the Michaelis enzyme-substrate complex (E·ROP). This complex breaks down upon nucleophilic attack of Ser-102 on the phosphate group of the substrate forming the covalent phospho-enzyme intermediate (E-P). This covalent intermediate is subsequently hydrolyzed into the noncovalent enzyme-phosphate complex (E·Pi). As predicted by the mechanism, the reaction proceeds with overall retention of configuration at the phosphorus center. The two consecutive in-line displacement steps are postulated to have trigonal bipyramidal transition states. In this study the interaction between vanadate (i.e.orthovanadate, VO43−) and E. coli alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) is evaluated by x-ray crystallography. Vanadate, an oxyanion of pentavalent vanadium, readily adopts a five-coordinate geometry resembling the proposed transition state in the enzyme-catalyzed reaction of alkaline phosphatase. In fact, vanadate has been used as a transition state analog in several enzyme-catalyzed reactions including phosphomonoester hydrolysis by rat acid phosphatase and ribonucleotide phosphodiester hydrolysis by ribonuclease A (2Borah B. Chen C. Egan W. Miller M. Wlodawer A. Cohen J.S. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2058-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 3Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Vihko P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Vanadate is isostructural and isoelectronic with phosphate, a product, and a competitive inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase (4Crans D.C. Keramidas A.D. Drouza C. Phosphorous Sulfur Silicon. 1996; 109–110: 245-248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Unlike the phosphate ion, vanadate can form stable five-coordinate species (4Crans D.C. Keramidas A.D. Drouza C. Phosphorous Sulfur Silicon. 1996; 109–110: 245-248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) allowing it to serve as a transition state analog for both the acquisition of phosphate and its release in the catalytic reaction of alkaline phosphatase. This paper describes the five-coordinate trigonal bipyramidal complex of vanadate in the active site of alkaline phosphatase as directly observed in a high resolution x-ray crystal structure refined at 1.9 Å resolution. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESE. coli alkaline phosphatase was isolated as described previously (5Chaidaroglou A. Brezinski D.J. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8338-8343Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). E. coli SM547 cells transformed with the plasmid pEK48 were used as the host strain for expression of wild-type alkaline phosphatase. The concentration of purified enzyme was determined from absorbance measurements at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.71 cm2 mg−1.Alkaline phosphatase activity in the presence and absence of ammonium vanadate was measured spectrophotometrically usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate (6Garen A. Leventhal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 38: 470-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). A 10 mm stock solution of ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3) was prepared by dissolving the material in hot water followed by pH adjustment to 8.0 upon cooling. The K i value for NH4VO3inhibition of wild-type E. coli AP was determined from the double-reciprocal plot shown in Fig. 2.Wild-type alkaline phosphatase was crystallized by vapor diffusion as described previously (7Murphy J.E. Tibbitts T.T. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 604-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Crystals were transferred into a stabilizing buffer containing 65% saturated (NH4)2SO4, 1 mmZnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and Tris buffer adjusted to a pH of 7.5. Initially, a high Tris concentration (1m) was used to complex residual phosphate carried by the enzyme. After three buffer exchanges with high Tris, the crystals were transferred into stabilizing solution containing low Tris (100 mm) and gradually introduced to the vanadate ion (NH4VO3). The crystal of the wild-type enzyme was soaked in stabilizing buffer containing a final concentration of 100 μm vanadate (approximately 8 ×K i) before mounting in a glass capillary for data collection.The diffraction data were collected using two area detectors (Area Detector Systems, San Diego, CA), driven by a VAX ALPHA 3300 computer and linked to Rigaku RU-200 rotating-anode generator operated at 50 kV and 150 mA using the Crystallographic Facility in the Chemistry Department of Boston College. Diffraction data for the AP-vanadate complex were collected to 1.90 Å. A total of 93722 unique reflections were obtained from measurements with an average redundancy of 2.8 (Table I). Merging of the reflections was accomplished using the software provided by Area Detector Systems. After correction for Lorentz and polarization effects, a scale factor was calculated for multiple measurements and symmetry-related reflections.

Using the initial (Fo − Fc) map and VO4 coordinates obtained from the structure of rat acid phosphatase (Protein Data Bank code 1RPT), vanadate was modeled into electron density in the active sites. In the initial modeling stage, the Oγ Ser-102 was within bonding distance to the vanadium atom, and the three equatorial oxygen atoms were coplanar with the vanadium atom. Water ligands to the metal ions were included in the second refinement cycle.

https://openalex.org/W2044865509,"Proteins containing C-terminal “CAAX” sequence motifs undergo three sequential post-translational processing steps: modification of the cysteine with either a 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenyl lipid, proteolysis of the C-terminal -AAX tripeptide, and methylation of the carboxyl group of the now C-terminal prenylcysteine. A putative prenyl protein protease in yeast, designated Rce1p, was recently identified. In this study, a portion of a putative human homologue of RCE1 (hRCE1) was identified in a human expressed sequence tag data base, and the corresponding cDNA was cloned. Expression of hRCE1 was detected in all tissues examined. Both yeast and human RCE1 proteins were produced in Sf9 insect cells by infection with a recombinant baculovirus; membrane preparations derived from the infected Sf9 cells exhibited a high level of prenyl protease activity. Recombinant hRCE1 so produced recognized both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins as substrates, including farnesyl-Ki-Ras, farnesyl-N-Ras, farnesyl-Ha-Ras, and the farnesylated heterotrimeric G protein Gγ1 subunit, as well as geranylgeranyl-Ki-Ras and geranylgeranyl-Rap1b. The protease activity of hRCE1 activity was specific for prenylated proteins, because unprenylated peptides did not compete for enzyme activity. hRCE1 activity was also exquisitely sensitive to a prenyl peptide analogue that had been previously described as a potent inhibitor of the prenyl protease activity in mammalian tissues. These data indicate that both the yeast and the human RCE1 gene products are bona fide prenyl protein proteases and suggest that they play a major role in the processing of CAAX-type prenylated proteins. Proteins containing C-terminal “CAAX” sequence motifs undergo three sequential post-translational processing steps: modification of the cysteine with either a 15-carbon farnesyl or 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenyl lipid, proteolysis of the C-terminal -AAX tripeptide, and methylation of the carboxyl group of the now C-terminal prenylcysteine.

These data indicate that both the yeast and the human RCE1 gene products are bona fide prenyl protein proteases and suggest that they play a major role in the processing of CAAX-type prenylated proteins. A variety of proteins are modified with an isoprenoid lipid at a cysteine that is initially four residues from the C terminus (1Schafer W.R. Rine J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 209-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 2Clarke S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Such proteins contain the so-called CAAX motif, in which the “C” is the modified cysteine, the “A” residues are most commonly (but not always) aliphatic amino acids, and the “X” residue can be one of several amino acids. TheX residue determines whether the protein is modified by the 15-carbon farnesyl lipid or the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl. If theX residue is a leucine, the protein will be geranylgeranylated; several other residues (e.g. Met, Ser, Ala, and Gln) direct farnesylation. Following prenylation of the protein, two additional processing steps occur (4Ashby M.N. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 5Rando R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). First, a specific protease cleaves the -AAX tripeptide from the protein, leaving the prenylated cysteine as the new C terminus. The carboxyl group of the prenylcysteine is then methylated by a specific methyltransferase. It is well established that protein prenylation plays a vital role in the membrane localization and function of most prenylated proteins (6Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The role that the proteolysis and methylation of prenyl proteins play in their function, however, is not as well understood. Studies on peptides have demonstrated that each processing step significantly increases the affinity of farnesylated peptides for membranes (7Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), although the effect of the final two steps is not as great for geranylgeranylated peptides. Proteolysis and methylation also increased the hydrophobicity of Ras proteins processed in an in vitrosystem (8Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Prevention of the proteolysis of Ras in cells resulted in a decrease in membrane localization (9Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M.

Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and in yeast it resulted in at least a partial loss of Ras function (10Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The enzymes responsible for prenylation of CAAX-containing proteins, protein farnesyltransferase and protein geranylgeranyltransferase I, have been cloned and studied in detail (3Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Additionally, a specific prenyl protein carboxymethyltransferase has been identified in yeast as the product of the STE14gene (11Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and a human homologue of the STE14 gene product has recently been described (12Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). These findings have left the prenyl protein protease as the only member of the processing pathway yet to be identified on a molecular level. Recently, an elegant genetic screen in yeast resulted in the identification of two candidate genes for prenyl protein proteases (10Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The first gene, AFC1/STE24, appeared to be primarily involved in the processing of the precursor to a-factor, a farnesylated yeast mating pheromone. AFC1/STE24 catalyzes two cleavage events on thea-factor precursor, the first being the C-terminal proteolysis and the second being a cleavage occurring near the N terminus of the peptide (10Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 13Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 635-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Strong evidence was provided that the second candidate gene, RCE1, was involved in the processing of the yeast Ras proteins, in addition to the C-terminal processing of thea-factor precursor (10Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 15Schmidt W.K. Tam A. Fujimura-Kamada K. Michaelis S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11175-11180Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Because RCE1 was linked to the processing of a prenyl protein, it seemed likely that the RCE1 gene product might have a broader range of substrates than AFC1/STE24. We report here the identification, expression, and preliminary characterization of a human homologue of RCE1, termed hRCE1. Evidence is provided that hRCE1 is in fact a prenyl protein protease and that it is involved in the processing of a variety of CAAX-type prenylated proteins, including all known forms of Ras. These findings open the door for molecular studies of this protease and will facilitate studies aimed at determining the roles of the proteolysis and methylation steps in the functions of CAAX-type prenyl proteins.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6394-6398Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). That screen yielded a clone containing the likely initiation codon, because it contained an upstream stop codon in-frame with the coding sequence. The 5′ end of the HUVEC cDNA containing the initiation codon was removed as a BssHII-XcmI fragment and ligated to the human fetal brain cDNAXcmI-PstI fragment to generate a hRCE1 cDNA containing the entire open reading frame. ThisBssHII-PstI fragment was subcloned into the vector pFASTBAC-1 to produce p-FASTBAC-1-hRCE1. In a second construct, designated pFASTBAC-1-ΔhRCE1, the 5′-untranslated region of hRCE1 was replaced with a portion of the 5′-untranslated region from the baculovirus polyhedron gene (CCTATAAAT), and the codons specifying the first 22 amino acids of hRCE1 were removed (see Fig. 1). A 32P-labeled probe was generated with random hexamer priming from the 1100-bpBssHII-PstI hRCE1 cDNA fragment and hybridized to a human multi-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot (obtained from CLONTECH); hybridization and washing were performed as described previously (21Glick J.L. Meigs T.E. Miron A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26008-26013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The process was repeated using a probe made to the cDNA of β-actin as a control. Expression of RCE1 was also examined using a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). The blot was probed with a 223-bp Rce1 cDNA fragment that was amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) with oligonucleotide primers 5′-TTGCCCTTGTGACCTGACAGATGG-3′ and 5′-GAGTGGGCAGGTGAACACAGCAGG-3′. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced with the pFASTBAC-1 vector and the protocol provided in the Bac-2-Bac Baculovirus Expression System kit. Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared for the two human RCE1 constructs described above, for yeast RCE1, and for the yeast prenyl protein carboxymethyltransferaseSTE14. For production of recombinant proteins, Sf9 cells in log phase growth were diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and infected with recombinant baculoviruses at multiplicities of infection ranging from 2 to 10. Cells producing yeast or human RCE1 were harvested 72 h post-infection and resuspended in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.7. Cells expressing yeast STE14 were harvested 60 h post-infection, and resuspended in 5 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm EDTA (11Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and a mixture of protease inhibitors (22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In all cases, cells were disrupted by sonication, nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 500 ×g for 5 min, and membranes were then pelleted by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1.5 h. Membranes from RCE1 producing cells were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, whereas membranes from cells producing STE14 were resuspended in 5 mm NaHPO4 containing 5 mm EDTA and the protease inhibitor mixture (22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Final protein concentrations of the membrane suspensions were 10–25 mg/ml. The suspensions were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C in multiple aliquots. Unprenylated Ki-Ras (18James G.L. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Ki-Ras, N-Ras, and Rap1b each had an N-terminal hexahistidine tag, whereas Ha-Ras and Gγ1 were unmodified. Ki-Ras, Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and Gγ1 were farnesylated by incubation of 2 μm protein with 20 μg/ml purified farnesyltransferase (22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 6 μm farnesyl diphosphate in buffer A (5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm GDP, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7) for 1 h at 37 °C. Ki-Ras and Rap1b were geranylgeranylated by incubation of 2 μm protein with 20 μg/ml purified geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (22Moomaw J.F. Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 6 μm geranylgeranyl diphosphate in buffer A for 1 h at 37 °C (23Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S.

A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Farnesyl-Ki-Ras and geranylgeranyl-Ki-Ras were resolved from the unprenylated precursor and modifying enzyme by applying the prenylation reactions to a heptyl-Sepharose column, which was washed with buffer B (50 mm Hepes, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm GDP) containing 0.1% lubrol (removing unprenylated Ki-Ras and the prenyltransferase), and then eluting the purified prenyl-Ki-Ras with buffer B containing either 2% sodium cholate (farnesyl-Ki-Ras) or 4% sodium cholate (geranylgeranyl-Ki-Ras). The eluted prenyl-Ki-Ras preparations were diluted 20-fold in buffer B and applied to an S-Sepharose column. The column was washed with buffer B, and the prenyl-Ki-Ras was eluted with buffer B containing 0.1% octylglucoside and 750 mm NaCl. Purified prenyl-Ki-Ras stocks were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C in multiple aliquots. The peptides CVIM and GSPCVLM were prenylated chemically as described previously (26Thissen J.A. Gross J.M. Subramanian K. Meyer T. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30362-30370Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Protease reactions were initiated by the addition of membranes containing the recombinant prenyl protein protease to an assay mixture containing prenylated proteins in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 5 mmMgCl2 in a total volume of 50 μl; reactions were conducted at 37 °C. Following the proteolysis reaction, methylation of proteolysed prenylated protein was initiated by addition of 20 μg of membranes containing STE14 to the reaction in 17.5 μm[3H]AdoMet (2000 Ci/mmol), 5 mmNaHPO4, pH 7.0, 62.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, and 300 μm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chlorophenyl ketone in a total volume of 20 μl. The addition of EDTA and protease inhibitors served both to quench the proteolysis reaction and to inhibit proteases present in the STE14 membranes. Stoichiometric methylation was achieved within 20 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding 0.5 ml 4% SDS along with 50 μg of bovine brain cytosol as carrier protein (27Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and 3H-methylated protein was quantitated using a filter assay (23Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar, 25Casey P.J. Thissen J.A. Moomaw J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8631-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 27Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Protease assays were also performed directly on prenylated proteins following their prenylation. In these assays, a 45-μl prenylation reaction was performed as described above, and the concentration of prenylated protein generated in the reaction was determined. The prenylated protein was diluted to the desired concentration in buffer A, and a source of membranes was added to the mixture. The assay then proceeded as described above. The deduced amino acid sequence of yeast RCE1 was used to search a human EST data base, and the entry W96411 was identified as a potential homologue. Five additional overlapping ESTs were identified giving a composite sequence of 725 amino acids. A full-length hRCE1 clone was assembled from a clone isolated from a human fetal brain cDNA library, which contained the 3′ end of the cDNA, and a clone isolated from a HUVEC cDNA library, which contained the 5′ end of the cDNA. The transcript was 1500 bp, not including polyadenylation, and had an open reading frame that encoded a 329-amino acid protein (Fig. 1). The strongest homology between the yeast and human proteins was found in a region from Arg166 to Pro270 of hRCE1 (42% identity and 68% similarity), suggesting that the active site of the enzyme could reside in this region. This region was also highly conserved in a potential homologue of RCE1 found in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome data base (CEF48F5). As reported for yeast RCE1 (10Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), the deduced amino acid sequence of hRCE1 contained multiple predicted transmembrane domains (not shown). Examination of hRCE1 expression by Northern blotting revealed a primary band of 1.8 kilobases, which was expressed in all tissues tested (Fig.2 A). A faint 2.4-kilobase band was also evident in some tissues. Examination of RCE1 expression in mouse tissues, using a probe corresponding to a sequence found in the mouse data base, gave stronger evidence of the presence of larger transcripts, which may represent alternatively spliced variants of RCE1 (Fig. 2 B). High level expression of the yeast carboxymethyltransferase STE14 inSf9 cells has allowed development of a coupled assay for prenyl protein proteolysis that utilizes proteins prenylatedin vitro as substrates and quantitates C-terminal proteolysis by stoichiometric methylation. In preliminary experiments, we found that expression of the cDNA encoding yeast RCE1 inSf9 cells by infection with a recombinant baculovirus resulted in a dramatic increase (>1000-fold) in prenyl protein protease activity in the cells (Fig. 3); subfractionation of cell extracts revealed that all of the activity was found in the membrane fraction (data not shown). It was this demonstration that the yeast RCE1 gene encoded an authentic prenyl protein protease that compelled us to search for and ultimately clone hRCE1. Although attempts to express full-length cDNA encoding hRCE1 in insect cells were unsuccessful, when a construct in which the first 22 codons of the hRCE1 were deleted (designated ΔhRCE1) was expressed in Sf9 cells, a dramatic (>1000-fold) increase in prenyl protein protease activity was observed in the membrane fraction (Fig. 3). Recombinant hRCE1 produced by expression of the ΔhRCE1 construct utilized both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated Ki-Ras as substrates, with both substrates exhibiting apparent K m values of approximately 0.5 μm (Fig.4 A) and similark cat values, indicating that the enzyme has similar catalytic efficiencies for farnesylated and geranylgeranylated substrates. Farnesyl-Ha-Ras, farnesyl-N-Ras, farnesyl-Gγ1, and geranylgeranyl-Rap1b were also found to be substrates for hRCE1 (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that the enzyme can utilize a broad range of CAAX-type prenyl protein substrates. Competition studies were performed with peptides corresponding to the C termini of Ki-Ras (CVIM) and of mouse N-Ras (GSPCVLM) to determine whether the enzyme could recognize unprenylated as well as prenylated substrates. GSPCVLM and CVIM that contained farnesylated cysteine residues were able to compete for the processing of prenylated Ki-Ras, whereas the corresponding unprenylated peptides could not, demonstrating both that hRCE1 is specific for prenylated proteins and that it recognizes short prenylated peptides (Fig.4 C). Additionally, the activity of a previously identified inhibitor of prenyl protease activity, a reduced farnesyl-peptide analogue termed RPI (19Ma Y.T. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2386-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Chen Y. Ma Y.T. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was examined. The RPI compound was indeed an extremely effective inhibitor of hRCE1, exhibiting an IC50 of approximately 5 nm (Fig.4 D). The first report of prenyl protein protease activity indicated that proteolysis (and methylation) occurs in a membrane compartment in cells (8Hancock J.F. Cadwallader K. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Subsequent in vitro studies have focused on membrane fractions in analysis of this processing step. Two distinct activities have been characterized. The first activity was tightly bound by membranes (28Hrycyna C.A. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10457-10464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Ma Y.T. Rando R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9500-9507Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and could only be released by detergents (20Chen Y. Ma Y.T. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Nishii W. Muramatsu T. Kuchino Y. Yokoyama S. Takahashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Jang G.F. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4473-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The second activity was loosely associated with membranes and could be solubilized by a freeze-thaw process (34Akopyan T.N. Couedel Y. Orlowski M. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For the purpose of comparison, these activities have been described as microsomal and soluble (35Hitz A.M. Georgopapadakou N.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The microsomal enzyme exhibits an apparently higher affinity for the prenyl peptide CVIM (K m of 0.65 μm) (20Chen Y. Ma Y.T. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) than the soluble enzyme (K mof 32 μm) (34Akopyan T.N. Couedel Y. Orlowski M. Fournie-Zaluski M.C. Roques B.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on competition-type assays, the microsomal enzyme exhibited a 250-fold specificity for prenylated peptides over unprenylated peptides, whereas the soluble enzyme reportedly had only a 5-fold specificity (35Hitz A.M. Georgopapadakou N.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Additionally, only the microsomal enzyme was inhibited by the RPI compound (19Ma Y.T. Gilbert B.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2386-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Chen Y. Ma Y.T. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3227-3237Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 35Hitz A.M. Georgopapadakou N.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The activity described herein for hRCE1 is most similar to the above-mentioned microsomal activity, based on its apparentK m for farnesyl-Ki-Ras (∼0.5 μm), its specificity for prenylated proteins, and the potent inhibition observed with the RPI compound. The variety of substrates that hRCE1 processed in vitrosuggests that it plays a major role in the processing of prenylated proteins in cells. Indeed, in an independent study, fibroblasts prepared from mouse embryos in which the RCE1 gene was disrupted failed to process the Ras proteins, as well as other prenylated proteins (36Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Identification of the hRCE1 cDNA and the ability to produce substantial quantities of enzyme in Sf9 cells will provide several major advantages for its study. First, the high level expression of hRCE1 will allow detailed examination of its activity, including screening for specific inhibitors, with minimal concerns of background. Additionally, the high level production system will provide a platform for the purification of the enzyme and will allow initiation of structural approaches to its study. Finally, in combination with the overexpression of yeast carboxymethyltransferase, the tools are now in place to generate large amounts of processing intermediates of prenyl proteins, which should be quite useful in examining the properties that each of the processing steps import to the functions of prenylated proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2084544096,"Data from western United States short-period seismic networks reveal a conversion from an S to a P wave within a low seismic velocity layer (greater than or equal to the 4 percent velocity difference compared to the surrounding mantle) in the mid–lower mantle (1400 to 1600 kilometers deep) east of the Mariana and Izu-Bonin subduction zones. The low-velocity layer (about 8 kilometers thick) dips 30° to 40° southward and is at least 500 kilometers by 300 kilometers. Its steep dip, large velocity contrast, and sharpness imply a chemical rather than a thermal origin. Ancient oceanic crust subducted into the lower mantle is a plausible candidate for the low-velocity layer because of its broad thin extent."

This disagreement is resolved by a new analytic theory. The theory shows that the chaos among the jovian planets results from the overlap of the components of a mean motion resonance among Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, and provides rough estimates of the Lyapunov time (10 7 years) and the dynamical lifetime of Uranus (10 18 years). The jovian planets must have entered the resonance after all the gas and most of the planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk were removed."
https://openalex.org/W2106402455,"Upon exposure to stress signals, the p53 tumor suppressor protein is stabilized and induces growth suppression. p53 activities are efficiently inhibited by the Mdm2 oncoprotein through an autoregulatory feedback loop. In addition, Mdm2 promotes p53 degradation, thereby terminating its growth inhibitory signal. Hence, p53 exerts its effects during the interval between p53 activation and the subsequent inhibition by Mdm2. Modulation of this interval by regulatory proteins may determine the extent and duration of p53 activity. Recent studies have shown that the c-Abl protein-tyrosine kinase binds p53 and enhances its transcriptional activity. Here we provide an explanation for the cooperation between these proteins. We demonstrate that c-Abl increases the expression level of the p53 protein. The enhanced expression is achieved by inhibiting Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. This provides a likely mechanistic explanation for the findings that c-Abl overcomes the inhibitory effects of Mdm2 on p53-mediated transcriptional activation and apoptosis. These results suggest that c-Abl modulates the time window within which p53 remains active. The ability of c-Abl to neutralize the inhibitory effects of Mdm2 on p53 may be important for its growth inhibitory function."

The gene coding for human prostate-specific membrane antigen, a marker of prostatic carcinomas, and its rat homologue glutamate carboxypeptidase II have recently been shown to possess such NAALADase activity. In contrast, a closely related member of this gene family, rat ileal 100-kDa protein, possesses a dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity.

Furthermore, we describe the cloning of a third novel member of this gene family, NAALADase II, which codes for a type II integral membrane protein and which we have localized to chromosome 11 by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Transient transfection of NAALADase II cDNA confers both NAALADase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity to COS cells.

NAAG has been localized to specific sub-populations of neurones and is one of the most abundant peptides in brain, being present in millimolar concentrations in certain brain regions (for review see Ref. 1Coyle J.T. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Clarification of the physiological role of NAAG has been difficult because it is co-localized with glutamate, however, it does fulfill some of the criteria for a neurotransmitter. It is localized in synaptic vesicles and is released in Ca2+-dependent manner from nerve terminals (1Coyle J.T. Neurobiol. Dis. 1997; 4: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system NAAG has been shown to act as a weak partial agonist at N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors but not at α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid or kainate receptors (2Valivullah H.M. Lancaster J. Sweetnam P.M. Neale J.H. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3Puttfarcken P.S. Handen J.S. Montgomery D.T. Coyle J.T. Werling L.L. J. Pharmacol.

NAAG attenuatesN-methyl-d-aspartate- or glutamate-induced neurodegeneration, and its addition to hippocampal slices or mixed cortical cultures results in neuroprotection following addition of excitotoxins, via a mechanism distinct from the action of NAAG on theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (5Bruno V. Wroblewska B. Wroblewski J.T. Fiore L. Nicoletti F. Neuroscience. 1998; 85: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this case it is postulated that NAAG, which is poorly transported or actively taken up, diffuses from the synaptic cleft and binds as an agonist to type II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR), such as mGluR 3, leading to reduced glutaminergic neurotransmission (6Wroblewska B. Wroblewski J.T. Saab O.H. Neale J.H. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 943-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 7Wroblewska B. Wroblewski J.T. Pshenichkin S. Surin A. Sullivan S.E. Neale J.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by studies using the mGluR 3 antagonist, ethyl glutamate, which eliminated the neuroprotective actions of NAAG (5Bruno V. Wroblewska B. Wroblewski J.T. Fiore L.

Subsequently, a 94-kDa membrane glycoprotein purified from rat brain was shown to possess an NAALADase-type activity similar to that previously described from brain extracts (10Slusher B.S. Robinson M.B. Tsai G. Simmons M.L. Richards S.S. Coyle J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21297-21301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera raised to this protein were used by Carter et al. (11Carter R.E. Feldman A.R. Coyle J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) to screen rat brain expression libraries resulting in the cloning of a novel rat partial cDNA. The full-length coding sequence was cloned, and the protein it encoded was termed glutamate carboxypeptidase II (EC 3.4.17.21; also called NAAG peptidase; 12, 13). This rat gene sequence was 86% identical to the human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSM), a cDNA of previously unknown function, which is highly expressed in prostate tumors (14Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection studies with PSM into NAALADase-negative cell lines conferred a NAAG-hydrolyzing activity to these cells that could be inhibited by the NAALADase inhibitor QA, demonstrating the first functional expression of a NAALADase cDNA clone (11Carter R.E. Feldman A.R. Coyle J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). PSM has also been shown to possess a second enzymatic activity, that of a pteroyl-poly-γ-glutamylcarboxypeptidase (15Pinto J.T. Suffoletto B.P. Berzin T.M. Qiao C.H. Lin S. Tong P.T. May F. Mukherjee B. Heston W.D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1445-1451PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a novel 100-kDa glycoprotein has been cloned, from rat ileal brush border membranes, which is homologous to but distinct from human PSM and rat glutamate carboxypeptidase II based on amino acid sequence. This protein possesses a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) type activity, being able to hydrolyze Gly-Pro 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, but has no reported NAALADase activity (16Shneider B.L. Thevananther S. Moyer M.S. Walters H.C. Rinaldo P. Devarajan P. Sun A.Q. Dawson P.A. Ananthanarayanan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31006-31015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For ease of understanding we have simplified the nomenclature used in this report to reflect the relatedness of these protein sequences. Human PSM and rat glutamate carboxypeptidase II (or rat NAAG peptidase) are termed human and rat NAALADase I, respectively. We have also termed ileal 100-kDa protein an NAALADase-“like” peptidase (NAALADase L) based on its sequence similarity to NAALADase I but lack of any functional NAALADase activity. In this study we describe the cloning, expression, and characterization of a third novel member of this enzyme family, human NAALADase II, that is similar to but distinct from NAALADase I and NAALADase L. In addition we have identified, expressed, and characterized the full coding sequence of human NAALADase L. Using the complete human (GenBankTMaccession number M99487), rat (GenBankTM accession number RNU75973), and mouse (GenBankTM accession number AF026380) NAALADase I protein sequences, the complete rat NAALADase L (GenBankTM accession number AF009921) protein sequence and a partial human NAALADase L protein sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AF010141) as query sequences, a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70663) Google Scholar) search was performed on the WashU Merck expressed sequence tag (EST) data base and on a proprietary LifeSeqTMhuman EST data base. Five EST clones 4190746, 1547649, 3448872, 3608639, and 1333965 were ordered from Incyte Pharmaceuticals. The DNA insert of each clone was sequenced on both strands using Applied Biosystems prism BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing kits and an Applied Biosystems 377XL sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). Sequence data from human NAALADase I (GenBankTM accession number M99487) was used to design primers to amplify the complete coding sequence of NAALADase I by PCR. Primers used were NAALD1S2 (BamHI) = 5′-CCCGGATCC GAG ATG TGG ATT CTC CTT CAC GAA AC-3′ and NAALD1AS2(XhoI) = 5′-CCC CTCGAGTTA GGC TAC TTC ACT CAA AGT CTC TGC -3′ (restriction sites to be introduced are underlined). PCR amplification was performed using Marathon-Ready human prostate cDNA (CLONTECH) and the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim) with primers NAALD1S1(BamHI) and NAALD1AS1(XhoI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All PCR reactions began with an initial denaturation step (94 °C for 5 min) prior to addition of enzyme, followed by 30 cycles of amplification (45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min 48 s at 68 °C) and ended with a final extension step (7 min at 72 °C). A 2303-bp PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1 according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). A full-length clone containing a single PCR-induced error, at position 1183, was corrected by site-directed mutagenesis (SDM) using the QuickChange SDM Kit (Stratagene). Primers designed for the SDM reactions were NAALD1-SDM-S1 = 5′-CCC TCA GAG TGG AGC AGC TGT TGT TCA TGA AAT TGT GAG G-3′ and NAALD1-SDM-AS1 = 5′-CCT CAC AAT TTC ATG AAC AAC AGC TGC TCC ACT CTG AGG G-3′. Sequence data from partial human NAALADase L (GenBankTM accession number AF10141) was used to design primers to amplify the 3′ end of NAALADase L by PCR. First round PCR amplification was performed with NAALDLS1 = 5′-GTT CTT CAA CAA GCT GCA GGA GCG -3′ and NAALDLAS1(XhoI) = 5′- CCCCTCGAG CCG GAG TAA AGG GAG GGC TGA AG-3′. Second round PCR amplification was performed with nested primers NAALDLS2 = 5′-GGC GAC CTG AGC ATC TAC GAC AAC-3′ and NAALDLAS2 (XhoI) = 5′- CCC CTCGAG TCC CCT CAG AGG TCA GCC ACA G-3′. Cycling conditions were similar to those described above (30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 57 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C). PCR products derived from Marathon-Ready human small intestine cDNA were cloned into pCR2.1 and extended to the translation termination codon of NAALADase L. To obtain unknown 5′ coding sequence for human NAALADase L, antisense primers were designed for the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE); antisense primers NAALDLAS5 = 5′-CTG CAG CTT GTT GAA CTC TTC TGT G-3′ and NAALDLAS6 = 5′-CAA ACA CGA TTG ATC TGC GAG GAC-3′ were synthesized for amplifications using various human Marathon-ReadyTMcDNAs. Cycling conditions were as described previously. PCR products derived the small intestine cDNA amplifications were cloned into pCR2.1 and found to extend the coding sequence beyond the putative translation start codon and into part of the 5′-untranslated region. To construct a full-length NAALADase L clone, primers were designed to introduce a unique restriction site (MunI) into the DNA sequence of NAALADase L without changing the amino acid sequence of the ORF. The first primer set was NAALDLS3 (EcoRV) = 5′-CGGATATCC GCA GGA TGC AGT GGA CGA AG-3′ and NAALDLAS8 (MunI) = 5′-CAA ACACAATTG ATC TGC GAG GAC GC-3′ and the second primer set was NAALDLS8 (MunI) = 5′-GCG TCC TCG CAG ATCAATTGT GTT TG-3′ and NAALDLAS1 (XhoI). The base change introducing theMunI site is marked in bold. PCR amplification was performed on the 3′ end clone with primers NAALDLS3 (EcoRV) and NAALDLAS8 (MunI) and on the 5′ end clone with primers NAALDLS8 (MunI) and NAALDLAS1 (XhoI). PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 and sequence-verified as described previously. It should also be noted that amplifications using NAALADase L-specific primers resulted in a number of PCR products of unexpected size using different cDNAs. These PCR products were cloned and sequenced in order to identify possible splice variants. Sequencing results from Incyte clone 3608639, derived from a human lung cDNA, suggested that this clone contained a DNA sequence spanning the complete coding region of a putative NAALADase-like molecule (NAALADase II) similar to but distinct from NAALADase I and NAALADase L. Sequential 5′-RACE PCR performed with antisense primers NAALD2AS1 = 5′-CTT TGA TGA TAG CGC ACA GAA GTG G-3′ and NAALD2AS2 = 5′-GGA AAG ATG CCA GCG CAG GAC-3′ failed to identify any potential upstream initiation codons in amplifications using brain, fetal brain, prostate, small intestine, and colon human Marathon-Ready cDNAs. NAALADase I, II, and L clones were subcloned into the cytomegalovirus promoter-based plasmid pcDNA3. NAALADase I/pCR2.1 was digested withBamHI/XhoI to excise the complete NAALADase I sequence. NAALADase II/pINCYTE was digested with EcoRI to excise the complete NAALADase II sequence. NAALADase L-5′/pCR2.1 was digested with EcoRV/MunI, and NAALADase L-3′/pCR2.1 was digested with MunI/XhoI to excise the two halves of complete NAALADase L sequence. All expression constructs subcloned into pcDNA3 were verified by full sequence analysis. COS cells were maintained in complete medium (defined minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1× non-essential amino acids, and a 1× streptomycin/penicillin/glutamine mix). Cell titer was determined in a Coulter counter, and cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2 and allowed to reach approximately 80% confluence. For each transfection 6 μl of FuGENE6 (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) was added to 96 μl of serum-free medium and incubated for 5 min at 20 °C. This preparation was added to a second tube containing 1 μg of NAALADase/pcDNA3 DNA, mixed gently, and allowed to stand for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA/FuGENE6/serum-free medium mix was pipetted into a well containing 2 ml of fresh complete medium. Cells were incubated for 72 h in a 37 °C incubator before harvesting. Transfected COS cell pellets were scraped with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100 and vortexed. Homogenates were put through at least one freeze/thaw cycle in liquid N2 before assay. Assay were performed as described previously (9Robinson M.B. Blakely R.D. Couto R. Coyle J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14498-14506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for each NAALADase, using equivalent numbers of cells or equivalent protein content, usingN-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-3,4-[3H]glutamate ([3H]NAAG). Assays were initiated by the addition of the membrane homogenates to the pre-warmed assay mixture and incubated at 37 °C for various times. Reactions were terminated by addition of ice-cold 250 mm potassium phosphate and loaded onto 4-cm anion exchange mini-columns (Bio-Rad AG1-X8). [3H]Glutamate was eluted off the column with 0.5m formic acid and counted in a scintillation counter (Packard). Inhibition curves were performed under similar conditions with increasing concentrations of QA. Assays were performed on cell samples from at least three independent transient transfections. DPP IV activity was determined by fluorescent analysis (excitation at 335 nm and emission 450 nm) of the hydrolysis of Gly-Pro-AMC as described previously (16Shneider B.L. Thevananther S. Moyer M.S. Walters H.C. Rinaldo P. Devarajan P. Sun A.Q. Dawson P.A. Ananthanarayanan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31006-31015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Assays were initiated by the addition of cellular homogenates (135 μg of total protein per reaction) to the buffered substrate solution (100 μm in 150 mmglycine, pH 8.5) in a total reaction volume of 100 μl and followed for 40 min at 37 °C. Chromosomal mapping studies were carried out by SeeDNA Biotech (Ontario, Canada) using FISH analysis. Lymphocytes isolated from human blood were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. The lymphocyte cultures were treated with bromodeoxyuridine (0.18 mg/ml, Sigma) to synchronize the cell population. The synchronized cells were washed three times with serum-free medium to release the block and re-cultured at 37 °C for 6 h in Lymphocytes isolated from human blood were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. The lymphocyte cultures were treated with bromodeoxyuridine with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml). Cells were harvested and slides were prepared using standard procedures including hypotonic treatment, fixations, and air drying. NAALADase I (bp 1–2252) and NAALADase II (bp 1–2503) probes and a partial NAALADase L probe (bp 1220–2276) were biotinylated with dATP for 1 h at 15 °C using the BioNick labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The procedure for FISH detection was performed as described previously (17Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70663) Google Scholar, 18Heng H.H. Tsui L.-C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA derived from non-neuronal tissues were hybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) for 2 h at 68 °C. A 546-bp NAALADase II fragment, isolated from NAALADase II/pcDNA3 by digestion with EcoRI and BglII, was radiolabeled using a Rapid Multiprime Labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [32P]dCTP (NEN Dupont). Unincorporated label was removed using a Microspin S-200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the denatured probe (specific activity = 2.6 × 108dpm/μg) was incubated overnight at 68 °C in ExpressHyb. Washes were performed at high stringency (55 °C in 0.1× sodium chloride sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS) and blots exposed to X-Omat AR Film (Eastman Kodak) for 2 days at −70 °C with two intensifying screens. 0ligonucleotide primers were designed for the specific amplification of a PCR fragment for each NAALADase; NAALADase I primers were NAALD1S3 5′-GGG AAA CAA ACA AAT TCA GCG GC-3′ and NAALD1AS3 5′-GTC AAA GTC CTG GAG TCT CTC ACT GAA C-3′ yielding a 341-bp product; NAALADase II primers were NAALD2S4 5′-CAC TAA GAA TAA GAA AAC AGA TAA GTA CAG C-3′ and NAALD2AS4 5′-GAT CAA CTT GTA TAA GTC GTT TAT GAA AAT CTG-3′ yielding a 353-bp product; and NAALADase L primers were NAALDLS7 5′-GAC CGG AGC AAG ACT TCA GCC AG-3′ and NAALDLAS7 5′-GTG TTG ATA TGC GTT GGC CCA AG-3′ yielding a 330-bp product. Each primer set was tested for its ability to specifically amplify the desired NAALADase and not to cross-react in amplification reactions with the other two family members (data not shown). These primers sets were used for PCR amplifications on human multiple tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH) normalized to the mRNA expression levels of six different housekeeping genes. Control PCR amplifications using GAPDH-specific primers (CLONTECH) were also used. Human cDNAs from carefully dissected brain regions, transformed prostate tumor cell lines, and a prostate tumor tissue sample were prepared from mRNA using an Expand Reverse Transcriptase kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and normalized to the mRNA expression levels of three different housekeeping genes, GAPDH, clathrin, and actin. PCR reactions with NAALADase or GAPDH-specific primers were performed with Advantage Taq polymerase mix (95 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min 30 s). Upon completion of 25 cycles, the PCR machine was paused at 80 °C, and a 15-μl aliquot was removed from each PCR tube. Tubes were returned to the machine, and the cycling method was continued. Further aliquots were removed after 30 and 35 cycles. Samples were analyzed agarose by gel electrophoresis, and images of the ethidium bromide-stained gels were captured using an Eagle Eye II system (Stratagene). Incyte Pharmaceutical clones 1547649, 3448872, 3608639, and 1333965 contained sequences originating from a single gene similar to but not identical to NAALADase I or NAALADase L. Clone 3608639, from a lung carcinoma cDNA library, contained a DNA sequence with a 2223-bp ORF coding for a 740-amino acid residue protein, which we termed NAALADase II (Fig.1). Analysis of this open reading frame predicted a calculated molecular mass of 83,590 kDa and isoelectric point of 8.53. The putative ATG translation start codon is in a favorable context for translation initiation (19Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and no ATG codons were detected upstream. NAALADase II was predicted to be a type II integral membrane protein containing a hydrophobic membrane spanning domain extending from amino acid residues 8–31 (20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). There are also seven potential N-glycosylation sites (N × S/T) as indicated in Fig. 1. Similarity searching of the LifeSeqTMdata base (Incyte Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA) with the human, rat, and mouse NAALADase I sequences and with rat and partial human NAALADase L protein sequences yielded 13 EST sequences, some of which were overlapping, encoding for a novel protein sequence similar to NAALADase I. DNA obtained from six of the clones were sequenced. Incyte Pharmaceuticals clone 4190746, isolated from a cerebellar cDNA library, contained known sequences corresponding to human NAALADase L (16Shneider B.L. Thevananther S. Moyer M.S. Walters H.C. Rinaldo P. Devarajan P. Sun A.Q. Dawson P.A. Ananthanarayanan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31006-31015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). However, because this DNA sequence also contained two segments of intronic sequence, it was not suitable for further cloning experiments. PCR reactions were performed to amplify a PCR product containing the 3′-half of the NAALADase L coding region from small intestine cDNA. To identify the remaining unknown human 5′-NAALADase L sequence, 5′-RACE PCR was performed on a number of cDNAs. Sequencing of the amplification products obtained from reactions using small intestine cDNA yielded a further 1344-bp fragment covering the complete coding sequence of NAALADase L. The full cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 2223 bp encoding a protein of 740 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 80,638 Da and isoelectric point of 5.26 (Fig.2). The putative ATG translation start codon is in a favorable context for translation initiation (19Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar) with no ATG codons detected upstream. Analysis of the human NAALADase L ORF suggests that it is a type II integral membrane protein containing a single hydrophobic membrane spanning domain extending from amino acid residues 6–27, with lysine residues bordering either side of the potential membrane spanning domain (20Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). There are seven potentialN-linked glycosylation sites (N × S/T) as indicated in Fig. 2. The predicted protein sequences of human NAALADase L were compared with that of rat using the alignment program Genedoc. Human NAALADase L protein sequence was 78% identical and 87% similar to rat NAALADase L. In the course of our cloning and RT-PCR gene expression analysis of NAALADase L, a number of amplified PCR products of unexpected size were observed, isolated, and sequenced in order to identify possible splice variants. We found both the splicing out of putative exon sequences as well as the presence of intronic sequences (as judged by the presence of G(T/A)G donor/acceptor sites) that were repeatedly amplified from our cDNA preparations (Fig. 3). When performing 5′-RACE amplifications, deletions between bases 497–619 and 903–1007 were identified in small intestine and colon that resulted in two in-frame amino acid residue deletions. In addition, PCR products have been obtained containing a 153-bp intron insertion at base 1094 resulting in an in-frame amino acid insertion of 51 amino acid residues. This insertion is most likely an intron as it has the consensus G(T/A)G donor acceptor sites at its 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17210) Google Scholar). In the PCR amplifications of the 3′ end of NAALADase L, several variants were also identified from small intestine, colon, brain, and fetal brain. These consisted of either a deletion of bases 1525–1615 or a larger deletion between bases 1525 and 1697 (Fig. 3). Both these deletions resulted in frameshifts and the premature termination of the protein sequence. Finally, in every cDNA sample examined, two intronic sequences were found to be inserted at either base 1697 and/or at base 1870. Inclusion of one or both of these intronic sequences into the ORF of NAALADase L accounted for PCR products of unexpected size seen in RT-PCR experiments migrating at 420 and 500 bp. Introduction of one or both these sequences results in a frameshift and therefore in altered amino acid sequence and premature stop (Fig. 3). The predicted protein sequences of NAALADase I, II, and L were compared with each other using the alignment program BESTFIT (Genetics Computer Group Software, WI), and the percent identity and percent similarity between each pair of sequences were calculated by the Genedoc program. NAALADase I sequence was 67% identical (81% similar) to NAALADase II and 35% identical (54% similar) to NAALADase L, whereas NAALADase II and L sequences were 37% identical (54% similar). The three protein sequences for NAALADase I, II, and L were aligned using the ClustalW alignment program (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) and are shown in Fig.4. A phylogram of NAALADase I, II, and L was constructed using the GCG Distances program with standard parameters and the Growtree program with the UPGMA method and is depicted in Fig. 5. From this phylogram it is clear that NAALADase I and II are the most closely related proteins. Two putative catalytic domains have previously been identified in rat NAALADase I and L sequences by comparison to other peptidases (12Bzdega T. Turi T. Wroblewska B. She D. Chung H.S. Kim H. Neale J.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2270-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Shneider B.L. Thevananther S. Moyer M.S. Walters H.C. Rinaldo P. Devarajan P. Sun A.Q. Dawson P.A. Ananthanarayanan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31006-31015Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By using multiple sequence alignments of NAALADase I, II, and L, we have identified similar putative catalytic domains in human NAALADase II and L (Fig. 4 and 6). The first catalytic domain is related to bacterial and yeast Zn2+-dependent peptidase domains (12Bzdega T. Turi T. Wroblewska B. She D. Chung H.S. Kim H. Neale J.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2270-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the second catalytic domain is related to members of the α/β hydrolase fold family of proteins (16Shneider B.L. Thevananther S. Moyer M.S. Walters H.C. Rinaldo P. Devarajan P. Sun A.Q. Dawson P.A. Ananthanarayanan M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2078475797,"The activity of the transcription factor NF-κB can be modulated by members of the Rho family of small GTPases (Perona, R., Montaner, S., Saniger, L., Sánchez-Pérez, I., Bravo, R., and Lacal, J. C. (1997) Genes Dev. 11, 463–475). Ectopic expression of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs proteins induces the translocation of NF-κB dimers to the nucleus, triggering the transactivation of the NF-κB-dependent promoter from the human immunodeficiency virus. Here, we demonstrate that activation of NF-κB by RhoA does not exclusively promote its nuclear translocation and binding to the specific κB sequences. NF-κB is also involved in the regulation of the transcriptional activity of the c-fosserum response factor (SRF), since the activation of a SRE-dependent promoter by RhoA can be efficiently interfered by the double mutant IκBαS32A/S36A, an inhibitor of the NF-κB activity. We also present evidence that RelA and p50 NF-κB subunits cooperate with the transcription factor C/EBPβ in the transactivation of the 4 × SRE-CAT reporter. Furthermore, RhoA increases the levels of C/EBPβ protein, facilitating the functional cooperation between NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and SRF proteins. These results strengthen the pivotal importance of the Rho family of small GTPases in signal transduction pathways which modulate gene expression and reveal that NF-κB and C/EBPβ transcription factors are accessory proteins for the RhoA-linked regulation of the activity of the SRF. The activity of the transcription factor NF-κB can be modulated by members of the Rho family of small GTPases (Perona, R., Montaner, S., Saniger, L., Sánchez-Pérez, I., Bravo, R., and Lacal, J. C.

Gene expression is regulated by the interplay of different transcription factors which bind to specific DNA recognition motifs and cooperate with the basal machinery to initiate transcription. During the last few years, an emerging body of evidence is revealing the importance of crossed interactions between members of distinct families of transcription factors to form higher complexes, enabling the accurate regulation of this process. The serum response element (SRE) 1The abbreviations used are:SRE, serum response element; SRF, serum response factor; TCF, ternary complex factor; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; β-gal, β-galactosidase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CMV, cytomegalovirus. is a specific DNA sequence which is found in the promoter of several immediate-early genes (2Treisman R.

The prototypic c-fos SRE binds a ternary complex composed of a homodimer of p67SRF (serum response factor) and a third subunit, p62TCF (ternary complex factor), which belongs to the Ets family of accessory proteins. These TCF factors have the ability to bind a purine-rich motif 5′ to the SRF-binding site, known as the Ets recognition domain, only when SRF is bound to DNA, and include Elk-1, SAP-1, and SAP-2/ERP/NET proteins. The formation of this SRE binding-ternary complex requires the conserved B-box motif of the Ets subunits and sequences located in the core domain of the SRF protein (coreSRF), which is a region that is also responsible of its DNA binding and dimerization capabilities (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 3Mueller C.G.F. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4219-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4Janknecht R.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The SRE has shown to be necessary and sufficient for the rapid induction of the c-fos proto-oncogen in response to different external stimuli such as serum, growth factors, and phorbol esters (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 9Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this DNA motif is a point of convergence of different signal transduction cascades activated by an extensive range of agonists. The regulation of the activity of the SRE is mediated by two different signaling pathways. The first mechanism is elicited by the multiple phosphorylation of TCFs within their C-terminal transactivation domain. Such phosphorylation can be triggered by distinct families of mitogen-activated protein kinases. Actually, whereas the classical Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade is responsible of the phosphorylation of TCFs proteins after growth factors or phorbol esters stimulation (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 10Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R.

The second signaling pathway which controls an efficient transcriptional activation through the SRE site is mediated by the SRF. Hill et al. (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar) showed that this TCF-independent regulation is modulated by members of the Rho family of small GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs. Indeed, stimulation of the transcriptional activity of the SRF induced by serum, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), and AlF4- (an activator of heterotrimeric G proteins) is signaled by RhoA in NIH 3T3 cells, since the expression of the C3 component of the Clostridium botulinum toxin efficiently blocks this effect. Fromm et al. (19Fromm C. Coso O.A. Montaner S. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10098-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) have also found that the Gα12 subfamily of heterotrimeric G protein α subunits is able to induce the SRE activity by a RhoA-dependent pathway. On the other hand, Rac1 GTPase plays an essential role in the activation of the c-fos SRE induced by certain agents such as the epidermal growth factor and hydrogen peroxide (20Kim B.-C. Kim J.-H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 21Kim J.-H. Kwack H.-J. Choi S.-E. Kim B.-C. Kim Y.-S. Kang I.-J. Kumar C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 496: 93-96Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whereas Hillet al. (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar) have described that Rac1 and Cdc42Hs GTPases can activate the SRF in a RhoA-independent manner, other authors have found a link between these signaling cascades (22Kim B.C. Lim C.-J. Kim J.-H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism by which Rho proteins can modulate the transcriptional activation through the c-fos SRE is ill defined. It has been proposed that this regulation may be targeted by a second, unknown accessory protein, distinct from TCFs, which could interact with the DNA-bound p67SRF (3Mueller C.G.F. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4219-4229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar, 23Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5920-5928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5421-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As other results suggest that the SRF contains different sequences which can inhibit its own transactivation capability (25Johansen F.-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4640-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it is possible that such interaction could relieve the transactivation domain from this inhibitory effect. And, moreover, this putative recognition factor should be a critical target for Rho family-mediated signal transduction pathways. Our group has recently demonstrated that the Rho family of small GTPases can efficiently induce the transcriptional activity of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sánchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The NF-κB complex is mainly composed of two subunits of 50 and 65 kDa which are retained in the cytoplasm by a third protein, IκB. These IκB inhibitory proteins block the ability of the dimer to translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression (27Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

This transcription factor has shown to play a relevant role in the control of cell growth and apoptosis, along with different aspects of the immune and inflammatory responses (30Baldwin Jr., A.S.

RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs are able to trigger the transactivation of the NF-κB dependent-HIV promoter in different cell lines. The mechanism involved is the conventional nuclear translocation of RelA/p50 and p50/p50 dimers, by a mechanism that involves the phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of the inhibitory subunit IκBα. Moreover, this activation is independent of that induced by H-Ras/Raf cascade (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sánchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Montaner S. Perona R. Saniger L. Lacal J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12779-12785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Different interactions of the NF-κB dimers with other families of transcription factors have been widely reported (reviewed in Ref. 27Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1995; 66: 255-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been described that RelA can act as an accessory protein for the SRF and a physical association between both subunits have been demonstrated in vitro (42Franzoso G. Carlson L. Brown K. Daucher M.B. Bressler P. Siebenlist U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The formation of this complex seems to be mediated through the Rel homology domain of RelA and the DNA-binding domain of SRF, which has shown to exert a negative effect on its transactivation ability. Furthermore, RelA functionally synergizes with SRF in the transactivation of a reporter construct dependent only on the SRE site, indicating that the direct or facilitated interaction between both proteins may neutralize the inhibitory functions of the core domain of SRF. In the present study, we have investigated the implications of RhoA-dependent activation of NF-κB in the regulation of p67SRF function. We demonstrate that NF-κB modulates the transcriptional activity of the SRF induced by this GTPase. Furthermore, this mechanism may also involve a cross-talking of RelA and p50 NF-κB subunits with the transcription factor C/EBPβ, which is also able to bind to the SRF and regulate its transactivation activity (43Sealy L. Malone D. Pawlak M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1744-1755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, members of the NF-κB and C/EBP families of transcription factors can interact and behave as accessory proteins in the modulation of the transcriptional activity of the SRF induced by the small GTPase RhoA. Simian COS-7 fibroblast-like cells were cultured in Dulbeccos′s modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 mmglutamine. Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in DMEM with 10% newborn calf serum. For transient expression assays, cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes by the calcium phosphate method as described (44Perona R. Esteve P. Jiménez B. Ballestero R.P. Ramón y Cajal S. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1285-1292PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of plasmidic DNA was kept constant at 9–10 μg/plate with the corresponding empty vector. The total amount of DNA was kept at 30 μg/100-mm plate with calf thymus DNA (Boehringer Mannheim). After the precipitate was removed, cells were incubated in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum for the next 24 h. Cells were stimulated during the last 5 h of culture where indicated and harvested for the different assays. Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection of the plasmid pCMV-β-gal, and the β-galactosidase assay as described previously (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sánchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCDNAIIIB plasmid (Invitrogen) and derived expression vectors encoding for constitutively activated RhoA (QL), Rac1 (QL), and Cdc42Hs (QL) proteins have been described previously (45Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). (−453/+80)HIV-LUC contains the NF-κB sites of the HIV enhancer/promoter and ΔNF-κB HIV-LUC contains a 3-base pair substitution in each of the NF-κB-binding sites (46Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The promoters of the different reporters contain the following specific motifs: 4 × SRE-CAT, (4X) (AGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT) the sequence of the SRE-binding site of the human c-fos gene 5′ from a minimum promoter harboring the TATA box (54König H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf U. Büscher M. Schönthal A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); SREMUT-CAT promoter contains the mutations (AGGATGTCAATACTAGGACATCT) that prevents binding of the SRF, as previously reported (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sánchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); SRE-β-gal, the sequence of the SRE-binding site of the human c-fos gene 5′ from a minimum promoter containing the TATA box; and 3D.A.CAT, a minimal c-fos promoter SRE with a TCF-defective binding site inserted 5′ to a Xenopus γ-actin TATA box (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). pMEX-RelA(p65) and pMEX-p50 were provided by Dr. Bravo. pMSV-C/EBPβ was generously provided by Dr. Pérez-Castillo and contains the rat C/EBPβ gene. pMSV-LIP was obtained by deletion of the 5′ coding region of the C/EBPβ gene, digested with the NcoI enzyme (48Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The following plasmids have been previously described: pMEX derived vector encoding for a truncated Vav protein (PJC7) (49Coppola J. Bryant S. Koda T. Conway D. Barbacid M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 95-105PubMed Google Scholar); PCEV27 derived vector encoding for a truncated Ost protein (50Horii Y. Beeler J.F. Sakaguchi K. Tachibana M. Miki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4776-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); and EXV-RasVal-12 (51del Peso L. Lucas L. Esteve P. Lacal J.C. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and pRcCMV-IκBαS32A/S36A (52Whiteside S.T. Ernst M.K. LeBail O. Laurent-Winter C. Rice N. Israël A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5339-5345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the NF-κB activity was performed by transfection of the reporter containing the wild-type κB sites of the HIV enhancer/promoter, (−453/+80)HIV-LUC, and the one containing 3-base pair substitutions in each NF-κB site, ΔNF-κB HIV-LUC. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and the protein extracts were prepared by three consecutive cycles of freezing and thawing. The total amount of protein was determined with a commercial kit based on the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). 2 μg of protein were assayed for luciferase activity using a commercial kit (Promega). For the SRE-binding site, both 4 × SRE-CAT and 3D.A.CAT reporters were used in this study. Protein extracts were prepared and 10–50 μg were assayed for the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity as described previously (53Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were corrected by the ratio of the luciferase or CAT activity and the β-gal activity obtained in the same sample by co-transfection of the pCMV-β-gal plasmid. None of the proteins used in this study affected considerably the levels of transcriptional activation of pCMV-β-gal because similar levels were always observed when compared with the respective empty plasmids. Measurement of the activation of the chromosomal SRE-β-gal plasmid was performed as follows: NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the pSV2Neo vector along with a SRE-β-gal plasmid and selected for G418 resistance. Approximately 200 colonies obtained by serial dilution were tested for β-galactosidase activity after serum stimulation. Four selected clones were then transfected with the pCDNAIIIB-derived expression vectors encoding for the constitutively activated Rho proteins and cells were incubated in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum for the next 24 h. Cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde and incubated at 37 °C for β-gal activity staining, using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside as substrate. Efficiency of transfections were normalized by parallel transfections using the pCMV-β-gal plasmid. For protein expression assays, cells were transfected with the corresponding plasmids and incubated in DMEM, 0.5% fetal calf serum for the next 24 h. The lysis was performed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The total amount of protein was determined with a commercial kit based on the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Lysates were obtained in 1 × SDS Laemmli buffer. Thirty micrograms of total protein were analyzed by SDS-electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE). After transferring to nitrocellulose, the blots were incubated with the corresponding rabbit antiserum (p50, RelA(p65), C/EBPβ) (Santa Cruz Laboratories). Immunocomplexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham) using a biotinylated anti-rabbit antibody and streptavidin peroxidase. Rho proteins are able to activate the transcription factor NF-κB in diverse cell systems (1Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sánchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the serum response factor in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (18Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). We aimed to investigate whether activation of NF-κB by Rho proteins was functionally related to the activation of the SRE-dependent transcriptional activity. We first identified a suitable cell system to carry out both assays, NF-κB activation and SRE-dependent transcription, under similar conditions. The NF-κB-dependent (−453/+80)HIV-luciferase (HIV-LUC) plasmid was used (47Devary Y. Rosette C. DiDonato J.A. Karin M. Science. 1993; 261: 1442-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) as a reporter for NF-κB activity. This reporter contains two κB-binding sites within its enhancer region, which are mostly responsible for the transactivation of the HIV LTR. Fibroblast-like COS-7 cells were co-transfected with the cDNAs encoding for the constitutively activated forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs (QL) proteins along with the HIV-LUC plasmid. As shown in Fig.1 A, an efficient transactivation of the HIV promoter could be readily observed. This effect was dependent on the κB-binding sites since the activation was completely avoided when a HIV-LUC reporter containing 3-base pair substitutions in each κB motif was used (data not shown). Under similar conditions, Rho proteins were also able to induce the transactivation of a 4 × SRE-CAT reporter in the same cell line (Fig. 1 B). The 4 × SRE-CAT plasmid contains the CAT gene under the control of a minimum promoter composed of four copies of the sequence of the SRE of the human c-fos gene along with a TATA box (54König H. Ponta H. Rahmsdorf U. Büscher M. Schönthal A. Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2559-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when both constitutively activated forms of two Rho family related exchange factors, Vav and Ost (55Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), were overexpressed (Fig. 1 B). Although there is a clearly positive and reproducible response with a 3–4-fold induction by serum, this is reduced compared with other cell systems. We also were able to demonstrate a more than 10-fold activation by serum when the NIH 3T3 cell system was used instead of the COS-7 cell sytem using the same reporter vectors (data not shown). These results demonstrate that these three members of the Rho family of GTPases mediate in the signal transduction pathways implicated in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB and in the up-regulation of intracellular cascades which promote gene expression through the SRE-binding site in the simian fibroblast-like COS-7 cells. Artificious regulation of the SRE-driven transcription due to the characteristic episomal replication of a transfection system based on COS-7 cells could affect the results. In order to eliminate this possibility we also investigated whether SRE-dependent transcription could be stimulated by Rho proteins in cells stably transfected with a plasmid carrying the SRE-binding site in a non-episomal vector. NIH 3T3 cells were stably transfected with the pSV2Neo vector along with the SRE-β-gal plasmid and selected for G418 resistance. Over 200 different resistant colonies obtained by serial dilution were isolated and tested for β-galactosidase activity after serum stimulation. Four of them that scored close to 100% staining when stimulated by serum were selected for further analysis. Cells were transiently transfected with the pCDNAIIIB-derived expression vectors encoding for the constitutively activated forms of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs GTPases and cells expressing the β-galactosidase were scored as positive. Efficiency of transfection for each plasmid preparation was normalized by parallel transfections using the β-galactosidase gene placed under control of the CMV promoter, allowing for constitutive expression of the β-galactosidase enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the three GTPases were able to promote transactivation through the chromosomal SRE site in one of the selected clones by at least 2-fold. Cdc42Hs was much more efficient, suggesting additional signaling pathways activated by Cdc42 to those activated by RhoA and Rac1, in agreement with the results reported by Albertset al. (56Alberts A.S. Geneste O. Treisman R. Cell. 1998; 92: 475-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Similar results were observed when the other three independent clones were used (data not shown). Thus, these results provide a strong support to the implication of Rho GTPases in signal transduction pathways which determine the activation of transcription due to the SRE sequences under physiological conditions and establishes that the COS-7 cell system is appropriate to carry out the proposed experiments. It has been previously reported that the different Rel/NF-κB proteins are able to interact physically and functionally with members of other families of transcription factors such as AP1, Sp1, Stat6, ATF, HMG/Y, the glucocorticoid receptor, TBP, TFIIB, and C/EBP (57LeClair K.P.

In order to understand better how ACK-2 activity is regulated in cells, we have expressed epitope-tagged forms of this tyrosine kinase in COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells. We find that ACK-2 can be activated by cell adhesion in a Cdc42-dependent manner. However, unlike the focal adhesion kinase, which also is activated by cell adhesion, the activation of ACK-2 is F-actin-independent and does not require cell spreading. In addition, overexpression of ACK-2 in COS-7 cells did not result in the stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity but rather activated the c-Jun kinase. Both anti-integrin β1 antibody and RGD peptides inhibited the activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion. In addition, ACK-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with integrin β1. Overall, these findings suggest that ACK-2 interacts with integrin complexes and mediates cell adhesion signals in a Cdc42-dependent manner.

The complexity of the effects mediated by Cdc42 may reflect a subtle balance or coordination between cytoskeletal organization and mitogenesis that is necessary for cells to process signals that regulate both cell morphology and cell growth.It is known that cell adhesion in adherent cells directly regulates both cytoskeletal organization and cell mitogenesis (32Hynes R.O.

Anchorage-independent growth becomes a criterion for cell transformation, indicating that cell adhesion has a key function for normal cell growth. In fact, overexpression of integrin molecules or their associated proteins prevents abnormal cell growth and recovers anchorage-dependent growth (35Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that integrin signaling mediates a balance between cytoskeletal organization and mitogenic progression. However, the connection between these two cellular events is not clear. Previous studies indicate that Rho proteins play important roles in cell adhesion (1Hall A.

Overexpression of a GTPase-defective mutant, Cdc42(G12V), or a constitutively active mutant, Cdc42(F28L), resulted in anchorage-independent growth (10Qiu R.-G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol.

Recent studies have shown that Cdc42 mediates integrin β1 signaling and promotes cell migration (39Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The Cdc42 targets that mediate these effects are not known, although a number of Cdc42 targets have been reported to regulate F-actin polymerization and depolymerization (17Symons M. Derry J.M.J.

Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar).The ACKs are members of a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that specifically interact with Cdc42 (14Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that ACK-2 is activated by cell adhesion on a substratum in a Cdc42-dependent manner. The activation does not require cell spreading. The RGD peptide and an anti-integrin β1antibody inhibit the activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion, and ACK-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with integrin β1, indicating a role for integrins in the regulation of this Cdc42 target.DISCUSSIONIt is well known that Rho-related small GTP-binding proteins regulate cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. Given that cell adhesion induces marked changes in the actin cytoskeleton, it seems likely that the Rho-related proteins will also play roles in bridging adhesion-dependent signaling with effects on the cytoskeletal architecture. Along these lines, Cdc42 and Rac have recently been shown to mediate integrin β1 signaling in cell migration (39Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), suggesting that cell adhesion or integrins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac (see also Ref. 46Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Tiam-1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, is involved in cell invasion (47Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and Rac has been shown to participate in cadherin signaling in epithelial cells and to inhibit Ras-induced cell invasion (48Hordijk P.L. Ten Klooster J.P. Van Der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C.J.M. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). An obviously important question will be to identify the target molecules for Cdc42 and Rac that mediate the effects of cell adhesion. Based on our initial studies with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase ACK-2 (15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we felt that it was an attractive candidate for such a role. Specifically, we had earlier shown that ACK-2 was activated upon cell adhesion (15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we show that ACK-2 can be activated by cell adhesion via the β1 integrin in a Cdc42-dependent manner and that ACK-2 appears to associate with an integrin complex.It is interesting to note that the activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion clearly differs from that of FAK. Activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion does not require cell spreading nor an intact F-actin structure, whereas the activation of FAK requires both. There are two possible explanations for this difference. 1) ACK-2 and FAK participate in distinct integrin signaling pathways, or 2) ACK-2 is upstream from FAK during cell adhesion signaling. However, the latter possibility seems unlikely given that we have not observed that overexpression of ACK-2 enhances FAK tyrosine phosphorylation.A particularly interesting distinction between ACK-2 and FAK concerns the ability of polylysine to activate ACK-2. Based on the inhibitory effects of anti-integrin β1 and GRD peptides on polylysine-induced activation of ACK-2, at least part of the activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion onto polylysine-coated plates appears to be mediated through β1 integrin. However, when cells adhere onto polylysine-coated plates, they can only attach to the plates but are not able to spread, indicating that cells plated on polylysine can not form stress fibers (45Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The inability of the cells to spread when plated on polylysine probably explains why FAK is not activated under these conditions. It has been reported that cells adhered onto polylysine form filopodia, suggesting that Cdc42 may be activated upon cell adhesion on polylysine (49Defilippi P. Olivo C. Tarone G. Mancini P. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and thus providing a link to ACK-2 activation. We have also observed that some protrusions appear from the bottom of cells that are attached to polylysine-coated plates (data not shown). These protrusions have been described as point contacts that are distinct from focal contacts (49Defilippi P. Olivo C. Tarone G. Mancini P. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 50Tawil N. Wilson P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been further proposed that in fibroblasts, α1β1 and α5β1 integrin heterodimers first accumulate in point contacts followed by their redistribution into focal contacts (in astrocytes, the accumulation of α1β1heterodimers in point contacts was shown to occur when cells were plated on either polylysine, fibronectin, or laminin (49Defilippi P. Olivo C. Tarone G. Mancini P. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Thus, cell attachment on either polylysine or fibronectin, leading to an accumulation of integrins in point contacts, may represent an early signal for the activation of Cdc42 and then ACK-2. Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a proto-oncogene and involved in cell invasion and tumor cell metastasis, shows a similar activation behavior as ACK-2 upon cell adhesion, i.e. it is activated upon plating cells on polylysine (51Wang R. Kobayashi R. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8425-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, thus far we have not found any signaling connection between ACK-2 and Met.Overall, the findings reported here now provide a possible molecular basis for the signaling connections between integrins/cell adhesion and Cdc42. The mechanisms underlying the apparent activation of Cdc42 by cell adhesion, which lead to the recruitment and/or activation of ACK-2, remain to be delineated. However, it appears that upon activation, Cdc42 may reverse an intramolecular interaction within ACK-2 which then makes the kinase accessible to interact with other binding partners or possibly substrates. At present, we know relatively little about the downstream signaling pathways that are engaged following ACK-2 activation, although the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway does not appear to be involved. Although we have found that overexpression of ACK-2 stimulates JNK activity, it is difficult to assess the importance of this activation in vivo given that a number of tyrosine kinases including Src, Pyk2, Abl, and Btk have also been shown to stimulate JNK activity (52Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 53Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, as yet, we have not been able to show a significant activation of JNK activity upon cell attachment. Thus, either one or more of the signaling participants that may connect cell adhesion to JNK activation was limiting in our experiments, or the observation that overexpression of ACK-2 resulted in JNK activation reflected an aberrant signaling pathway triggered by the higher than normal levels of ACK-2. We suspect that ACK-2 may play some specialized roles in cell differentiation, since it is highly enriched in brain and skeletal muscle (15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One interesting possibility is that ACK-2 may be activated by extracellular matrix proteins that guide neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells or the differentiation of muscle cells. Future efforts will be directed toward determining thein vivo function of ACK-2 in specific tissues and identifying its downstream targets.

Functional analyses of these targets indicate that some are involved in cytoskeletal organization, such as the Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome proteins, IQGAPs and PAKs, whereas others regulate JNK activation or mitogenesis, including the PAKs, mixed lineage kinase-3, p70 S6 kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The specific cellular activities of Cdc42 that are mediated by these targets have been variable and sometimes contradictory. Thus, activation of Cdc42 has been suggested both to stimulate (17Symons M. Derry J.M.J. Karlak B. Jiang S. Lemahieu V. McCormick F. Francke U. Abo A.

The complexity of the effects mediated by Cdc42 may reflect a subtle balance or coordination between cytoskeletal organization and mitogenesis that is necessary for cells to process signals that regulate both cell morphology and cell growth. It is known that cell adhesion in adherent cells directly regulates both cytoskeletal organization and cell mitogenesis (32Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 33Gumbiner B.M.

Anchorage-independent growth becomes a criterion for cell transformation, indicating that cell adhesion has a key function for normal cell growth. In fact, overexpression of integrin molecules or their associated proteins prevents abnormal cell growth and recovers anchorage-dependent growth (35Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), suggesting that integrin signaling mediates a balance between cytoskeletal organization and mitogenic progression. However, the connection between these two cellular events is not clear. Previous studies indicate that Rho proteins play important roles in cell adhesion (1Hall A.

Kimura K. Fukuta Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a GTPase-defective mutant, Cdc42(G12V), or a constitutively active mutant, Cdc42(F28L), resulted in anchorage-independent growth (10Qiu R.-G. Abo A. McCormick F. Symons M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 6: 3449-3458Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 11Lin R. Bagrodia S. Cerione R. Manor D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 794-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), suggesting that Cdc42 may mediate cell adhesion signals that regulate both cytoskeletal organization and mitogenesis. Recent studies have shown that Cdc42 mediates integrin β1 signaling and promotes cell migration (39Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The Cdc42 targets that mediate these effects are not known, although a number of Cdc42 targets have been reported to regulate F-actin polymerization and depolymerization (17Symons M. Derry J.M.J.

The ACKs are members of a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that specifically interact with Cdc42 (14Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that ACK-2 is activated by cell adhesion on a substratum in a Cdc42-dependent manner. The activation does not require cell spreading. The RGD peptide and an anti-integrin β1antibody inhibit the activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion, and ACK-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with integrin β1, indicating a role for integrins in the regulation of this Cdc42 target. DISCUSSIONIt is well known that Rho-related small GTP-binding proteins regulate cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. Given that cell adhesion induces marked changes in the actin cytoskeleton, it seems likely that the Rho-related proteins will also play roles in bridging adhesion-dependent signaling with effects on the cytoskeletal architecture. Along these lines, Cdc42 and Rac have recently been shown to mediate integrin β1 signaling in cell migration (39Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), suggesting that cell adhesion or integrins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac (see also Ref. 46Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Tiam-1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, is involved in cell invasion (47Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and Rac has been shown to participate in cadherin signaling in epithelial cells and to inhibit Ras-induced cell invasion (48Hordijk P.L. Ten Klooster J.P. Van Der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Oomen L.C.J.M. Collard J.G. Science. 1997; 278: 1464-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). An obviously important question will be to identify the target molecules for Cdc42 and Rac that mediate the effects of cell adhesion. Based on our initial studies with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase ACK-2 (15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we felt that it was an attractive candidate for such a role. Specifically, we had earlier shown that ACK-2 was activated upon cell adhesion (15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here we show that ACK-2 can be activated by cell adhesion via the β1 integrin in a Cdc42-dependent manner and that ACK-2 appears to associate with an integrin complex.It is interesting to note that the activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion clearly differs from that of FAK. Activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion does not require cell spreading nor an intact F-actin structure, whereas the activation of FAK requires both. There are two possible explanations for this difference. 1) ACK-2 and FAK participate in distinct integrin signaling pathways, or 2) ACK-2 is upstream from FAK during cell adhesion signaling. However, the latter possibility seems unlikely given that we have not observed that overexpression of ACK-2 enhances FAK tyrosine phosphorylation.A particularly interesting distinction between ACK-2 and FAK concerns the ability of polylysine to activate ACK-2. Based on the inhibitory effects of anti-integrin β1 and GRD peptides on polylysine-induced activation of ACK-2, at least part of the activation of ACK-2 by cell adhesion onto polylysine-coated plates appears to be mediated through β1 integrin. However, when cells adhere onto polylysine-coated plates, they can only attach to the plates but are not able to spread, indicating that cells plated on polylysine can not form stress fibers (45Schlaepfer D.D. Jones K.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The inability of the cells to spread when plated on polylysine probably explains why FAK is not activated under these conditions. It has been reported that cells adhered onto polylysine form filopodia, suggesting that Cdc42 may be activated upon cell adhesion on polylysine (49Defilippi P. Olivo C. Tarone G. Mancini P. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and thus providing a link to ACK-2 activation. We have also observed that some protrusions appear from the bottom of cells that are attached to polylysine-coated plates (data not shown). These protrusions have been described as point contacts that are distinct from focal contacts (49Defilippi P. Olivo C. Tarone G. Mancini P. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 50Tawil N. Wilson P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been further proposed that in fibroblasts, α1β1 and α5β1 integrin heterodimers first accumulate in point contacts followed by their redistribution into focal contacts (in astrocytes, the accumulation of α1β1heterodimers in point contacts was shown to occur when cells were plated on either polylysine, fibronectin, or laminin (49Defilippi P. Olivo C. Tarone G. Mancini P. Torrisi M.R. Eva A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). Thus, cell attachment on either polylysine or fibronectin, leading to an accumulation of integrins in point contacts, may represent an early signal for the activation of Cdc42 and then ACK-2. Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a proto-oncogene and involved in cell invasion and tumor cell metastasis, shows a similar activation behavior as ACK-2 upon cell adhesion, i.e. it is activated upon plating cells on polylysine (51Wang R. Kobayashi R. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8425-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, thus far we have not found any signaling connection between ACK-2 and Met.Overall, the findings reported here now provide a possible molecular basis for the signaling connections between integrins/cell adhesion and Cdc42. The mechanisms underlying the apparent activation of Cdc42 by cell adhesion, which lead to the recruitment and/or activation of ACK-2, remain to be delineated. However, it appears that upon activation, Cdc42 may reverse an intramolecular interaction within ACK-2 which then makes the kinase accessible to interact with other binding partners or possibly substrates. At present, we know relatively little about the downstream signaling pathways that are engaged following ACK-2 activation, although the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway does not appear to be involved. Although we have found that overexpression of ACK-2 stimulates JNK activity, it is difficult to assess the importance of this activation in vivo given that a number of tyrosine kinases including Src, Pyk2, Abl, and Btk have also been shown to stimulate JNK activity (52Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 53Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Moreover, as yet, we have not been able to show a significant activation of JNK activity upon cell attachment. Thus, either one or more of the signaling participants that may connect cell adhesion to JNK activation was limiting in our experiments, or the observation that overexpression of ACK-2 resulted in JNK activation reflected an aberrant signaling pathway triggered by the higher than normal levels of ACK-2. We suspect that ACK-2 may play some specialized roles in cell differentiation, since it is highly enriched in brain and skeletal muscle (15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One interesting possibility is that ACK-2 may be activated by extracellular matrix proteins that guide neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells or the differentiation of muscle cells. Future efforts will be directed toward determining thein vivo function of ACK-2 in specific tissues and identifying its downstream targets. It is well known that Rho-related small GTP-binding proteins regulate cytoskeletal organization and cell morphology. Given that cell adhesion induces marked changes in the actin cytoskeleton, it seems likely that the Rho-related proteins will also play roles in bridging adhesion-dependent signaling with effects on the cytoskeletal architecture. Along these lines, Cdc42 and Rac have recently been shown to mediate integrin β1 signaling in cell migration (39Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), suggesting that cell adhesion or integrins induce the activation of Cdc42 and Rac (see also Ref. 46Price L.S. Leng J. Schwartz M.A. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Tiam-1, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rac, is involved in cell invasion (47Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar), and Rac has been shown to participate in cadherin signaling in epithelial cells and to inhibit Ras-induced cell invasion (48Hordijk P.L.

Met, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is a proto-oncogene and involved in cell invasion and tumor cell metastasis, shows a similar activation behavior as ACK-2 upon cell adhesion, i.e. it is activated upon plating cells on polylysine (51Wang R. Kobayashi R. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8425-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, thus far we have not found any signaling connection between ACK-2 and Met. Overall, the findings reported here now provide a possible molecular basis for the signaling connections between integrins/cell adhesion and Cdc42. The mechanisms underlying the apparent activation of Cdc42 by cell adhesion, which lead to the recruitment and/or activation of ACK-2, remain to be delineated. However, it appears that upon activation, Cdc42 may reverse an intramolecular interaction within ACK-2 which then makes the kinase accessible to interact with other binding partners or possibly substrates. At present, we know relatively little about the downstream signaling pathways that are engaged following ACK-2 activation, although the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway does not appear to be involved. Although we have found that overexpression of ACK-2 stimulates JNK activity, it is difficult to assess the importance of this activation in vivo given that a number of tyrosine kinases including Src, Pyk2, Abl, and Btk have also been shown to stimulate JNK activity (52Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27622-27628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 53Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J.

Moreover, as yet, we have not been able to show a significant activation of JNK activity upon cell attachment. Thus, either one or more of the signaling participants that may connect cell adhesion to JNK activation was limiting in our experiments, or the observation that overexpression of ACK-2 resulted in JNK activation reflected an aberrant signaling pathway triggered by the higher than normal levels of ACK-2. We suspect that ACK-2 may play some specialized roles in cell differentiation, since it is highly enriched in brain and skeletal muscle (15Yang W. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24819-24824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One interesting possibility is that ACK-2 may be activated by extracellular matrix proteins that guide neurite outgrowth of neuronal cells or the differentiation of muscle cells. Future efforts will be directed toward determining thein vivo function of ACK-2 in specific tissues and identifying its downstream targets. We thank Dr. Shubha Bagrodia for helpful discussions regarding JNK kinase assays and for providing the flag-tagged JNK plasmid. We appreciate the help of Cindy Westmiller in the preparation of this manuscript."

Met residues make up a large portion of its hydrophobic target binding surfaces. In this work, we have studied the surface exposure of the Met residues in the apo- and calcium-bound states of CaM in solution. Complexes of calcium-CaM with synthetic peptides derived from the CaM-binding domains of myosin light chain kinase, constitutive nitric-oxide synthase, and CaM-dependent protein kinase I were also studied. The surface exposure was measured by NMR by studying the effects of the soluble nitroxide spin label, 4-hydroxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy, on the line widths and relaxation rates of the Met methyl resonances in samples of biosynthetically 13C-methyl-Met-labeled CaM. The Met residues move from an almost completely buried state in apo-CaM to an essentially fully exposed state in Ca2+4-CaM. Binding of two Ca2+ to the C-terminal lobe of CaM causes full exposure of the C-terminal Met residues and a partial exposure of the N-terminal Met side chains. Binding of the three target peptides blocks the access of the nitroxide surface probe to nearly all Met residues, although the mode of binding is distinct for the three peptides studied. These data show that calcium binding to CaM controls the surface exposure of the Met residues, thereby providing the switch for target protein binding.

(1Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) is a ubiquitous calcium regulatory protein that is found in all eukaryotic cells. This small acidic protein (16.7 kDa) can regulate at least 30 different target proteins in a calcium-dependent manner (1Vogel H.J. Biochem.

Its target proteins include multiple components in muscle contraction such as myosin light chain kinases (MLCK), various protein kinases, protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), and nitric-oxide synthases. CaM responds to an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration from 10−7 to 10−6m in vivo. CaM's capacity to bind and activate a diverse range of target proteins originates in its structure. The x-ray structure of Ca2+-saturated CaM reveals a dumbbell-shaped molecule with each lobe containing two “helix-loop-helix” calcium binding motifs, giving a total of four Ca2+-binding sites (7Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 8Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The two lobes in Ca2+4-CaM are connected by a 26-residue highly exposed α-helix in the crystal structures (7Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 8Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In contrast, structural and dynamic information derived by NMR spectroscopy as well as molecular dynamics simulations indicates that the region between amino acids 77 and 81 in Ca2+4-CaM is flexible in solution (9Barbato G. Ikura M. Kay L.E. Pastor R.W. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 10van der Spoel D. de Groot B.L. Hayward S. Berendsen H.J. Vogel H.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2044-2053Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This central linker region in Ca2+4-CaM unravels further when a CaM-binding peptide from a target protein such as MLCK is bound (11Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 12Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). High resolution x-ray and NMR structures of the complexes between Ca2+4-CaM and the CaM-binding domain peptides of MLCK and CaM kinase II clearly indicate the different relative movement of the two lobes of CaM in the complexes as well as the bending and unraveling of the central linker region (11Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 12Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

This flexibility of the central linker region in Ca2+4-CaM is one of the key reasons that allows CaM to activate so many different systems. Another prominent feature that contributes to CaM's flexibility are the two Met-rich hydrophobic surfaces on the N- and C-lobes of CaM, which become exposed upon calcium binding to CaM. The majority of the hydrophobic residues that make up these surface areas are buried inside the protein in apo-CaM (14Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C.B. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 15Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In particular, all Met side chains involved in target binding are buried in apo-CaM, with the possible exceptions of Met124 and Met144, which appear to be partially exposed in the solution structure determined by NMR (15Zhang M. Tanaka T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 758-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Because the interactions between Ca2+4-CaM and CaM-binding domains in the target proteins are mainly through Van der Waal's interactions of the side chains, the importance of the two hydrophobic patches in Ca2+4-CaM for target protein binding is obvious (11Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 12Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

The Met residues contribute 46% to the solvent-accessible surface area of these two exposed hydrophobic surfaces in calcium-CaM (16O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In addition, almost all of the Met side chains in Ca2+4-CaM appear to be involved in binding to the CaM-binding domain peptides from MLCK, CaM kinase II, caldesmon, constitutive nitroxide synthase (cNOS), cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, glycoprotein 41 of simian immunodeficiency virus, CaM-dependent protein kinase I (CaMKI), and plant glutamate decarboxylase (2Crivici A.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the Met residues of CaM further illustrates the importance of their side chains in the binding and activation of various target proteins (20Zhang M. Li M. Wang J.

Compared with other aliphatic hydrophobic amino acid side chains, the Met side chains possess a unique intrinsic flexibility and polarizability due to the presence of the sulfur atom as noted by Gellman (26Gellman S.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6633-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The flexible and malleable surfaces in Ca2+4-CaM created by the Met side chains provide a highly adjustable interaction area that can accommodate the binding of a wide range of target proteins (1Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 2Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

It has been used for the characterization of different protein folding intermediates, identification of the critical residues involved in ligand-binding, and simplification of 1H NMR spectra for assignment purposes (Refs. 27Petros A.M.

Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The idea behind the TEMPOL method is that NMR resonances for residues that are (or become) exposed on the surface of proteins will be dramatically broadened by the paramagnetic nitroxide in the surrounding medium (34Petros A.M. Fesik S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, the relaxation rate of buried residues will not be influenced by this probe. As such, the relative surface exposure of various groups in a protein can be gauged. The method works well for studying hydrophobic areas on protein surfaces (27Petros A.M. Mueller L. Kopple K.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10041-10048Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Petros A.M. Fesik S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The combination of high sensitivity proton-detected 1H,13C heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) NMR spectra and the availability of the residue-specific assignments for the nine Met methyl groups in a number of physiologically relevant states of CaM provided us with a unique opportunity to investigate the Met methyl group exposure in solution for different states of CaM. Here we have studied apo-CaM, Ca2+2-CaM, Ca2+4-CaM, the Ca2+4-CaM-MLCK peptide complex, and complexes of Ca2+4-CaM with cNOS and CaMKI CaM-binding peptides. In addition, we have also studied the Met methyl groups in the separated N- and C-lobes of CaM (TR1C and TR2C) in the presence and absence of two Ca2+ions using the same experimental approach. Our results reveal that changes in the surface exposure of the Met side chains play a key role in allowing CaM to act as a versatile calcium regulatory protein. TEMPOL was purchased from Sigma. A synthetic mammalian CaM gene was expressed in Escherichia coli (35Waltersson Y. Linse S. Brodin P. Grundström T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7866-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,36Zhang M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22420-22428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purification of wild-type CaM and [methyl-13C]Met-labeled CaM was accomplished as described before (17Zhang M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Zhang M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22420-22428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-lobe of CaM, TR1C (residues 1–75), was cloned using the DNA polymerase chain reaction; the expression and purification of TR1C followed the same protocol as for wild-type CaM (17Zhang M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 36Zhang M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22420-22428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-lobe of CaM, TR2C (residues 78–148), was generated by limited tryptic digestion of intact CaM in the presence of saturating levels of calcium (37Fabian H. Yuan T. Vogel H.J. Mantsch H.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the purified TR2C fragment may contain three different fragments of slightly different length (38Thulin E. Andersson A. Drakenberg T. Forsén S. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1862-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the vast majority was the fragment 78–148, as determined by electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown). Two-dimensional 1H,13C HMQC NMR spectra of the [methyl-13C]Met-labeled TR2C fragment (see below) showed only about 20% intensity for the Met76 resonance compared with the other Met resonances (see Fig. 4 C), in agreement with the outcome of the protein mass spectrometry. The absence of trace calcium ions in apo-form preparations of CaM and fragments after Chelex 100 chromatography was confirmed by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. The MLCK peptide, cNOS peptide, and CaMKI peptide were commercially synthesized by the Core Facility for Protein/DNA Chemistry at Queen's University (Kingston, Ontario, Canada). The preparation of CaM-peptide complexes for NMR analysis has been described before (19Zhang M. Yuan T. Aramini J.M. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20901-20907Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 39Siivari K. Zhang M. Palmer III, A.G. Vogel H.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The concentration of CaM was calculated using an extinction coefficient of ε2761% = 1.8. The concentrations of the TR1C and TR2C fragments were determined by using molar extinction coefficients of ε258 = 1073m−1·cm−1 and ε276= 2666 m−1·cm−1, respectively, which were confirmed by quantitative amino acid analysis. EPR spectra were acquired at ambient temperature (22 °C) using a Bruker ER-200D-SRC spectrometer located at the Department of Chemistry, University of Alberta (Edmonton, Canada). The parameters used were as follows: modulation amplitude, 1 G; microwave power, 18 dB; microwave frequency, 9.770 GHz; time constant, 0.2 s. EPR spectra were acquired for 0.08 mm TEMPOL in the absence or presence of 16, 1, or 6 eq of Ca2+4-CaM. The solution contained 100 mm KCl, pH 7.50 ± 0.05, which was similar to the conditions used for the NMR experiments except that H2O was used as the solvent instead of D2O. EPR spectra of TEMPOL were also obtained in the presence of apo-CaM and the Ca2+4-CaM-MLCK peptide complex. All NMR samples contained 1 mm[methyl-13C]Met isotopically labeled protein in 100 mm KCl, 99.9% D2O. The pD was determined as 7.50 ± 0.05 using a glass electrode; no corrections for the isotope effects were made. All NMR spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer at 298 K. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were obtained with a sweep width of 6024 Hz and 128 scans. A 1-Hz line broadening was applied before the Fourier transformation. A concentrated stock solution of TEMPOL in D2O was prepared, and 1-μl amounts of the spin label were titrated into the protein sample. Two-dimensional 1H, 13C HMQC spectra were acquired as described before (39Siivari K. Zhang M. Palmer III, A.G. Vogel H.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Quadrature detection in the F1 dimension was obtained using the time-proportional phase increment method. The sweep width was 6 ppm in the 1H and13C dimensions, with the 1H carrier set at 500.1383 MHz and the 13C carrier at 125.7613 MHz. The size of the HMQC spectra gave a 1024 × 128 real data matrix with eight scans for each experiment. Spin-lattice relaxation (T 1) measurements were also performed as described before (39Siivari K. Zhang M. Palmer III, A.G. Vogel H.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), with a 1024 × 128 real data matrix and 32 scans for each experiment. The different relaxation delays used in theT 1 experiments were 10, 50, 150, 300, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500 ms. NMR spectra were processed on a Bruker X32 data station using Bruker UXNMR software. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were zero-filled to 1024 × 256, and a 72° sine square window function was applied before Fourier transformation.T 1 spectra were integrated using an integration subroutine in UXNMR, and the integration data were fitted to a single exponential decay curve to give the T 1 values (39Siivari K. Zhang M. Palmer III, A.G. Vogel H.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). All 1H chemical shifts are referenced to HDO as 4.78 ppm, which is further referenced to DSS (2, 2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate) as 0 ppm. All 13C chemical shifts are indirectly referenced to DSS using a converting ratio 13C/1H = 0.251449530 as suggested by Wishart et al. (40Wishart D. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). We first acquired EPR spectra of TEMPOL in the absence and presence of CaM to assess whether any specific interactions between TEMPOL and CaM existed. Such interactions have been reported for other proteins (e.g. Ref. 31Cocco M.J. Lecomte J.T.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and they complicate the interpretation of subsequent NMR experiments, where TEMPOL is used as a general relaxation enhancement reagent. The formation of complexes between the TEMPOL nitroxide spin label and the protein should lead to a broadening of the EPR nitroxide signal, accompanied by a commensurate decrease in the signal intensities (31Cocco M.J. Lecomte J.T.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 267-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig.1, no changes were detected in the EPR spectra of TEMPOL in the absence or presence of 6 eq of Ca2+4-CaM. We also did not observe any changes in the EPR spectra recorded with TEMPOL/Ca2+4-CaM at a ratio of 6, TEMPOL/apo-CaM at a ratio of 16 or 6, and the TEMPOL/Ca2+4-CaM-MLCK-peptide complex at a ratio of 16 or 6 (data not shown). Therefore, the outcome of these EPR studies indicates that there are no specific interactions between TEMPOL and CaM; consequently, the soluble spin label is suitable to probe the exposed hydrophobic surfaces and the exposure of Met methyl groups in CaM (29Esposito G. Lesk A.M. Molinari H. Motta A. Niccolai N. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Howarth J.W. Krudy G.A. Lin X. Putkey J.A. Rosevear P.R. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in our NMR studies of CaM in the presence of TEMPOL, we also did not observe any chemical shift changes for the Met methyl resonances, which is also consistent with the absence of specific interactions between the spin label and the protein (see below). Other relaxation enhancement reagents, such as lanthanide compounds, may give rise to specific interactions with proteins and chemical shift changes in the protein NMR spectra (41Peters J.A. Huskens J. Raber D.J. Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson. Spectrosc. 1996; 28: 283-350Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Thus, choosing TEMPOL as a reagent to probe the exposed hydrophobic surface in CaM seems appropriate. Three regions of the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of Ca2+4-CaM, which were recorded in the absence and presence of 6 eq of TEMPOL, are shown in Fig.2 A. Several resonances for aromatic side chains were significantly broadened upon the addition of TEMPOL. These observations are in accordance with the x-ray structure of Ca2+4-CaM, in which four Phe residues are found in the exposed hydrophobic patches (7Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 8Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The broadened upfield-shifted methyl proton resonances are also consistent with this notion. Val35, Val108, Ile27, and Ile100 are all part of the two exposed hydrophobic surface areas in the x-ray structure of Ca2+4-CaM (7Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar,8Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In contrast, the downfield-shifted α-proton resonances between 5.0 and 5.5 ppm are well protected from TEMPOL; these resonances correspond to the two buried β-sheets between the two Ca2+-binding loops in each lobe of Ca2+4-CaM in the x-ray structure (7Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 8Chattopadhyaya R. Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Relaxation enhancement effects caused by TEMPOL on the resonances in NMR spectra can be assessed quantitatively by measuring the enhancement of relaxation rates in the presence of TEMPOL (28Fesik S.W. Gemmecker G. Olejniczak E.T. Petros A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7080-7081Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Petros A.M. Neri P. Fesik S.W. J. Biomol.

Because all resonances (except for Met76) in1H, 13C HMQC spectra of [methyl-13C]Met-labeled Ca2+4-CaM disappeared in the presence of 1 eq of TEMPOL (data not shown), we decided to use only 0.4 eq of TEMPOL to study the relaxation effects in Ca2+4-CaM. Severe line broadening of the resonances of all of the Met methyl groups with the exception of Met76 can be seen in Fig.3 A. The four N-terminal Met residues (Met36, Met51, Met71, and Met72) and the four C-terminal Met residues (Met109, Met124, Met144, and Met145) showed an average 53 and 66% increase, respectively, in their13C spin-lattice relaxation rates (R 1) (TableI); this result is in agreement with the qualitative picture obtained by looking at the line broadening (Fig.3 A). As a control, we also measured the increase of theR 1 relaxation rate for the isolated [methyl-13C]Met amino acid, and in the presence of 0.4 eq of TEMPOL the ratio of R 1(0.4 eq)/R 1 (0 eq) is 2.07. Thus, the results obtained with the protein indicate that the Met methyl groups are almost fully exposed on the surface of Ca2+4-CaM with the exception of Met76 (see below).Table ICarbon-13 spin-lattice relaxation rate R1 (s−1) for the Met methyl groups in Ca2+4-CaM, Ca2+2-TR1C, and Ca2+2-TR2C in the absence and presence of 0.4 eq of TEMPOLR 1N averageC averageMet36Met51Met71Met72Met76Met109Met124Met144Met145s−1s−1s−1Ca2+4-CaMR 1 (0 eq)aAssignments taken from Siivari et al.

Open table in a new tab We also studied the individual isolated lobes of Ca2+4-CaM using the TEMPOL broadening experiment. Fig. 3, B and C, shows the1H, 13C HMQC spectra obtained for Ca2+2-TR1C and Ca2+2-TR2C, respectively, in the absence and presence of 0.4 eq of TEMPOL. By utilizing the similarities between the NMR spectra of these two protein fragments and intact CaM in the Ca2+ form as well as the apo-form, the assignment for the Met methyl resonances could be readily made (Figs. 3 and4). Table I includes the results obtained for the R 1 relaxation rate measurements for Ca2+2-TR1C and Ca2+2-TR2C. Clearly, we obtained a very similar result for the two isolated fragments Ca2+2-TR1C and Ca2+2-TR2C, when compared with intact Ca2+4-CaM (Fig. 3, Table I). These data imply that Ca2+2-TR1C and Ca2+2-TR2C have a very similar exposure for the Met methyl groups as in Ca2+4-CaM. The broadening effect is slightly less dramatic, but this possibly reflects the decrease of the correlation time of TR1C and TR2C compared with intact CaM. A higher TEMPOL concentration is generally needed to achieve similar broadening effects for small molecules (34Petros A.M. Fesik S.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Be that as it may, the 13C R1 measurements definitively show a comparable increase in the spin-lattice relaxation rates in the presence of 0.4 eq of TEMPOL (Table I). These results suggest that Met side chains are almost fully exposed on the protein surface in Ca2+2-TR1C and Ca2+2-TR2C. Next, we acquired the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of apo-CaM in the absence and presence of 6 eq of TEMPOL (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to the results obtained with Ca2+4-CaM (Fig. 2 A), we observed almost no line broadening effects in the aromatic region and upfield-shifted methyl group region of the proton NMR spectra upon the addition of TEMPOL (Fig. 2 B). This is consistent with the burial of the majority of these side chains inside the protein as seen in the apo-CaM structure (14Kuboniwa H. Tjandra N. Grzesiek S. Ren H. Klee C"

The cyclic nucleotides, cAMP and cGMP, are intracellular second messengers mediating the actions of a large number of hormones and neurotransmitters. These cyclic nucleotides act to allosterically regulate the action of a small number of important proteins.

The cAKs and the cGKs are highly homologous protein kinase families with similar substrate specificities. Phosphorylation of cellular proteins by both families of kinases leads to alterations in calcium mobilization, protein phosphatase activity, ion channel function, gene transcription, smooth muscle contractility, and platelet aggregation (1Francis S.H.

The type I enzymes (cGKIs) are highly expressed in lung (5Kuo J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2256-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), cerebellum (6Lohmann S.M. Walter U.

A second type of cGK, termed the type II cGK (cGKII), is highly expressed in intestinal microvilli (19de Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333PubMed Google Scholar) and is encoded by a gene distinct from that encoding cGKI proteins (20Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Jarchau T. Hausler C. Markert T. Pohler D. Vanderkerckhove J. De Jonge H.R. Lohmann S.M. Walter U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9426-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). While cGKI isoforms are soluble proteins, cGKII is particulate and associated with cellular membranes (19de Jonge H.R. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1981; 14: 315-333PubMed Google Scholar). Both types possess amino-terminal leucine zipper motifs and exist as homodimers in native tissues (13Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cAKs, which have separate catalytic and regulatory subunits, each monomer of the cGKs consists of both a regulatory domain and a catalytic domain contained in the same polypeptide (13Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 237-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Many mammalian tissues coexpress isoforms of cAK and cGK, where the cAK and cGK proteins are thought to play distinct roles in cellular regulation. The in vitro substrate specificities of the cAKs and the cGKs are very similar, although a number of proteins have been identified as specific substrates for either cAKs or cGKs. For example, the type I regulatory (R) subunit of cAK (22Geahlen R.L. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1164-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), G-substrate (23Aswad D.W.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14971-14978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are specific substrates of cGKI in vitro, while the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) has been shown to be a specific in vitro substrate of cAK (76Colbran J.-L. Roach P.J. Foil C.J. Dixon J.E. Andrisani O.M. Corbin J.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1277-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although in vitro substrate specificity may be an important indicator of in vivo substrate specificity, recent evidence suggests that colocalization of kinase and substrate in the cell is at least an equally important factor (27Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The cAMP signaling pathway is used to regulate the transcription of many genes and involves the phosphorylation of specific transcription factors by the C subunit of cAK (28Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). In the absence of cAMP, cAK exists predominantly as an inactive tetrameric holoenzyme composed of two R subunits and two C subunits. The inactive holoenzyme may be localized diffusely in the cytoplasm or localized to specific subcellular compartments by interaction of the R subunits with protein kinase A anchoring proteins (27Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Upon cytoplasmic elevation of cAMP, cAMP binds to each R subunit, causing the holoenzyme complex to dissociate into a homodimer of R subunits and two catalytically active C subunits. Once released, the C subunit can phosphorylate cytoplasmic substrates, and because of its small size (40 kDa), it can also passively diffuse through the nuclear pores into the nucleus (29Harootunian A.T. Adams S.R. Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Taylor S.S. Tsien R.Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the C subunit can phosphorylate nuclear transcription factors, such as members of the CREB/ATF family, which bind directly to specific enhancer sequences and alter levels of gene transcription (30Nigg E.A. Hilz H. Eppenberger H.M. Dutly F. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2801-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar,31Hagiwara M. Brindle P. Harootunian A. Armstrong R. Rivier J. Vale W. Tsien R. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4852-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Substrates of cAK therefore include both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. Like the cAKs, the cGKs are capable of activating gene transcription in a cyclic nucleotide-dependent manner (32Pilz R.B. Suhasini M. Idriss S. Meinkoth J.L. Boss G.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 33Gudi T. Huvar I. Meinecke M. Lohmann S.M. Boss G.R. Pilz R.B. J. Biol.

For example, in PC-12 cells, stimulation of the NO/cGMP pathway leads to increased expression of the immediate early genes c-fos andjunB. Importantly, this induction can be blocked by the selective cGK inhibitor KT5823, suggesting that this induction is dependent on cGK activity (35Haby C. Lisovoski F. Aunis D. Zwiller J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 496-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). While the mechanisms by which the cAKs activate gene transcription have been well characterized, little is known about cGK regulation of gene transcription. In this report, we demonstrate that both transiently expressed and endogenous cGKs are localized to the cytoplasm in mammalian cells. Treatment of cells with cyclic nucleotide does not cause nuclear accumulation of the cGKs, while the C subunit of cAKs does translocate to the nucleus. As a result of its cytoplasmic restriction, cGKIβ is a weaker activator of CRE-dependent gene transcription than cAKII. These data suggest that regulation of gene transcription by cGK involves phosphorylation of cytoplasmic substrate protein(s) that remain to be characterized. cDNA library screening was performed essentially as described previously (20Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13586-13591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.0-kilobase pairEcoRI–SalI restriction fragment from pCGKI.6 was isolated and labeled by random primer extension in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. The resulting radiolabeled DNA fragments were used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library. Clones mcGKIβ3D and mcGKI2.2 were isolated, and their inserts were restriction-mapped. mcGKIβ3D, which contains the entire open reading frame (ORF) of murine cGKIβ, was fully sequenced in both directions using Sequenase DNA polymerase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). mcGKI2.2, which lacks the first 1130 bp of the cGKIβ ORF, was partially sequenced to confirm a 2-bp deletion in the ORF of mcGKIβ3D. The murine cGKIβ cDNA sequence derived from the sequencing of both clones has been submitted to the GenBankTM data base. Sequence analyses were performed using DNASTAR software. The pCMV.mcGKIβ mammalian expression vector was constructed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGA GAT CTC CAC CAT GGG CAC CCT GCG GGA TTT AC-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC AAG CTT ACA TTA GAA GTC TAT GTC-3′ with cDNA clone mcGKIβ3D as a template. The resulting 2100-bp PCR fragment containing the coding region of murine cGKIβ flanked by a BglII site and a BamHI site was digested with BglII andBamHI and ligated into the BglII site of pCMV.Neo (36Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Stofko R.E. Seasholtz A.F. Uhler M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to create pCMV.mcGKIβ. During sequencing of cDNA clone mcGKIβ3D, a two-nucleotide deletion (Fig. 1) was discovered in the ORF sequence. To correct the deletion in pCMV.mcGKIβ, a 600-bpBsrGI–AflII restriction fragment from cDNA clone mcGKI2.2, containing the correct sequence, was ligated intoBsrGI- and AflII-digested pCMV.mcGKIβ. pCMV.mcGKIβ was sequenced to confirm the entire coding region sequence. 10-cm plates of CV-1 or HEK293 cells were transiently transfected using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). 48 h after application of DNA precipitates, plates were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Following the addition of 200 μl of homogenization buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm sucrose) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), cells were scraped into separate tubes and sonicated twice for 10 s. For kinase activity determinations, cyclic nucleotide (50 μm) was added to or omitted from separate tubes containing a phosphotransferase assay mixture consisting of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgAc, 500 μm IBMX, 200 μm ATP, 11 nm[γ-32P]ATP (ICN) (specific activity = 200–300 cpm/pmol), 10 mm NaF, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and the synthetic phosphate acceptor peptide Kemptide (LRRASLG; 150 μm) or H2Btide (RKRSRAE; 110 μm). When assaying cGKIβ activity, protein kinase inhibitor (PKI) peptide (1 μm) was added to all tubes. The assay was initiated by the addition of cell extracts (0.2 mg/ml), and the phosphotransfer reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 min at 30 °C. The assay was terminated by spotting aliquots onto P81 phosphocellulose (Whatman). The P81 phosphocellulose was washed in 10 mm phosphoric acid and counted. The mutations in pCMV.mcGKIβR75A, pCMV.mcGKIβS79D, pCMV.mcGKIβK404R, pCMV.mcGKIβK407R/R409Q, pCMV.mcGKIβH419Q, and pCMV.mcGKIβW530R were generated by a two-step PCR method using mutagenic primers as described previously (38Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into pCMV.mcGKIβ using convenient restriction sites, and each construct was verified by DNA sequencing of the PCR-amplified region. pCMV.FC/CD, the expression plasmid for the chimeric cGKI deletion mutant, was constructed by replacing the amino-terminal regulatory domain (amino acids 1–355) of cGKIβ with an amino-terminal Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) followed by the amino-terminal (amino acids 1–20) of murine Cα (39Uhler M.D. Carmichael D.F. Lee D.C. Chrivia J.C. Krebs E.G. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1300-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The two-step PCR method was used to create this chimeric cDNA. Initially, a Cα PCR fragment containing aBamHI site and an amino-terminal Flag epitope was generated using the primers 5′-GGG GGA TCC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG GGC AAC GCC GCG GCC GCC AAG AA-3′ and 5′-AAG TAC TCC GGA GTC CCA C-3′ with pGEM-4.Cα (40Brown N.A. Stofko R.E. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13181-13189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template. The resulting PCR fragment was ligated into pGEM-T (Promega) to create pGEM-T.Flag-Cα1. To generate the cAK/cGK chimera, PCR fragments coding for the Flag-tagged amino terminus of murine Cα and the carboxyl terminus of murine cGKIβ were amplified in separate PCRs. A PCR fragment coding for the amino terminus of murine Cα was generated using primer 5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3′ and the chimeric primer 5′-GGC TTC ATA TTT TGC TTT TGC TAG GAA CTC TTT CAC GCT-3′ with pGEM-T.Flag-Cα1 as a template. A PCR fragment coding for the carboxyl terminus of murine cGKIβ was generated using primer 5′-AGG CAC GCT TCC ATC AAC-3′ and the chimeric primer 5′-AGC GTG AAA GAG TTC CTA GCA AAA GCA AAA TAT GAA GCC-3′ with pCMV.mcGKIβ as a template. The partially overlapping PCR fragments were isolated, combined with flanking primers 5′-GGG GGA TCC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG GGC AAC GCC GCG GCC GCC AAG AA-3′ and 5′-AGG CAC GCT TCC ATC AAC-3′, and amplified. The resulting fragment was cut with BamHI and BsrGI, isolated, and ligated into the BglII- and BsrGI-digested pCMV.mcGKIβ to create pCMV.FC/CD. pCMV.FC/CD was restriction-mapped and sequenced to confirm the amplified sequence. pCMV.mcGKII and pCMV.mcGKIIG2A were constructed by PCR. PCR fragments were generated using the following oligonucleotides as forward primers: 5′-GAG ATC TGC TAG CCC ACC ATG GGA AAT GGT TCA GTG-3′ (cGKII) and 5′-GAG ATC TGC TAG CCC ACC ATG GCA AAT GGT TCA GTG-3′ (cGKIIG2A). The oligonucleotide 5′-CTC TAT CGA GGG CCC AAG-3′ was used as the reverse primer, and pCMV.His6cGKII (41Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) was used as the template in the PCRs to amplify 780-bp DNA fragments coding for the amino termini of mcGKII and mcGKIIG2A. pCMV.His6cGKII was digested with BglII. The full-length cGKII insert was subcloned into the BglII site of pSP73 (Promega) to create pSP73.His6cGKII. The PCR fragments described above were digested with BglII and NsiI, isolated, and ligated individually into pSP73.His6cGKII, which had been fully digested with NsiI and partially digested withBglII, generating pSP73.mcGKII and pSP73.cGKIIG2A. pSP73.mcGKII and pSP73.cGKIIG2A were individually cut withBglII, and 2.4-kilobase pair fragments were isolated and ligated into BglII-cut pCMV.Neo to generate pCMV.mcGKII and pCMV.mcGKIIG2A, respectively. Both pCMV.mcGKII and pCMV.mcGKIIG2A were restriction-mapped, and the amplified regions were fully sequenced. His6cGKII was expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and purified as described previously (41Gamm D.M. Francis S.H. Angelotti T.P. Corbin J.D. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27380-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Purified His6cGKII was used to immunize rabbits for polyclonal antibody production (Research Genetics Inc.). CV-1 and HEK293 cells were grown separately on 10-cm plates to 30 and 50% confluency, respectively, and transfected using a standard calcium phosphate method (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) with 0.5 μg of the cAMP-responsive reporter construct human chorionic gonadotropin-luceriferase (HCG-luciferase) (42Mellon P.L. Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4887-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) as well as the indicated amounts of pRSV.βgal and expression vectors. The total amount of plasmid DNA was brought to 30 μg with the parental vector pCMV.Neo. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with or without added cyclic nucleotides. Following treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped into homogenization buffer, sonicated, and assayed for both luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described (43Gamm D.M. Baude E.J. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15736-15742Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A full-length cDNA sequence coding for murine VASP (I.M.A.G.E. Consortium clone identification no. 354921/GenBankTM accession no. W45954) (44Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) was identified in a search of the expressed sequence tag data base for protein sequences homologous to human VASP using the BLAST algorithm (45Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar). This I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (LLNL) cDNA clone was obtained from Genome Systems Inc. It was sequenced in both directions using Sequenase DNA polymerase (U.S. Biochemical), and sequence analyses were performed using DNASTAR software. The nucleotide sequence of the murine cDNA derived from a mouse embryo (embryonic day 13.5–14.5) cDNA library differs from that of the published murine VASP genomic sequence (46Zimmer M. Fink T. Fischer L. Hauser W. Scherer K. Lichter P. Walter U. Genomics. 1996; 36: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), in that it contains a G instead of an A at nucleotide position 955, a three-nucleotide deletion from position 1192 to 1194, and an A instead of a G at nucleotide position 1867. The first difference changes threonine 209 to an alanine, the second difference eliminates glutamine 292, and the third difference is located in the 3′-untranslated region. The murine VASP cDNA sequence has been submitted to the GenBankTMdata base. A mammalian expression plasmid encoding amino-terminal Flag-tagged murine VASP protein was constructed using the PCR method. A PCR fragment containing an amino-terminal Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) was generated using the primers 5′-GGA TCC GGT ACC TCC ACC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG GGC GGA GGT ATG AGC GAG ACG GTC ATC TGT TCC-3′ and 5′-GGA TCC CTC GAG TCA AGG AGA ACC CCG CTT CCT CAG-3′ with clone 354921 as a template. The resulting PCR fragment was digested withBamHI, isolated, and ligated into BglII digested pCMV.Neo to create pCMV.Flag-VASP. pCMV.Flag-VASP was restriction-mapped, and the inserted DNA was fully sequenced. For phosphorylation studies, 10-cm plates of CV-1 cells at 30% confluency were transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection method as described previously (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Each plate was transfected with 20 μg of pCMV.Flag-VASP. 24 h after transfection, the media was changed, and the cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM without serum. Following treatment with cyclic nucleotides, cells were quickly washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, scraped into 400 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer, and sonicated for 10 s. Extracts were quickly diluted with 500 μl of RIPA buffer (20 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 300 mm NaCl, 2% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Triton X-100, 2% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate) and vortexed. Fractions were denatured in SDS-PAGE buffer at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membranes (BA-85; Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% nonfat dried milk and subsequently incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of an anti-Flag epitope antibody (M2) (Eastman Kodak Co.) in TBST supplemented with 5% nonfat dried milk for 1 h. Filters were washed three times for 10 min with TBST and incubated with an 35S-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (0.5 μCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 as the secondary antibody for 1 h. Following the final set of three 10-min washes with TBST, the blots were dried and quantitated. PhosphorImager quantitation was performed in a PhosphorImager apparatus and analyzed with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). CV-1 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum in eight-well tissue culture chambers on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides (Lab-Tek) to 30% confluency. Cells were transiently transfected using a standard calcium phosphate method (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar) with 0.1 μg of pCMV.mcGKIβ; 0.01 μg of pCMV.Flag-Cα3; and 0.04 μg of pCMV.RIIα, 0.1 μg of pCMV.mcGKIβS79D, or 0.1 μg of pCMV.FC/CD. Total plasmid concentration was maintained at 0.25 μg by the addition of the parental vector, pCMV.Neo. Following a 12-h incubation with DNA precipitates, cells were washed once with DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and grown for 24 h. Indicated cells were stimulated with 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) or 8-Br-cGMP (1 mm) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 μm) in DMEM for various times at 37 °C. Following stimulation, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by a 1:1 mixture of methanol and acetone for 5 min. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of cGKI (anti-cGMP-PK CT) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at a 1:1000 dilution or an anti-Flag epitope antibody (M2) (Eastman Kodak) at a 1:2000 dilution in blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 3% goat serum, and 0.1% saponin (Sigma)) for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with wash buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.1% saponin), a 1:1000 dilution of Cy3-F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson) or a 1:3000 dilution of Cy3-F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson) was incubated with the cells for 1 h in the dark in blocking buffer.

Whereas the R. sphaeroides signal sequence prevents formation of active enzyme, addition of a 6× His-tag at the N terminus of the mature peptide maximizes production of active enzyme and allows for affinity purification. The recombinant protein contains 1.7–1.9 guanines and greater than 0.7 molybdenum atoms per molecule and has a DMSO reductase activity of 3.4–3.7 units/nmol molybdenum, compared with 3.7 units/nmol molybdenum for enzyme purified from R. sphaeroides. The recombinant enzyme differs from the native enzyme in its color and spectrum but is indistinguishable from the native protein after redox cycling with reduced methyl viologen and Me2SO. Substitution of Cys for the molybdenum-ligating Ser-147 produced a protein with DMSO reductase activity of 1.4–1.5 units/nmol molybdenum.

This substitution leads to losses of 61–99% of activity toward five substrates, but the adenosine N 1-oxide reductase activity increases by over 400%. The majority of molybdoenzymes contain one or more strongly chromophoric prosthetic groups in addition to molybdenum (1Rajagopalan K.V. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Although the properties of their molybdenum centers have been studied by EPR and EXAFS, 1The abbreviations used are:EXAFS, extended x-ray absorption fine structure; MCD, magnetic circular dichroism; RR, resonance Raman; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; MGD, molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide; VTMCD, variable-temperature MCD; TMAO, trimethylamine N-oxide; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; MetSO, methionine sulfoxide; DMSO reductase, dimethyl sulfoxide reductase; BSO, d-biotin d-sulfoxide; ANO, adenosine N 1-oxide; MPT, molybdopterin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitriloacetic acid. other techniques such as MCD, resonance Raman spectroscopy (RR), and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy have not been applicable to these enzymes because the weakly absorbing molybdenum centers are masked by the other stronger chromophores. Periplasmic RhodobacterDMSO reductase is one among the few proteins containing only the molybdenum cofactor as a prosthetic group (3Bastian N.R. Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active enzyme is also a monomer of 85 kDa in contrast to other well characterized molybdoenzymes that are larger oligomeric molecules, many containing a membrane-anchoring subunit complicating molecular cloning and purification (4Kisker C. Schindelin H. Rees D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 233-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). All of these factors combine to makeRhodobacter DMSO reductase an ideal molybdoenzyme for cloning and structural studies of the molybdenum active site. The purified Rhodobacter sphaeroides enzyme has been studied by several spectroscopic techniques including absorption spectroscopy (3Bastian N.R. Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol.

EXAFS studies of the oxidized R. sphaeroides protein showed the molybdenum ligand field to contain 4 Mo–S, 1 Mo=O, and 1 Mo–O bonds (6George G.N. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1113-1117Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and chemical analysis of the purified enzyme revealed the bis(MGD)molybdenum form of the cofactor (Fig. 1 A) (8Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The long wavelength absorption bands in the visible spectrum of DMSO reductase have proven to be extremely useful for RR, enabling detailed and nearly complete assignments for all of the observed RR resonance lines. In particular, redox cycling of the enzyme in the presence of18O-labeled Me2SO caused a downshift of 43 cm−1 in the bond assigned to Mo=O, providing unequivocal evidence for the single oxo group. This finding also demonstrated the mono-oxo molybdenum center is fully capable of carrying out an oxo transfer reaction (7Garton S.D. Hilton J.C. Oku H. Crouse B.R. Rajagopalan K.V. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12906-12916Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, EXAFS studies on R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase indicated that the ligand field of molybdenum includes an Mo–O bond presumably from a protein side chain (6George G.N. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 1113-1117Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Subsequent x-ray crystallography of the enzyme identified this protein ligand as Ser-147 (9Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 272: 1615-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignment of the DMSO reductase family of proteins suggests that the protein ligand to molybdenum in diverse members of the group may be either Ser, Cys, or selenocysteine (Fig.1 B) (9Schindelin H. Kisker C. Hilton J. Rajagopalan K.V. Rees D.C.

In particular, the effect of site-directed mutagenesis on the electronic and chemical properties of the molybdenum centers can be examined using kinetic techniques, analysis of substrate specificities, and a variety of spectroscopic techniques including EXAFS, RR, EPR, and x-ray crystallography. In order to carry out detailed structural and mechanistic studies onR. sphaeroides DMSO reductase, we have cloned the R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase gene (16Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim.

Since plasmids cannot be introduced into Rhodobacter by transformation, homologous expression requires transformation of a donor E. coli strain with a suicide plasmid followed by conjugation and subsequent crossover to integrate a mutated gene into the R. capsulatus cellular chromosome. These complications are eliminated by heterologous expression in E. coli, with the additional advantage of a multitude of molecular biology techniques tailored to this system. Furthermore, because of the availability of E. coli mutants defective in cofactor biosynthesis (21Rajagopalan K.V. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 674-679Google Scholar), heterologous expression provides the ability to examine the mechanism of incorporation of the complex cofactor into the apoprotein. Initial attempts at heterologous expression of the cloned R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase gene in E. coli produced only inactive protein (16Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Since other molybdoenzymes including the human and rat sulfite oxidases (22Garrett R.M. Bellissimo D.B. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and E. coli DMSO reductase (24Bilous P.T. Weiner J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli, the apparent lack of expression of active R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase was unexpected. The cloned R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase gene codes for a precursor protein that includes an N-terminal 42-residue signal sequence serving to target the mature protein to the periplasmic space. R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase shares approximately 50% amino acid sequence identity with mature E. coli TMAO reductase, another periplasmic molybdoenzyme (25Mejean V. Iobbi-Nivol C. Lepelletier M. Giordano G. Chippaux M. Pascal M.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although the mature enzymes share significant homology, the periplasmic signal sequences differ substantially (26.Hilton, J. C., Rhodobacter sphaeroides Dimethyl Sulfoxide Reductase: Molecular Biochemistry of an Enzyme Containing Bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide)MolybdenumPh.D. thesis, 1996, Duke University.Google Scholar). Since differences in the signal sequence requirements of the two organisms could result in improper processing, we have examined the effects of deletion of the N-terminal signal sequence as well as the effects of substitution of the R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase signal sequence with that of E. coli TMAO reductase on the expression of active DMSO reductase. These studies show that maximum expression of active enzyme is achieved without any signal sequence. Paradoxically, the inclusion of an N-terminal His-tag results in an even higher production of active enzyme and facilitates rapid and high yield purification of the recombinant protein. To explore the effect of ligand substitution on catalytic activity and electrochemical properties such as oxidation-reduction potentials, we have created the S147C mutant of DMSO reductase and examined its properties. As described below, the mutant enzyme displays attenuated activities with several substrates but markedly elevated activity with adenosine N-oxide. These data as well as the results of spectroscopic analysis of the recombinant wild type and the S147C forms of DMSO reductase are presented in this paper.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized at the Duke University DNA Core Facility on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer model 394. Site-directed mutagenesis of R. sphaeroides DMSO reductase with the CLONTECH Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit was carried out on double-stranded DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pJH115 construct (TableI), containing the DMSO reductase coding sequence, free of NcoI and NdeI restriction sites, in pBluescript II KS(+), was subjected to mutagenesis with selection primer BSXbaD677 (Table II) and mutagenic primers NdeA122 or NdeA-2 to create pJH118 and pJH119, respectively.

Open table in a new tab PCR primers TRNdeA-2 and TRBclA132 were designed to amplify the first 150 nucleotides of the torA coding sequence from E. coli DH5α genomic DNA, incorporating anNdeI site at position −2 and a BclI site at position 132, respectively. The 100-μl PCR reaction contained 0.8 μg of DNA, 4 mm MgCl2, 1× Taq PCR buffer II, 20 nmol of dNTP, 50 pmol of each primer, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The PCR parameters included an initial 2-min 94 °C denaturation, 15 amplification cycles (30 s denaturation at 97 °C, 30 s annealing at 45 °C, and 1-min extension at 72 °C), and a final 10-min 72 °C extension. The PCR product was ligated directly into the pCRII vector using the TA cloning kit, and the construct, pTT601, containing the insert, was isolated fromE. coli INVαF′ cells that had been transformed with the ligated material. Mutagenesis with selection primer BSXbaD677 and mutagenic primer BclA123 on pJH115 incorporated a BclI site at position 123 of the gene creating pJH125. Unmethylated pJH125 and pTT601 constructs were propagated indam − /dcm − DM1 cells, and the torA insert was released from pTT601 withSpeI and BclI and ligated into pJH125 that had been digested with the same enzymes, creating the fusion construct pJH126. The coding sequence for the fusion protein was released from pJH126 with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into the pET-29 expression vector with the initiation codon of the insert positioned at the translation start site of the vector, creating pJH527. Construct pJH118 was subjected to mutagenesis with selection primer BSSpeD683 and mutagenic primer S147C to alter the Ser codon at position 147 to a Cys codon creating pJH130. The mutant coding sequence for the mature peptide was released from the construct with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into pET-28 in frame with the 6× His-tag coding sequence creating pJH731. Inserts containing the DMSO reductase coding sequence were sequenced using the chain termination method on double-stranded DNA with the Oncor Fidelity DNA Sequencing System according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sequencing gels containing 6% acrylamide were prepared from Glycerol-tolerant DNA Sequencing Gel Mix and included 20% formamide to resolve compressions. Sequence analysis was accomplished using the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). Alternatively, automated sequencing was performed at the Duke University DNA Analysis Facility using a Perkin-Elmer Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing system with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase combined with an Applied Biosystems 377 PRISM DNA Sequencing instrument. Expression constructs pJH520, pJH521, pJH527, pJH720, and pJH731 were transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli cells for expression. Aerobic growth and expression conditions were explored in 3-ml LB cultures supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 1 mm NaMoO4 in 14-ml Falcon 2057 tubes. Anaerobic growth and expression analysis were carried out in sterile 5-ml, additive-free blood collection tubes containing 5 ml of M9ZB medium (28Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6004) Google Scholar) consisting of 10 g/liter N-Z-amine, 5 g/liter NaCl, 1 g/liter NH4Cl, 1.5 g/liter KH2PO4, 15 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.25 g/liter MgSO4·7H2O, 0.4% glucose, supplemented with 40 mm fumaric acid, 10–1000 μmNaMoO4, and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. BL21(DE3) E. coli cells containing expression constructs were transformed with pLysE using the calcium chloride method (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.82-1.84Google Scholar). When cells also contained pLysE, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol was included in the medium. Expression under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions was induced with up to 1 mm IPTG. Mature DMSO reductase was purified from R. sphaeroides as described previously (8Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recombinant enzyme was purified from BL21(DE3) cells containing pLysE and either pJH720 or pJH731. Cells were grown aerobically at 37 °C overnight in 80-ml cultures containing LB supplemented with kanamycin and chloramphenicol and used to inoculate 40-liter cultures containing M9ZB medium supplemented as described above and including NaMoO4 at 0.5 mm and IPTG at 80 μm. The cells were grown for 24 h at room temperature and harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g. The cell pellets were resuspended in 500 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and frozen to lyse the cells. The frozen cells were thawed in the presence of 5 mg of DNase I and stirred at room temperature until the lysate was smooth and homogeneous. After centrifugation at 11,000 ×g for 30 min, the pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 6.5, and the extract was heated rapidly to 50 °C in a boiling water bath, maintained at 50 °C for 1 min, cooled rapidly in an ice bath, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min. Imidazole was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 10 mm. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH, and the solution was centrifuged again. The supernatant was combined with 15–25 ml of Ni-NTA resin, and the slurry was equilibrated with gentle stirring at 4 °C for 15 min. The slurry was poured into a 2.5 × 10-cm chromatography column, and the protein solution was allowed to flow through the resin. The column was then washed with 2 column volumes of 10 mmimidazole, 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, 8 column volumes of the same solution at pH 8.0, and 3 column volumes of the pH 8 solution at a 20 mm imidazole concentration. The DMSO reductase was eluted with 100 mmimidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mmNaCl, pH 8.0. Fractions containing the DMSO reductase were combined and made 20% saturated with solid ammonium sulfate. The protein was loaded on a 23-ml phenyl-Sepharose HR16/10 FPLC column equilibrated in 114 g/liter ammonium sulfate in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The column was then washed with 1 column volume of this solution followed by a 1-column volume gradient that decreased the ammonium sulfate concentration from 114 to 34 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, a 1-column volume wash at 34 g/liter, a 2-column volume gradient further dropping the ammonium sulfate concentration to 17 g/liter, and finally a 4.4-column volume gradient decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration from 17 to 0 g/liter. Selected fractions were combined, and the ammonium sulfate was removed by ultrafiltration using Amicon PM30 membranes or Centricon 30 devices. Samples were heated at 95 °C in sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Electrophoresis was carried out on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide Ready Gels using the Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II Electrophoresis System at 200 V, and proteins on the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (16Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1294: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Pure samples of DMSO reductase were quantitated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 200,000 m−1 cm−1or 2.3 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 (8Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 325: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Total protein was also assayed using the Pierce BCA assay on trichloroacetic acid-precipitated samples as described in the manufacturer's protocol, with known concentrations of DMSO reductase purified from R. sphaeroides as standards. DMSO reductase activity was assayed as described previously (3Bastian N.R. Kay C.J. Barber M.J. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 45-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 2-ml anaerobic assay mixture containing up to 3 μg of the enzyme, 0.1 mm sodium dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm Me2SO. The assay was initiated by injecting sodium dithionite into a sealed anaerobic mixture containing all other assay components. The change in absorbance at 600 nm was monitored for 1 min, and the activity in micromoles of Me2SO reduced per min was determined by the formulaU = 1/2[ΔA 600/min][1/ε600][v] where ε600, the extinction coefficient of reduced methyl viologen at 600 nm, is 1.3 × 10−2μm−1 cm−1 and v= 2 × 10−3 liter. Alternative substrates were assayed using enzyme concentrations that varied relative to the activity toward that substrate. The substrates TMAO,dl-MetSO, potassium chlorate, fumaric acid, and potassium nitrate were assayed at 10 mm substrate concentrations, whereas BSO was assayed at 1.7 mm (30Pollock V.V. Barber M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3355-3362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ANO was dissolved directly in the assay buffer at 3.4 mm (31Weiner J.H. MacIsaac D.P. Bishop R.E. Bilous P.T. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solid ammonium sulfate was added to soluble cell extracts to 45% saturation at 4 °C, and the precipitated material was removed by centrifugation at 23,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was heated rapidly to 60 °C, and immediately chilled in an ice bath, and the precipitated material was again removed by centrifugation. The ammonium sulfate concentration of the supernatant was increased to 70% saturation, and after centrifugation the supernatant was discarded. The precipitated protein was dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and SDS-free samples containing 25–30 μg of total protein were loaded onto 4–20% Ready Gels. After non-denaturing electrophoresis at 200 V for approximately 30 min, the gels were stained in a 13-ml anaerobic solution of 150 mm Me2SO, 4 mmreduced methyl viologen, and 77 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (32Shimokawa O. Ishimoto M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After bands containing Me2SO reducing activity became clear, the stained background was fixed with 2.5% tetrazolium red (33Huckles"

Several lines of evidence have established that DNA methylation patterns are tissue specific and are generated during development by rounds of de novo methylation and demethylation events (1Razin A. Riggs A.D. Science. 1980; 210: 604-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (1511) Google Scholar, 2Brandeis M. Ariel M. Cedar H. Bioassays. 1993; 15: 709-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 3Kafri T.

Genet. 1994; 7: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Two modes of demethylation have been documented: site-specific demethylation that coincides in many instances with the onset of gene expression of specific genes (5Saluz H.P. Jiricny J. Jost J.P.

The global demethylation is consistent with the hypothesis that a general demethylase activity that is activated at specific points in development or oncogenesis exists (13Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 7: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, until recently the identity of the enzymes responsible for demethylation has been a mystery. It has been generally assumed that an activity that can transform a methylated cytosine to a cytosine by direct removal of a methyl group does not exist. Therefore, it has been proposed previously that demethylation involves either a glycosylase and repair activity (10Razin A. Szyf M. Kafri T. Roll M. Giloh H. Scrapa S. Carotti D. Cantoni G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 13Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol.

Cell. 1996; 87: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Whereas a demethylation process that involves a sequence of glycosylase, nuclease, repair, and ligase enzymatic activities could possibly be involved in site specific demethylation, it is hard to understand how it can catalyze genome wide global demethylation. Global nicking and repair would have a serious impact on the integrity of the genome. What enzymatic activity is responsible for global demethylation? We have recently identified and cloned from human cancer cells abona fide DNA demethylase that catalyzes the hydrolytic removal of methyl residues from methyl cytosine in DNA (16Bhattacharya S. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). DNA demethylase demethylates both fully methylated and hemimethylated DNA, shows dinucleotide specificity, and can demethylate mCpG sites in different sequence contexts (16Bhattacharya S. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Since this enzyme can remove methyl groups from DNA without damaging the DNA, it is a candidate to be involved in global hypomethylation. One essential property of an enzyme that removes methylation from wide regions of the genome could be processivity. In this paper we have used sodium bisulfite DNA mapping to determine whether purified demethylase demethylates DNA in a processive or distributive manner in an isolated system. Bisulfite treatment that is followed by PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing of individual molecules of DNA allows one to determine the state of methylation of a single DNA molecule at a time, at single base resolution (17Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). This allows for the analysis of an interaction of an enzyme with a single substrate molecule. We test here whether methylated murine and bacterial gene sequences are processively or distributively demethylated by purified demethylase and whether this process is affected by the properties of the methylated sequence. The processive nature of DNA demethylase in vitrodemonstrated in this manuscript provides a model to explain the mechanism involved in genome wide hypomethylation. Nuclear extracts were prepared from A549 (ATCC: CCL 185) cultures at near confluence as described previously (18Szyf M. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12690-12696Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A freshly prepared nuclear extract (1 ml, 6 mg) was diluted to a conductivity equivalent to 0.2 m NaCl in buffer L (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2) and applied onto a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.0 × 1 cm) that was pre-equilibrated with buffer L at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Following a 15-ml wash with buffer L, proteins were eluted with 5 ml of a linear gradient of NaCl (0.2–5.0 m). 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for demethylase activity. Demethylase eluted between 4.9 and 5.0 m NaCl. Active DEAE-Sephadex column fractions were pooled, adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl by dilution, and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (2.0 × 1 cm). Following washing of the column as described above, the proteins were eluted with 5 ml of a linear NaCl gradient (0.2–5.0m). 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assayed for demethylase activity. Demethylase activity eluted around 5.0m NaCl. Active fractions were pooled, adjusted to 0.2m NaCl by dilution, and applied onto a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (2.0 × 1 cm), and proteins were eluted as described above. The demethylase activity eluted around 4.8–5.0 m NaCl. The pooled fractions of Q-Sepharose column were loaded onto a 2.0 × 2.0 cm DEAE-Sephacel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with 10 ml of buffer L. The activity was detected at fraction 4, which is very near the void volume. Demethylase is purified 500,000-fold using this protocol. Demethylase activity was assayed by measuring the conversion of methyl-dCMP (mdCMP) 1The abbreviations used are:mdCMP, methyl-dCMP; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; bp, base pair(s). in a poly(mdC-[32P]dG)n double-stranded DNA stranded to dCMP as described previously (18Szyf M. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12690-12696Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). One unit of demethylase is defined as the activity required to transform 1 pmol of mdCMP to dCMP in 1 h at 37 °C (16Bhattacharya S. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). PMetCAT+ plasmid or pBluescript SK(+) plasmid were methylated in vitro by incubating 5 μg of plasmid DNA with 8 units of SssI CpG DNA methyltransferase (19Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glaser G. Rottem S. Razin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (New England Biolabs Inc.) in a buffer recommended by the manufacturer containing 320 μm S-adenosylmethionine, at 37 °C for 2 h. After repeating this procedure five times, full protection fromHpaII digestion was observed. 400 ng of methylated pMetCAT+ or pBluescript SK plasmids were incubated with 1.4 units of DEAE-Sephadex-purified dMTase in buffer containing 20 μg of RNase A, for 10 s to 2 h. The reaction was stopped and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and subjected to bisulfite mapping. Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously with minor modifications (17Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Fifty nanograms of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA samples were subjected to PCR amplification using the first set of primers described below. PCR products were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions utilizing nested primers. The PCR products of the second reaction were then subcloned using the Invitrogen TA cloning kit (we followed the manufacturer's protocol), and the clones were sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (we followed the manufacturer's protocol, procedure C). The primers used for the DNA MeTase genomic region (Gen BankTM accession numberM84387) were: MET5′1, 5′-ggattttggtttatagtattgt-3′; MET5′ (nested), 5′-ggaattttaggtttttatatgtt-3′; MET3′1, 5′-ctcttcataaactaaatattataa-3′; and MET3′ (nested), 5′-tccaaaactcaacataaaaaaat-3′ (245–265). The primers used for the bacterial DNA chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) genomic region (GenBankTM accession number U65077) were: CAT5′1, 5′-ttgtttaatgtatttataattacat-3′; CAT5′(nested), 5′taaagaaaaataagtataagtttta-3′; CAT3′1, 5′-ctcacccaaaaattaactaaaa-3′; CAT3′ (nested), 5′tttaaaaaaataaaccaaattttca-3′. Eighteen control clones were sequenced using methyltransferase primers (0 s), 14 clones at 10 s and 30 s and 12 clones at 2 h. Six control clones were sequenced using CAT primers (0 s), 5 clones at 30 s and 8 clones at 2 h. Enzymes interacting with DNA can act either processively or distributively. A processive mechanism implies that once the demethylase lands on, or centers itself on, a DNA molecule, it slides along the DNA molecule and demethylates a stretch of CpGs in cis as it progresses along the DNA strand (see Fig. 1 for model). The alternative distributive mechanism implies that each demethylation event requires an independent interaction of the enzyme with the DNA. The enzyme is dislodged from the DNA after demethylation of each CpG site and will then land on any accessible methylated CpG site on any molecule of DNA in the reaction mixture in no specific order. These two models can be differentiated if one can monitor the intermediate stages of a demethylation reaction of a sequence of methylated CG sites on individual molecules of DNA. A distributive mechanism predicts that the demethylated sites will be interspersed within methylated sites and will be randomly distributed in the different DNA molecules (Fig.1 A). On other hand, if demethylation is progressive, two classes of molecules will be identified at an intermediate stage, molecules that bear stretches of nonmethylated sites and others that are fully methylated (Fig. 1 B). pBluescript(+) plasmid was fully methylated in vitro and incubated at 37 °C with 1.4 units of demethylase for either 25 min or 3 h. Following demethylation, the plasmid was subjected to digestion withHpaII, which cleaves the sequence CCGG when the internal C is not methylated. As shown in Fig. 2, demethylation of the plasmid is completed after 3 h, as indicated by the complete digestion of the plasmid with HpaII and the appearance of all the predicted HpaII fragments. At 25 min the plasmid is incompletely demethylated as indicated by the presence of plasmid DNA that is resistant to HpaII cleavage. However, the pattern of cleavage by HpaII is consistent with a processive mechanism of demethylation. If demethylation is distributive, the demethylated CpGs should be randomly spread, resulting in a gradient of sizes of HpaII partial fragments. However, the results in Fig. 2 show two classes of bands, fully digested HpaII fragments and plasmids that are completely resistant to HpaII. Whereas the restriction enzyme pattern of digestion shown above suggests a processive mechanism of demethylation, it only allows us to look at a population of plasmids at a given time. To fully demonstrate a processive mechanism, one has to be able to follow the fate of methylated CG sites on a single molecule of DNA. Bisulfite mapping, which is followed by PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing of individual clones allows one to determine the state of methylation of a single DNA molecule at a time, at single base resolution (17Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Fully methylated pMetCAT+ plasmid DNA, which has been described previously (18Szyf M. Theberge J. Bozovic V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12690-12696Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig.3 A and4 A, zero time) bears a genomic fragment of the dnmt1 gene and a bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene on the same DNA molecule. Thus, it allows us to follow the demethylation of a stretch of CpG sites located in a low density CG region, which is characteristic of many vertebrate genes (dnmt1) as well as a dense CG region in the bacterial CAT (Fig. 4). In vitro methylated pMetCAT was incubated with purified demethylase for different time intervals as indicated in Fig.3 and Fig. 4. The demethylated DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite (which results in the conversion of nonmethylated cytosines to thymidine, whereas methylated cytosines are protected), amplified by PCR using appropriate primers for the indicated region ofdnmt1, and subcloned. Subclones, each of which represents a single molecule of DNA treated with demethylase for a specific amount of time, were sequenced.Figure 4Bisulfite mapping of the CAT region in methylated pMetCAT+ plasmid at different time intervals following initiation of demethylation in vitro. A, physical map of the bacterial CAT region in pMetCAT. A blowup of the region amplified is shown under the physical map; the different CpG sites in the fragment are presented as ovals. The percentage of methylated cytosines per site for all the clones analyzed per time interval (indicated by different lines under the physical map) were determined and are presented as different shadings of the circles representing each of the sites as indicated (see legend to Fig. 3 A). B, the methylation pattern for a sample of individual clones of amplified CAT region from bisulfite-treated methylated pMetCAT plasmids that were incubated for different time intervals (10 s, 30 s, and 2 h) are displayed. Each line with circles represents one clone mapped within the methyltransferase enhancer region. Filled circles refer to methylated CG dinucleotides, and empty circles indicate demethylated CG dinucleotides. “n” refers to the number of clones analyzed for each time interval.C, a representative sequencing gel of bisulfite treated DNA is presented per condition. Lollipops indicate the specific CpG sites by their position. The numbering is according to GenBankTM accession number U65077. Filled lollipops indicate fully methylated sites, and empty lollipops indicate nonmethylated sites. The two sequencing gels on the left-hand side present nucleotides in the order of ATCG, whereas the two gels on the right-hand side present the nucleotides in the order of TAGC. “n” indicates the number of clones with identical methylation patterns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We first calculated the average methylation at each site in a representative population of in vitro demethylated pMetCAT plasmids. This allowed us to monitor the general progression of the demethylation reaction and to identify sites that exhibited either specific resistance or sensitivity to demethylation. Fig. 3 Ashows the map of the CG sites in the dnmt1 region and the average percentage methylation of each site in a representative population. The 265-bp region amplified contains 5 CG sites or 1 CG site in 50. At 10 s 11 out of 14 clones observed remain fully methylated (78%); however, methylation decreases with increased time. At 30 s, 8 clones remain fully methylated out of 14 (57%), and all 12 clones are fully demethylated (0% methylation) at 2 h. As appears from this experiment, demethylation of all the CGs in thednmt1 region proceeds at the same rate. Since each CG site has the same probability of being demethylated at interim time points of the reaction, the pattern of methylation of individual molecules of DNA should be a consequence of either the distributive or processive property of the enzyme. As observed in Fig.3 C, one quarter of the molecules are fully demethylated, whereas the other group of molecules is completely methylated at 30 s. Even at 10 s we did not see a demethylated CpG, which is bilaterally flanked with methylated CpGs. This pattern is consistent with a processive mechanism. This assay was repeated, and the results were confirmed by looking at a bacterial sequence with a higher CpG density, within the same plasmid. Bisulfite mapping of the state of methylation of a second region in the same pMetCAT+ plasmid allowed us to confirm our initial observations regarding the processivity of the reaction and to determine whether demethylation is dependent on the properties of the sequence. We amplified a 250-base pair sequence within the bacterial CAT gene, with a CpG density of 5.2% (13 CpGs within a region of 250 bp), which is more than two times times greater than the density of thednmt1 region. Fig. 4 A shows a physical map of the CAT gene and the location of the CpG sites that were mapped. The average methylation of the CG sites at different time intervals through the demethylation reaction was calculated, and it demonstrates that the demethylation of the CAT region which is co-linear with thednmt1 region is slower (Fig. 4 A). This is consistent with the slower demethylation of the SK plasmid, which is also CG-rich relative to the dnmt1 region (Fig. 3). At zero time, all 13 CpGs are fully methylated and remain so at 30 s, unlike the pattern seen in the dnmt1 region (Fig.3 A). Even at 2 h, the demethylation reaction is not complete, 2 clones out of 8 are still methylated. When the state of methylation of independent molecules is examined (Fig. 4 B), the distribution of demethylated sites is not random among the different plasmid molecules. Some molecules are fully methylated whereas others bear a stretch of demethylated CGs. This again is consistent with a processive mechanism. Once demethylation is initiated in this region it progresses in cis. Global changes in demethylation require enzymatic activities that can transform methylated cytosines, which are spread over large segments of DNA to nonmethylated cytosines. One attractive explanation might be that the demethylase enzyme is a processive enzyme. The mechanisms responsible for demethylation have been unknown, since the identity of the enzymatic activities responsible for demethylation was a mystery. Our identification of a bona fide demethylase (16Bhattacharya S. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) allows us to address the mechanisms of demethylation for the first time. In this manuscript we use the bisulfite mapping method (17Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar), which provides a unique opportunity to dissect the interaction of an enzyme with a single substrate molecule at a time. Using this method, we demonstrate that the demethylase is a processive enzyme. We suggest that the critical step in demethylation is the interaction of the enzyme with the substrate. Once demethylation is initiated, it will proceed uninterrupted for at least 250 bp at a high rate, since no partial demethylation of the dnmt1 region or the CAT region is detected even after 30 s at single molecule resolution. The presence of regions exhibiting different density of methylated CGs on the same molecule of DNA allowed us to determine whether these differences will affect demethylation and its processivity. It is obvious that the processivity of the demethylase does not extend to the CAT region from the dnmt1 region, since the CAT region (Fig. 4 B), which is co-linear with thednmt1 region (Fig. 3 B), is demethylated more slowly. This is consistent with the demethylase proceeding to a certain distance before being dislodged. However, even within the CAT region, once demethylation is initiated, it proceeds in cis, since we have not identified molecules that are partially methylated in this region. The difference in the demethylation of the CAT anddnmt1 regions must reflect a lag in initiation of demethylation in these two different regions. These data are consistent with the interaction of demethylase with the substrate as being the rate-limiting step. We suggest that the interaction of demethylase with DNA can vary based on the properties of the region; some regions such as the dnmt1 sequence on pMetCAT show a high propensity to interact with the enzyme, whereas others such as the CAT regions display a low affinity. Once the demethylase lands on a specific region, it migrates processively to a certain distance until it recognizes a stop signal or dislodges from the DNA. It has been proposed previously that demethylation in vivoproceeds in cis from centers of demethylation (20Szyf M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 69: 764-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), resulting in demethylation of certain stretches of the genome. The data presented here are consistent with this model. Whereas additional experiments are required to establish that demethylation in vivo progresses processively from centers of methylation as suggested here, the data presented here demonstrate that the demethylase is a processive enzyme and is consistent with this model.

In the present study, the physiological relevance of three putative regulatory protein binding sites found within a 280-base pair region in intron 1 of the c-myc gene was explored. HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were transiently transfected with three different c-mycpromoter constructs cloned upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. With the wild-type c-myc promoter construct (pMPCAT), which contains MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites, 1,25-(OH)2D3 was able to decrease CAT activity by 45.4 ± 7.9% (mean ± S.E.,n = 8). The ability of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to inhibit CAT activity was significantly decreased to 18.5 ± 4.3% (59.3% reversal,p < 0.02) when examined with a MIE1 deletion construct (pMPCAT-MIE1). Moreover, 1,25-(OH)2D3was completely ineffective at suppressing CAT activity in cells transfected with pMPCAT-287, a construct without MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites (−6.5 ± 10.9%, p < 0.002). MIE1- and MIE2-binding proteins induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 had similar gel shift mobilities, while MIE3-binding proteins migrated differently. Furthermore, chelerythrine chloride, a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, and a PKCβ antisense oligonucleotide completely blocked the binding of nuclear proteins induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 to MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3. A 1,25-(OH)2D3-inducible MIE1-binding protein was identified to be HOXB4. HOXB4 levels were significantly increased in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Taken together, these results indicate that HOXB4 is one of the nuclear phosphoproteins involved in c-myc transcription elongation block during HL-60 cell differentiation by 1,25-(OH)2D3. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) suppresses c-mycexpression during differentiation of HL-60 cells along the monocytic pathway by blocking transcriptional elongation at the first exon/intron border of the c-myc gene.

The c-myc protooncogene is linked to pathways of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Several studies reported that decreases in c-myc levels are required for oncogenic cells to escape from the cell cycle and undergo terminal differentiation. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60, is an excellent model system to study mechanisms involved in cellular differentiation. HL-60 cells can be terminally differentiated along the monocytic/macrophage pathway by phorbol esters and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3(1,25-(OH)2D3) 1The abbreviations used are:1, 25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; PKC, protein kinase C; MIE, c-myc intron element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are:1, 25-(OH)2D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3; PKC, protein kinase C; MIE, c-myc intron element; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.and along the granulocytic pathway by retinoic acid and Me2SO (1Collins S.J.

Accompanying this differentiation event, c-myc levels are down-regulated by approximately 90% (2Bentley D.L. Groudine M.

Furthermore, differentiation of HL-60 cells can be triggered by decreasing c-myc protein levels using c-mycantisense RNA or DNA oligonucleotides (6Yokoyama K. Imamoto F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7363-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7Holt J.T. Redner R.L. Nienhuis A.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 963-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, transcription of c-mycwas abolished within 48 h in HL-60 cells (5Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Begley D.A. Mitchell B.S. Alizadeh B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4104-4108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reduction in transcription is at least in part a result of a transcriptional elongation block at a site within the first exon/intron border of the c-myc gene (8Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Wendt M.D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19710-19715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like 1,25-(OH)2D3, phorbol esters and retinoic acid have been shown to block transcription of the gene at the first exon/intron border (2Bentley D.L. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 321: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Several groups have shown that 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases PKC levels and activity (9Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Taylor J.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, inhibitors of PKC activity, such as H-7 and sphinganine, blocked 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of cell differentiation (10Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similarly, H-7 was able to significantly block 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibition of c-myctranscription. Sphinganine, a PKC inhibitor that acts on the regulatory domain of PKC, also prevents 1,25-(OH)2D3 down-regulation of c-myc expression (8Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Wendt M.D. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19710-19715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results provide evidence that PKC plays a critical role in 1,25-(OH)2D3inhibition of c-myc transcription. Zajac-Kaye and Levens (16Zajac-Kaye M. Gelmann E.P. Levens D. Science. 1988; 240: 1776-1780Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 17Zajac-Kaye M. Levens D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4547-4551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) identified several protein binding sites located at intron 1 of the c-myc gene. They termed these protein binding sites MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3. Furthermore, they reported that mutations/deletions in MIE1, MIE2, and/or MIE3 are associated with uncontrolled c-myc expression in numerous Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (18Yu B.W. Ichinose I. Bonham M.A. Zajac-Kaye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19586-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that 1,25-(OH)2D3 significantly enhances the binding of two nuclear proteins to MIE1 in HL-60 cells (19Pan Q. Martell R.E. O'Connell T.D. Simpson R.U. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4154-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present study, MIE1-, MIE2-, and MIE3-binding proteins were demonstrated to be required and may act in concert to regulate c-myc during HL-60 cell differentiation. HOXB4 was identified to be the major MIE1-binding protein. Moreover, HOXB4 protein levels were increased by 1,25-(OH)2D3 prior to monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Cells used in this study were from passage 14–45. The c-myc plasmids were generously provided by Dr. Maria Zajac-Kaye. pMPCAT contains a 3.2-kilobaseHindIII-SstI fragment of c-myc cloned upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (18Yu B.W. Ichinose I. Bonham M.A. Zajac-Kaye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19586-19592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This c-myc fragment includes 2328 bp upstream of exon 1, exon 1, and the first 387 bp of intron 1, which contains the MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 sequences. pMPCAT-287 was constructed by deletion ofHinPI-SstI (bp 2981–3268). The MIE1 sequence was deleted from pMPCAT by polymerase chain reaction methodology using overlapping oligonucleotides to form pMPCAT-MIE1 (deletion of bp 3001–3020). A luciferase expression vector (pGL3) (Promega) was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. The concentration and quality of all vectors used for transfections were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. HL-60 cells (6 × 106) were transiently transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μg of pGL3 by electroporation using a Gene Pulser II Electroporator (Bio-Rad) at 270 V and 975 microfarads. After a 24 h recovery period, the transfected cells were divided equally into two treatment groups. Subsequently, cells were treated with vehicle or 100 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 48 h. Cells were freeze/thawed for three cycles, and cell debris was pelleted by microcentrifugation. Protein concentration of the supernatants was assayed by the Bradford method (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The amount of cell extract and the incubation time used in the CAT assay were optimized so that the CAT activity measured was linear. The percent of CAT conversion was quantified on a Beckman LS8100 counter and normalized with respect to the parent pMPCAT vector by dividing all values by the percent conversion of the pMPCAT transfection. This relative CAT expression value was then corrected for transfection efficiency by dividing it by the ratio of luciferase expression between pMPCAT-MIE1 or pMPCAT-287 and pMPCAT transfection. Luciferase activity was measured according to the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the DNA Synthesis Core Facility at the University of Michigan. The oligonucleotides were synthesized on Applied Biosystems automated DNA synthesizers (Forest City, CA), employing β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite chemistry on controlled pore glass support. MIE1 recognition sequence: 5′-AGAGTAGTTATGGTAACTGG-3′; MIE2 recognition sequence: 5′-CCTTATGAATATATTCACGC-3′; MIE3 recognition sequence: 5′-CTCCCGGCCGGTCGGACATTCCTGCTTTATTGT-3′. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described previously (19Pan Q. Martell R.E. O'Connell T.D. Simpson R.U. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4154-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins (2 μg) were incubated with 10,000 cpm (0.1 ng) of 32P-labeled MIE1, MIE2, or MIE3 probe and 100 ng of poly[d(I-C)] in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) 30 min at 25 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA probe by electrophoresis on a high ionic strength 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:1) containing 380 mm glycine, 50 mm Tris base (pH 8.5), and 2 mm EDTA. Thereafter, gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. Nuclear extract (500 μg) from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated HL-60 cells was incubated with 20 ng of biotin-labeled MIE1 double-stranded DNA sequence in buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm DTT for 30 min at 25 °C. Subsequently, the binding reaction mixture was incubated with a 5 molar excess of streptavidin-agarose on a rotating wheel for 2 h. The resin was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatant (flow-through) was removed. The pellet was washed with binding buffer two times and resuspended in elution buffer (12% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). After incubating on a rotating wheel for 20 min, the resin was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatant containing the MIE1-binding proteins was collected. For N-terminal protein sequencing, gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in buffer containing 10 mm CAPS (pH 11) for 4 h at 70 V. The membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the desired protein band was excised. Samples were sequenced using a Proton PI 2090E Integrated Micro-Sequencing System. Protein sequence analysis was performed by the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility at the University of Michigan. Equal amounts of nuclear protein from each condition were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and proteins were subsequently transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1% Tween 20, and 2% bovine serum albumin. It was then probed for 2 h with a HOXB4 antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co.), then washed three times with blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). Then, the membrane was washed five times with Tween-TBS (10 mm Tris and 0.2% Tween 20, pH 7.4). Finally, the membrane was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to x-ray film. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student's t test. We showed previously that 1,25-(OH)2D3 increases the binding of a novel 32-kDa doublet protein to the MIE1 of the c-myc gene (19Pan Q. Martell R.E. O'Connell T.D. Simpson R.U. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4154-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Since the time course of this increase in protein binding was similar to that of 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibition of c-myctranscription, MIE1-binding proteins were suggested to be responsible for blocking c-myc transcription. In the present study, a CAT reporter gene system was utilized to determine whether the MIE-binding proteins play a functional role in 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of c-myc. The wild-type c-myc construct (pMPCAT) contained 2.3 kilobases upstream of exon1, exon1, and the first 387 bp of intron 1, which contains the MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites. pMPCAT-MIE1 was constructed by deleting MIE1 (bp 3001–3020) from pMPCAT. pMPCAT-287 was constructed from pMPCAT by deleting aHinPI-SstI fragment (bp 2981–3268), which removed the MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites. HL-60 cells were transiently transfected with pMPCAT, pMPCAT-MIE1, or pMPCAT-287 by electroporation. In all experiments pGL3, a luciferase expression vector, was cotransfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. After a 24-h recovery period, transfected cells were divided equally into two treatment groups. One-half was treated with vehicle, the other was treated with 100 nm1,25-(OH)2D3 for 48 h. It should be noted that these transfected cells differentiated normally in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 as determined by nitro blue tetrazolium dye reduction and nonspecific esterase activity (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited CAT activity by 45.4 ± 7.9% (mean ± S.E., n = 8) in cells transfected with the wild-type c-myc construct (pMPCAT). With the MIE1 deletion construct (pMPCAT-MIE1), 1,25-(OH)2D3 was only able to suppress CAT activity by 18.5 ± 4.3% (mean ± S.E., n = 8); this 59.3% reversal was statistically significant (p < 0.02). Deletion of MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites (pMPCAT-287) completely reversed 1,25-(OH)2D3's ability to inhibit CAT activity (−6.5 ± 10.9% inhibition by 1,25-(OH)2D3, mean ± S.E.,p < 0.002). These transfection results indicate that MIE2- and/or MIE3-binding proteins are acting cooperatively with the MIE1-binding proteins to block c-myc transcription. Since the cell transfection data shows that MIE2 and/or MIE3 binding sites are also involved in 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of c-myc, we examined if 1,25-(OH)2D3 can enhance nuclear protein binding to MIE2 and MIE3. HL-60 cells were treated with vehicle or 100 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 48 h. Nuclear proteins were isolated and assayed for MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding using EMSA (Fig. 2). Consistent with our previous study, 1,25-(OH)2D3 enhanced the binding to two nuclear proteins to the MIE1 site. MIE2-binding proteins migrated similarly to MIE1-binding proteins. This observation was not surprising, since the MIE2 binding site has sequence homology to the MIE1 binding site. Interestingly, MIE3-binding proteins induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 migrated differently. To determine the specificity of these MIE-binding proteins, competition experiments were performed (Fig. 3). MIE1 and MIE2 complexes were completely blocked by competition with unlabeled MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–4, and Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–9). Different slower migrating MIE1 and MIE2 complexes were observed when unlabeled MIE1 or MIE2 was used as the competitor (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2 and 3, and Fig. 3 B,lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, these slower MIE1 and MIE2 complexes were not apparent when unlabeled MIE3 was used as a competitor, suggesting that this protein has greater affinity for MIE3 than MIE1 or MIE2. As shown in Fig. 3 C, unlabeled MIE1 or MIE2 was not as effective as unlabeled MIE3 in displacing the binding of the MIE3 complexes. Moreover, the MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 complexes were not displaced with a nonspecific competitor (OCT1, 100-fold excess).Figure 3Competition analysis between MIE1-, MIE2-, and MIE3-binding proteins. All of the competition experiments were performed with nuclear extracts from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells. Unlabeled MIE1, MIE2, MIE3, or OCT1 (100-fold excess) was added to the reaction where indicated. A, 32P-MIE1; B,32P-MIE2; C, 32P-MIE3. This figure is representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our laboratory reported that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate mimicked the effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 by inducing a similar increase in the binding of a 32-kDa doublet protein to MIE1 (19Pan Q. Martell R.E. O'Connell T.D. Simpson R.U. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4154-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, this report showed that dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase completely prevented the 32-kDa proteins to bind to MIE1. However, treatment of nuclear proteins with phosphatase is a crude method to determine the importance of protein phosphorylation. To further elucidate the role of protein phosphorylation and specifically PKC, HL-60 cells were treated with two different protocols to inhibit 1,25-(OH)2D3 mediated increases in PKCβ levels and activity. Chelerythrine chloride, a PKC activity inhibitor, and a PKCβ antisense oligonucleotide were used. Previously, our laboratory reported the activity and specificity of the PKCβ antisense used in this study (15Simpson R.U. O'Connell T.D. Pan Q. Newhouse J. Somerman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19587-19591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were cotreated with 100 nm 1,25-(OH)2D3 and 3 μm chelerythrine chloride or 30 μm PKCβ antisense for 48 h. Nuclear extracts were isolated and assayed for MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding using EMSA. As shown in Fig.4 A, 1,25-(OH)2D3 significantly increased the binding of two nuclear proteins to MIE1. Extract from cells cotreated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 and chelerythrine chloride exhibited a mark reduction in protein binding to MIE1. Likewise, a PKCβ antisense oligonucleotide was able to significantly suppress 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced binding of proteins to MIE1, while the PKCβ sense had no effect. Similar results were obtained using MIE2 (Fig. 4 B) and MIE3 (Fig. 4 C) oligonucleotides. These observations support the notion that protein phosphorylation via PKCβ is required for 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulation of c-mycduring HL-60 cell differentiation. To purify the MIE1-binding proteins, we utilized a biotin-streptavidin affinity system (Fig. 5 A). Nuclear extract from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated cells was incubated with biotin-labeled MIE1 double-stranded oligonucleotide. The incubation buffer, duration of incubation, and temperature were identical to the conditions used in the EMSA. The binding reaction was then incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of streptavidin-agarose on a rotating wheel. The reaction mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant (FT) was removed. The biotin-streptavidin-agarose pellet was washed two times (W1and W2) with binding buffer and resuspended in elution buffer. After incubating on a rotating wheel, the mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant containing the MIE1-binding proteins was collected (E). The collected fractions were dialzyed for 2 h against 50 volumes of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mmDTT. Fifty (50) μg of nuclear protein from the starting material (SM) and the FT fraction along with the entire volume collected from the wash 1 (W1), wash 2 (W2), and elute (E) fractions were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. As shown in Fig. 5 B, a protein around 32 kDa was selectively retained until eluted. Importantly, this elute fraction still maintained its capacity to bind to MIE1 (Fig. 6, lane 4). The retarded proteins from the elute fraction had an identical migration pattern as compared with the starting material (Fig. 6, lane 2 versus lane 4), indicating that the MIE1-binding proteins were still present in the elute fraction. The sequence of the 32-kDa MIE1-binding protein (QPE(X)G) was found to partially match (80% identity) with residues 49–53 (QPEAG) of the human HOXB4 protein. With this information, we determined whether the 32-kDa protein that was selectively retained by biotin-streptavidin purification was HOXB4. When nuclear protein extracts (1,25-(OH)2D3-treated) were subjected to purification using MIE1-biotin, a HOXB4 antibody was able to detect a 32-kDa protein from the starting material (SM) and elute (E) fractions but not from the flow-through (FT) and wash (W1 and W2) fractions (Fig.6 B). To further support the identification of the 32-kDa protein as HOXB4, supershift experiments were performed using a HOXB4 antibody (Fig. 7). Nuclear protein extracts used in the supershift experiments were subjected to biotin-streptavidin purification. Consistent with Fig. 6, MIE1 binding was still observed with the elute fraction from 1,25-(OH)2D3-treated nuclear proteins. A HOXB4 antibody was able to completely block the binding of nuclear proteins to MIE1. The nonimmune serum had no effect. These results demonstrate that the 32-kDa HOXB4 protein is the major MIE1-binding protein.Figure 6Analysis of elute fraction collected from MIE1 biotin-streptavidin affinity system.

HOXB4 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig.8). HOXB4 has been characterized as a phosphoprotein with a molecular mass of 33 kDa (21Corsetti M.T. Briata P. Sanseverino L. Daga A. Airoldi I. Simeone A. Palmisano G. Angelini C. Boncinelli E. Corte G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4465-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). HOXB4 levels were significantly increased in cells treated with 1,25-(OH)2D3 by 125 ± 15% (n = 5). Interestingly, 1,25-(OH)2D3 also increased the levels of a 60-kDa protein that is recognized by the HOXB4 antibody by 95 ± 12% (n = 5). We do not know the relationship between the 60-kDa protein and the 32-kDa HOXB4. The c-myc protooncogene has been shown to be important in the control of cellular proliferation and differentiation. Overexpressing c-myc in transgenic mice results in high incidences of widespread neoplasia (22Pattengale P. Leder A. Kuo A. Stewart T. Leder P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1986; 132: 9-16PubMed Google Scholar, 23Leder A. Pattengale P. Kuo A. Stewart T. Leder P. Cell. 1986; 45: 485-495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Conversely, transgenic mice carrying the null mutations for c-myc die in utero between 9.5 and 10.5 days (24Davis A.C. Wims M. Spotts G.D. Hann S.R. Bradley A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-myclevels are elevated in both experimentally induced and naturally occurring tumors (25Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, c-myc has been reported to play a role in the regulation of telomerase activity. Several groups have shown that differentiation of HL-60 cells with retinoic acid or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate results in a significant reduction of telomerase activity (26Sharma H.W. Sokolosky J.A. Perez J.R. Maltese J.Y. Sartorelli A.C. Stein C.A. Nichols G. Khaled Z. Telang N.T. Narayanan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1997; 241: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) reported that a c-myc antisense oligonucleotide inhibits telomerase activity in three leukemia cell lines, HL-60, U937, and K562. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex that adds telomeric repeats onto the ends of chromosomes during the replicative phase of the cell cycle. Without telomerase activity cells will withdraw from the cell cycle and undergo cell death. Telomerase activity has been detected in a wide variety of human tumors, but only in a few normal somatic cells (30Kim N.W. Piathyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6458) Google Scholar). Thus, differentiation of tumor cells is associated with decreased c-myc expression and telomerase activity. Regulation of c-myc gene expression is complex and has been shown to involve several mechanisms, including changes in transcription initiation, transcription elongation, RNA stability, and RNA translation (4Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Ryan K.M. Birnie G.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that binding of a 32-kDa doublet protein to MIE1 may be a mechanism used by 1,25-(OH)2D3 to regulate c-myctranscription during HL-60 cell differentiation (19Pan Q. Martell R.E. O'Connell T.D. Simpson R.U. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4154-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The results from our cell transfection data indicate that MIE1-, MIE2-, and MIE3-binding proteins are required and may cooperate to down-regulate c-myc during 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of HL-60 cells (Fig. 1). In addition, we demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)2D3 induces nuclear proteins to bind to MIE2 and MIE3. As shown in Fig. 3, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled OCT1 was unable to displace the binding of specific nuclear proteins to MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3. Unlabeled MIE1 or MIE2 was able to completely displace the binding of two retarded bands to 32P-MIE1 and caused the appearance of a higher molecular weight MIE1 complex. This higher molecular weight MIE1 complex was visible in the absence of unlabeled MIE1 or MIE2 if the film was allowed to expose for a longer period of time (data not shown). These observations suggest that the higher molecular weight binding protein has a lower affinity for MIE1. The same results were obtained using 32P-MIE2, suggesting that the same proteins bind to MIE1 and MIE2. Moreover, unlabeled MIE3 was able to block the binding of nuclear proteins to MIE1 and MIE2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). Unlabeled MIE3 was more effective at displacing nuclear proteins to bind to32P-MIE3 than unlabeled MIE1 or MIE2 (Fig. 3 C,lanes 12–14). It should be noted that the fastest migrating MIE3 band appears to bind with specificity to MIE3. Taken together, these results suggest that these 1,25-(OH)2D3-inducible proteins are capable of binding to MIE1, MIE2, or MIE3 with different specificities and affinities. We and others (9Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Taylor J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5570-5575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Martell R.E. Simpson R.U. Hsu T. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 2370-2374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed previously that 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotes the differentiation of HL-60 cells by increasing PKC levels. In addition, it was demonstrated that 1,25-(OH)2D3 must also provide the cofactors, calcium and phospholipids, to chronically activate PKC in order to promote HL-60 cell differentiation (32Pan Q. Granger J. O'Connell T.D. Somerman M.J. Simpson R.U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that PKCβ antisense oligonucleotides were able to block 1,25-(OH)2D3-mediated increases in PKCβ levels as well as 1,25-(OH)2D3 promotion of HL-60 cell differentiation (15Simpson R.U. O'Connell T.D. Pan Q. Newhouse J. Somerman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19587-19591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using the same PKCβ antisense construct, MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 complexes induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 were completely abrogated (Fig.4). Similarly, chelerythrine chloride, a selective PKC activity inhibitor, was able to significantly reduce the binding of MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 to the nuclear proteins. These data suggest that c-myc regulatory proteins must be phosphorylated via PKCβ in order to bind to their respective MIE sites. The results from the biotin-streptavidin purification showed that a 32-kDa protein was retained by biotin-MIE1. Previously, we reported that the predominant MIE1-binding protein is a 32-kDa doublet protein as determined by SouthWestern blot analysis. From this, we were interested in identifying the 32-kDa protein isolated from the biotin-streptavidin purification. The amino acid sequences obtained for the 32-kDa protein have similarities to the human HOXB4 protein. Also, the characteristics of HOXB4 was similar to our unknown 32-kDa MIE1-binding protein. HOXB4 and the 32-kDa MIE1-binding protein are phosphoproteins with similar molecular weights. Additionally, both proteins bind DNA and act as transcriptional regulators. To determine whether the 32-kDa MIE1-binding protein was HOXB4, a supershift EMSA was performed using a HOXB4 antibody. As shown in Fig. 7, a HOXB4 antibody was able to block the binding of nuclear proteins to MIE1. Most likely, the HOXB4 antibody is interacting with the MIE1 binding site on HOXB4 since addition of 32P-MIE1 prior to antibody incubation partially reverses the block in complex formation (data not shown). Moreover, a HOXB4 antibody immunodetected the 32-kDa protein that was affinity purified using biotin-MIE1 (Fig. 6). Taken together, our results strongly support the identification of the 32-kDa MIE1-binding protein as HOXB4. The homeobox (HOX) genes are a family of transcriptional regulators that contain a conserved 183-nucleotide sequence. This nucleotide sequence encodes a 61-amino acid domain, the homeodomain, and includes a helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif (32Pan Q. Granger J. O'Connell T.D. Somerman M.J. Simpson R.U. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 909-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Scott M.P. Tamkum J.W. Hartzell G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 989: 25-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar).

From these studies, evidence exists to suggest the possibility of a correlation between expression of individual HOX genes and hematopoietic cell phenotype (36Shen W.F. Largman C. Lowney P. Corral J.

Studies utilizing human leukemia cells have demonstrated that cells representing various stages of hematopoietic differentiation exhibit different patterns of HOX gene expression (38Celetti A. Barba P. Cillo C. Rotoli B. Boncinelli E. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HOX genes have been involved in translocation events in certain leukemia cells, suggesting that mutant/nonfunctional forms of these proteins may be important in oncogenesis (39Blatt C.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In addition, Zappavigna et al. (43Zappavigna V. Renucci A. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Urier G. Peschle C. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4177-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) reported that HOX4C and HOX4D are able to transactivate the HOX4D promoter, whereas HOX4E is not. Relevant to our finding, Vallerga et al. (44Vallerga A. Shen W.F. Hauser C. Largman C. Lawrence H.J. Proc. Am. Soc. Hematol. 1991; 78: 254aGoogle Scholar) demonstrated that the HOX 2.2 protein is able to bind to the second intron and the 3′ enhancer region of the β-globin gene, important regulatory sites for globin expression. Our studies indicate that HOXB4 is the major MIE1-binding protein. Thus, it is possible that HOXB4 is able to block transcription elongation and thereby negatively regulate c-myc expression during cell differentiation. Alternatively, it is possible that HOXB4 is heterodimerizing with a distinct MIE1-binding protein to form a cooperative MIE1 binding complex. Several studies have shown that HOX proteins heterodimerize with non-HOX proteins to form DNA binding complexes (45Shen W.-F. Rozenfeld S. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. J. Biol.

Our data does not exclude any of these possibilities but indicates that HOXB4 is involved in the complex regulation of c-myc expression. Several investigators have reported that modulation of HOX expression can affect myeloid differentiation. Overexpression of HOXB8 in a murine myeloid cell line inhibited the ability of interleukin-6 to promote differentiation (47Blatt C. Lotem J. Sachs L. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 671-676PubMed Google Scholar). Lill et al. (48Lill M.C. Fuller J.F. Herzig R. Crooks G.M. Gasson J. Blood. 1995; 85: 692-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of HOXB7 in HL-60 cells blocked granulocytic differentiation in response to retinoic acid or Me2SO, but did not potentiate monocytic differentiation promoted by 1,25-(OH)2D3. Moreover, they reported that overexpression of HOXB7, by itself, is not sufficient to promote monocytic differentiation, suggesting that other HOX proteins must be involved in this differentiative process. Recently, 1,25-(OH)2D3 has been shown to increase HOXB7 expression in HL-60 cells prior to monocytic differentiation (48Lill M.C. Fuller J.F. Herzig R. Crooks G.M. Gasson J. Blood. 1995; 85: 692-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, HOXB4 protein levels in HL-60 cells were significantly increased upon exposure to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Interestingly, in differentiated HL-60 cells (1,25-(OH)2D3 for 72 h), HOXB4 protein levels were similar to untreated cells (data not shown). This observation suggests that HOXB4 is involved in the process of initiating differentiation but not in maintaining a mature cell phenotype. In summary, these results demonstrate that MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 binding sites are necessary for 1,25-(OH)2D3down-regulation of c-myc. Also, nuclear proteins binding to MIE1, MIE2, and MIE3 are blocked by inhibition of PKC activity and decreased PKCβ levels. This study further reveals that a major MIE1-binding protein is HOXB4. Moreover, HOXB4 protein levels are regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 during HL-60 cell differentiation. We thank Dr. Maria Zajac-Kaye for providing the c-myc promoter plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W2050302468,"Structural analysis of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has revealed two sites of ligand interaction in the active site gorge: an acylation site at the base of the gorge and a peripheral site at its mouth. A goal of our studies is to understand how ligand binding to the peripheral site alters the reactivity of substrates and organophosphates at the acylation site. Kinetic rate constants were determined for the phosphorylation of AChE by two fluorogenic organophosphates, 7-[(diethoxyphosphoryl)oxy]-1-methylquinolinium iodide (DEPQ) and 7-[(methylethoxyphosphonyl)oxy]-4-methylcoumarin (EMPC), by monitoring release of the fluorescent leaving group. Rate constants obtained with human erythrocyte AChE were in good agreement with those obtained for recombinant human AChE produced from a high level Drosophila S2 cell expression system. First-order rate constants k OP were 1,600 ± 300 min−1 for DEPQ and 150 ± 11 min−1 for EMPC, and second-order rate constants k OP/K OP were 193 ± 13 μm−1 min−1 for DEPQ and 0.7–1.0 ± 0.1 μm−1 min−1for EMPC. Binding of the small ligand propidium to the AChE peripheral site decreased k OP/K OPby factors of 2–20 for these organophosphates. Such modest inhibitory effects are consistent with our recently proposed steric blockade model (Szegletes, T., Mallender, W. D., and Rosenberry, T. L. (1998)Biochemistry 37, 4206–4216). Moreover, the binding of propidium resulted in a clear increase in k OPfor EMPC, suggesting that molecular or electronic strain caused by the proximity of propidium to EMPC in the ternary complex may promote phosphorylation. In contrast, the binding of the polypeptide neurotoxin fasciculin to the peripheral site of AChE dramatically decreased phosphorylation rate constants. Values ofk OP/K OP were decreased by factors of 103 to 105, andk OP was decreased by factors of 300–4,000. Such pronounced inhibition suggested a conformational change in the acylation site induced by fasciculin binding. As a note of caution to other investigators, measurements of phosphorylation of the fasciculin-AChE complex by AChE inactivation gave misleading rate constants because a small fraction of the AChE was resistant to inhibition by fasciculin.

Adv. Enzymol. 1975; 43: 103-218PubMed Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of AChE reveals that despite the impressive turnover rate of the enzyme, substrate molecules must penetrate 20 Å into a deep active site gorge to be hydrolyzed (2Sussman J.L.

Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). This gorge contains two sites of ligand interaction: a peripheral site at the surface of the enzyme and an acylation site at the base of the gorge where the substrate acyl group is first transferred to residue Ser200 (Torpedo californica AChE sequence numbering) and then hydrolyzed. In the acylation site, a catalytic triad consisting of residues Ser200, His440, and Glu327 promotes the acyl transfers, and Trp84 binds the acetylcholine trimethylammonium group, positioning the substrate for hydrolysis. Certain ligands can bind selectively to either the acylation site or the peripheral site, and ternary complexes can be formed in which ligands are bound to both sites simultaneously (5Taylor P. Lappi S. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 1989-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 6Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cervenansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19694-19701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Ligands specific for the peripheral site include the small aromatic compound propidium and the snake venom neurotoxin fasciculin, both of which are potent inhibitors of the hydrolysis of the chromogenic acetylcholine analog, acetylthiocholine. The AChE peripheral site is an attractive target for the design of new classes of therapeutic agents, so it is important to understand how ligand binding to the peripheral site affects substrate hydrolysis. We recently provided evidence for a steric blockade model which proposes that small peripheral site ligands like propidium inhibit substrate hydrolysis by decreasing the association and dissociation rate constants for an acylation site ligand without significantly altering their ratio, the ligand equilibrium constant (7Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cationic substrates like acetylthiocholine also were shown to bind to the peripheral site as the first step in their catalytic pathway, and steric blockade arising from this substrate binding accounted for the well known phenomenon of substrate inhibition for AChE at very high concentrations of substrate (8Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). A key feature of the steric blockade model is that ligand binding to the peripheral site results in significant inhibition only if substrate fails to reach equilibrium binding prior to reaction at the acylation site. Substrates that are thought to form equilibrium complexes at the acylation site can be examined to test this prediction. Among these substrates are the organophosphates (OPs), a class of compounds that inactivate cholinesterases because they are poor substrates (9Burgen A.S.V. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1949; 4: 219-228Google Scholar, 10Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 190: 111-117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Aldridge W.N. Reiner E. Frontiers of Biology. 26th Ed. Elsevier, North Holland, Amsterdam1972: 328Google Scholar). OPs readily phosphorylate the active site serine of AChE, but very slow hydrolysis of this phosphoryl enzyme results in essentially irreversible inactivation of the enzyme (12Froede H.C. Wilson I.B. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 5. Academic Press, New York1971: 87-114Google Scholar). In this paper we examine the effects of ligand binding to the peripheral site on OP phosphorylation of AChE in the context of the steric blockade model. Rate constants of phosphorylation are measured in two ways. The classical method involves periodic measurements of AChE activity toward substrates as the enzyme becomes inactivated. The second method involves continuous assay of the phosphorylation reactions either with mixtures of acetic acid ester substrates and OPs (13Hart G.D. O'Brien R.D. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Berman H.A. Leonard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3942-3950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by monitoring loss of a fluorogenic OP leaving group (15Gordon M.A. Carpenter D.E. Barrett H.W. Wilson I.B. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Levy D. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This method can be adapted to stopped-flow kinetic techniques to allow determination of both first- and second-order phosphorylation rate constants (13Hart G.D. O'Brien R.D. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 14Berman H.A. Leonard K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3942-3950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we monitor the reactions of two fluorogenic OPs, EMPC and DEPQ (Fig.1), with erythrocyte and recombinant human AChE. Phosphorylation rate constants obtained directly by fluorescence measurement of their AChE-mediated hydrolysis products 7HMC and 7HMQ, respectively (Fig. 1), are compared with those obtained by enzyme inactivation. Human erythrocyte AChE was purified as outlined previously, and active site concentrations were determined by assuming 410 units/nmol (17Rosenberry T.L. Scoggin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5643-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Roberts W.L. Kim B.H. Rosenberry T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7817-7821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2One unit corresponds to 1 μmol of acetylthiocholine hydrolyzed/min under standard pH-stat assay conditions (3.67 ΔA 412 nm/min in our standard spectrophotometric assay (17Rosenberry T.L. Scoggin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5643-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)).DEPQ (15Gordon M.A. Carpenter D.E. Barrett H.W. Wilson I.B. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 85: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Ginsburg S. Kitz R.J. Wilson I.B. J. Med. Chem. 1966; 9: 632-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and EMPC were synthesized by established procedures (see Ref. 16Levy D. Ashani Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). [(Methylethoxyphosphonyl)oxy]chloride was reacted with 7HMC (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to give EMPC, and [(diethoxyphosphoryl)oxy]chloride was linked to 7-hydroxyquinoline (Acros Organics) and quaternized by methylation to form DEPQ. Structures were confirmed by 1H NMR and 31P NMR, and stock concentrations were determined by absorbance (ε310 nm = 11.0 mm−1cm−1 for EMPC, and ε317 nm = 8.3 mm−1 cm−1 for DEPQ). Fasciculin was the fasciculin 2 form obtained from Dr. Carlos Cervenansky at the Instituto de Investigaciones Biologicas, Clemente Estable, Montevideo, Uraguay (6Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cervenansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19694-19701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Propidium iodide was purchased from Calbiochem. The full-length cDNA for human G4 AChE was obtained from Dr. Avigdor Shafferman in the vector pACHE10 (20Kronman C. Velan B. Gozes Y. Leitner M. Flashner Y. Lazar A. Marcus D. Sery T. Papier Y. Grosfeld H. Cohen S. Shafferman A. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To obtain a secreted dimeric form of human AChE, a 96-base pair truncation sequence including a stop codon was synthesized and inserted just downstream from the exon 4/5 boundary (see Ref. 21Incardona J.P. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 595-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Insertion of the modified exon 4/5 sequence (corresponding to544ASEAPSTC-DGDSS-stop, human AChE sequence numbering) resulted in a partial duplication of the 3′-end of the exon 4 region of the gene. To remove this duplicated segment, theNotI-NheI 3′- segment of the gene was cloned intoNotI-NheI-digested pCIneo (Promega Corp.). This construct, pCIneo3′-AChE, contained an EspI site in both the original and modified sections of exon 4. The unwanted duplicated gene segment was removed by digestion with EspI followed by cloning of the resolved NotI-NheI fragment back into the AChE gene cassette. The final gene construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out at the Mayo Clinic Rochester Molecular Biology Core Facility. The modified human AChE cDNA was moved into the pPac vector for transfection into and expression fromDrosophila S2 cells in tissue culture (21Incardona J.P. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 595-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). S2 cells were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum and appropriate antibiotics at 28 °C. S2 cells were cotransfected with pPac carrying the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene for selection of cells with hygromycin B. After selection with 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin B, monoclonal cell lines were isolated from colonies formed using a modified soft agar cloning protocol (21Incardona J.P. Rosenberry T.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 595-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 104 to 105selected cells were suspended in complete medium with 0.3% low melting temperature agarose. This mixture was plated onto a base layer of solidified 1.5% low melting temperature agarose (in complete medium with 0.15 m NaCl) in 12-well tissue culture plates. After cell/medium layer solidification, a layer of complete medium was placed on top of the agarose. Colonies (>2 mm) were picked and grown in 24-well plates until confluence. At this point clones were assayed for AChE activity, and lines with high activity were kept for large scale culturing and long term propagation. AChE was purified from culture medium by two cycles of affinity chromatography on acridinium resin (17Rosenberry T.L. Scoggin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5643-5652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified recombinant AChE samples analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) showed no contaminants. In the absence of disulfide reducing agents, a prominent band of 140-kDa dimer and a minor band of 70-kDa monomer were apparent, whereas in the presence of reducing agents a single 70-kDa band was observed. Comparison of the recombinant AChE with purified human erythrocyte AChE showed no differences in k cat,K app, or K SS for acetylthiocholine hydrolysis (8Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J.

Open table in a new tab Rate constants were calculated from the dependence of k on [OP] as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Direct reaction of AChE with EMPC or DEPQ was followed by formation of their respective fluorescent leaving groups 7HMC or 7HMQ on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer and 0.02% Triton X-100 at 23 °C. Because these groups are fluorescent only when their 7-OH substituents are deprotonated (7HMC, pK a = 7.8 (catalog from Molecular Probes, Inc.); 7HMQ, pK a = 5.9 (23Rosenberry T.L. Bernhard S.A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4114-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 24Maglothin J.A. Wins P. Wilson I.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 403: 370-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)), measurements were conducted at pH 8.0 for EMPC and pH 7.0 for DEPQ. Ratios of OP to AChE concentrations were adjusted to at least 20 for EMPC and 9 for DEPQ in all cases to prevent significant depletion of OP during the course of the reaction. Formation of 7HMC (ε360 nm = 19.0 mm−1 cm−1 at pH 9.0; catalog of Molecular Probes, Inc.) was monitored with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 450 nm, and 7HMQ formation was monitored with excitation at 400 nm and emission at 500 nm (for 7HMQ, ε406 nm = 10.0 mm−1 cm−1 at pH 9.0). For reactions that were completed in less than 1 min, a Hi-Tech SFA 20 stopped-flow apparatus was used to mix equal volumes (300 μl) of AChE (or AChE with inhibitor) and OP solutions rapidly, and fluorescence was recorded at fixed intervals as short as 20 ms. Formation of 7HMC or 7HMQ did not follow a simple exponential time course. Nonenzymatic hydrolysis of EMPC under all conditions and of DEPQ in the presence of propidium or fasciculin as inhibitors was significant, and under these conditions data were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis (Fig. P version 6.0, BioSoft, Inc.) to Equation 1.f=finitial+Δf(1−e−kt)+CtEquation 1 In Equation 1, f initial is the fluorescence at time zero, Δf is the fluorescence change corresponding to an amount of fluorescent product equal to the AChE concentration (23Rosenberry T.L. Bernhard S.A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 4114-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), C is the nonenzymatic hydrolysis rate, and k is the rate constant for the approach to the steady-state level of phosphorylation. With DEPQ in the absence of inhibitors the release of 7HMQ occurred in two phases, a large rapid phase and a small slower phase (see “Results”) for both erythrocyte and recombinant AChE. These data were fitted to Equation 2, where Δf 2 and k 2 were the respective amplitude and the rate constant for the slower phase, and the other parameters were as defined in Equation 1.f=finitial+Δf(1−e−kt)+Δf2(1−e−k2t)Equation 2 The rate constants k were analyzed according to the catalytic pathway in Scheme FS1. In this Scheme, OPX is the intact OP with leaving group X; EOPX is the initial complex of the OP with AChE, characterized by the equilibrium dissociation constant K S =k −S/k S; andEOP is the phosphorylated enzyme. The inhibitor I can bind to the peripheral site in each of the enzyme species (as denoted by the subscript P). This scheme is identical to a general pathway for substrate hydrolysis by AChE considered elsewhere (7Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of this scheme was simplified here in two ways. First, dephosphorylation rate constants (k 3 in SchemeFS1), which appeared consistent with a value of 2–4 × 10−4 min−1 reported previously for diethoxyphosphorylated eel AChE (24, 15; data not shown), were assumed to be negligible in all our experiments. Second, OPs were assumed to equilibrate with the AChE acylation site even when inhibitors were bound to the peripheral site. This assumption was supported by nonequilibrium kinetic simulations with the program SCoP, as noted under “Results,” 3To ensure that EMPC and DEPQ were close enough to equilibrium with AChE in the presence of 30 μmpropidium or 0.5–10 μm fasciculin to justify application of Equations Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, we applied the SCoP simulation program (7Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to SchemeFS1 with the following rate constant assignments:k S = 1 × 107m−1 s−1 for EMPC and 2 × 108m−1 s−1 for DEPQ, values similar to those assigned previously for neutral and cationic acetic acid ester substrates (7Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); k I =k SI = 2 × 108m−1 s−1 for propidium (7Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar);k I = k SI = 3 × 107m−1 s−1 for fasciculin with free AChE, and k I =k SI = 1 × 107m−1 s−1 for fasciculin with AChE in the presence of DTNB and acetylthiocholine (6Eastman J.

Simulated values ofk OP andk OP/K OP were then compared for complete equilibrium (k S2/k S = 1) and pronounced steric blockade (k S2/k S = 0.00001) and found to differ by less than 10%, justifying the equilibrium assumption.and it obviated the need for more complex mechanistic schemes that apply to substrates that do not equilibrate with AChE (8Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). With these assumptions, the dependence of k evaluated from either Equation 1 or Equation 2 on the OP concentration was analyzed by weighted nonlinear regression analysis (assuming constant percent error in k) according to Equation 3 to givek OP andk OP/K OP, the respective first- and second-order rate constants of phosphorylation.k=kOP[OP]KOP+[OP]Equation 3 These rate constants are related to the intrinsic rate constants in Scheme FS1 as shown Equations 4 and 5.kOP=k21+a[I]KSI1+[I]KSIEquation 4 kOPKOP=k21+a[I]KSIKS1+[I]KIEquation 5 In the absence of I, k OP =k 2 and K OP =K S. In the presence of I,K OP is given by Equation 6.KOP=KS1+[I]KI1+[I]KSIEquation 6 Assays with the peripheral site inhibitors propidium (30 μm) or fasciculin (0.5–10 μm) were conducted at inhibitor concentrations at least 30 times their respective K I values to ensure that most of the AChE was complexed with inhibitor. Values of K Iwere taken as 1.0 ± 0.1 μm for propidium (7Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4206-4216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 11 ± 0.2 pm for fasciculin (6Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cervenansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19694-19701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and 100 pm for fasciculin in the presence of DTNB and acetylthiocholine in the standard assay (6Eastman J. Wilson E.J. Cervenansky C. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19694-19701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Szegletes T. Mallender W.D. Thomas P.J. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Measurements that included fasciculin were modified in several ways. First, the enzyme was incubated with fasciculin for 5–10 min to generate equilibrated complex before the addition of OP. Second, the reaction buffer with EMPC was adjusted to pH 7.0 to reduce nonenzymatic hydrolysis of the OP. Finally, a four-cell cuvette changer was employed (except where noted) for reaction times as long as 4 h. This device minimized fluorophore photobleaching because the sample was cycled in and out of the light path. Each reaction was measured in parallel with cuvettes corresponding to an air blank and a nonenzymatic hydrolysis control devoid of AChE. AChE activity was monitored by a modified acetylthiocholine assay (25Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres J.V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar). Standard assays were conducted in 3.0 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.02% Triton X-100, 0.33 mm DTNB, and 0.5 mmacetylthiocholine (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. Enzyme hydrolysis was monitored by formation of the thiolate dianion of DTNB at 412 nm (Δε412 nm = 14.15 mm−1 cm−1 (26Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar)) for 1–5 min on a Varian Cary 3A spectrophotometer. 4Enzyme activities were standardized to 0.1 ΔA 412 nm/min by applying the observed relationship v std = 0.1(v/0.1)1/R, where v was the measured activity, v std was the standardized activity, and r = 0.95. R was the slope of a plot of log measured activity versus log enzyme concentration over a 200-fold range of enzyme dilution. The inactivation of AChE by an OP was initiated by mixing AChE and OP at 23 °C in 20 mm phosphate buffer and 0.02% Triton X-100 (pH = 7.0). At various times a 1.0-ml aliquot was removed to a cuvette, 40 μl of acetylthiocholine and DTNB were added to final concentrations of 0.5 mm and 0.33 mm, respectively, and a continuous assay trace was recorded immediately at 412 nm. Background hydrolysis rates in the absence of AChE were subtracted. To assess the effects of peripheral site inhibitors on OP inactivation rates, propidium (30 μm) or fasciculin (50–250 nm) was incubated with AChE for at least 10–30 min prior to the addition of the OP. In some cases, DEPQ was also added (to 10–60 nm) for 60–120 min after incubation of fasciculin with AChE to eliminate a minor population of AChE which was refractory to normal fasciculin inhibition (see “Results”). Titrations of AChE activity with substoichiometric amounts of DEPQ were conducted by procedures similar to those in other inactivation measurements except that initial incubation mixtures contained higher concentrations of AChE (28–260 nm) and fasciculin (0–2 μm) and that after 90–120 min small aliquots of the mixtures (15–20 μl) were diluted into the standard acetylthiocholine assay solution. OP inactivation reactions were measured under pseudo first-order conditions in which the ratio of OP to AChE concentrations was adjusted to at least 5. Assay rates v during inactivation were divided by the control assay rate in the absence of OP to give a normalized value v (N), and these values were fitted by nonlinear regression analysis (Fig. P) to Equation 7, wherev (N)initial and v (N)finalare the calculated values of v (N) at time zero and in the final steady state, respectively.v(N)=v(N)final+(v(N)initial−v(N)final)e−ktEquation 7 OP concentrations also were sufficiently low that the observed inactivation rate constant k was proportional to [OP]. The second-order rate constant for inactivationk OP/K OP was fitted by weighted linear regression analysis of the relationshipk = (k OP/K OP)[OP] (see Equation 3), assuming a constant percent error in k. The rapid reactions of EMPC and DEPQ with AChE require the use of stopped-flow methods if both first- and second-order phosphorylation rate constants are to be measured. Fig. 2 Aillustrates the measurement of an individual k value for the reaction of DEPQ with AChE. The release of the fluorescent product 7HMQ occurred largely with a"

In the current work, we first investigated the possibility of a novel anticoagulant mechanism that functions at the level of zymogen inactivation. Utilizing both clotting and chromogenic assays, the fibrinolysis protease plasmin was found to irreversibly inhibit the pivotal function of factor X (FX) in coagulation. This was due to cleavage at several sites, the location of which were altered by association of FX with procoagulant phospholipid (proPL). The final products were ∼28 and ∼47 kDa for proPL-bound and unbound FX, respectively, which did not have analogues when activated FX (FXa) was cleaved instead. We next investigated whether the FX derivatives could interact with the plasmin precursor plasminogen, and we found that plasmin exposed a binding site only on proPL-bound FX. The highest apparent affinity was for the 28-kDa fragment, which was identified as the light subunit disulfide linked to a small fragment of the heavy subunit (Met-296 to ∼Lys-330). After cleavage by plasmin, proPL-bound FX furthermore was observed to accelerate plasmin generation by tissue plasminogen activator. Thus, a feedback mechanism localized by proPL is suggested in which plasmin simultaneously inhibits FX clotting function and converts proPL-bound FX into a fibrinolysis cofactor. These data also provide the first evidence for an anticoagulant mechanism aimed directly at the zymogen FX.

Whereas the coagulation pathway produces insoluble fibrin clot to seal vascular leaks, the fibrinolysis pathway solubilizes the clot to restore normal blood flow. It is obvious that for either of these pathways to be effective, their amplification must be sequential. Several coordinating mechanisms have been identified that each control the availability of fibrinolysis cofactors. The best described of these is the production of fibrin (1Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 223: 197-206Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which, unlike its precursor fibrinogen, is a fibrinolysis cofactor that colocalizes the zymogen plasminogen and an activating protease, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), 1The abbreviations used are:tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; FX, factor X; FXa, activated FX; FVa, factor Va; proPL, procoagulant phospholipid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; KIU, kalikrein inhibitory unit(s); RVV, Russell's viper venom FX activator; GEMSA, 2-guanidino-ethylmercaptosuccinic acid; HBS, HEPES plus NaCl; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride.1The abbreviations used are:tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; FX, factor X; FXa, activated FX; FVa, factor Va; proPL, procoagulant phospholipid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; KIU, kalikrein inhibitory unit(s); RVV, Russell's viper venom FX activator; GEMSA, 2-guanidino-ethylmercaptosuccinic acid; HBS, HEPES plus NaCl; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride. for subsequent plasmin generation. Plasmin directly mediates fibrin solubilization by proteolysis. In order for plasminogen to assemble into the ternary activation complex, the cofactor molecule must contain a COOH-terminal Lys, which is an essential constituent of the plasminogen binding site (2Miles L.A.

Carboxypeptidases in plasma have been identified that excise COOH-terminal Lys and thereby limit the generation of plasmin (11Skidgel R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1988; 9: 299-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 12Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) by restricting fibrinolysis cofactor function. In particular, an important regulatory role has been demonstrated for one of these carboxypeptidases, TAFI, which has been shown to first become activated and then later inactivated by the final coagulation enzyme, thrombin (12Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 13Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, thrombin orchestrates a lag between coagulation and the amplification of fibrinolysis to ensure sufficient clot production. An additional mechanism of communication between coagulation and fibrinolysis has recently been reported. This involves the enzyme complex responsible for physiological thrombin production, prothrombinase (15Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Prothrombinase consists of the serine protease factor Xa (FXa), and the non-enzymatic cofactor Va (FVa), which in the presence of Ca2+ associate with each other and a procoagulant phospholipid (proPL)-containing surface. Together the constituents of prothrombinase enhance the FXa-mediated activation of prothrombin to thrombin by 5 orders of magnitude (17Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that plasmin can inhibit the prothrombinase cofactor function of FVa (18Omar M.N. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9750-9755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the procofactor V (19Lee C.D. Mann K.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have extended these findings to show that plasmin also proteolytically inhibits the coagulation activity of FXa, and furthermore converts both FXa and FVa into fibrinolysis cofactors (9Pryzdial E.L.G. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the acquisition of fibrinolysis function was dependent on the prior association of FXa or FVa with proPL. This may provide a means to accelerate plasmin generation specifically at sites of vascular damage, where the exposure of proPL is selectively triggered. The physiological generation of FXa requires recruitment of its inactive precursor, factor X (FX), to sites of vascular damage through an association with proPL. Therefore, following sufficient fibrin formation to initiate fibrinolysis, it is conceivable that localized plasmin production may modulate FX function. We now report that FX is a substrate for plasmin, but the final proteolytic products differ from that of FXa. The cleavage of proPL-bound FX by plasmin results in a diametric functional change that inhibits participation in coagulation and simultaneously induces the expression of fibrinolysis cofactor activity. HEPES, EDTA, (Sigma), 2-guanidino-ethylmercaptosuccinic acid (GEMSA), aprotonin (Calbiochem),N-α-Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanalide (S2765), and benzoyl-Ile-Glu-(piperidyl)-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanalide (S2366) (Helena) were purchased. As a source of proPL, small unilamellar phospholipid vesicles consisting of 75% phosphatidylcholine and 25% of the procoagulant lipid, phosphatidylserine, were prepared and quantified as described (16Krishnaswamy S. Nesheim M.E. Pryzdial E.L.G. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 260-280Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Human coagulation factor X (FX) was purified from fresh frozen plasma (21Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) or from prothrombin complex concentrate diluted to 1 unit/ml factor X clotting activity (obtained as generous gifts from the Canadian Red Cross Society, London Collection Center, and from Bayer, Inc., respectively). For comparison to in-house preparations, FX was also purchased (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.). Human FXa (22Jesty J. Nemerson Y. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3291-3299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lys-plasminogen were produced, as described (25Nesheim M. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lys-plasminogen was radioiodinated (50,000–150,000 dpm/μg) using Iodogen (Pierce) and chromatographically desalted (Excellulose 5, Pierce) to remove unincorporated 125I. Purified human plasmin was purchased (Hematologic Technologies, Inc.). FX (9 μm) was treated with plasmin (0.1 μm) in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2 (HBS), in the presence of various combinations of Ca2+ (2 mm), EDTA (5 mm), or proPL (300 μm) at 21 °C. Each digest was sampled over time, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (12% acrylamide) (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and silver-stained. For electrophoretic comparison to the FXa fragments generated by plasmin, at each time point, aprotonin (50 kalikrein inhibitory units (KIU)/ml) was added to the plasmin-digested FX followed by treatment with RVV (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h in 10 mmCaCl2. The effect of plasmin treatment of FX on the generation of FXa coagulation and amidolytic activity was evaluated in plasmin digestion time courses identical to those described above. At each time point, aprotonin (50 KIU/ml) was added to stop further effects of plasmin. Clotting activity was measured by thromboplastin clotting time assays using FX-deficient plasma (Sigma) reconstituted with 5 units/ml purified FX treated with plasmin as a substrate. The amount of FX activation was determined by comparison to a standard curve obtained by titrating purified FXa in the presence of precomplexed plasmin and aprotonin to duplicate the conditions of the time course samples. The generation of FXa amidolytic activity at 22 °C in HBS using S2765 (200 μm) as a chromogenic substrate was followed after treatment of plasmin-digested FX with RVV as described above. The rate of color development was monitored in a kinetic multiwell plate reader (V max, Molecular Devices). To identify FX-derived species that interact with plasminogen, ligand blotting experiments were performed according to methods published by several laboratories (5Dudani A.K. Cummings C. Hashemi S. Ganz P.R. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 185-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 3Hajjar K.A. Jacovina A.T. Chacko J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1991; 30: 1682-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). In our studies, FX fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotansferred to PVDF (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yuen S.W. Chui A.H. Wilson K.J. Yuan P.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 74-82PubMed Google Scholar). The PVDF was blocked overnight at 4 °C in bovine serum albumin (Sigma, 10 mg/ml) and then incubated with125I-Lys-plasminogen (0.1 μm) for 1 h at 22 °C in the presence of the protease inhibitors GEMSA (50 nm) and aprotonin (50 KIU/ml, Calbiochem). Following extensive washing with HBS, the location of bound125I-plasminogen was determined by autoradiography and compared with the electrophoretic patterns made visible by staining the PVDF with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The activation of plasminogen (1 μm) to plasmin by single-chain tPA (10 nm) was followed as a time course utilizing the chromogenic substrate S2366. To determine whether plasmin-treated FX affects tPA function, FX was treated with plasmin (or left untreated) exactly as described above for 30 min. Just enough aprotonin (9.5 KIU/ml) was added to inhibit the plasmin used in this step prior to the addition of tPA and plasminogen. To control for the possible effects of added aprotonin and plasmin, reactions that did not involve a plasmin treatment step contained aprotonin and plasmin that had been preincubated. The subunit composition of plasmin-digested FX products was investigated both by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE involving a first dimension under nonreducing conditions and a second dimension under reducing conditions (29Pryzdial E.L.G. Isenman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1519-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To identify proteolytic cleavage sites, electrophoretic patterns were transferred to PVDF, and bands were excised for sequence analysis (27Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yuen S.W. Chui A.H. Wilson K.J. Yuan P.M. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 74-82PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether FX coagulation activity is altered upon pretreatment with plasmin, Fig. 1 shows FXa-dependent thromboplastin clotting (panel A) and RVV-initiated amidolytic (panel B) assays. Both methods demonstrated that plasmin inhibits the coagulation enzyme function of FX. This was observed regardless of whether binding of FX to proPL was facilitated by Ca2+. The demonstration that FX enzymatic activity is lost due to plasmin pretreatment strongly indicates that FX is cleaved by plasmin. To provide direct evidence, changes in plasmin-treated FX electrophoretic mobility were followed using the same digestion conditions and pretreatment times as in Fig. 1. As demonstrated by the SDS-PAGE shown in Fig.2, plasmin sequentially cleaves FX at several sites. Interestingly, the proteolytic sites recognized by plasmin depended on whether Ca2+ was present to facilitate FX-proPL interactions. It should be noted that minor amounts of the alternate proteolytic products were detected under both reaction conditions, indicating that one pathway is favored over the other but is not exclusive. The nomenclature adopted previously for Pn-mediated FXa fragments (20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used for the analogous FX fragments observed here. However, two additional species were observed for FX that had apparent molecular masses of 28 kDa (Fig. 2 A) and 47 kDa (Fig. 2 B) and resulted from cleavage by plasmin in the presence of Ca2+ and EDTA, respectively. To determine whether only binding of FX to Ca2+ was the determinant in altering the cleavage sites recognized by plasmin, the 30-min time points shown in Fig. 2 were compared with identically treated FX in the presence of Ca2+ but no proPL. These data are shown in Fig. 3 and demonstrate that Ca2+ alone is insufficient to generate the fragmentation profile that resulted in the presence of Ca2+ and proPL. Thus, binding to proPL and not just to Ca2+ is suggested to alter the cleavage of FX by plasmin. To further compare the cleavage of FX and FXa by plasmin, the same fragmentation time courses were conducted as in Fig. 2 except that prior to electrophoresis, the FX-derived fragments generated by plasmin were treated with RVV to remove the activation domain. The resulting SDS-PAGE profiles are shown in Fig. 4, with the mobility of plasmin-mediated species generated directly from purified FXa indicated. As shown in Fig. 4 A, when FXβPn, Ca and FXγPn, Ca were treated with RVV under conditions that favored binding to proPL, the resulting species had electrophoretic migrations identical to FXaβPn, Ca and FXaγPn, Ca, respectively. This suggests that plasmin cleaves the same sites in FX and FXa to generate these fragments. However, the 28-kDa product was unique to FX bound to proPL, and RVV had no effect on the mobility of this fragment. In contrast to FXγPn, Ca, but similar to the further proteolyzed 28-kDa species, the data presented in Fig. 4 Bshow that RVV does not cleave FXγPn, EDTA over the indicated time. This is additional evidence that two pathways of FX proteolysis by plasmin are followed, depending on whether the prior interaction with proPL is facilitated. Because plasmin liberates COOH-terminal basic amino acids and COOH-terminal Lys is a requisite for plasminogen binding to known fibrinolysis cofactors, we investigated whether the proteolysis of FX by plasmin generated species capable of participating in fibrinolysis. As an initial step, we determined whether the plasmin-mediated FX fragments were capable of interacting with plasminogen. To do so, the SDS-PAGE patterns shown in Fig. 2 were transferred to PVDF and probed with125I-plasminogen. The resulting autoradiographs are shown in Fig. 5. Binding of125I-plasminogen to untreated FX was not detectable. However, under conditions that facilitated proPL binding (Fig.5 A), plasmin induced the expression of a receptor site(s) in FXβPn, Ca, FXγPn, Ca, the 28-kDa fragment, and the ∼13-kDa fragment. Using this ligand blotting method, the species clearly having the highest apparent affinity for125I-plasminogen was the 28-kDa fragment for as yet unknown reasons. These observations suggested that plasmin liberates a COOH-terminal Lys on each of these FX fragments. Under conditions that did not facilitate binding of FX to proPL during the plasmin pretreatment step (Fig. 5 B), we observed125I-plasminogen binding only marginally to FXβPn, EDTA and a species that migrated with the dye front. The former appeared to be present as a minor constituent of our starting FX preparation and is likely independent of plasmin pretreatment. No interaction was detectable between 125I-plasminogen and the other major cleavage products, FXγPn, EDTA and the 47-kDa fragment, suggesting that a COOH-terminal Lys is not made available by proteolysis unless binding to proPL is facilitated . Based on our ligand blotting experiments, the 28-kDa fragment in particular was suggested to have potential as a fibrinolysis cofactor. Therefore, we followed the effect of plasmin-cleaved FX on the activation of plasminogen by tPA using a chromogenic assay for plasmin (Fig. 6). As shown, a mixture of FXγPn, Ca and the 28-kDa species produced by pretreatment of proPL-bound FX with plasmin for 30 min (final concentration, 0.5 μm FX) resulted in a 27-fold enhancement of tPA activity (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, when either native FX or FX pretreated with plasmin to produce FXγPn, EDTA and the 47-kDa fragment (Fig. 6 B) were used, insignificant effects on tPA activity were observed. As shown in Fig. 6 C,acceleration of tPA by the FXγPn, Ca and the 28-kDa species mixture was titratable to levels below the circulating concentration of FX (0.17 μm). Because the cleavage sites recognized by plasmin to produce the 28-kDa fragment are unique to FX-bound to proPL, and because this species was found to be a good tPA accelerator and plasminogen-binder, we conducted amino acid sequence analyses to locate the specific cleavage sites. TableI summarizes these data. When the nonreduced FXγPn, Ca band was analyzed, two equimolar sequences were revealed that corresponded to the NH2terminus of the heavy and light subunits of FX. Determination of the ∼13-kDa species amino acid sequence, which appeared concomitant with FXγPn, Ca, revealed that FXγPn, Ca is generated due to cleavage of the heavy subunit at Gly-331 (based on amino acid numbering adopted previously (30Messier T.L.

Open table in a new tab When the nonreduced 28-kDa species was excised from PVDF and sequenced, three equimolar residues per cycle were observed. These corresponded to the NH2 terminus of the heavy and light subunits, in addition to an internal heavy chain sequence beginning at Met-296. To further investigate this mixture of fragments, two-dimensional SDS-PAGE was conducted in which the 28-kDa species was first electrophoresed nonreduced and then subjected to a second dimension under reducing conditions (not shown). Two species were identified after transfer to PVDF and were sequenced. The mobility of the first was not affected by reduction and yielded a sequence identical to the NH2terminus of the FX heavy subunit. The second reduced fragment had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa and migrated exactly to the position of the native FX light subunit. NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis confirmed its identity as the light subunit. These data cumulatively suggested that the nonreduced 28-kDa band was a co-migrating mixture of an NH2 terminus-derived heavy subunit fragment ending at Arg-295 and a heterodimer consisting of the intact light subunit disulfide-linked to a small heavy chain fragment. Under reducing conditions, the small heavy chain fragment was not detectable after transfer to PVDF, and consequently only the amino acid sequence under nonreducing conditions was obtained. Prothrombinase is the final enzyme complex generated within the coagulation cascade and functions directly to generate thrombin. Consequently, numerous modes of regulation of prothrombinase assembly and activity have evolved to enable fine-tuning of thrombin production (31Kalafatis M. Egan J.O. van't Veer C. Mann K.G. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 241Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These include anticoagulant mechanisms that exclusively target the prothrombinase constituent cofactor FVa (32Esmon C.T. Fukudome K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and enzyme FXa (33Olson S.T. Bjork I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 222: 525-559Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar), as well as the upstream tenase complexes, which are responsible for activating FXa from its inactive precursor (32Esmon C.T. Fukudome K. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 34Broze G.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated whether the fibrinolysis effector protease plasmin can modulate the properties of the zymogen FX. Utilizing functional assays initiated by tissue factor or RVV FX activator, we show that plasmin is able to function as an anticoagulant through proteolytic inhibition of FX. To our knowledge this is the first evidence for an anticoagulant mechanism that operates directly at the level of FX inactivation. Because proteolysis by plasmin is capable of producing COOH-terminal Lys, which is an essential feature of known fibrinolysis cofactors (2Miles L.A. Dahlberg C.M. Plescia J. Felez J. Kato K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the possibility that plasmin-cleaved FX acquires fibrinolytic activity was investigated. We found that in addition to having an anticoagulant effect on FX, plasmin converted the FX into a fibrinolysis cofactor. This conclusion is based on experiments that showed plasmin induces the expression of a plasminogen binding site on FX and the ability to accelerate the rate of tPA-dependent plasmin generation by approximately 30-fold. The latter effect was observed below the circulating concentration of FX. This supports the hypothesis that at sites of clot formation, where proPL increases the local concentration of coagulation proteins (15Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the in vitro effects of Pn-cleaved FX on tPA reported here may have a physiological function in concert with other tPA accelerators, notably fibrin. Because the expression of FX-derived tPA cofactor activity was observed only under conditions that facilitated FX-proPL interactions, the proposed pathway would be advantageously localized to sites of clot formation. To understand the structural basis by which FX function is altered by plasmin, Fig. 7 shows a fragmentation map of FX bound to proPL. The first plasmin-mediated cleavage produces FXβPn, Ca, which has the same electrophoretic mobility as previously documented FXβ generated by treatment of FX with FXa (35Jesty J. Spencer A.K. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5614-5622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The location of the cleavage site that excises the β-peptide is inferred and is based partly on the supposition that FXβPn, Ca must have a newly exposed COOH-terminal Lys to account for the observed plasminogen binding. Autolytic cleavages at Lys-435 and Lys-433 have been reported for FXa, with the latter representing a minor product (36Eby C.S. Mullane M.P. Porche-Sorbet R.M. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1992; 80 Suppl. 1: 306aGoogle Scholar). Thus, we have positioned the first plasmin-mediated cleavage of FX to be consistent with the former. The second cleavage of proPL-bound FX by plasmin produced FXγPn, Ca and a 13-kDa species. Amino acid sequence analysis of the former under nonreducing conditions produced two sequences corresponding to the NH2 terminus of the FX heavy and light subunits. Sequence analysis of the latter indicated cleavage of the heavy subunit within the “autolysis loop” between Lys-330 and Gly-331, which is the same as that previously reported for FXa cleaved under identical conditions (20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike the recently reported proteolysis of FX by FXa (37Sabharwal A.K. Padmanabhan K. Tulinsky A. Mathur A. Gorka J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22037-22045Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), cleavage in the autolysis loop by plasmin was not observed by us to be protected by Ca2+. The exposure of a new COOH-terminal Lys at position 330 is consistent with our finding that plasminogen interacts with FXγPn, Ca in ligand blotting experiments. Furthermore, cleavage at this site explains the loss of FX coagulation function because disruption of the protease domain results. Continued incubation of proPL-bound FX with plasmin resulted in a third sequential cleavage that produced a 28-kDa band under nonreducing conditions. Amino acid sequencing identified a heterodimer consisting of the light subunit disulfide linked to a small piece of the heavy subunit starting at Met-296 and presumably extending to Lys-330. The small heavy subunit fragment encompasses Cys-302, which is known to link the FX subunits (38Hojrup P. Magnusson S. Biochem. J. 1987; 245: 887-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The end position at Lys-330 is inferred from the prior cleavage known to expose Gly-331 as the NH2terminus of the 13-kDa fragment. Immunoblot analysis utilizing the well studied monoclonal antibody H11 (39Church W.R. Messier T. Howard P.R. Amiral J. Meyer D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6259-6267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) specific for the Gla-containing domains of several proteins, including residues 4–9 of FX, confirmed that the light chain is a constituent of the 28-kDa heterodimer (not shown). Interestingly, cleavage at Met-296 was not observed after an identical incubation of FXa with plasmin (20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that the activation domain in FX influences the accessibility of cleavage sites. Comigrating with the 28-kDa heterodimer was the expected fragment corresponding to the NH2-terminal portion of the heavy subunit produced by cleavage at Met-296. Reduction changed the electrophoretic mobility of the 28-kDa heterodimer containing the light subunit, but not the mobility of the fragment corresponding to the NH2-terminal heavy subunit fragment. Compared with the other FX fragments generated by plasmin, the apparent affinity observed for plasminogen was clearly strongest for the nonreduced 28-kDa species. The prediction that a COOH-terminal Lys is available in the heterodimer (Lys-330) but not in the single chain heavy subunit fragment (predicted COOH terminus at Arg-295) strongly suggests that the former is responsible for the observed plasminogen binding. Consistent with this conclusion is the lack of plasminogen binding to the 28-kDa monomer under reducing conditions (not shown). The basis for comparatively strong plasminogen binding to the 28-kDa heterodimer is under investigation. When conditions were used to prevent the interaction of FX with proPL (i.e. in the presence of EDTA), the electrophoretic pattern due to plasmin cleavage was altered. At present, the specific cleavage sites have not been determined by amino acid sequencing. However, immunoblot analysis revealed that upon production of FXγPn, EDTA, antigenic recognition by the Gla domain-specific antibody, H11, is lost (not shown). Therefore, unlike our findings for proPL-bound FX, cleavage of FX in the absence of proPL binding resulted in rapid cleavage of the light chain. This is consistent with our previous report (20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) showing that the light subunit of FXa is cleaved by plasmin in the presence of EDTA. Subsequent cleavage of FXγPn, EDTA was observed to result in the appearance of a 47-kDa species that does not have an analogous plasmin-mediated fragment when FXa rather than FX is the substrate (20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the FX light subunit by plasmin was protected only in the presence of both Ca2+ and proPL, indicating that proPL binding and not just divalent cation binding was necessary. The Gla domain has been shown to be involved in activation of FX by tissue factor/FVIIa or RVV FX activator (24Rezaie A.R. Neuenschwander P.W. Morrissey J.H. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8176-8180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which provides an explanation for inhibition of FX coagulation activity by plasmin under conditions that did not facilitate proPL binding. Further evidence for differences in the sites recognized by plasmin due to binding of FX to proPL comes from plasminogen binding and tPA activity studies. Whereas plasmin cleavage was found to convert proPL-bound FX into a plasminogen receptor and tPA accelerator, neither activity was detectable when FX was cleaved by plasmin in the absence of proPL and/or Ca2+. The FX data presented here, together with our earlier reports that showed that plasmin has similar modulatory effects on proPL-bound FXa and FVa (9Pryzdial E.L.G. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17871-17877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Pryzdial E.L.G. Kessler G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16614-16620Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), support a model in which plasmin functions to create a profibrinolytic milieu through direct conversion of specific proteins into tPA cofactors. We have found that neither FX, FXa, nor FVa expresses tPA cofactor function when not bound to proPL. Although the plasmin-mediated cleavage patterns differ, both proPL-bound and unbound FX, FXa, and FVa are inhibited from participating in any further clot formation. In this way, plasmin may participate in a feedback amplified mechanism by producing tPA cofactors localized by the selective accessibility of cellular proPL trapped in the fibrin network. We are currently investigating the relative contribution of fibrin to proPL-bound tPA cofactors within a clot.

However, as yet there is still rather little direct evidence at the protein level for attributes such as the precise sites and the roles of glycosylation, palmitoylation, and phosphorylation of bradykinin B2 or other G protein-coupled receptors. Indeed phosphorylation sites for few G protein-coupled receptors have been mapped to date (10Papac D.I. Oatis J.E. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R.

In-gel digestion of electrophoretically separated receptor, subsequent peptide mass fingerprinting by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) or electrospray ionization (ESI) and fragment analysis by tandem (MS/MS) mass spectrometry have been used to characterize post-translational modifications of this receptor and its multiply phosphorylated species. The patterns of post-translational modifications which have been observed for the receptor under in vivo conditions show correlations among the various modifications and provide new information on their possible role(s) in the functional regulation of the bradykinin B2 receptor.

Chem. 1998; 273: 924-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 1 mg (400 nmol) of Met-Lys-bradykinin was dissolved in 400 μl of 35% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetate, further diluted with 50 mm sodium borate and 0.015% Triton X-305, pH 8.2, and a 10-fold excess (4 μmol) of the heterobifunctional cross-linker EMCS dissolved in 200 μl of acetonitrile was added. Subsequent steps in the reaction were carried out as described previously (12Roos M. Soskic V. Poznanovic S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 924-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The derivatized Met-Lys-bradykinin,N-(ε-maleimidocaproyloxy)succinimide-Met-Lys-bradykinin (EMC-MKBK), was purified on an Aquapore RP-300 column using a gradient of 0–70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The purity of the fraction containing EMC-MKBK was checked by protein sequencing to confirm derivatization at Lys2 and by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (found MH+ 1513.9, expected 1513.6). (dA)30-5′-SS-R was used for attachment of 30-mer (dA) to the EMC-MKBK according to the procedure in Ref. 12Roos M. Soskic V. Poznanovic S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. J. Biol.

The (dA)30-5′-S-EMC-MKBK was purified on a Sephasil C18 column by applying a linear gradient of 2–70% acetonitrile in 0.1m triethylammoniumacetate and 2 mmtetrabutylammoniumhydrogensulfate. CHO cells transfected with rat B2 receptor cDNA (4McEachern A.E. Shelton E.R. Bhakta S. Obernolte R. Bach C. Zuppan P. Fujisaki J. Aldrich R.W. Jarnagin K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells grown to 80% confluence were harvested for membrane preparation by scraping in 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Pipes at pH 6.8. The cells obtained were washed twice with the same buffer and subsequently resuspended in 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm Pipes at pH 6.8. All subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell rupture was performed by Ultra-Turrax (IKA-Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) at 20,000 rpm for 2 min. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Pipes at pH 6.8 to a final protein concentration of 2 mg/ml. The membrane suspension was stored at −80 °C. CHO membranes (600 μl) were suspended in 2 volumes of 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 4 mm CHAPS, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA (buffer A). The mixture was stirred gently at 4 °C for 1 h and was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 0.2 nmol of (dA)30-5′-S-EMC-MKBK for 1 h at 4 °C, 30 mg of oligo(dT)-cellulose was added, and the suspension was agitated gently at 4 °C for 2 h. The oligo(dT)-cellulose was pelleted by centrifugation (4 °C, 1,000 × g, 5 min) and packed into a microcolumn. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A at 4 °C and afterward eluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm CHAPS, 1 mm EDTA. Fractions (50 μl each) containing B2 receptor were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis. 10 μl of each fraction from the oligo(dT)-cellulose column was mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer containing 6% SDS, 10% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.25 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, and brought to 95 °C for 2 min. Electrophoresis was performed in 10 or 12.5% polyacrylamide gels in the presence of 0.1% SDS at a constant current of 40 mA for 1.5 h (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. After visualization, the gel was destained with a solution of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 50% acetonitrile. The band corresponding to the B2 receptor was cut out and digested in the gel according to (16Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Gonez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar) as modified previously (12Roos M. Soskic V. Poznanovic S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 924-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For MALDI mass spectrometry, samples were dissolved in 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and sonicated for few minutes. Aliquots of 0.5 μl were applied to a target disk and allowed to air dry. Subsequently, 0.3 μl of matrix solution (1% w/v α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% v/v trifluoroacetic acid) was applied to the dried sample and again allowed to dry. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker Biflex MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. MS/MS analysis was carried out using a Finnigan MAT (San Jose, CA) LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer coupled on-line with a HPLC system (Hewlett Packard 1090). For the interpretation of MS and MS/MS spectra of protein digests we used the Sherpa software (17Taylor J.A. Walsh K. Johnson R.S. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 10: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the MS-Fit, MS-Tag, and MS-Product programs available at the UCSF web site (http://rafael.ucsf.edu/cgi-bin/msfit), the PepSearch programs at the EMBL web site (http://www.mann.embl-heidelberg.de/Services/PeptideSearch/FR_peptideSearchForm.html), and the PepFrag program at the Rockefeller University web site (http://prowl.rockefeller.edu/). Rat bradykinin B2 receptor was isolated from CHO cells using a “fishhook” strategy similar to that recently applied successfully for isolation of another peptide receptor, endothelin B receptor (12Roos M. Soskic V. Poznanovic S. Godovac-Zimmermann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 924-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The fishhook consists of the receptor ligand (here MLBK) and a (dA)30 polynucleotide joined via the heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent EMCS which, in addition to a N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated ester, also possesses a thiol-selective maleimido group. This linker was attached to MKBK via the ε-amino group of Lys2, and the thiol-selective maleimido group was used to attach (dA)30. The final product, (dA)30-5′-S-EMC-MKBK, was subsequently added to a suspension of CHO cell membranes solubilized in the non-ionic detergent CHAPS. B2 receptors bound to (dA)30-5′-S-EMC-MKBK were purified in a manner similar to that used for the isolation of eukaryotic mRNA: absorption on oligo(dT)-cellulose, washing in the presence of high salt concentrations, which favor the formation of a poly(dA·dT) double helix, and elution with very low salt concentrations that destabilize a poly(dA·dT) double helix. Recombinant B2 receptor is highly expressed in the transfected CHO cells used for the present experiments (1.3 pmol/mg of protein (13Quitterer U. Schröder C. Müller-Esterl W. Rehm H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1992-1999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar)) and shows a strong band at about 42 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of total membrane proteins (lane 1, Fig.1). This band is strongly enriched relative to other membrane proteins by the fishhook purification strategy (lane 2, Fig. 1). Subsequent analysis of this band (Fig. 1, lane 2) revealed that it contains highly pure B2 receptor suitable for detailed analysis by mass spectrometry. By comparison with intensities from the unpurified extract of membrane proteins, we estimate that about 70% of cellular B2 receptor was recovered after fishhook purification. Bands corresponding to Coomassie Blue-stained bradykinin B2 receptor were cut out from the SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion. MALDI mass spectrometry was used for the initial analysis of the entire mixture of tryptic peptides. From the MALDI spectra it was possible to identify peptides from the extracellular domains ED3 as well as peptides from cytoplasmic regions ID2, ID3, and ID4. Peptides containing TM helical regions TM3–TM5 joined to the corresponding loop region(s) could also be observed (Fig. 2 and TableI). In the present studies we did not observe peptides from domains ED1, TM1, ID1, TM2, and ED2 (Fig. 2) presumably because this region of the B2 receptor has only two internal sites for tryptic hydrolysis at positions 10 and 91 and therefore would be expected to yield large, hydrophobic peptides except for the extreme amino-terminal peptide of 10 residues.Table IMALDI mass spectrometry analysis of B2 receptor tryptic peptidesPeptideaPeptides corresponding to putative tryptic hydrolysis at Lys or Arg residues were numbered consecutively from the NH2terminus of the bradykinin B2 receptor (4, 30).

Open table in a new tab The MALDI mass measurements gave clear indications of which peptides were post-translationally modified (Table I). We observed phosphorylation for peptides 6–7, 26–31, 28–31, and 32–33. Peptides 6–7, 26–31, and 28–31 showed an increased mass of 80 Da, which is characteristic for peptides with single phosphorylation sites. For peptide 32–33, a mass consistent with a diphosphorylated peptide was observed. For peptide 30–31, palmitoylation was suggested by an increase in mass of 238 Da. The identity of the peptides was confirmed by electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry of the unseparated peptide mixture with subsequent MS/MS analysis of selected fragments of interest. It is known that in electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry the phosphorylated peptides partially lose the H3PO4 moiety in the mass spectrometer, thus producing a pair of peaks separated by a mass difference of 98 Da (18Szczepanowska J. Zhang X. Herring C.J. Qin J. Korn E.D. Brzeska H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8503-8508Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, we observed that phosphopeptides 6–7, 26–31, and 28–31 could be identified by a pair of masses 80 Da higher (the mass of H3PO4 minus H2O) and 18 Da lower than expected based on the amino acid sequence. For the peptide 32–33 the loss of two H3PO4 moieties confirmed the presence of two phosphorylation sites. We conclude that intracellular domains ID2 and ID4 of the rat B2 receptor are modified by phosphorylation (ID2, ID4) and palmitoylation (ID4). For the peptide 26–31, a m/z of 1992.2 Da was observed in the MALDI-TOF spectra. There were two pairs of peaks separated by 98 Da (m/z 1992.2 and 1895.8 Da). In addition the MS/MS ESI spectrum of peptide 26–31 (Fig.3 A) showed a y ion series, y15, y14, y13, y12,y9, y8, y7, and a b ion series, b15, b14, b13, b12,b11, b9, b8, and b7, which was sufficient to identify Tyr352 and not Ser348 in the amino acid sequence344FRKKSREVY(Pi)QAICRK358 as the site of phosphorylation. The presence of the w11 ion confirmed that Ser348 is not phosphorylated. For peptide 6–7 an increase of 80 Da was observed, suggesting that the peptide161YLALVKTMSMGR171 is phosphorylated at Tyr161 or Ser168. MS/MS analysis generatedy12 and y11 ions as well as b12,b11, b10, and b7 ions that were sufficient to determine that Tyr161 is the phosphorylation attachment site. For the peptide 32–33,359GGCMGESVQMENSMGTLRTSISVDR383, the MALDI-TOF mass spectra gave a parent ion with an m/z of 2806.4 corresponding to this peptide with two phosphate groups attached. No ions corresponding to this peptide with more or fewer than two phosphate groups could be detected. Given that this peptide has six potential phosphorylation sites, Ser at positions 365, 371, 378, and 380 and Thr at 374 and 377, this was a first indication that phosphorylation of this peptide does not involve uncoordinated phosphorylation of these sites. Further evidence for correlation among the sites that are phosphorylated in this peptide has been obtained from ion trap ESI mass spectra after fragmentation of this peptide (Fig. 3 B). Initial inspection of the MS/MS spectra clearly indicated a very complicated phosphorylation pattern for this peptide. From the y 2+ and b 2+series of fragments, clear evidence of concurrent phosphorylation at Ser365 and Ser371 was obtained from the fragments y 2+12 andb 2+14-pp (Fig.4 A, note that one or two attached phosphate groups are indicated by -p or -pp in the following text and in Fig. 4). Other fragments that would be consistent with this phosphorylation pattern include y 2+18-p,y 2+16-p, and y 2+5 as well as b 2+19-pp, b 2+17-pp, and b 2+12-p. Similarly, the fragmenty 2+6-pp-98, which corresponds to the peptidey 2+6-pp with the loss of two phosphate groups, gives clear evidence for concurrent phosphorylation at Ser378 and Ser380. Other fragments that would be consistent with concurrent phosphorylation of these two serines include y 2+18-pp,y 2+14-pp, y 2+12-pp, andy 2+4-p as well asb 2+21-p. (Fig. 4). There are three fragments,y 2+7-p, y 2+6-p, andb 2+18-p which cannot be consistent with the the above two types of diphosphorylation and which require phosphorylation at one of Ser365, Ser371, or Thr374as well as at one of Thr377, Ser378, or Ser380. Evidence for concurrent phosphorylation at Thr374 and Ser380 was obtained by MS3 analysis of the y series fragmenty 2+12-pp (Figs. 3 B, inset, and 4 B). The three concurrent phosphorylation patterns shown in Fig.4 C suffice to explain all observed fragments. Evidence that other patterns of diphosphorylation probably do not exist was obtained by MS3 analysis of fragmentsy 2+16-p, which indicated that when Ser365 is phosphorylated, the only concurrent phosphorylation site is Ser371, and of y7-pm which indicated that Thr377 is probably never phosphorylated, at least under the conditions to which the CHO cells were subjected in the present experiments. Given that diphosphorylation of the five sites Ser365, Ser371, Ser378, Ser380, and Thr374 could occur in 10 different combinations, the present evidence that only three of these combinations occur is strong evidence for coordinated diphosphorylation. We confirmed these results with many more NH2-terminal (b 2+H2O,b 2+NH3,b 2+H3PO4), COOH-terminal (y 2+H2O,y 2+NH3,y 2+H3PO4), and internal fragment ions, which for clarity have been omitted from further discussion here, but were of considerable help during the course of spectra analysis. The increase of 238 Da in the mass of peptide 30–31 indicated the presence of a palmitate residue (Table I). The MS/MS analysis generatedy92+, y82+,y72+, y62+,y52+, y42+,y32+, and b42+,b52+, b62+,b72+, b82+,b92+ ions showing that Cys356 in peptide 350EVYQAICRK358 is palmitoylated (Fig.3 C). MS/MS analysis of this peptide showed no phosphorylation at Tyr352 (Fig. 3 C). Conversely, MS/MS analysis of peptide344FRKKSREVY(Pi)QAICRK358demonstrated phosphorylation at residue Tyr352 but not palmitoylation at Cys356 (Fig. 3 A). This result was confirmed by MS/MS analysis of peptide347KSREVY(Pi)QAICRK358 (not shown). In the MALDI mass spectra we were able to find masses corresponding to peptides 25–31, 26–33, and 28–32 (Table I) with no phosphorylation at Tyr352 or palmitoylation at Cys356, but no masses were detected which correspond to peptides with simultaneous phosphorylation and palmitoylation of Tyr352 and Cys356, respectively. Together these results indicate a mutually exclusive palmitoylation at Cys356 or phosphorylation at Tyr352 of intracelluar domain ID4 of the rat B2 receptor. Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation are a widespread mechanism thought to regulate the desensitization, internalization, and resensitization of G protein-coupled receptors. For two prototypic receptors, i.e. rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptor, the phosphorylation sites have been studied in some detail (9Prado G.N. Taylor L. Polger P. J. Biol.

Several strains of Lactococcus lactis secrete antibacterial peptides or proteins with antagonistic activities, the so-called bacteriocins (1Tagg J.R. Dajani A.S. Wannamaker L.W. Bacteriol.

LcnD is an accessory protein with similarities to other proteins known or believed to be involved in the secretion of various (poly)peptides. They always operate in conjunction with a protein from the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are:ABC, ATP-binding cassette; TMS, transmembrane segment; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PAA, polyacrylamide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tricine, N-[2- hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.transporters. The accessory proteins of Gram-negative bacteria are proposed to form a family of so-called membrane fusion proteins (11Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that they connect the inner and the outer membranes to facilitate the passage of substrates. CvaA, a member of the membrane fusion protein family, involved in the secretion of colicin V, has been shown to interact with both a cytoplasmic membrane protein (the ABC transporter) and a protein present in the outer membrane (12Hwang J.W. Zhong X. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6264-6270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The function of these accessory proteins in Gram-positive bacteria is unknown. LcnC, a protein of 715 amino acids, belongs to the family of ABC transporter proteins present in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and involved in the import or export of a large variety of substrates such as antibiotics, sugars, amino acids, peptides, and proteins. A typical ABC transporter protein consists of a hydrophobic integral membrane domain and two ATP binding domains. These domains can be either encoded as separate polypeptides or fused into multidomain proteins. The hydrophobic integral membrane domain of the majority of ABC transporter proteins is predicted to consist of two times six transmembrane segments (TMSs) (13Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3386) Google Scholar). In a number of cases, this topology has been experimentally confirmed (14Pearce S.R. Mimmack M.L. Gallagher M.P. Gileadi U.

LcnC contains only one ATP binding domain in its C terminus, whereas the integral membrane domain is, by computer analysis, predicted to consist of four to six TMSs (see below). LcnC contains an N-terminal domain of approximately 160 amino acids, which shows homology to other ABC transporter proteins involved in the secretion of bacteriocins, and is not present in most other ABC transporter proteins. The N-terminal parts of the ABC transporter proteins involved in the secretion of the bacteriocins pediocin PA-1 and lactococcin G have been shown to process the precursors of the respective bacteriocins into their mature forms. For lactococcin G, this has been shown in in vitro experiments (3Håvarstein L.S. Diep D.B. Nes I.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), whereas for pediocin PA-1 this has been established in vivo in the heterologous host E. coli (18Venema K. Kok J. Marugg J.D. Toonen M.Y. Ledeboer A.M. Venema G. Chikindas M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this paper we show that the N-terminal part of LcnC is involved in the processing of the precursor of LcnA. To examine at which side of the cytoplasmic membrane this processing takes place, we determined the membrane topology of LcnC by making translational fusions of N-terminal parts of LcnC with a modified alkaline phosphatase (PhoA*) 2C. M. Franke, J. Tiemersma, G. Venema, and J. Kok, submitted for publication. lacking its own signal sequence and β-galactosidase (LacZ). The results indicate that four membrane helices of LcnC span the cytoplasmic membrane and that both the N- and C termini are cytoplasmic. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI. L. lactis was grown at 30 °C in 2-fold diluted M17 broth (19Terzaghi B.E. Sandine W.E. Appl. Microbiol. 1975; 29: 807-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (G1/2M17). For L. lactis, chloramphenicol was used at a final concentration of 4 μg/ml. E. coli was grown in TY broth (see Ref. 20Rottlander E. Trautner T.A. Mol. Gen.

Chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and erythromycin were used at final concentrations of 10, 100, and 100 μg/ml for E. coli, respectively. The chromogenic substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate were used at final concentrations of 5 μg/ml.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids used in this studyBacterial strain or plasmidRelevant properties/genotypeSource or Ref.BacteriaL. lactis subsp.cremorisMG1363Plasmid free50Gasson M.J.

DNA techniques were performed essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Enzymes were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany) and were used according to the instructions of the supplier. DNA was isolated as described before (22Birnboim H.C. Doley J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9908) Google Scholar) or with the plasmid miniprep isolation kit of Boehringer Mannheim. Electrotransformation of L. lactis was performed as described earlier (23Holo H. Nes I.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 55: 3119-3123Crossref Google Scholar) with modifications according to Venema et al. (24Venema K. Haverkort R.E. Abee T. Haandrikman A.J. Leenhouts K.J. de Leij L. Venema G. Kok J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 6127-6145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). Nucleotide sequences were determined using a Vistra DNA Labstation 625 in combination with a Vistra DNA sequencer 725 (Amersham International, Little Chalfont, UK). To overexpress (pre)LcnA inL. lactis under control of the nisApromoter, RcaI and HindIII restriction enzyme sites were introduced upstream of lcnA and downstream oflciA, respectively, by PCR on the template pKV4 (26Venema K. Dost M.H.R. Beun P.A.H. Haandrikman A.J. Venema G. Kok J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1689-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the primers CMF60III (5′-AATTCGAATTCTCATGAAAAATCAATTAAATTTTAATATTG-3′) and CMF61 (5′-TCTAGATCTAGAAAGCTTAGAATAGTCGTCCCCACGACATAAT-3′). The PCR product was digested with RcaI and HindIII and cloned in pNZ8048 restricted with NcoI andHindIII, resulting in plasmid pNA0. Vector pC164 was constructed to express the first 164 amino acids of LcnC. To this end, pPC164 was digested with BglII andAsp718. After filling-in of the sticky ends, the plasmid was self-ligated, giving rise to pIC164. Subsequently, theAvaII/Eco47-3 fragment of the latter plasmid was transferred to pIL253, resulting in pC164. To express lcnD under control of the lactococcal P32 promoter, the SacI/HindIII fragment of pUClcnD was cloned in pMG36E, resulting in pMGlcnD. TheEcoRI/HindIII fragment of pMGlcnD was transferred to pUC19 to obtain pP32LcnD. Based on the working model presented in Fig. 1 A, primers were designed to introduce BglII restriction enzyme sites in lcnCat various positions flanking the sequences encoding the putative transmembrane segments (TMS). PCRs were performed on pLC as a template, using the various mutagenic primers in combination with primer MvdG1. The sequences of the primers were (BglII sites are indicated in bold) as follows: MvdG1, 5′-CCT CGG GAT ATG ATA AG-3′; JT164, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT TGA CGG GTG ATA ATT GGG-3′; JT194, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT CTG TCA ATC ATG CTC TGG AGG-3′; JT222, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT AAG ACC TGT TGG ATA-3′; JT225, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT GCA AAT TCT AAG ACC TGT TGG -3′; JT246, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT ATA TAA GAA AGA ATG ACA TC-3′; JT266, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT GTA ATT TCT CCT GTT CTT CGG-3′; JT277, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT AAA ATA GAA CTC GCA TCG G-3′; JT303, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT TTT TGA AGG CCT AAA ATT AG-3′; J T327, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT GGC GTA AAA ATA ATA ATA AC-3′; JT355, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT TCA ATC CCA TTG ATA TCT TC-3′; JT375, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT GCA AAT TCG TAG TCA ATT TTT TG-3′; JT391, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT TGA ATA GCT TCT GAT TTT TG-3′; JT435, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT GTA AAG TAA GAA AGC AGG GC-3′; JT478, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT TGT GAG AGG GAC AGT TC-3′; JT584, 5′-AGA TCT AGA TCT GCA TTC TCA TTA GCT CCT AG-3′. After digestion with EcoRI and BglII, the PCR fragments were cloned into either pFUSLC or pFUSPC and verified at the nucleotide sequence level. Alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described earlier (see Refs.27Manoil C. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar and 28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar, respectively). Independent cultures were started from three single colonies of each construct. Plasmid stability was checked by plating dilutions of the cultures on plates containing the proper chromogenic substrate prior to the activity measurements. Enzyme assays were performed in triplicate on 2 ml of exponential cultures ofE. coli and L. lactis. All samples used for the enzymatic assays were also subjected to analysis by Western hybridizations. After harvesting and washing, the cells were resuspended in the appropriate buffer for either alkaline phosphatase or β-galactosidase activity assays. Parts of the same samples were prepared for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) by diluting aliquots of the suspensions 1:1 in 2× sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 2.5% SDS and subsequent boiling for 10 min. SDS-PAGE and Tricine/SDS-PAGE were carried out as described earlier (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar, 30Schägger H. Jagow V.G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). Fusion protein samples were run on SDS-5 or 10% PAA gels, whereas samples containing (pre)LcnA were run on either SDS-15% PAA gels or Tricine/SDS-16% PAA gels. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) according to standard protocols (31Kyhse-Anderson J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). LacZ and PhoA* fusion proteins were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega, Madison, WI). Polyclonal antibodies against LacZ and PhoA were obtained from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Promega) were used as secondary antibodies. Induction of genes under control of the nisA promoter were carried out inL. lactis NZ9000 containing either pIL253 or pC164. Overnight cultures were diluted 100-fold into fresh medium and grown until an A 600 between 0.4 and 0.5. Subsequently, the cultures were split in half, and one of these was induced with nisin at a final concentration of 0.5 ng/ml. Both cultures were grown for another 2 h. Purified nisin A was kindly provided by Dr. Oscar Kuipers (NIZO, Ede, The Netherlands). L. lactis cells were disrupted by sonication using the Soniprep 150 (MSE, Crawley, UK) at 8 μm (eight cycles of 15 s with 45-s intervals, all on ice), boiled in 2× sample buffer, and run on Tricine/SDS-16% PAA gels. Gels were overlayered with the indicator strain L. lactis IL1403 (18Venema K. Kok J. Marugg J.D. Toonen M.Y. Ledeboer A.M. Venema G. Chikindas M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To obtain a working model for the membrane topology of LcnC, four different computer programs were used that predict the topology of membrane proteins. Due to the various algorithms used by these programs (SOAP (32Klein P. Kanehisa M. DeLisi C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 815: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 33Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), Rao and Argos (34Rao M.J.K. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), Helixmem (35Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Microbiol. 1984; 179: 125-142Google Scholar), and TopPred (36Sipos L. Von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 37Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 252: 487-494Crossref Scopus (1404) Google Scholar)) all four programs arrived at a different topological model for LcnC. The model obtained with SOAP, contains six transmembrane segments (TMSs) and is shown in Fig. 1 A. TopPred predicts five of the six TMSs indicated by SOAP (namely I, II, IV, V, and VI), whereas both Rao and Argos (I, II, IV, and V) and Helixmem (II, IV, V, and VI) only predict four. The contradictory results obtained with the various computer programs warranted the analysis of the membrane topology of LcnC by protein fusion studies. N-terminal fusions of LcnC were made with the reporter proteins alkaline phosphatase (PhoA*) and β-galactosidase (LacZ) using the pFUSP/LC plasmid system that we have previously described.2 The alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase activities of exponentially growing cultures of E. coli andL. lactis carrying the constructed plasmids are presented in Table II. Fig. 1 A gives an overview of the positions in LcnC to which PhoA* or LacZ were fused.Table IIAlkaline phosphatase (PhoA*) and β-galactosidase (LacZ) activities in exponentially growing E. coli and L. lactis cells expressing protein chimeras specified by the indicated plasmidsPlasmidbExcept for pFUSP32 and pMG36C, the numbers in the names of the plasmids correspond to the codons of lcnC to which either ′lacZ or ′phoA* was fused.PhoA* activitiesaActivity units were calculated as [A 420 − (1.75 × A 550) × 1000]/[time (min) × A 600 × volume of culture assayed (ml)].

Open table in a new tab From the data obtained in E. coli (Table II), it is clear that at least the N-terminal 164 amino acids of LcnC reside in the cytoplasm; the alkaline phosphatase activity of the fusion protein in which these amino acids are fused to PhoA* (PC164) is low, indicating an intracellular location of the PhoA* moiety. The alkaline phosphatase activity of PC194 is high, indicating that the PhoA* moiety in this chimera is in the periplasm. This strongly suggests the presence of a TMS (TMS I) between the amino acids at positions 164 and 194. The chimeras PC222, PC225, PC246, PC266, and PC277 all have low alkaline phosphatase activities in E. coli, indicating that in all these chimeras the PhoA* moiety is intracellular. In accordance with all computer programs tested, these results suggest that TMS II is present and traverses the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas TMS III, only predicted by SOAP, does not exist. The alkaline phosphatase activity of PC303 is high compared with PC277, indicating that TMS IV is present. The same applies to the fusions PC327, PC355, PC375, and PC390, which argues against the existence of TMS V. As the alkaline phosphatase activities of PC478 and PC584 are low, the C-terminal part of LcnC is located intracellularly. This must be facilitated by the presence of TMS VI. However, the high alkaline phosphatase activity of PC435 would argue against the existence of TMS VI. To examine the expression of the LcnC-PhoA* chimeras, all samples used for the activity assays were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western hybridizations (Fig. 2, A andB). As for all chimeras, bands of the expected sizes were detected, lack of activity of certain chimeras cannot be explained by lack of expression of that fusion protein (e.g. compare the alkaline phosphatase activities and expression levels of PC194 and PC222 in Table II and Fig. 2 A, respectively). However, the amount of full-sized fusion protein generally decreased as the size of the chimera increased. Several LcnC-PhoA* chimeras were expressed in L. lactis, and their alkaline phosphatase activities were determined. The results, presented in Table II, are in accordance with those obtained inE. coli taking into consideration that, as we have shown previously, alkaline phosphatase activity is high when the PhoA* moiety is in the cytoplasm of L. lactis, whereas it is low when PhoA* is extracellularly located.2 Western analysis showed that the amount of fusion proteins in L. lactis with low alkaline phosphatase activity, indicative of an extracellular location of the PhoA* moiety, was much lower than the amount of a chimera with high enzymatic activity (data not shown). This is in accordance with similar topology studies of LcnD (38Franke C.M. Leenhouts K.J. Haandrikman A.J. Kok J. Venema G. Venema K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1766-1769Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the results obtained with the LcnC-PhoA* fusions indicate that both the N- and C-terminal parts of LcnC are located in the cytoplasm and that four TMSs (I, II, IV, and VI) span the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 1 B). Genetic instability was observed during construction and maintenance of several of the lcnC::lacZ plasmids. Although all cultures were started from a single blue (LacZ+) colony, several of these cultures appeared to consist of mixtures of LacZ+ and LacZ− cells. Cultures in which this mixed phenotype was observed were discarded. The enzymatic activities in cultures of cells expressing the various LcnC-LacZ fusions are shown in Table II. The location of both the N- and C-terminal domains of LcnC in the cytoplasm of E. coliwas confirmed by the observation that β-galactosidase activities of the chimeras LC164, LC478, and LC584 were high. The β-galactosidase activity of LC194 was much less than that of LC164, which is in accordance with the presence of TMS I. However, the β-galactosidase activities of those chimeras located in loops 2 and 3 were rather low, whereas on the basis of the PhoA* fusions, the LacZ moiety was expected to reside in the cytoplasm. The β-galactosidase activities of LC222 and LC225 were only slightly higher than that of LC194. The activities of the chimeras in which LacZ had been fused to amino acids of loop 3 in LcnC showed considerable differences; fusions LC246 and LC277 suggest an extracellular location of loop 3, whereas LC266 would rather favor a cytosolic location of loop 3. The low β-galactosidase activity of LC303 indicated that loop 4 is exposed to the periplasm, whereas the high activities of LC355, LC375, and LC390 are indicative for a cytosolic location of loop 5. The low activity of LC327 may be due to the absence of the positive charge of amino acid 331 in the chimera, which may be important for a proper membrane location of loop 5. A similar explanation may apply to the low β-galactosidase activity of LC435, as six positive charges immediately downstream of the fusion point are missing in this chimera. The differences in the β-galactosidase activities of various LcnC-LacZ chimeras were more pronounced in L. lactis (TableII). The activities of LC164, LC435, LC478, and LC584 clearly indicate that the N- and C-terminal domains of LcnC are located intracellularly. Loops 1 and 4 must be exposed at the extracellular side of the cytoplasmic membrane as the β-galactosidase activities of LC194 and LC303 were very low. In contrast, loops 2, 3 and 5 seem to be cytoplasmic, as judged from the high β-galactosidase activities of LC225, LC277, and LC355. The expression levels of all LcnC-LacZ chimeras were examined by Western hybridizations (data not shown). Bands of the expected sizes were detected for all chimeras, whereas the amounts of full-sized fusion proteins varied between the LcnC-LacZ chimeras, and proteolytic breakdown was more severe than for the full-sized LcnC-PhoA* chimeras. In conclusion, the results of the LcnC-LacZ fusions indicate that both the N- and C-terminal part of LcnC are located in the cytoplasm and that four TMSs span the cytoplasmic membrane. Although the data of the LcnC-PhoA* fusions suggest the presence of TMSs I, II, IV, and VI (Fig.1 B), the results obtained with the LcnC-LacZ chimeras favor the presence in the cytoplasmic membrane of the TMSs I, II, IV, and V (Fig. 1 C). To examine whether the membrane topology of LcnC was influenced by the presence of its accessory protein LcnD"
https://openalex.org/W2090616009,"Chimeras were generated between the human anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a receptors (C3aR and C5aR, respectively) to define the structural requirements for ligand binding and discrimination. Chimeric receptors were generated by systematically exchanging between the two receptors four receptor modules (the N terminus, transmembrane regions 1 to 4, the second extracellular loop, and transmembrane region 5 to the C terminus). The mutants were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells (with or without Gα-16) and analyzed for cell surface expression, binding of C3a and C5a, and functional responsiveness (calcium mobilization) toward C3a, C5a, and a C3a as well as a C5a analogue peptide. The data indicate that in both anaphylatoxin receptors the transmembrane regions and the second extracellular loop act as a functional unit that is disrupted by any reciprocal exchange. N-terminal substitution confirmed the two-binding site model for the human C5aR, in which the receptor N terminus is required for high affinity binding of the native ligand but not a C5a analogue peptide. In contrast, the human C3a receptor did not require the original N terminus for high affinity binding of and activation by C3a, a result that was confirmed by N-terminal deletion mutants. This indicates a completely different binding mode of the anaphylatoxins to their corresponding receptors. The C5a analogue peptide, but not C5a, was an agonist of the C3aR. Replacement of the C3aR N terminus by the C5aR sequence, however, lead to the generation of a true hybrid C3a/C5a receptor, which bound and functionally responded to both ligands, C3a and C5a. Chimeras were generated between the human anaphylatoxin C3a and C5a receptors (C3aR and C5aR, respectively) to define the structural requirements for ligand binding and discrimination. Chimeric receptors were generated by systematically exchanging between the two receptors four receptor modules (the N terminus, transmembrane regions 1 to 4, the second extracellular loop, and transmembrane region 5 to the C terminus). The mutants were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells (with or without Gα-16) and analyzed for cell surface expression, binding of C3a and C5a, and functional responsiveness (calcium mobilization) toward C3a, C5a, and a C3a as well as a C5a analogue peptide. The data indicate that in both anaphylatoxin receptors the transmembrane regions and the second extracellular loop act as a functional unit that is disrupted by any reciprocal exchange. N-terminal substitution confirmed the two-binding site model for the human C5aR, in which the receptor N terminus is required for high affinity binding of the native ligand but not a C5a analogue peptide. In contrast, the human C3a receptor did not require the original N terminus for high affinity binding of and activation by C3a, a result that was confirmed by N-terminal deletion mutants. This indicates a completely different binding mode of the anaphylatoxins to their corresponding receptors. The C5a analogue peptide, but not C5a, was an agonist of the C3aR. Replacement of the C3aR N terminus by the C5aR sequence, however, lead to the generation of a true hybrid C3a/C5a receptor, which bound and functionally responded to both ligands, C3a and C5a. Activation of the complement cascade leads to the generation of the 74–77-amino acid anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a. Acting as potent signaling molecules, C3a and C5a exhibit a broad spectrum of proinflammatory effects on different organs and cell types, which include smooth muscle contraction, increase in vascular permeability, chemotaxis, cell activation, and granule secretion. Despite a high overall similarity in their structure and functional effects, C3a and C5a exhibit qualitative and quantitative differences in their ability to elicit the above-mentioned reactions, suggesting distinct roles of each anaphylatoxin in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory reactions. Increased serum levels of C3a and C5a have been reported in a number of disease states, like the adult respiratory distress syndrome, chronic polyarthritis, and psoriasis, suggesting an important role of the anaphylatoxins in the pathophysiology of these and other inflammatory diseases (for review see Refs. 1Köhl J.

Volanakis J. Frank M. The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 241-284Crossref Google Scholar). A more detailed knowledge about the mode of action of the anaphylatoxins on their target cells might suggest novel and valuable therapeutic approaches for the treatment of many of these disease states. C3a and C5a have similar solution structures consisting of a globular core composed of four tightly folded α-helices and a C-terminal “finger” (3Huber R. Scholze H. Paques E.P. Deisenhofer J.

They act on their target cells by binding to and activating highly ligand-specific membrane receptors belonging to the family of seven transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptors. The human C5a receptor (C5aR) 1The abbreviations used are:C5aR, C5a receptor; C3aR, C3a receptor; Ch, receptor chimera; EL, extracellular loop; TM, transmembrane region; UTR, untranslated region; fMLP, formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; wt, wild type. was cloned in 1991 (6Boulay F.

A highly characteristic and unique feature of the C3a receptor (C3aR) is the unusually large second extracellular loop (EL2) of ∼175 residues with as yet unknown function. Several mutagenesis experiments, including chimeras with the fMLP receptor, N-terminal deletion mutants, and site-directed mutagenesis of individual residues have revealed a two-point binding model for the C5aR (10Pease J.E.

According to this model, a first binding site is located in the C5aR N terminus that binds core residues of the C5a ligand. This interaction provides about half of the overall binding energy and facilitates the interaction of the C terminus of the ligand with the second binding site, which encompasses several residues scattered among the extracellular loops and TM helices. Two of these, Glu199 in EL2 and Arg206 in TM5, have already been identified (15DeMartino J.A. Konteatis Z.D. Siciliano S.J. Van Riper G. Underwood D.J. Fischer P.A. Springer M.S. J. Biol.

This model is confirmed by studies using synthetic peptides mimicking the C5a C terminus, which are able to bind to the C5aR and to induce signal transduction, although with much lower affinity and potency than the wild type ligand. As might be expected, the activity of such peptides is not affected by mutations in the C5aR N terminus, in contrast to what is observed with native C5a (12DeMartino J.A. Van Riper G. Siciliano S.J.

The sites of interaction between C3a and the C3aR are not known. Like C5a, synthetic C3a analogue peptides of the C terminus are full receptor agonists, although most of these investigations have been performed in the heterologous guinea pig system. As the peptide length is extended toward the C3a N terminus, the activity of the peptides gradually increases. A sequence-optimized 21-mer “superagonist” peptide (17Ember J.A. Johansen N.L. Hugli T.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3603-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) has been identified that exhibits ∼10% of the activity of wild type C3a versus the cloned human C3aR (18Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. Foley J.J. Hugli T.E. Sarau H.M. Immunopharmacology. 1997; 38: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These data would also indicate a two-point binding site in the C3aR, where the C terminus of the ligand is bound by the effector site, whereas the overall affinity is increased by additional interactions. However, no mutagenesis experiments of the C3aR have been reported yet. Receptor chimeras between the C5aR and the fMLP receptor have been generated and found to be expressed on the cell surface allowing for the delineation of sites involved in fMLP binding (19Perez H.D. Holmes R. Vilander L.R. Adams R.R. Manzana W. Jolley D. Andrews W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2292-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the human C3aR also has high homology to the C5aR, we used an analogous approach to identify sequence modules in the anaphylatoxin receptors that are involved in ligand binding. Using a panel of 19 receptor mutants, we show that the binding behavior of C3a to the C3aR differs from the C5a-C5aR interaction, culminating in the generation of a true hybrid C3a/C5a receptor. Human C3a was obtained from Advanced Research Technologies (San Diego, CA), human C5a was from Sigma,125I-labeled C3a and C5a were from NEN Life Science Products, and the synthetic peptides H-1264 and H-8135 were from Bachem (King of Prussia, PA). The monoclonal mouse IgG1 anti-C3aR antibody 8H1 was generated in our laboratory, 2B. Sohns, J. Westermann, R. Frank, M. Grove, J. Köhl, A. Klos, and W. Bautsch, manuscript in preparation. the monoclonal mouse IgG1 anti-C5aR antibody W17/1 (20Werfel T. Zwirner J. Oppermann M. Sieber A. Begemann G. Drommer W. Kapp A. Gotze O. J.

Götze, Göttingen, Germany, the anti-FLAG M2 and M5 antibodies were obtained from Scientific Imaging Systems (Rochester, NY), and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody from Becton-Dickinson (San Jose, CA). The following buffers and stock solutions were used: phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 2.7 mmKCl, adjusted with NaCl to a final conductivity of 15 millisiemens), HAG-CM (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25% w/v bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm glucose), and KRH (118 mm NaCl, 4.6 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KH2PO4, 11 mmglucose, 1.1 mm MgCl2). The C5aR coding sequence with an additional FLAG epitope sequence and an EcoRI site at the 5′ end (21Raffetseder U. Röper D. Mery L. Gietz C. Klos A. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Boulay F. Köhl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) plus a newSalI site at position 708 was used for mutagenesis of the C5a receptor sequence. Conservative mutations (which did not alter the amino acid code) that created novel restriction sites (BsrGI at position 519 = Tyr174 at the junction of TM4 and EL2, and BssHII at position 597 = Ala201 at the junction EL2 and TM5) were introduced using the QuickChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The same 5′-UTR plus FLAG epitope sequence was added to the C3aR by subcloning after introduction of a novel MfeI site at position +4 of the C3aR cDNA (9Crass T. Raffetseder U. Martin U. Grove M. Klos A. Köhl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Similarly, novel restriction sites (BsrGI at position 476 = Tyr160 at the junction of TM4 and EL2, andNruI at position 1003 = Ala335 at the junction of EL2 and TM5) were introduced into the C3aR coding sequence. These changes to the C3aR did not alter the K d for C3a. 3T. Crass, R. S. Ames, H. M. Sarau, M. A. Tornetta, J. J. Foley, J. Köhl, A. Klos, and W. Bautsch, unpublished observations. The receptor N termini (defined as codons 1–23 in the C3aR and codons 1–37 in the C5aR) were exchanged by fusion PCR, as described previously (21Raffetseder U. Röper D. Mery L. Gietz C. Klos A. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Boulay F. Köhl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The other chimeras were generated by subcloning via the BsrGI site and the NruI/BssHII sites after suitable blunting of the BssHII site according to standard techniques (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). N-terminal deletions of the C3aR coding sequence (9, 16, and 22 residues) were generated by standard PCR using the cDNA clone HNAFG09 (8Ames R.S. Li Y. Sarau H.M. Nuthulaganti P. Foley J.J. Ellis C.

The final panel of 16 chimeras (including the wt receptors) plus three deletion mutants in vector pcDNA3/Amp (CLONTECH) was characterized by restriction analysis and DNA sequence analysis of all PCR-amplified sequences. In all cases where no expression of the mutant receptor on the cell surface could be detected, the complete coding sequence was determined. Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were transfected using LipofectAMINE as described previously (9Crass T. Raffetseder U. Martin U. Grove M. Klos A. Köhl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 3 days later, cells were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin at 1 × 107 cells/ml. 50 μl were incubated with 50 μl of first step antibody (8H1: 10 μg/ml; W17/1: 5 μg/ml; M2: 20 μg/ml; M5: 20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 0 °C, developed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, and examined flow-cytometrically on FACScan (Becton-Dickinson) using mock-transfected cells as negative control. For immunofluorescence studies of mutants that were not expressed on the cell surface, LipofectAMINE-transfected HEK-293 cells were developed with the same set of antibodies after prior fixation and permeabilization of the cells in acetone, as described previously (21Raffetseder U. Röper D. Mery L. Gietz C. Klos A. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Boulay F. Köhl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Binding assays were performed essentially as described (9Crass T. Raffetseder U. Martin U. Grove M. Klos A. Köhl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1944-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5–3.0 × 105 transfected cells were incubated with 20,000–40,000 cpm of125I-labeled C3a and varying concentrations of unlabeled ligand at room temperature in a total volume of 50 μl of HAG-CM. After 30 min, unbound ligand was removed by vacuum filtration using the MultiScreen filtration system with a Durapore 0.45-μm membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) equilibrated with HAG-CM. The filter was washed twice with 100 μl of HAG-CM and dried, and bound radioactivity was determined by γ-counting (Cobra II Auto Gamma, Canberra Packard, Meriden, CT). Binding curves were analyzed using the software package LIGAND (23Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). HEK-293 (1.2 × 107) cells were plated into a T150 flask in Earl's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Following a 16-h incubation at 37 °C, medium was removed and replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were co-transfected with cDNA encoding each chimera, truncation mutant, or wild type receptor and a cDNA encoding Gα-16 (15 μg of each plasmid) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer′s recommendation. Following a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were replated on poly-d-lysine coated 96-well black wall microplate (Becton-Dickinson) at 30,000 cells/well. After 18–24 h the medium was aspirated off, and 100 μl of fresh Earl's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 μm Fluo-3AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR; stock solution prepared at 2 mm in Me2SO containing 20% pluronic acid), 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 μm probenecid (prepared with the addition of equal equivalents of NaOH) was added to each well and incubated in a CO2 incubator for 1 h at 37 °C. Medium was aspirated and replaced with 100 μl of the same medium but without Fluo-3AM and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with a Denley cell wash with KRH containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2.5 μm probenecid, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (buffer A), and after the last wash cells were aspirated down to final volume of 100 μL. Ligand concentration-response curves were prepared in 96-well polyproplyene microplates at three times the final concentration in buffer A and warmed to 37 °C. Microplates containing the Fluo-3AM-loaded cells and the ligand plates were placed in a fluorometric imaging plate reader where all 96 wells are monitored simultaneously (24Schroeder K.S. Neagle B.D. J. Biomol. Screening. 1996; 1: 75-80Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). At initiation of the reading fluorescence is read every 1 s for 60 s and then every 3 s for the following 60 s. Agonist (50 μl) was added at 10 s, and the maximal fluorescent count above background after the addition of agonist was used to define maximal activity for that concentration of agonist. The fluorometric imaging plate reader software normalizes fluorescent readings to give equivalent readings for all wells at zero time. The aim of this study was the identification of receptor modules in the human C3aR and C5aR that determine binding affinity, specificity (i.e. discrimination from the noncognate ligand), and signal transduction. For this purpose, chimeric C3a/C5a receptors were constructed by systematically recombining four receptor parts (the N terminus, TM1 to TM4, EL2, and TM5 to the C terminus) to generate all 16 possible receptor chimeras (including the wt receptors). To normalize receptor expression and to facilitate immunological detection of the receptors on the cell surface, the same 5′-UTR plus a sequence tag coding for an N-terminal FLAG epitope were introduced at the 5′ end of each clone, as described previously for the human C5aR (21Raffetseder U. Röper D. Mery L. Gietz C. Klos A. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Boulay F. Köhl J. Bautsch W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All receptor constructs were analyzed for (i) cell surface expression by flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the N-terminal FLAG epitope, the C5aR N terminus, and EL2 of the human C3aR, (ii) ligand binding of C3a and C5a in competitive displacement studies, and (iii) functional response (intracellular calcium mobilization) toward C3a, C5a, and a synthetic C3a and C5a analogue peptide after cotransfection of Gα-16, which had previously been shown to complement the signal transduction cascade of the anaphylatoxin receptors in these cells (9Crass T.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 132-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis revealed highly different surface expression levels among this panel of receptor chimeras, indicating determinants other than the 5′-UTR and N-terminal sequence that regulate cell surface expression. Specifically, for 7 of 14 chimeras (Ch2 to Ch7 and Ch10; TableI) reproducible and significant surface expression could not be confirmed, which was compatible with and explained the negative results obtained in the binding studies and functional analyses for these mutants. This observation was unexpected because in the case of C5aR/fMLP chimeric receptors, all of the constructs were expressed on the cell surface, despite an even slightly lower sequence homology between those two receptors (19Perez H.D. Holmes R. Vilander L.R. Adams R.R. Manzana W. Jolley D. Andrews W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2292-2295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, all mutants with negative cell surface expression were expressed intracellularly as shown by immunofluorescence studies of acetone-treated cells (data not shown), indicating a defect in correct folding and/or transport of these mutants to the cell surface.Table ICombined results of cell surface expression, C3a/C5a bindings and functional responsiveness towards C3a, C5a, and synthetic C3a/C5a analogue peptides of all receptor mutants used in this study1 Determined at least 8-fold; S.D. < 12% if not stated otherwise.2 A half-maximal release well above 10 μm is indicated by (+).3 Wild type C3aR.4 Wild type C5aR.5 Determined as cross-competition of 125I-labeled C3a with C5a.

Replacement of the C5aR N terminus by the C3aR N terminus (chimera Ch8,i.e. a C5aR with a C3aR N terminus) lead to an affinity loss in C5a binding of >2 orders of magnitude (i.e. above the sensitivity of this assay) without affecting the signal transduction properties of the C5a analogue synthetic peptide H-8315 (Table I), confirming previous data that showed the presence of a major ligand binding site within this part of the receptor, which contributes to ligand binding affinity (12DeMartino J.A.

Conversely, in the reciprocal exchange mutant (Ch9, a C3aR with a C5aR N terminus) significant C5a binding could be detected (Table I and Fig.1). The K d = 33 ± 14 nm for C5a binding of this mutant was only about 1 order of magnitude higher than the K d = 5.2 ± 2.5 nm of the wt C5aR. Because the C3aR does not bind C5a (Ch1; Table I), this provides direct evidence for a C5a interaction site within the C5aR N terminus. More important, this chimera responded functionally to C5a with an ED50 of ∼60 nm(Table I and Fig. 2). Although C5a was about 2–3 orders of magnitude less potent on this receptor mutant than on the wt C5aR, this result clearly shows that the C3aR “core structure” (i.e. TM1 to C terminus) does accept C5a as an activating stimulus. This unexpected result was confirmed by the observation that the C5a analogue peptide H-8315 had similar activity on both anaphylatoxin receptors (Ch1 = C3aR and Ch16 = C5aR) as well as on the N-terminal exchange mutants (Ch8 and Ch9; Table I). This suggests that the N terminus of the C3aR partially determines ligand specificity by preventing the binding of the noncognate C5a. Once bound, C5a could activate the C3aR at physiologically relevant concentrations. As a consequence, previous investigations analyzing the functional activity of C5a analogue peptides on human granulocytes (27Ember J.A. Sanderson S.D. Taylor S.M. Kawahara M. Hugli T.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3165-3173PubMed Google Scholar) have to be interpreted with caution because these cells harbor both anaphylatoxin receptors, both of which respond to this peptide. The C3a analogue peptide, however, appears to be more sequence-restricted because it did not activate the C5aR (see Ch8 and Ch16; Table I)Figure 2Functional response (intracellular calcium mobilization) of Ch1, Ch9, and Ch16 toward C3a (circles), C5a (squares), and the synthetic peptides H-8135 (C5a analogue; triangles) and H-1264 (C3a analogue; diamonds).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Previous investigations had implicated Glu199in the second extracellular loop of the human C5aR in ligand binding (16Monk P.N. Barker M.D. Partridge L.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16625-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, replacement of EL2 from the C3aR in chimera Ch9 by the C5aR homologue increased C5a binding affinity about 10-fold, thus restoring wild type affinity of the resulting chimera Ch11 (Table I). Unexpectedly, however, this replacement also strongly affected the signal transduction properties toward C5a and the C5a analogue peptide, which were virtually inactive on this mutant (Table I). This result, which shows a critical involvement of the second extracellular loop in signal transduction, may be explained by an indirect effect of this loop on the correct positioning of the transmembrane helix bundle, thus affecting signal transduction. Similarly, replacement of EL2 in the C5aR by the C3aR counterpart (Ch16 → Ch14; Table I) critically affects both ligand binding (C3a as well as C5a) and signal transduction despite the fact that EL2 of the C3aR does not by itself prevent C5a binding and signal transduction, as already shown above (Ch9; Table I). Again, this result is best explained by an indirect effect of EL2 of the C3aR on the correct positioning of the TM helix bundle. Thus, helix bundles and EL2 have to be regarded as a functional unit in which the size of EL2 is of critical importance. Neither elongation of the C5aR loop (compare Ch16 → Ch14; Table I) nor shortening of EL2 of the C3aR (Ch9 → Ch11; Table I) are compatible with correct functioning of the resulting receptor mutants, an important caveat for any deletional mutagenesis experiments in the C3aR loop. Furthermore, it is tempting to speculate that C3aR antagonists may be found that bind within EL2 of the C3aR, thus functionally “tethering” the helix bundle with consequences similar to those observed by exchange of the C3aR loop by its C5aR counterpart (compare Ch8 → Ch10; Table I). Our data do not exclude the hypothesis that residues within EL2 of the C3aR are involved in ligand binding, although this idea appears less likely in view of the low sequence homology in EL2 of the C3aR sequences of different species (28Lienenklaus S. Ames R.S. Tornetta M.A. Sarau H.M. Foley J.J. Crass T. Sohns B. Raffetseder U. Grove M. Hölzer A. Klos A. Köhl J. Bautsch W. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2089-2093PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, all chimeras with “mixed” C3aR/C5aR helix bundles did not show any signal transduction ability (like Ch12 and Ch14; Table I), suggesting that the transmembrane receptor modules also are not completely compatible with each other despite the fact that within the coding region these domains exhibit the highest sequence homology. Apart from the wt C3aR, only Ch9, a C3aR with a C5aR N terminus, showed significant C3a binding (Fig. 1) and signal transduction (Fig. 2) both with C3a and the C3a-like peptide H-1264. Because the same mutant Ch9 also bound C5a (Table I and Fig. 1), it is thus revealed as a true hybrid C3a/C5a receptor. This finding suggests that the C3aR N terminus determines receptor specificity, as explained above, but does not participate in C3a binding or else that the C5aR N terminus complements putative N-terminal residues involved in C3a binding despite the fact that the sequence homology between C3aR and C5aR is rather low in this receptor part. To exclude this latter possibility, however, N-terminal truncation mutants of the C3aR were generated (Δ09, Δ16, and Δ22). The Δ09 and Δ16 mutants showed only slightly decreased binding affinities and almost unaltered signal transduction properties, whereas the Δ22 deletion mutant was not properly expressed on the cell surface (Table I). These results confirm that the N terminus of the C3aR does only contribute to a minor degree or not at all to C3a binding, in sharp contrast to what is known from the C5aR (11Mery L. Boulay F. J.

The ligand binding site(s) for C3a must reside in the other receptor modules of the C3aR, although it is not possible to further delineate them using this set of mutants due to the indirect effects on receptor expression. Alternatively, mutagenesis of candidate residues is required and will be greatly facilitated by the low sequence homology (<50%) of the C3aR cloned from mouse, humans, and guinea pigs (28Lienenklaus S.

The molecular mechanism by which eIF3 exerts these functions is incompletely understood.

The p33 subunit binds both mRNA and rRNA fragments due to an RNA recognition motif near its C terminus. Deletion of the C-terminal 71 amino acid residues causes loss of RNA binding, but expression of the truncated form as the sole source of p33 nevertheless supports the slow growth of yeast.

There are five major steps involved in initiation of eukaryotic protein synthesis: dissociation of ribosomes into 40 S and 60 S subunits, binding of Met-tRNAi to the 40 S ribosomal subunit; binding of mRNA to the 40 S preinitiation complex; scanning and initiation codon recognition, and the joining of the 60 S subunit to the 40 S initiation complex (1Merrick W.C.

Biochem. 1996; 236: 747-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). The initiation phase is promoted by at least 10 soluble proteins known as eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). 1The abbreviations used are:eIFs, eukaryotic initiation factors; RRM, RNA recognition motif; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; kb, kilobase pair; ORF, open reading frame; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; RNP, ribonucleoprotein. eIF3 is the largest and most complex initiation factor, comprising 10 or more subunits in mammalian cells (3Brown-Luedi M.L. Meyer L.J. Milburn S.C. Mo-Ping Yau P. Corbett S. Hershey J.W.B. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4202-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and up to eight subunits in yeast (4Hershey J.W.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several functions have been assigned to eIF3 in the translation initiation pathway in mammalian cells (1Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar). It promotes dissociation of 80 S ribosomes into 40 S and 60 S subunits and stabilizes Met-tRNAi binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit. eIF3 also is required for mRNA binding to 40 S and 80 S ribosomes in part through its interaction with eIF4G (6Lamphear B.J. Kirchweger R. Skern T. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21975-21983Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and/or eIF4B (7Méthot N. Song M.S. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5328-5334Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Thus, eIF3 plays a central role in the initiation process. To assist in elucidating the function of eIF3, attention has been given to the corresponding factor in yeast, where genetic approaches are feasible. The yeast eIF3 complex was purified on the basis of its stimulation of methionylpuromycin synthesis dependent on formation of 80 S initiation complexes in an assay composed of mammalian components (5Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active eIF3 preparation contains eight subunits with apparent molecular masses of 16, 21, 29, 33, 39, 62, 90, and 135 kDa (5Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, further studies revealed that the 29-kDa protein is a truncated form of p39 (8Naranda T. Kainuma M. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and that the p21 protein originates by partial degradation of a 110-kDa protein. 2H.-P. Vornlocher, P. Hanachi, S. Ribeiro, and J. W. B. Hershey, manuscript in preparation. A somewhat similar preparation was isolated and purified by using its stimulation of protein synthesis in lysates prepared from aprt1-1 temperature-sensitive strain of yeast. The reported molecular masses of the subunits in this preparation of putative eIF3 are 130, 80, 75, 40, and 32 kDa (9Danaie P. Wittmer B. Altmann M. Trachsel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4288-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The following yeast genes already have been characterized as encoding subunits of eIF3: SUI1 (p16) (10Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Donahue T.F. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell.

SUI1, encoding the smallest subunit of eIF3 (p16), was first identified genetically by recessive mutations that allow utilization of a UUG triplet as a translation initiation codon (13Yoon H.J. Donahue T.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 248-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). TIF34 was cloned by obtaining a partial amino acid sequence of p39 and matching it to translated sequences in the data base (8Naranda T. Kainuma M. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or by identifying the yeast homolog of the human TRIP1 protein (eIF3-p36) (14Verlhac M.-H. Chen R.H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The gene encoding p62 was identified through mutations that constitutively derepress the expression of GCN4 in rich medium (11Garcia-Barrio M.T. Naranda T. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Cuesta R. Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B. Tamame M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1781-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The p90 (Prt1) subunit was shown to affect Met-tRNAi binding to the 40 S ribosomal subunit (15Feinberg B. McLaughlin C.S. Moldave K. J. Biol.

Genes encoding the p135 (TIF31) and p110 (TIF32) subunits have been identified,2 and a preliminary account of their cloning has been published (4Hershey J.W.B. Asano K. Naranda T. Vornlocher H.-P. Hanachi P. Merrick W.C. Biochimie (Paris). 1996; 78: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To complete the cloning of the genes coding for yeast eIF3 subunits, we focused on the p33 subunit of eIF3 encoded by TIF35 (for translationinitiation factor 3, the5th subunit). TIF35 was first cloned through a two-hybrid analysis with p39 (TIF34) as bait (14Verlhac M.-H. Chen R.H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In this report, identification of the gene product as a component of eIF3 was based in large part on the work described here. During the preparation of this manuscript, reports were made identifying p33 in eIF3 complexes prepared by affinity chromatography or immunoprecipitation (18Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.-P. Greenberg J.R. Goldfarb D.S. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 19Asano K. Phan L. Anderson J. Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18573-18585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, further characterization of p33 and its role in protein synthesis were not addressed in the reports. We describe here the cloning of TIF35, characterization of the function of p33 in protein synthesis, and analysis of its RNA recognition motif (RRM). This completes the detailed characterization of the genes encoding eight eIF3 subunits in yeast. Escherichia coli strain XL1-Blue was used for plasmid propagation. The variousSaccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this work are based on strain W303-1A (MAT a , leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100) or its isogenic diploid, W303 (20Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in YP or synthetic (S) medium supplemented with the relevant amino acids and 2% glucose (YPD or SD) or 2% galactose (YPG or SG) as described previously (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar); growth was monitored by measuring absorbance at 600 nm (A 600). Sporulation was carried out at room temperature on plates containing 0.3% potassium acetate, 0.02% raffinose, and 10 μg/ml each amino acid. Tetrad dissections and DNA transformations were carried out by standard procedures (22Struhl K. Stinchcomb D.T. Scherer S. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). The yeast gene encoding eIF3-p33 was tentatively identified as a homolog of the gene for mammalian eIF3-p44. The mouse eIF3-p44 sequence (34Block K.L. Vornlocher H.-P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) was used to conduct a TblastN search of the entire yeast genome sequence, 3http://genome-www.stanford.edu/Saccharomyces/. and a putative protein was identified whose amino acid sequence exhibits 33.3% identity to mouse eIF3-p44. The coding sequence, together with flanking regions, was amplified from total yeast genomic DNA by PCR. The upstream (5′-CTCTTCACGATCTGCAAAAGTCCCAACATT-3′) and downstream, (5′-GCTTATGGTGGTGGTGCTTCTTATAGCGCC-3′) primers generate a single 2.1-kb DNA fragment. The fragment was gel-purified and subcloned into pNoTA (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO ) to create pNo-TIF35. Sequencing confirmed that the 2.1-kb insert contains an 825-base pair open reading frame (ORF) with 607 and 674 base pairs of DNA flanking the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. To disrupt the TIF35 gene, pNo-TIF35 was digested withBsaAI and BsmI to remove 91% of theTIF35 coding region, and a 1.7-kb BamHI DNA fragment containing HIS3 was inserted to generate pNoTAtif35::HIS3. The upstream and downstream cloning primers described above were used to generate a 3.1-kbtif35::HIS3 PCR fragment, which was transformed into the diploid yeast strain W303 to create a one-step gene deletion/disruption (23Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (2030) Google Scholar). One of the stable His+transformants (PH33D-7) was selected, and the disruption of one of theTIF35 genes was confirmed by Southern blot analysis (data not shown). pRS316-TIF35 was constructed by digesting pNo-TIF35 with BamHI and subcloning the resulting fragment into BamHI-cleaved pRS316 (American Type Culture Collection). p415Gal1-NH33 is a CEN4 LEU2 plasmid that allows expression of N-terminal His6-tagged p33 under the control of the GAL1 promoter. For its construction, the p33 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from pNo-TIF35 using 5′-CCCGGATCCGCCATGGGTAGAGGTTCTCACCATCACCATCACCATATGAGTGAACATATTCTGTGCATCTA-3′ (tagged with BamHI and NcoI sites (underlined); the bases corresponding to the initiation codon of wild-typeTIF35 are in boldface) and 5′-CCCGTCGACCTCGAGCATATTCTGTGCATCTA-3′ (tagged with SalI and XhoI sites (underlined); the bases corresponding to the stop codon are in boldface). The resulting 0.9-kb DNA fragment was subcloned into pNoTA and sequenced, yielding pNo-NH33 (NH represents N terminus tagged with His6). To construct plasmids p415GalL-NH33 and p415GalS-NH33, pNo-NH33 was digested withBamHI and SalI, and the 0.9-kb fragment was subcloned into the BamHI/SalI sites of p415GalL and p415GalS, respectively (24Mumberg D. Maller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). p415p33ΔC (kindly provided by M.-H. Verlhac, University of California, San Francisco) (14Verlhac M.-H. Chen R.H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) is identical to p415Gal1-NH33, except that the encoded p33 lacks the C-terminal 71 amino acids. To express a recombinant form of His-tagged p33 in E. coli, pET-NH33 was constructed by inserting theNcoI/XhoI fragment from pNo-NH33 into the corresponding sites in pET28c (Novagen). To generate pET-NH33ΔC, p415p33ΔC was digested with BamHI and SalI, and the 0.7-kb fragment was subcloned into pET28c digested withBamHI/SalI. Strain PH33D-7 was transformed with p415GalS-NH33, p415GalL-NH33, or p415p33ΔC, and transformants were selected on SD-His-Leu plates. The resulting transformants were sporulated, and their asci were dissected. Two, three, and four viable spores were obtained on YPG plates and were streaked on SG-His-Leu plates to identify TIF35-disrupted cells carrying p415GalS-NH33, p415GalL-NH33, and p415p33ΔC. The corresponding haploid strains were named PHS33, PHL33, and PH133, respectively. Rabbit antiserum against yeast eIF3 has been described previously (5Naranda T. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32286-32292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-Prt1 antibody was a gift from A. G. Hinnebusch (National Institutes of Health), and affinity-purified rabbit anti-p39 antibody (14Verlhac M.-H. Chen R.H. Hanachi P. Hershey J.W.B. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6812-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by M.-H. Verlhac. To obtain anti-p33 antiserum, rabbit antibodies were raised against purified His6-p33 (BAbCo). For affinity-purified anti-recombinant p33 antibodies, His6-p33 was overexpressed from pET-NH33 in E. coli BL21(DE3), partially purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography (Novagen), and fractionated by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The anti-p33 antiserum was incubated with a piece of the membrane containing His6-p33, and antibodies bound to His6-p33 were eluted with 0.2 ml of low-pH buffer (0.2 m glycine HCl and 1 mm EGTA, pH 2.5). The eluate was quickly neutralized with 0.2 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8; diluted with 1 volume of Blotto (0.5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.075% (v/v) Tween 20); and stored frozen at −80° C. A second batch of affinity-purified anti-p33 antibodies was prepared similarly, but from the anti-eIF3 antiserum, and was used as indicated in the figure legends. Anti-p135 and anti-p110 antibodies were affinity-purified against recombinant His6-tagged p135 and p110 as described elsewhere.2 Strains PHS33 and W303-1A were grown in YPG medium at 30° C to early log phase and shifted into YPD medium. Five, nine, and twelve hours after the shift to glucose, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, followed by quick cooling of the cultures on ice. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) plus 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were broken by vortexing with glass beads in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Boehringer Mannheim)), and cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C. Aliquots (10 A 260 units) from each extract were fractionated on 15–45% sucrose gradients in buffer A by centrifugation at 38,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 40 rotor for 2.25 h at 4° C. The gradients were analyzed by upward displacement, andA 254 profiles were obtained with a density gradient fractionator and UV monitor (Isco Model 185). Strains W303-1A and PHS33 were grown overnight in SG complete minus methionine medium. Cells were harvested, washed in water, and resuspended in either SG complete minus methionine or SD complete minus methionine medium at a density of 0.05 A 600. During incubation at 30° C, cells corresponding to 1 A 600 unit were withdrawn at the indicated time points, harvested, washed in buffer A, and resuspended in 300 μl of the same medium containing 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (1 × 106Ci/mol). The cells were incubated at 30° C for 5 min, followed by addition of 1 ml of a “stop buffer” containing 1.2 mg/ml nonradioactive methionine and 0.1 mg/ml cycloheximide in lysis buffer. Cells were disrupted with glass beads, and proteins from the cleared lysate were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed with acetone and dissolved in 200 μl of 1% SDS. The incorporation of [35S]methionine into total protein was determined by counting radioactivity in an aliquot of the SDS extract. The protein concentration of the SDS extract was determined by the micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. The rate of protein synthesis is expressed as cpm × min−1 × μg of protein−1. Cells harvested at an A 600 of 0.9–1 were disrupted with glass beads in lysis buffer by eight 30-s pulses in a Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc.). The lysate was centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g at 4° C, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 65,000 rpm in a Beckman TL100.4 rotor for 80 min at 4° C. The ribosomal pellet was suspended in 500 mm KCl in lysis buffer and centrifuged as described above. The resulting ribosomal salt wash enriched in eIF3 was incubated in batch for 1 h at 4° C with 0.8 ml of HIS-bindTM resin (Novagen) equilibrated with binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 30 mm imidazole, and 500 mm NaCl). After pouring the resin into a column, unbound proteins were removed by washing with 40 bed volumes of binding buffer, and eIF3 was eluted with the same buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Plasmid pRIB-S1 (kindly provided by J. Warner, Albert Einstein University) carrying a copy of the yeast rDNA gene was used as template to amplify two fragments of yeast 18 S rDNA overlapping at the unique SacI site. rDNA nucleotides 1–1248 were amplified with primers 5′-CCCCTCGAGTATCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAG-3′ (introducing anXhoI site (underlined) upstream of the first rDNA nucleotide) and 5′-CCCGAATTCGAGCTCTCAATCTGTCAATC-3′ (introducing an EcoRI site downstream of the SacI site in the rDNA). Nucleotides 1243–1800 were amplified with primers 5′-CCCTCGAGGAGCTCTTTCTTGATTTTGTG-3′ (introducing anXhoI site upstream of the SacI site) and 5′-CCCATCGATTAATGATCCTTCCGCAGGTT-3′ (introducing aClaI site after the last rRNA nucleotide). PCR products were cloned into pNoTA to generate pNo18S-5′ and pNo18S-3′, and the sequence was verified for both constructs. To construct templates for in vitro transcription under control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter, the XhoI/EcoRI fragment from pNo18S-5′ was cloned into pSP73 digested with XhoI/EcoRI to generate pSP18S-5′. pSP18S-3′ was created by ligating theXhoI/ClaI fragment from pNo18S-3′ intoXhoI/ClaI-digested pSP73. Ligating aSacI/ClaI fragment from pNo18S-3′ into theSacI/ClaI sites of pSP18S-5′ resulted in pSP18S-fl. pSP18S-fl and pSP18S-3′ were linearized with ClaI and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase to yield rRNA-(1–1800) and rRNA-(1243–1800), respectively. pSP18S-5′ digested withEcoRI and BstBI generated rRNA-(1–1248) and rRNA-(1–264), respectively. To synthesize rRNA-(263–1248), pSP18S-5′ was digested with XhoI and BstBI, blunt-ended with Klenow DNA polymerase, religated, and digested withEcoRI prior to transcription. All T7 transcripts carry the sequence 5′-GGGAGACCGGCCUCGAG at the 5′-end of the rRNAs, corresponding to the pSP73 sequence following the transcription start site. In vitro transcription was carried out in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) with the T7/SP6 transcription MAXIscript kit (Ambion Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using MicroSpinTM S-200 HR columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 32P-labeled β-globin mRNA was prepared as described previously (25Wei C.-L. MacMillan S.E. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5764-5771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Isotopically labeled transcripts were analyzed on denaturing 4% (for long transcripts) or 5% (for shorter transcripts) polyacrylamide gels. For Northwestern RNA binding experiments, purified His6-p33 (3 μg), His6-p33ΔC (3 μg), and yeast lysate (10 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were treated for 20 min with binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 75 mm KOAc, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2% (w/v) CHAPS, 1 mg/ml E. coli tRNA, and 200 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were then incubated for 20 min with 200,000 cpm/ml of the 32P-labeled 18 S rRNA or β-globin transcripts in 8 ml of binding buffer. The blots were washed three times for 5 min each with binding buffer and subjected to autoradiography. When this work was initiated, the gene encoding the 33-kDa subunit of eIF3 had not been identified. An attempt to obtain partial amino acid sequences from tryptic digests of p33 from purified yeast eIF3 was not successful. However, at this time, partial amino acid sequence information was being developed in the laboratory (34Block K.L. Vornlocher H.-P. Hershey J.W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31901-31908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) for one of the last subunits of mammalian eIF3 to be characterized, namely eIF3-p44. The mouse p44 amino acid sequence was used to search the yeast data base as described under “Materials and Methods,” and an ORF encoding a putative homolog of mammalian eIF3-p44 was identified. Since the yeast ORF appeared to encode a 30.5-kDa protein, we considered it to be a good candidate for the gene for yeast eIF3-p33, which we namedTIF35. Evidence reported below and elsewhere (18Phan L. Zhang X. Asano K. Anderson J. Vornlocher H.-P. Greenberg J.R. Goldfarb D.S. Qin J. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4935-4946Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) shows that the protein product of TIF35 is a 33-kDa protein that is present in a complex with other known eIF3 subunits, confirming that the gene encodes the p33 subunit. A 2.1-kb fragment of DNA containing TIF35 was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into the pNoTA vector to yield pNo-TIF35 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The 2.1-kb DNA contains an ORF of 825 base pairs that codes for a protein of 274 amino acid residues with a calculated mass of 30,501 Da. The sequence context of the first AUG in the ORF, AUAAUG (the initiation codon is underlined), resembles the yeast consensus context, A(A/U)AAUG (26Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This AUG is preceded by an in-frame UAG termination codon, whereas the next in-frame AUG is found far downstream at codon 117. Thus, the first AUG very likely serves as the initiation codon. Hybridization of 32P-labeled DNA probes (derived from the coding region) to a single band of genomic DNA individually digested with four different restriction enzymes suggested the presence of a single gene locus (data not shown). Sequence comparisons revealed amino acid sequence identities/similarities of 35.8/46.9, 33.1/42.5, 33.3/43.1, and 33.6/47.3% when yeast eIF3-p33 was compared with the corresponding homologous proteins from Schizosaccharomyces pombe(GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB011823), human (U96074), mouse (AA109090, AA270800, and W18370), and Caenorhabditis elegans (Z50044; protein F22B5.2), respectively. When restricting the sequence comparison to the C-terminal 93-amino acid region of p33 that contains the RRM, identity/similarity values range between 43.7/56.3% for S. pombe and 36.4/47.7% for C. elegans. Therefore, eIF3-p33 appears to be present and moderately conserved in essentially all eukaryotic cells. In contrast, no homolog is found in Archaea sequences. To examine whether or notTIF35 is an essential gene, we constructed a diploid strain, PH33D-7, in which one of the TIF35 genes is nearly entirely deleted and is replaced by HIS3, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Tetrad analysis of PH33D-7 revealed that only two of the four spores in each of 30 asci formed colonies on rich medium (YPD), even after a long incubation at 30° C (data not shown). All viable spores were unable to grow on SD-His medium, suggesting that the phenotype oftif35::HIS3 is lethal. The segregation pattern of the tetrad spores (2+:2−) and the fact that no His+ segregants were found indicate thatTIF35 is necessary for germination and/or cell viability. To confirm that the lethal phenotype is due to disruption ofTIF35, plasmid pRS316-TIF35, which expressesTIF35 from its own promoter on a centromeric plasmid carrying a URA3 marker gene, was constructed and transformed into PH33D-7. Ura+ transformants were selected; two were sporulated; and the resulting asci were dissected. Two, three, or four viable spore colonies per ascus were obtained (data not shown). Only one spore from the three viable tetrads or two from the four viable tetrads grew on SD-His plates, and all His+ spore colonies were also Ura+. Thus, spores containing thetif35::HIS3 allele must harbor theURA3 plasmid, which carries TIF35. The results show that TIF35 is the only gene affected and that the disruption is complemented by the cloned gene. To obtain further evidence that TIF35 encodes a subunit of eIF3, we fused six histidine residues to the N terminus of p33 to create His6-p33. Strain PHL33, expressing His6-p33 as the sole source of this subunit, grows at the wild-type rate, indicating that the histidine tag is not deleterious to p33 function. Ribosomal salt wash fractions were prepared from strains expressing the wild-type (strain W303–1A) and histidine-tagged (strain PHL33) forms of p33, and the preparations were fract"

The nuclear genome of eucaryotes is transcribed by three heteromultimeric RNA polymerases that respectively contain 14, 12, and 17 distinct subunits in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The two largest subunits are related to the β′ and β components of the α2ββ′ bacterial core enzyme and to the equivalent subunits of the archaeal and vaccinial RNA polymerases. Biochemical and genetic studies have established that they harbor the active site of the yeast (1Riva M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Grachev M.A. Mustaev A.A. Zaychikov E.F. J. Biol.

The α2ββ′ core polymerase structure is therefore preserved in all eucaryotic, archaeal, bacterial, and viral forms of RNA polymerases. A number of additional subunits are structurally conserved or even strictly identical from one to another polymerases (6Thuriaux P. Sentenac A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R.

We report here that the yeast subunit and its archaeal homolog are largely interchangeable in vivo and that the eucaryotic, archaeal, and viral polypeptides have in common an invariant metal binding domain (CX 2C … CC) critical for its biological activity in S. cerevisiae. Moreover, our data show that ABC10β discriminates between RNA polymerase I and the other two nuclear RNA polymerases via an invariant eucaryotic motif, HVDLIEK.

Plasmids bearing mutant or chimeric forms of RPB10 were expressed from the strong constitutive pPGK1 promoter of the TRP1 multicopy vector pGEN-B (Table I). The yeast (S. cerevisiae) and archaeal (Sulfolobus acidocaldarius) coding sequences were cloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEN-B to generate pGEN-B/RPB10 and pGEN-B/RpoN. The latter plasmid contains a unique BamHI site in the RpoN coding sequence. The N-terminal and C-terminal halves of RPB10 andRpoN could be exchanged to form the F5 and F6 chimeric protein of Fig. 2 A. This required an internalBamHI site at the equivalent position of RPB10, made by a GAA → CAA change at the 32nd codon corresponding to the phenotypically silent rpb10-E32P allele of plasmid pGEN-B/RPB10(E32P).

Acker J. Wintzerith M. Lacroix J.F. Thuriaux P. Vigneron M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4702-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In vivo complementation of the null mutant was monitored by the formation of uracil auxotrophic subclones (selected in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid) in the case of OG10–6a or of red sectors on YPD in the case of YGVS017. Multicopy suppression was systematically monitored by testing several independent transformants by the relevant suppressor plasmid and by checking that spontaneous subclones lacking the suppressor plasmid (selected in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid) invariably lose the suppressor phenotype. [3H]Uracil labeling was done on strains made prototrophic for uracil by transformation with pFL44L. Cells were grown in casamino acids medium (30 °C) supplemented with adenine (20 μg/ml) to an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm and shifted for 1, 4, or 8 h at 37 °C. 150 μCi of [5,6 3H]uracil (1mCi/ml) were added to 10 ml of culture for 10 min. RNA was prepared as described previously (20Hermann-Le Denmat S. Werner M. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2905-2913Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Total RNA were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel after denaturation with glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Boehringer Mannheim) by vacuum blotting (2 h, 200 millibars) in a 785 Vacuum Blotter (Bio-Rad) in 10× SSC (1× SSC =0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate). RNAs were cross-linked using a UV-Stratalinker apparatus (Stratagene) and hybridized againstDED1 and ACT1 probes that were PCR-amplified on yeast genomic DNA using TAACAACAACGGCGGCTACA and CCATCAAATCTCTGCCGTTG (DED1) or TTGAGAGTTGCCCCAGAAGAACACC and CACCATCACCGGAATCCAAAACAAT (ACT1) as primers. These probes were randomly labeled using a Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Six-liter cultures of strains OG22–2b-WTHA (RPB10+) and F4HA (rpb10-F4) grown on minimal SD-Gal (supplemented with casamino extract but lacking adenine) were harvested at a absorbance of about 1.0. Cell-free extracts were prepared as previously described (21Riva M. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. Hawthorne D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4570-4577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cleared by centrifugation. 15 μg of the supernatant proteins was loaded on SDS-PAGE gels (11 and 8% polyacrylamide). These preparations were probed on nitrocellulose membranes by antibodies raised against purified pol I and by a mixture of antibodies raised against the two largest subunits of yeast RNA polymerase II, using a commercial detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fig.1 A presents the alignment of four eucaryotic, four archaeal, and three viral gene products related to ABC10β and documents the particularly strong conservation of the eucaryotic sequences with 41 identical amino acid positions in the fungal, plant, and human sequences. We have previously shown that the human and fission yeast polypeptides are functional in S. cerevisiae (9Shpakovski G.V. Acker J. Wintzerith M. Lacroix J.F. Thuriaux P. Vigneron M. Mol. Cell.

J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The archaeal sequences (including the N polypeptide, a proven polymerase subunit of S. acidocaldarius (14Lanzendörfer M. Langer D. Hain J. Klenk H.P. Holz I. Arnold-Ammer I. Zillig W. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1994; 16: 656-664Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), are less stringently conserved but still clearly related to the eucaryotic subunit. Three cytoplasmic DNA viruses (vaccinia, African swine fever virus and chilo Iridovirus) encode products that are loosely related to each other and to ABC10β, but the vaccinial polypeptide copurifies with RNA polymerase and is thus in all likelihood a genuine subunit of that enzyme (15Amegadzie B.Y. Ahn B.Y. Moss B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, there is no ABC10β-related sequence in any of the bacterial genomes currently available in public data banks. In particular, ABC10β is unrelated to ω, a small polypeptide that copurifies with the holopolymerase of Escherichia coli ((23) and references therein). The N subunit of S. acidocaldarius and ofHaloarcula marismortui cannot replace ABC10β in vivo (9Shpakovski G.V. Acker J. Wintzerith M. Lacroix J.F. Thuriaux P. Vigneron M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4702-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 24McKune K. Woychik N.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4754-4756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, yeast/archaeal chimerae are largely interchangeable in vivo with the yeast subunit, because they support growth when introduced in a S. cerevisiae host strain that is deleted for RPB10, the gene encoding ABC10β (Fig. 2). The archaeal and eucaryotic polypeptides must therefore have largely equivalent functions in their respective transcription complexes. In particular, all constructions where the archaeal component extends up to the first 49 amino acids are viable. In contrast, a chimeric construction (rpb10-F8) extending the archaeal segment up to position His-53 was lethal, as was also the case for a rpb10-F4, swapping the C-end of ABC10β downstream His-53. Deleting the last five amino acids (downstream of Pro-65) had instead no growth defect (rpb10-ΔLEK). The amino acids falling between positions His-53 and Pro-65 are therefore likely to account for the functional incompatibility observed between full-size archaeal (S. acidocaldarius) and eucaryotic ABC10β in vivo. Interestingly, this domain is moderately conserved between archaeal and eucaryotic sequences but contains an invariant HVDLIEK motif in all eucaryotic sequences identified so far (Fig. 1 A). The S. acidocaldarius and S. cerevisiae subunits share 17 amino acids, of which 13 are identical in all eucaryotes and archaeal sequences (Fig.1 A). Amino acid replacements were generated at these 17 positions and at 11 other highly conserved amino acids, expressed from a strong promoter harbored on a multicopy plasmid (i.e.under conditions maximizing the expression of the mutant allele) and tested for their ability to support growth. Practically all the mutants tested were phenotypically silent or had but a partial growth defect, which in keeping with our domain swapping and heterospecific complementation data, indicates that the precise amino acid sequence of ABC10β is not very critical for its function (Fig. 1 B). However, conservative Cys to Ser or Thr substitutions at the CX 2C … CC motif are lethal at all temperatures tested, and mutants with partial growth defect also tend to cluster near this motif. This fits very well with the fact that the CX 2C … CC motif is the only sequence feature shared by all relatives of ABC10β, including the three viral gene products that hardly show any similarity outside this motif. In view of the striking similarity with the canonical CX 2C … CX 2C Zn2+ binding domain, and given that yeast ABC10β binds Zn2+ in vitro (25Treich I. Carles C. Riva M. Sentenac A. Gene Expr. 1992; 2: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that the CX 2C … CC motif defines a new type of metal-coordinating domain, although Zn2+ need not be the true ligand chelated by that motif in vivo. As stated above, the growth properties of yeast/archaeal chimeric constructions suggest that the eucaryotic motif HVDLIEK is critical for the biological activity of ABC10β. This is confirmed by the properties of temperature-sensitive mutants isolated from a library of randomly mutagenizedRPB10 alleles. Only 2 of the 12 mutants thus obtained resulted from single amino acid substitutions (rpb10-K59E and rpb10-I57F), and both are in the HVDLIEK motif (rpb10-K59E actually replaces the invariant lysine by the glutamate of the archaeal sequence). These mutants are strongly temperature-sensitive on plates (see Fig. 4) but can still undergo two to three cycles of growth and division upon a shift to the restrictive temperature, as shown by their delayed growth arrest (Fig.3 A). We monitored the in vivo synthesis of rRNA and tRNA in the first 8 h after the shift (i.e. before growth recedes) by short-pulse labeling with tritiated uracil and followed the accumulation of specific mRNAs by Northern hybridization. The results are shown forrpb10-K59E, and similar data were obtained withrpb10-I57F (not shown). tRNA and 5 S rRNA synthesis (pol III) was not affected under these conditions, but there was a marked effect on the three rRNA species (25 S, 18 S, and 5.8 S) synthesized by pol I (Fig. 3B). In contrast to the rapid arrest observed for therpb1–1 mutant (26Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) specifically affecting the activity of pol II, mRNA synthesis goes on in the rpb10 mutants for at least 5 h after the temperature shift, although it progessively decreases thereafter (Fig. 3 C). Thus, both mutations primarily block the synthesis of pol I-dependent transcripts, although ABC10β is shared by all three polymerases.Figure 3Growth and transcription pattern in a rpb10-K59E mutant (OG20) and its isogenic wild type (WT) control (YGVS017).

Cultures were shifted from 30 °C (lanes 1 and 5) to 37 °C for 1 h (lanes 2 and 6), 5 h (lanes 3 and7), or 8 h (lanes 4 and 8). Total RNA (5 mg as determined by absorbance at 260 nm) was separated on 6% acrylamide gel and exposed for 24 h to reveal the high molecular weight rRNA (25 S and 18 S). Low molecular weight RNAs (5.8 S rRNA, 5 S rRNA, and tRNAS) were revealed after a 7-day exposure. C, RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Total RNA was prepared from YGVS017(RPB10 +) and OG20(rpb10-K59E) and from Y260 (rpb1–1) (26Nonet M. Scafe C. Sexton J. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1602-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). After separation on a 1% agarose gel, RNA was transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Boehringer Mannheim) and hybridized with ACT1 and DED1 probes to determine the steady-state level of the corresponding mRNAs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further explore the transcriptional specificity ofrpb10-K59E and rpb10-I57F mutants, we examined whether they could be rescued by making growth independent of pol I. The appropriate genetic context was created by introducing arpa43-Δ::LEU2 deletion that inactivates the essential pol I subunit A43 (19Thuriaux P. Mariotte S. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Vu L. Lee B.S. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24252-24257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and is thus lethal, except in the presence of a plasmid that expresses the rDNA transcript from the galactose-inducible promoter pGAL7. This allows pol I-defective mutants to be rescued on galactose by pol II-dependent transcription (17Nogi Y. Yano R. Nomura M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3962-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 19Thuriaux P. Mariotte S. Buhler J.M. Sentenac A. Vu L. Lee B.S. Nomura M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24252-24257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Growth at 37 °C was indeed restored inrpa43-Δ::LEU2 (pGAL7::rDNA) constructions harboring rpb10-K59E or rpb10-I57F, indicating that their temperature-sensitive phenotype is primarily because of a pol I defect. As a control, we reintroduced the wild typeRPA43 gene by genetic transformation and shifted the resulting transformants to a glucose medium, shutting off the RNA polymerase II-dependent synthesis of rRNA and thus restoring pol I dependence. Both mutants regained their temperature-sensitive phenotype under these conditions (Fig.4). This pol I-specific defect is an allele-specific property that was not observed in two other temperature-sensitive mutants (rpb10-H53Q andrpb10-M49L) nor in the rpc40-V78R mutant affecting AC40, the α-like subunit common to pol I and III. We next asked if the lethal phenotype of the rpb10-F4 andrpb10-F6 chimerae (where HVDLIEK is replaced by its archaeal counterpart) also results from a pol I-specific defect. Using the same experimental approach, we found again both chimeric constructions to be rescued on galactose, although they are fully lethal when pol II-dependent synthesis of rRNA is shut off in the presence of glucose (Fig. 5). However, growth was slower than in isogenic wild type controls, indicating that there is also a partial pol II and/or III defect. At this point, we began to wonder if ABC10β itself, although shared by all three polymerases, might be only essential for pol I-dependent transcription. Reassuringly, we found that the rpb10-Δ::HIS3deletion is lethal even when allowing pol II-dependent synthesis of rRNA (data not shown). Taking advantage of a previously described yeast genomic library constructed in the multicopy vector pFL44L (27Stettler S. Chiannilkulchai N. Hermann-Le Denmat S. Lalo D. Lacroute F. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we looked for dosage-dependent suppressor genes able to partly correct the growth defect of the ts mutantsrpb10-I57F and rpb10-K59E at 37 °C. It has often been observed that conditional mutants in a given pol I, pol II, or pol III subunits are suppressed by increasing the gene dosage of another subunit of the same enzyme (13Lalo D.

None of the 13 other RNA polymerase I subunits had any suppressor effect, includingRPC19 and RPC40 (encoding the α-like subunits AC19 and AC40 of pol I and pol III), although ts alleles of these two genes are themselves suppressed by a high dosage of RPB10(13Lalo D. Carles C. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5524-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).

These include such diverse functions as postembryonic and fetal development and postnatal growth in mammals, amphibian metamorphosis, maturation of central nervous system, energy metabolism in homeotherms, and environmental adaptation in poikilotherms (1$$Google Scholar, 2$$Google Scholar, 3Shambaugh III, G.E.

It is now generally accepted that, at the molecular level, most of these actions of thyroid hormone are initiated by the interaction between thyroid hormone receptor and T3. Thyroid hormone receptor is a member of a multigene family of nuclear receptors that act as transcription factors in combination with transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors and chromatin-modifying factors (5Oppenheimer J.H.

It is, however, not clear as to how T3enters the cell and reaches the nucleus and what determines the dynamics of cytoplasm-to-nucleus transfer of the hormone.

The physiological actions of retinoic acid (RA) and other retinoids are also considered to be exerted through nuclear retinoic acid receptors (7Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P.

Res. 1995; 50: 317-332PubMed Google Scholar). There is also good evidence that a large fraction of RA and retinoids is present in the cell bound to cytoplasmic proteins, identified as cytosolic retinoic acid (CRABP) and retinol-(CRBP) binding proteins (16Chambon P. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 317-332PubMed Google Scholar, 17Napoli J.L. Posch K.C. Fiorella P.D. Boerman M.H.E.M. Salerno G.J. Burns R.D. Livrea M.A. Packer L. Retinoids, Progress in Research and Clinical Applications. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1993: 29-48Google Scholar). It has been suggested that these binding proteins may not only determine the intracellular concentration of free ligands but may also act as their transporters into the nucleus. A similar suggestion, based on indirect evidence, has also been made for a mammalian CTBP that has been identified as a monomer of pyruvate kinase subtype M2 (18Ashizawa K. Cheng S.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9277-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although there are many similarities between CTBP, CRABP, and CRBP, on the one hand, and retinoic acid receptors and thyroid hormone receptors, on the other, a major difference is the multiple types of CTBPs, unlike CRABP and CRBP (17Napoli J.L. Posch K.C. Fiorella P.D. Boerman M.H.E.M. Salerno G.J. Burns R.D. Livrea M.A. Packer L. Retinoids, Progress in Research and Clinical Applications.

Physiol. 1997; 118C: 27-32Google Scholar), each with a distinct pattern of expression, which raises the possibility of a tissue-specific role for CTBPs. It therefore became important to characterize CTBPs in greater detail. A unique feature of xCTBP found in adult liver is that it has a region similar to those of mammalian class 1 aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH1) (aldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.2.1.3) (11Yamauchi K.

Development. 1992; 115: 371-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yoshida A. Hsu L.C. Dave V. Enzyme (Basel). 1992; 46: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 23Graham C. Hodin J. Wistow G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15623-15628Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It would be highly possible that ALDH1 has a binding activity for hydrophobic signaling molecules including T3 since human ALDH1 from genital skin fibroblasts displays androgen binding activity (24Pereira F. Rosenmann E. Nylen E. Kaufman M. Pinsky L. Wrogemann K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we report studies carried out to unambiguously identify xCTBP as ALDH1. Toward this aim, we have cloned two cDNAs encoding ALDH1 from a Xenopus hepatic cDNA library with human ALDH1 cDNA as the probe (25Hsu L.C. Tani K. Fujiyoshi T. Kurachi K. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), determined their nucleotide sequences, and examined both the enzyme and T3 binding activities using the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Deduced amino acid sequences and studies of their activities clearly showed that the two translated products are ALDH1 with T3binding activity. The corresponding mRNAs were expressed predominantly in the kidney and intestine in adult Xenopus. T3 binding and ALDH activities of these proteins seem to be expressed alternatively depending on NAD+ binding. Enzymes and chemicals were obtained from the following sources: restriction enzymes from Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs, Boehringer Mannheim, Takara Shuzo, and Toyobo; a multiprime DNA labeling kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase, exonucleases III and VII, guanidinium isothiocyanate, and cesium chloride were from Life Technologies, Inc.; Taq DNA polymerase was from Biotech International; a DNA sequencing kit was from Toyobo; ethyl-3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonic acid salt was from Aldrich; [α-32P]dCTP (110 TBq/mmol) was from ICN Biomedicals Inc.; [125I]T3 (122 MBq/μg; carrier-free) was from NEN Life Science Products; and unlabeled T3,d-T3, T4, 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyroacetic acid andall-trans-retinal were from Sigma. Acetaldehyde was obtained from Merck and AG 1-X8 resin from Bio-Rad. Other reagents of molecular biology grade were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals and ICN Biomedicals. Adult Xenopus hepatic cDNA library in ZAP II λ vector was kindly provided by Dr. A. Kawahara, Hiroshima University, Japan. Human ALDH1 cDNA was a gift from Dr. A. Yoshida, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, CA. Protein was determined by the dye binding method with bovine γ-globulin as a standard (26Bradford M. Chang W.C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 112-124Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Adult female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized by immersing in 0.2% ethyl-3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonic acid salt. Animals were first perfused with ice-cold Barth-X amphibian Ringer (27Barth L.G. Barth L.J. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1959; 7: 210-222PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.2 mg/ml heparin and then with ice-cold Barth-X amphibian Ringer alone. Dissected tissue was minced with scissors in Barth-X amphibian Ringer, followed by several washings in the same solution. The minced tissue was homogenized in 4.5 volumes of 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.5, as described previously (11Yamauchi K. Tata J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After successive differential centrifugations at 3,000 ×g for 10 min, 12,000 × g for 20 min, and 100,500 × g for 60 min, a clear supernatant was obtained and stored in 10% glycerol at −85 °C until its use as a cytosol. xCTBP was purified as described with some modifications (11Yamauchi K. Tata J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C, unless otherwise noted. In brief, solid ammonium sulfate at a final concentration of 1.4m was added to 30 ml of cytosol, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. More solid ammonium sulfate, at a final concentration of 2.5m, was added to the supernatant. The precipitate obtained was collected by centrifugation in the same way and dissolved in 2–3 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5. It was applied to a Cellulofine GCL-1000 column (3.0 × 76.5 cm, Seikagaku Co.), which had been equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The eluates with T3 binding activity were applied to CM cation-exchange and DEAE anion-exchange Sepharose columns (5 ml packed Fast Flow columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been tandemly connected and equilibrated with 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5. Flow-through fractions were collected, and the pH of the combined eluate was adjusted to 5.3 with 1 macetic acid. The eluate was subjected to chromatography on Mono S cation-exchange column (5 × 50 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been equilibrated with 20 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 5.3, and the proteins were eluted with a 60-min gradient of this buffer to 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins in the peak fractions exhibiting T3 binding activity were further fractionated by chromatography on a hydroxyapatite column (model Taps, Tonen) with a 20-min gradient of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, to 300 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min in a fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus. Finally, the proteins with T3 binding activity were further isolated by chromatography on a hydrophobic interaction phenyl 5PW column (7.5 × 75 mm, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), equilibrated with 0.5 m ammonium sulfate in 5 mm sodium phosphate and 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.0. The proteins were resolved with a 20-min linear gradient of the buffer to 60% ethylene glycol in 5 mm sodium phosphate, 0.5 mm DTT, pH 7.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, using a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) apparatus (Jusco 851-GI system, Japan Spectroscopic Co.). An hepatic cDNA library was screened with 32P-radiolabeled human ALDH1 cDNA (25Hsu L.C. Tani K. Fujiyoshi T. Kurachi K. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The entire sequences of the two cDNAs were determined for both strands by the method of Sanger et al. (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). The computer program, Clustal W (1.60) in DNA Data Bank of Japan was used on multiple sequence alignment and the construction of unrooted tree by the Neighbor-joining method (29Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from them by the acid guanidinium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform method (30Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing 2.6 m formaldehyde, and the separated RNAs were transferred onto a nylon filter. Hybridization and washing were performed under high stringency conditions as described (31Iwase K. Yamauchi K. Ishikawa K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The probe forXenopus ALDH1 (xALDH1) cDNAs, a 0.3-kbp fragment that contained nt 1708–2014 of xALDH1-I cDNA, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. To check the amount of total RNA loaded, 28 S ribosomal RNA hybridization signals on the same filter were estimated as a loading control. Xenopus 28 S ribosomal cDNA was amplified at the nt positions 1–346 by PCR, after the reaction with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase in the presence of (dT)12–18 at 37 °C for 1 h. Autoradiography was done with Kodak XAR5 film with intensifying screen at −85 °C for 1–7 days. The coding sequences of xALDH1-I and -II cDNAs, with a NdeI site engineered into the start codon and a BglII site downstream from the stop codon, was prepared by PCR, subcloned into pET15b expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and designated pET15b/xALDH1-I and pET15b/xALDH1-II. These plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.5. The temperature was lowered to 24 °C, 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and incubation was continued for 24 h unless otherwise noted. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifuging (1200 × g), resuspending in 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1 mmbenzamidine hydrochloride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and then keeping on ice for 30 min. The cells were disrupted by sonication for 10 s three times on ice at the range 5 (UR200P type, Tomy) and subsequently by three cycles of freezing and thawing, and the lysate was centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. Recombinant proteins with a histidine tag were isolated from the other proteins in the supernatant by a nickel affinity chromatography (1 ml of the resin) (ProBond Resin, Invitrogen, CA), with 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, after washing the column with six times column volume of 0.3 mNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 80 mm imidazole. The purified proteins were stored in 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol at −85 °C until use. Cytosolic or recombinant proteins were incubated in 250 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 nm[125I]T3, in the presence of or absence of 5 μm unlabeled T3 at 0 °C for 30 min. The [125I]T3 bound to proteins was separated from free [125I]T3 by the Dowex method (11Yamauchi K. Tata J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and these radioactivities were measured in a γ counter (Auto Well Gamma System ARC-2000, Aloka, Japan). The amount of [125I]T3 bound nonspecifically was derived from the radioactivity in the sample incubated with 5 μmunlabeled T3 and subtracted from amount of the total bound T3 to give the values for specific binding. The values for the dissociation constant (K d) and maximum binding capacity were calculated from Scatchard plot (32Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling with underivatized [125I]T3 was carried out as described previously (11Yamauchi K. Tata J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and visualized using Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining or silver staining. Phosphorylase b, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and carbonic anhydrase were used as molecular weight standards. The labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography exposed to x-ray XAR5 film (Kodak) at −85 °C for 2–5 days. Assay was performed in duplicate or triplicate (values within 10% of the mean) in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 3.3 mm pyrazole, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.33 mmNAD+, and various concentrations of substrates by monitoring for 1–2 min at 24 °C the formation of NADH (ε at 340 nm = 6220) with aldehydes other than retinal. The reactions were initiated by adding the enzyme. At least six concentrations were used for determining kinetic constants of acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, and retinal, ranging 1–32 mm, 0.2–16 mm and 1–32 μm, respectively. For RA synthesis, the formation of NADH and retinoic acid (ε at 340 nm = 6220 + 39,200 − 22,800) were monitored under dim light (34Elder T.D. Topper Y.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 64: 430-437Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In some cases, the formation of RA was monitored at 340 nm by HPLC (35Napoli J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 189: 470-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). There are few differences in the values of kinetic parameters obtained from the two methods. Kinetic constants were determined under initial velocity conditions linear with time and protein. Cytosolic proteins from adult liver and two recombinant xALDH1 proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted for 1 h at room temperature with a primary polyclonal antibody to a peptide of xCTBP, which is identical to amino acid residues 239–261 in xALDH1-II (see Fig. 2 B). Binding was detected by using the chemiluminescence kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's directions. The photoaffinity labeled xCTBP was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the peptides were fractionated by HPLC as described previously (36Yamauchi K. Yamamoto T. Hayashi H. Koya S. Takikawa H. Toyoshima K. Horiuchi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The peptide with radioactivity was hydrolyzed and analyzed by gas phase sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystem, 470A). The elution profile of the final step of the chromatography of xCTBP, which was purified on the basis of [125I]T3-binding on a phenyl 5PW column, resembled that described earlier (11Yamauchi K. Tata J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The major protein peak contained a single species of protein with 59 kDa that was specifically photoaffinity labeled with [125I]T3 and corresponded to the peak of [125I]T3-binding activity (Fig.1). To determine whether or not xCTBP has ALDH activity, each fraction was assayed with acetaldehyde as a substrate. The major protein peak also coincided with the peak of ALDH activity. These results indicate that the 59-kDa protein has both activities. The information about the sequence involved in the [125I]T3-binding site was obtained by the identification of the peptide with radioactivity after digestion of the affinity labeled xCTBP with lysyl endopeptidase. Protein sequencing revealed that the peptide (K)LADLVERDRLILSTM-, which corresponded well to 91–106 residues of human ALDH1 enzyme (25Hsu L.C. Tani K. Fujiyoshi T. Kurachi K. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and to 92–107 residues of xALDH1-I and -II enzymes (Fig.2 B), would constitute a part of the [125I]T3-binding site. Relative efficiencies of ALDH activity of xCTBP for two aldehyde substrates, acetaldehyde and retinal, are shown in TableI. xCTBP catalyzed the conversion of acetaldehyde into acetic acid or retinal into RA at a linear rate for at least 1–2 min at 1.85 μg of the purified protein. TheK m value for acetaldehyde (380 ± 20 μm) was 220 times higher than that for retinal (1.7 ± 0.5 μm), although the V max for acetaldehyde (0.54 ± 0.01 μmol/min/mg) was 7 times higher than that for retinal (0.073 ± 0.002 μmol/min/mg). xCTBP exhibited allosteric characteristics for retinal with the Hill coefficient of 2.5 ± 0.2 but not for acetaldehyde as the substrate (Fig.5 A).Table IKinetic constants of ALDH activities of xCTBP and ALDH1 enzymesSubstrate/enzymeK mV maxV max/K mHill coefficientAcetaldehydexCTBP (2)0.38 ± 0.020.54 ± 0.011.42xALDH1-I (3)3.2 ± 0.4ap < 0.05, compared kinetic constants of xALDH1-I with those of xALDH1-II.0.40 ± 0.120.125xALDH1-II (3)1.7 ± 0.20.14 ± 0.020.082PropionaldehydexALDH1-I (3)0.45 ± 0.130.31 ± 0.070.69xALDH1-II (3)0.32 ± 0.140.12 ± 0.010.38RetinalxCTBP (3)1.7 ± 0.50.073 ± 0.00242.92.5 ± 0.2xALDH1-I (4)6.9 ± 0.5bp < 0.01, compared kinetic constants of xALDH1-I with those of xALDH1-II.0.062 ± 0.0058.91.8 ± 0.4xALDH1-II (4)4.2 ± 0.20.045 ± 0.00310.72.7 ± 0.6NAD+xALDH1-I (3)38 ± 3ap < 0.05, compared kinetic constants of xALDH1-I with those of xALDH1-II.0.44 ± 0.1011.6xALDH1-II (3)9.2 ± 1.80.18 ± 0.0319.6Substrate K m values are millimolar for acetaldehyde and propionaldehyde, and micromolar for retinal.

We selected adultXenopus liver cDNA library for cloning ALDH cDNA because T3 binding activity is higher in liver cytosol than in other tissues of adult Xenopus (36Yamauchi K. Yamamoto T. Hayashi H. Koya S. Takikawa H. Toyoshima K. Horiuchi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 1485-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Human ALDH1 cDNA (25Hsu L.C. Tani K. Fujiyoshi T. Kurachi K. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was used as a screening probe from the fact that amino acid sequence of xCTBP showed high identity to that of human ALDH1 in the two regions selected (see Fig. 2 B). Two cDNAs with 2.4 kbp, xALDH1-I and xALDH1-II, which were quite similar to but slightly different from each other, were thus isolated. xALDH1-I was distinguished from xALDH1-II in one of the two internal PstI restriction sites (Fig. 2 A). When amino acid sequences were deduced from the two cDNAs and aligned with human ALDH1 sequence (25Hsu L.C. Tani K. Fujiyoshi T. Kurachi K. Yoshida A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3771-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), it is likely that xALDH1-I cDNA starts at the third nt of the putative ATG codon and ends at nt position 2301 and that xALDH1-II cDNA starts at 21 nt upstream from possible start codon and ends at nt position 2341 (Fig. 2 B). For xALDH1-II cDNA, the flanking sequence of the possible start site conformed partially to the Kozak criteria (37Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2383) Google Scholar). A putative polyadenylation signal was present beginning at nt position 2276 for xALDH1-I cDNA and 2317 for xALDH1-II cDNA, in their 3′-untranslated regions. Deduced amino acid sequences of xALDH1-I and -II consisted of both 502 residues including the start site Met and whose molecular weights were calculated to be 55,020 and 55,215, respectively, which agreed well with 59 kDa for xCTBP estimated by SDS-PAGE. Estimated pI values of xALDH1-I (7.08) and -II proteins (7.44) also agreed well with the measured pI value of xCTBP, 7.0 ± 0.1 (11Yamauchi K. Tata J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions of the xALDH1-I and -II were highly similar to that of the purified xCTBP (11Yamauchi K. Tata J.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1105-1112Crossre"
https://openalex.org/W2087676876,"In the introduction to “A Thematic Series on Phospholipases” that appeared about two years ago (Prescott, S.M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272,15043) I commented that phospholipids are a reservoir for lipid mediators that support many intracellular events and that the initial step leading to their synthesis was activation of a phospholipase. This series reviews another molecular route to generating, and then shutting off, lipid-based signals: phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) of a lipid. This is a well characterized mechanism for regulating the function of proteins, and the last decade has seen an explosion of information about similar processes in regulating lipid messengers. The first clue was the observation that phosphatidylinositol and its analogs with phosphates on the inositol ring were substrates for the addition of another phosphate and that this reaction occurred at the 3-position of inositol, a previously unrecognized target. This finding led to remarkable insights into signals that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. This important body of work is covered in the first paper, “The Role of Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Lipid Products in Cell Function” by Lucia E. Rameh and Lewis C. Cantley. The kinases, or at least many of them, responsible for this modification have been identified, their cDNAs cloned, and their substrate specificity and subcellular location(s) identified. The phosphoinositide 3-kinases were found early on to be associated with other proteins, notably receptors for growth factors, and this observation has progressed to a detailed list of such binding partners and definition of the regions of the proteins that are essential for the interactions. Likewise, the question of how the phospholipid products from the reaction catalyzed by phosphoinositide 3-kinase(s) alter cell responses has been extensively studied. Many target proteins have been identified, and specific sequences that bind the 3-phosphorylated phospholipids have been determined. Rameh and Cantley review this area, and then it is focused upon by Andrew E. Wurmser, Jonathan D. Gary, and Scott D. Emr in their article, “Phosphoinositide 3-Kinases and Their FYVE Domain-containing Effectors as Regulators of Vacuolar/Lysosomal Membrane Trafficking Patterns.” One particularly productive area of investigation is featured in this review, i.e. the definition of the essential role of these lipids in membrane trafficking, a subject that has been particularly well served by genetic approaches in yeast. The description of the consequences of adding phosphate(s) to phosphatidylinositol is continued in the review, “Phosphatidylinositol Phosphate Kinases, a Multifaceted Family of Signaling Enzymes” by Richard A. Anderson, Igor V. Boronenkov, Scott D. Doughman, Jeannette Kunz, and Joost C. Loijens. It has been known for many years that phosphatidylinositol could be converted to singly and doubly phosphorylated forms with the additions at the 4- and 5-positions of the inositol; in fact, such products are found as trace components of cellular membranes. The recent identification of the kinases that catalyze these reactions has both explained the usual synthetic pathway for these membrane constituents and, as with the 3-kinase story, led to the observation that the synthesis of these lipids was involved in many types of cellular signaling. As with the 3-kinases, these enzymes are found in complexes with other signaling proteins, a general theme that has emerged in studies of lipid kinases and phosphatases, just as with protein kinases and phosphatases. The study of inositol phosphatases began as an effort to define one of the off switches in signaling initiated by the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides; this is one of the phospholipase-initiated pathways mentioned above, and when phosphatidylinositol P2 is cleaved by a phospholipase C the water-soluble product, inositol trisphosphate, is a signal to raise the intracellular calcium concentration. The removal of the 5-phosphate abolishes the signal and calcium declines. After members of this phosphatase family were identified it subsequently was found that some of them also could catalyze the removal of phosphate from the phospholipids, a completely unexpected finding. This property has been implicated in the tumor-suppressing ability of one of the inositol phosphatases, PTEN. This rapidly evolving field is reviewed by Philip W. Majerus, Marina V. Kisseleva, and F. Anderson Norris in their article “The Role of Phosphatases in Inositol Signaling Reactions.” Another signal from the phosphatidylinositol signaling cycle that needs to be shut off is diacylglycerol, the other product of the phospholipase C reaction. This neutral lipid is present only in very low amounts in normal, resting cells but rises in response to many types of stimuli and is elevated persistently in many transformed cells. Its major action is to activate members of the protein kinase C family, which have diverse effects on cell growth, differentiation, and other responses. The major route for lowering the transiently elevated diacylglycerol is by conversion to phosphatidic acid, a reaction that adds phosphate to the lipid. This is catalyzed by a family of kinases that Matthew K. Topham and I review in “Mammalian Diacylglycerol Kinases, a Family of Lipid Kinases with Signaling Functions.” As with the kinases and phosphatases that modify phosphatidylinositol, the diacylglycerol kinases are a diverse group. Two themes run through these reviews of enzymes that add and remove phosphate from lipids. First, they are found in complexes with other signaling proteins including protein kinases and phosphatases, G proteins, and each other. Second, although they all were initially assumed to be part of events localized to the plasma membrane and nearby cytoplasm, they all have additionally been found to be in the nucleus, where they participate in what appears to be a parallel signaling system. Both of these themes will attract intense interest in the next few years as the functional significance is dissected."
