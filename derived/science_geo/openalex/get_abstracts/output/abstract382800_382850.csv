https://openalex.org/W2126504590,"A Lot of HOTAIR The roles of several classes of small (&lt;50 nucleotides) noncoding RNAs are beginning to be defined in molecular detail, whereas the function of most of the long (∼200+ nucleotides), intergenic noncoding (linc)RNAs found in most eukaryotic genomes remains something of a mystery. The HOTAIR lincRNA, which is transcribed from the mouse HOXC locus, binds to the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and recruits it to HOXD and other genes, where its histone methylase activity acts to repress gene transcription. Tsai et al. (p. 689 , published online 8 July) now show that HOTAIR also binds to a histone demethylase enzyme, LSD1, part of the CoREST/REST repressor complex. LSD1 acts to remove transcription-activating histone marks, reinforcing the repressive activity of the PRC2 complex. HOTAIR thus functions as a platform for the coordinated binding of PRC2 and LSD1-containing complexes to genes, as revealed in a genome-wide analysis of PRC1/CoREST/REST co-regulated genes."

One strategy to identify potential vaccine candidates is to isolate broadly neutralizing antibodies from infected individuals and then attempt to elicit the same antibody response through vaccination (see the Perspective by Burton and Weiss ). Wu et al. (p. 856 , published online 8 July) now report the identification of three broadly neutralizing antibodies, isolated from an HIV-1–infected individual, that exhibited great breadth and potency of neutralization and were specific for the co-receptor CD4-binding site of the glycoprotein 120 (gp120), part of the viral Env spike. Zhou et al. (p. 811 , published online 8 July) analyzed the crystal structure for one of these antibodies, VRC01, in complex with an HIV-1 gp120. VRC01 focuses its binding onto a conformationally invariant domain that is the site of initial CD4 attachment, which allows the antibody to overcome the glycan and conformational masking that diminishes the neutralization potency of most CD4-binding-site antibodies. The epitopes recognized by these antibodies suggest potential immunogens that can inform vaccine design."

https://openalex.org/W1988939568,"Genomic imprinting results in preferential expression of the paternal or maternal allele of certain genes. We have performed a genome-wide characterization of imprinting in the mouse embryonic and adult brain. This approach uncovered parent-of-origin allelic effects of more than 1300 loci. We identified parental bias in the expression of individual genes and of specific transcript isoforms, with differences between brain regions. Many imprinted genes are expressed in neural systems associated with feeding and motivated behaviors, and parental biases preferentially target genetic pathways governing metabolism and cell adhesion. We observed a preferential maternal contribution to gene expression in the developing brain and a major paternal contribution in the adult brain. Thus, parental expression bias emerges as a major mode of epigenetic regulation in the brain."

(p. 197 ) studied the polymerization kinetics of nanoparticles. Functionalized arrowhead nanorods acted as linkable units that joined together in solvent-tuned assembly. The results resembled common processes of chemical polymerization: Growth was controlled kinetically and could be interpreted by formulas for step-growth polymerization and branching. Furthermore, some isomerization phenomena were observed, as was the formation of cyclic “macromolecules.”"
https://openalex.org/W2008823848,"Offsetting the Cost of Parasitism Fruit flies, like most animals, are vulnerable to infection by a range of organisms, which, in co-infections, can interact with sometimes surprising effects. Jaenike et al. (p. 212 ) discovered that a species of Spiroplasma bacterium that is sometimes found in flies, and that is transmitted from mother to offspring, protects its host from the effects of a nematode worm parasite, Howardula aoronymphium . The worm sterilizes the female flies and shortens their lives, but when flies were experimentally infected with Spiroplasma , their fertility was rescued. Similarly, in wild populations of fruit flies infected with worms, those also infected with Spiroplasma had more eggs in their ovaries. The bacterium inhibits the growth of the adult female worms, but such is the advantage of this bacterial infection in offsetting the burden of nematodes on reproductive fitness, Spiroplasma appears to be spreading rapidly through populations of fruit flies in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2053013933,"Elucidating Turbulent Flow When needing to mix two fluids rapidly, turbulent flow can be beneficial. However, in most cases, the churning and tumbling motions of a fluid during turbulent flow reduce the efficiency of a device or process. When fluid flows past a solid object, the bulk of the turbulent motion is concentrated at the surface boundary, but it is unclear to what extent these inner motions are influenced by flow far from the boundary. Marusic et al. (p. 193 ; see the Perspective by Adrian ) demonstrate a nonlinear connection between inner-layer motions and the large-scale outer-layer motions in wind tunnel experiments. A simple model was able to describe the relationship mathematically while accurately mapping the experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2069254821,"Parental Influences Genomic imprinting results in the preferential expression of either the paternally or the maternally inherited allele of certain genes. Two papers by Gregg et al. (p. 643 , published online 8 July; and p. 682 , published online 8 July; see the Perspective by Wilkinson ) use a genome-wide approach to characterize the repertoire of genes with parent-of-origin allelic effects in the mouse embryonic and adult brain. The studies uncovered over 1300 loci with maternal or paternal allelic bias. Comparison of the parent-of-origin allelic expression bias in the adult hypothalamus and cortex, and in the developing brain, revealed spatiotemporal, sex-specific, and isoform-specific regulation. Parent-of-origin effects thus represent a major and dynamic mode of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2074482550,"Switching Basins Most of the densest, deepest water at the bottom of the oceans comes from two regions, the North Atlantic and the circum-Antarctic. Have other regions been able to produce significant quantities of deep water in the past? For decades, researchers have looked, with limited success, for evidence of deepwater formation in the North Pacific since the time of the Last Glacial Maximum, about 23,000 years ago. Okazaki et al. (p. 200 ) combine published observational evidence from the North Pacific with model simulations to suggest that deep water did form in the North Pacific during the early part of the Last Glacial Termination, between about 17,500 and 15,000 years ago. The switch between deep-water formation in the North Atlantic and the North Pacific is likely to have had an important effect on heat transport and climate."
https://openalex.org/W2091285282,"Unlike neurons in the central nervous system (CNS), injured neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) can regenerate their axons and reinnervate their targets. However, functional recovery in the PNS often remains suboptimal, especially in cases of severe damage. The lack of regenerative ability of CNS neurons has been linked to down-regulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. We report here that PNS dorsal root ganglial neurons (DRGs) activate mTOR following damage and that this activity enhances axonal growth capacity. Furthermore, genetic up-regulation of mTOR activity by deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) in DRGs is sufficient to enhance axonal growth capacity in vitro and in vivo. We further show that mTOR activity is linked to the expression of GAP-43, a crucial component of axonal outgrowth. However, although TSC2 deletion in DRGs facilitates axonal regrowth, it leads to defects in target innervation. Thus, whereas manipulation of mTOR activity could provide new strategies to stimulate nerve regeneration in the PNS, fine control of mTOR activity is required for proper target innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2081006654,"Separating Under Strain Complex oxides, such as cuprate superconductors and perovskites, often exhibit microscopic phase separation, where two or more phases coexist on the macroscopic scale but are spatially separated on the microscopic scale. Lai et al. (p. 190 ) studied a configuration often found in technological applications, a strained manganite thin film placed on a substrate. Microwave impedance microscopy, which differentiates between conducting and insulating areas on the thin film, allowed visualization of the phase separation as the magnetic field was varied. A network of conducting domains was observed whose orientation and characteristic length scales suggest that the substrate-exerted strain was involved in network formation."
https://openalex.org/W2019304821,"Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) initiates a complex series of neurochemical and signaling changes that lead to pathological events including neuronal hyperactivity, excessive glutamate release, inflammation, increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and cerebral edema, altered gene expression, and neuronal dysfunction. It is believed that a drug combination, or a single drug acting on multiple targets, may be an effective strategy to treat TBI. Valproate, a widely used antiepileptic drug, has a number of targets including GABA transaminase, voltage-gated sodium channels, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), and therefore may attenuate a number of TBI-associated pathologies. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a rodent model of TBI, we tested if post-injury administration of valproate can decrease BBB permeability, reduce neural damage and improve cognitive outcome. Dose-response studies revealed that systemic administration of 400 mg/kg (i.p.), but not 15, 30, 60 or 100 mg/kg, increases histone H3 and H4 acetylation, and reduces GSK-3 activity, in the hippocampus. Thirty min post-injury administration of 400 mg/kg valproate improved BBB integrity as indicated by a reduction in Evans Blue dye extravasation. Consistent with its dose response to inhibit GSK-3 and HDACs, valproate at 400 mg/kg, but not 100 mg/kg, reduced TBI-associated hippocampal dendritic damage, lessened cortical contusion volume, and improved motor function and spatial memory. These behavioral improvements were not observed when SAHA (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid), a selective HDAC inhibitor, was administered. Conclusion/Significance Our findings indicate that valproate given soon after TBI can be neuroprotective. As clinically proven interventions that can be used to minimize the damage following TBI are not currently available, the findings from this report support the further testing of valproate as an acute therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2033485858,"Cooperative behavior that increases the fitness of others at a cost to oneself can be promoted by natural selection only in the presence of an additional mechanism. One such mechanism is based on population structure, which can lead to clustering of cooperating agents. Recently, the focus has turned to complex dynamical population structures such as social networks, where the nodes represent individuals and links represent social relationships. We investigate how the dynamics of a social network can change the level of cooperation in the network. Individuals either update their strategies by imitating their partners or adjust their social ties. For the dynamics of the network structure, a random link is selected and breaks with a probability determined by the adjacent individuals. Once it is broken, a new one is established. This linking dynamics can be conveniently characterized by a Markov chain in the configuration space of an ever-changing network of interacting agents. Our model can be analytically solved provided the dynamics of links proceeds much faster than the dynamics of strategies. This leads to a simple rule for the evolution of cooperation: The more fragile links between cooperating players and non-cooperating players are (or the more robust links between cooperators are), the more likely cooperation prevails. Our approach may pave the way for analytically investigating coevolution of strategy and structure."
https://openalex.org/W1963715731,"Getting Gametes Together Despite decades of research, the molecular basis of sperm-egg recognition in mammals remains unresolved. Models in which a glycan ligand in the zona pellucida (ZP) surrounding ovulated eggs binds to a sperm surface receptor have been widely embraced. A more recent model proposes that the cleavage status of a ZP protein, ZP2, renders the structure of the zona matrix either permissive or nonpermissive for sperm binding. Gahlay et al. (p. 216 ) tested predictions of each model by replacing endogenous zona proteins with either a mutant form of ZP2 that could not be cleaved or of ZP3 that lacked O glycan attachment sites. Sperm-egg recognition depended on the cleavage status of ZP2 rather than on glycan ligands released following fertilization."
https://openalex.org/W2029418101,"The autophagy-related protein 8 (Atg8) conjugation system is essential for the formation of double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes during autophagy, a bulk degradation process conserved among most eukaryotes. It is also important in yeast for recognizing target vacuolar enzymes through the receptor protein Atg19 during the cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting (Cvt) pathway, a selective type of autophagy. Atg3 is an E2-like enzyme that conjugates Atg8 with phosphatidylethanolamine. Here, we show that Atg3 directly interacts with Atg8 through the WEDL sequence, which is distinct from canonical interaction between E2 and ubiquitin-like modifiers. Moreover, NMR experiments suggest that the mode of interaction between Atg8 and Atg3 is quite similar to that between Atg8/LC3 and the Atg8 family interacting motif (AIM) conserved in autophagic receptors, such as Atg19 and p62. Thus, the WEDL sequence in Atg3 is a canonical AIM. In vitro analyses showed that Atg3 AIM is crucial for the transfer of Atg8 from the Atg8∼Atg3 thioester intermediate to phosphatidylethanolamine but not for the formation of the intermediate. Intriguingly, in vivo experiments showed that it is necessary for the Cvt pathway but not for starvation-induced autophagy. Atg3 AIM attenuated the inhibitory effect of Atg19 on Atg8 lipidation in vitro, suggesting that Atg3 AIM may be important for the lipidation of Atg19-bound Atg8 during the Cvt pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2122540855,"In HIV-1-infected individuals, G-to-A hypermutation is found in HIV-1 DNA isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). These mutations are thought to result from editing by one or more host enzymes in the APOBEC3 (A3) family of cytidine deaminases, which act on CC (APOBEC3G) and TC (other A3 proteins) dinucleotide motifs in DNA (edited cytidine underlined). Although many A3 proteins display high levels of deaminase activity in model systems, only low levels of A3 deaminase activity have been found in primary cells examined to date. In contrast, here we report high levels of deaminase activity at TC motifs when whole PBMCs or isolated primary monocyte-derived cells were treated with interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) or IFNalpha-inducing toll-like receptor ligands. Induction of TC-specific deaminase activity required new transcription and translation and correlated with the appearance of two APOBEC3A (A3A) isoforms. Knockdown of A3A in monocytes with siRNA abolished TC-specific deaminase activity, confirming that A3A isoforms are responsible for all TC-specific deaminase activity observed. Both A3A isoforms appear to be enzymatically active; moreover, our mutational studies raise the possibility that the smaller isoform results from internal translational initiation. In contrast to the high levels of TC-specific activity observed in IFNalpha-treated monocytes, CC-specific activity remained low in PBMCs, suggesting that A3G deaminase activity is relatively inhibited, unlike that of A3A. Together, these findings suggest that deaminase activity of A3A isoforms in monocytes and macrophages may play an important role in host defense against viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2103062085,"Xanthine oxidase is a molybdenum-containing enzyme catalyzing the hydroxylation of a sp(2)-hybridized carbon in a broad range of aromatic heterocycles and aldehydes. Crystal structures of the bovine enzyme in complex with the physiological substrate hypoxanthine at 1.8 A resolution and the chemotherapeutic agent 6-mercaptopurine at 2.6 A resolution have been determined, showing in each case two alternate orientations of substrate in the two active sites of the crystallographic asymmetric unit. One orientation is such that it is expected to yield hydroxylation at C-2 of substrate, yielding xanthine. The other suggests hydroxylation at C-8 to give 6,8-dihydroxypurine, a putative product not previously thought to be generated by the enzyme. Kinetic experiments demonstrate that >98% of hypoxanthine is hydroxylated at C-2 rather than C-8, indicating that the second crystallographically observed orientation is significantly less catalytically effective than the former. Theoretical calculations suggest that enzyme selectivity for the C-2 over C-8 of hypoxanthine is largely due to differences in the intrinsic reactivity of the two sites. For the orientation of hypoxanthine with C-2 proximal to the molybdenum center, the disposition of substrate in the active site is such that Arg(880) and Glu(802), previous shown to be catalytically important for the conversion of xanthine to uric acid, play similar roles in hydroxylation at C-2 as at C-8. Contrary to the literature, we find that 6,8-dihydroxypurine is effectively converted to uric acid by xanthine oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2074241276,"Quake Control Large earthquakes occur at the margins of two colliding plates, where one plate subducts beneath the other at a shallow angle. These megathrust earthquakes often cause destructive tsunamis owing to the displacement of large volumes of water at the fault along the plate boundary. Two related studies of the seismic structure of subduction zones attempt to reveal the underlying mechanisms of megathrust earthquakes (see the Perspective by Wang ). Kimura et al. (p. 210 ) compared seismic reflection images and microearthquake locations at the Philippine Sea plate where it subducts obliquely beneath Japan. The locations of repeating microearthquakes correspond to active transfer of material from the subducting plate to the continent—a process only previously assumed from exhumed metamorphic rocks. Dean et al. (p. 207 ) observe an expansive structure in the sea-floor sediment near the location of the 2004 and 2005 Sumatra earthquakes in Indonesia that suggests sediment properties may influence the magnitude of megathrust ruptures and their subsequent tsunamis."
https://openalex.org/W1988290076,"Aphids are one of the most important insect taxa in terms of ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics and genomics, and interactions with endosymbionts. Additionally, many aphids are serious pest species of agricultural and horticultural plants. Recent genetic and genomic research has expanded molecular resources for many aphid species, including the whole genome sequencing of the pea aphid, Acrythosiphon pisum. However, the invasive soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, lacks in any significant molecular resources.Two next-generation sequencing technologies (Roche-454 and Illumina GA-II) were used in a combined approach to develop both transcriptomic and genomic resources, including expressed genes and molecular markers. Over 278 million bp were sequenced among the two methods, resulting in 19,293 transcripts and 56,688 genomic sequences. From this data set, 635 SNPs and 1,382 microsatellite markers were identified. For each sequencing method, different soybean aphid biotypes were used which revealed potential biotype specific markers. In addition, we uncovered 39,822 bp of sequence that were related to the obligatory endosymbiont, Buchnera aphidicola, as well as sequences that suggest the presence of Hamiltonella defensa, a facultative endosymbiont.Molecular resources for an invasive, non-model aphid species were generated. Additionally, the power of next-generation sequencing to uncover endosymbionts was demonstrated. The resources presented here will complement ongoing molecular studies within the Aphididae, including the pea aphid whole genome, lead to better understanding of aphid adaptation and evolution, and help provide novel targets for soybean aphid control."
https://openalex.org/W2137832853,"Even highly mutually beneficial microbial-plant interactions, such as mycorrhizal- and rhizobial-plant exchanges, involve selfishness, cheating and power-struggles between the partners, which depending on prevailing selective pressures, lead to a continuum of interactions from antagonistic to mutualistic. Using manipulated grass-endophyte combinations in a five year common garden experiment, we show that grass genotypes and genetic mismatches constrain genetic combinations between the vertically (via host seeds) transmitted endophytes and the out-crossing host, thereby reducing infections in established grass populations. Infections were lost in both grass tillers and seedlings in F1 and F2 generations, respectively. Experimental plants were collected as seeds from two different environments, i.e., meadows and nearby riverbanks. Endophyte-related benefits to the host included an increased number of inflorescences, but only in meadow plants and not until the last growing season of the experiment. Our results illustrate the importance of genetic host specificity and trans-generational maternal effects on the genetic structure of a host population, which act as destabilizing forces in endophyte-grass symbioses. We propose that (1) genetic mismatches may act as a buffering mechanism against highly competitive endophyte-grass genotype combinations threatening the biodiversity of grassland communities and (2) these mismatches should be acknowledged, particularly in breeding programmes aimed at harnessing systemic and heritable endophytes to improve the agriculturally valuable characteristics of cultivars."

IntroductionThe transforming potential of human Papillomavirus (HPV),4Moscicki A.B. Schiffman M. Kjaer S. Villa L.L. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 42-51Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar first suspected in the 1970s, has now been firmly established both biologically and epidemiologically (1zur Hausen H. Curr. Top.

Vaccine. 2006; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). The single most important variable linked to malignant transformation is persistent infection with one of the high-risk HPV types. The E6 and E7 proteins encoded by high-risk HPVs have transforming activities and functionally inactivate the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor proteins, respectively (3Munoz N. Castellsague X. de Gonzalez A.B. Gissmann L. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 4Moscicki A.B. Schiffman M. Kjaer S. Villa L.L. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 42-51Crossref Scopus (393) Google Scholar). HPV-16 is the most abundant high risk HPV and has been detected in >50% of cervical cancer cases and in most other HPV-induced tumors, such as carcinomas of the vagina, anus, vulva, penis, and oropharynx (3Munoz N. Castellsague X. de Gonzalez A.B. Gissmann L. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 5Longworth M.S. Laimins L.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Virol. 2004; 78: 11451-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Worldwide, high risk HPVs are thought to be responsible for >500,000 malignancies per year, representing more than 5% of human cancers (7Parkin D.M. Bray F. Vaccine. 2006; 24: S3/11-25Google Scholar).A major breakthrough in combating HPV-induced disease was the development of prophylactic vaccines to prevent HPV infection in previously unexposed individuals. These vaccines are based on virus-like particles consisting of the L1 capsid protein (8Berzofsky J.A. Ahlers J.D. Janik J. Morris J. Oh S. Terabe M. Belyakov I.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 450-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 9Lowy D.R. Schiller J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Virus-like particles resemble natural virions and are able to induce high titers of L1-neutralizing antibodies. Two vaccines, one against HPV-16, -18, -6, and -11 and another against HPV-16 and -18, were approved for clinical use in 2006 (10Printz C. Cancer. 2009; 115: 5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 11Ramqvist T. Andreasson K. Dalianis T. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2007; 7: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Vetter K.M. Geller S.E. J. Womens Health. 2007; 16: 1258-1268Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although the impact of prophylactic HPV vaccination on the incidence of vaccine type HPV-associated disease and cancer is unquestionable over time, these vaccines have no therapeutic efficacy for established HPV infections. Antibodies neutralize virus particles only before infection. Moreover, as HPV capsid proteins are exclusively expressed late in the viral replication cycle within the upper layers of the epithelium, immune responses against capsid proteins do not affect persistently infected basal cells and, thus, fail to clear the infection (13Frazer I.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Moreover, high risk HPV-associated cancers generally represent nonproductive infections, and the capsid proteins are not expressed (5Longworth M.S. Laimins L.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 6Minger K. Baldwin A. Edwards K.M. Hayakawa H. Nguyen C.L. Owens M. Grace M. Huh K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11451-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). For these reasons, viral capsid based strategies are not useful in the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines.HPV-16 infection is widespread in the sexually active population, but >95% of infections are either transient and/or cleared by the immune system (13Frazer I.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Regression of lesions has been shown to be dependent on strong localized cell-mediated immune responses. In particular, antigen-specific T cell-mediated immunity is required for the clearance of persistent high-risk HPV infections (14Stanley M. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 16-22Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Hence, the immune system is capable of terminating high risk HPV-associated lesions and tumors. Therapeutic vaccines aimed to induce targeted T cell-mediated immune responses against dysplastic and neoplastic cells, therefore, seem a logical extension for achieving beneficial clinical results. Given that E6 and E7 are consistently expressed in HPV-associated cancers, these proteins themselves represent promising targets for vaccine design. Although most tumor-specific antigens are derived from normal or mutated endogenous self-proteins (15Boon T. Coulie P.G. Van den Eynde B. Immunol Today. 1997; 18: 267-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) (TANTIGEN: Tumor T cell Antigen Database), E6 and E7 are foreign viral antigens. These two proteins are required for the induction and maintenance of the malignant phenotype of high-risk HPV-associated cancer cells (5Longworth M.S. Laimins L.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 362-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 6Minger K. Baldwin A. Edwards K.M. Hayakawa H. Nguyen C.L. Owens M. Grace M. Huh K. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 11451-11460Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and because HPV uses the cellular DNA replication machinery for genome synthesis, the mutation rate of HPV proteins is low. Thus, it is unlikely that HPV will evade immune attack through loss or mutation of the E6 and/or E7 gene products (16Devaraj K. Gillison M.L. Wu T.C. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 2003; 14: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Studies on therapeutic vaccines, therefore, have mostly focused on E6 and E7 as target antigens. To date these targets have been delivered as naked DNA vaccines, with recombinant viral or bacterial vectors, as protein or peptide vaccines, and as fusion constructs with toll-like receptor agonists or proteins that enhance antigen delivery or presentation (for review, see Refs. 13Frazer I.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 17Leggatt G.R. Frazer I.H. Curr. Opin.

Most clinical studies have been performed using DNA vaccines. These include a DNA HPV-16 E7 vaccine that has been tested with various fusion partners to enhance antigen presentation and with another DNA vaccine encoding E6 and E7 peptides from HPV-16 and -18 (for review, see Ref. 19Peng S.

Live viral vectors also have been tested in the clinic, with vaccinia virus constructs coding for either bovine Papillomavirus E2 (20García-Hernández E. González-Sánchez J.L. Andrade-Manzano A.

Such studies, however, have yielded disappointing clinical responses.For induction of HPV-specific T lymphocytes in a focused manner, vaccination against defined epitopes is an attractive option. Indeed, various MHC class I-restricted CTL epitopes of HPV-16 E6 and E7 have been tested in early phase clinical studies (28Kast W.M. Brandt R.M. Drijfhout J.W. Melief C.J. J. Immunother.

Nonetheless, little or no benefit over historic controls has been observed. Recently, multiple long synthetic peptide fragments of E6 and E7 have been used to create a polyepitope vaccine, which when tested in patients with HPV-16-positive vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, exhibited promising clinical efficacy (35Kenter G.G. Welters M.J. Valentijn A.R. Lowik M.J. Berends-van der Meer D.M. Vloon A.P. Essahsah F. Fathers L.M. Offringa R. Drijfhout J.W. Wafelman A.R. Oostendorp J. Fleuren G.J. van der Burg S.H. Melief C.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 1838-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). This type of vaccination-induced clinical response has been the most efficacious to date and argues that a robust outcome can be engendered by peptides in conventional adjuvants.One of the key practical challenges to specific epitope-based vaccines to stimulate cytotoxic T lymphocytes stems from the fundamental nature of T cell receptor (TCR)-based recognition. TCR recognition is referred to as MHC-restricted as, unlike antibody-based recognition, a TCR physiologically interacts with a peptide in complex with an MHC molecule (pMHC) (for review, see Refs. 36Rudolph M.G. Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 24: 419-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar and 37Wang J.H. Reinherz E.L. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Further complexity to TCR-based recognition is that a given peptide binds to some but not all MHC molecules. Each human being expresses 3–6 MHC class I molecules (so-called HLA molecules) and at least as many MHC class II molecules. More than 3000 variants of human MHC class I and 1000 variants of MHC class II have been characterized throughout the world to date (38Robinson J. Waller M.J. Fail S.C. McWilliam H. Lopez R. Parham P. Marsh S.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D1013-D1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cytotoxic T cell recognition of foreign protein antigens occurs via short (generally 9–10 amino acids long) peptides produced through proteolytic cleavage in the cytoplasmic proteasome complex. These are subsequently transported into the endoplasmic reticulum, bound to MHC class I molecules and ultimately displayed on the cell surface as a pMHC. The viral pMHC serves as a flag to target an infected or transformed cell for destruction by a CTL.Bioinformatic approaches are important tools for peptide-based vaccines and immunotherapy. Computational methods now offer accuracies that are useful in reducing the number of potential candidate peptides that must be tested experimentally for binding to a given MHC allele (39Brusic V. August J.T. Petrovsky N. Expert Rev. Vaccines. 2005; 4: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40De Groot A.S. Berzofsky J.A. Methods. 2004; 34: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 41Purcell A.W. McCluskey J. Rossjohn J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 404-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In silico methods cannot predict, however, which MHC class I-binding peptides are actually processed and displayed on a cell surface. We have developed an MS3 Poisson detection mass spectrometry approach to directly assess the physical presence of predicted CTL target epitopes on tumors and infected cells. Our “predict/detect” method achieves sensitivities comparable with that of a T cell with a dynamic range of one peptide among 100,000 pMHCs displayed per cell.Here for the first time we have interrogated the MHC class I peptide array of several HLA-A*0201 HPV-16-transformed epithelial tumor cells for the presence of any and all predicted HLA-A*0201-binding E6- and E7-derived peptides. Among E6 and E7 proteins, only a single 9-mer epitope was found on all HPV-16 transformants tested. This conserved peptide, termed E711–19, is predicted to have the capacity to bind to the vast majority of globally distributed A2 alleles (100 of 116 HLA-A2 alleles). We suggest that the lack of prior clinical effectiveness of targeted CTL epitope vaccination (32van Driel W.J. Ressing M.E. Kenter G.G. Brandt R.M. Krul E.J. van Rossum A.B. Schuuring E. Offringa R. Bauknecht T. Tamm-Hermelink A. van Dam P.A. Fleuren G.J. Kast W.M. Melief C.J. Trimbos J.B. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 946-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) is a consequence of misidentification of peptides displayed on tumor cells because of the use of indirect immunological surrogates (killing, proliferation, cytokine production, etc.) to judge T cell epitope expression. Our results offer a direct path to select allele-specific targets that should afford tumor protection to a broad population of patients.DISCUSSIONHPV-induced dysplasia and cancer cause significant morbidity worldwide (7Parkin D.M. Bray F. Vaccine. 2006; 24: S3/11-25Google Scholar). Although prophylactic vaccines are now available, immunization does not reach everyone at risk. Given that HPV-associated cancers develop years and often decades after initial infection, it was predicted that no measurable decline of HPV-associated cancers in women may occur before 2040. This prediction was based upon higher acceptance rates for the vaccines than is currently achieved in the United States (for review, see Ref. 13Frazer I.H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the approved prophylactic vaccines have no therapeutic effects (54Schiller J.T. Castellsague X. Villa L.L. Hildesheim A. Vaccine. 2008; 26: K53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), leaving HPV-infected individuals in need of treatment options. Fortunately, most HPV infections are cleared naturally by the immune system (14Stanley M. Vaccine. 2006; 24: 16-22Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). If the lesions do not regress, surgical treatments are necessary. These procedures are associated with significant morbidity ranging from dysfunction to infertility depending on the site and stage of the lesion. A noninvasive treatment such as a therapeutic vaccine fostering an effective anti-HPV state would be an attractive alternative. A vaccine could be offered to patients who do not clear HPV infection spontaneously during a finite observation period as well as to patients with established lesions.HPV-related diseases represent an ideal set of clinical disorders to test development of a therapeutic cancer vaccine as the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 are consistently expressed in HPV-associated cancers (16Devaraj K. Gillison M.L. Wu T.C. Crit. Rev. Oral. Biol. Med. 2003; 14: 345-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and they represent “non-self” cancer antigens. Given their key role in cancerous transformation, a large body of research focusing on E6 and E7 as therapeutic vaccine targets has been conducted. Multiple MHC class I- and class II-restricted epitopes, mostly of HPV-16 and HPV-18, have been reported (19Peng S. Trimble C. Wu L. Pardoll D. Roden R. Hung C.F. Wu T.C. Clin.

Although induction of peptide-specific T cell responses could be demonstrated in these studies, no clinical improvements exceeding the rate of spontaneous tumor regression were observed.The lack of clinical impact was thought to be a consequence of an advanced stage of disease in the patient groups. However, as there is evidence that HPV infection influences antigen presentation, this lack of success might be caused by a paucity (or even absence) of epitopes presented on HPV-16-transformed cells. In this regard several HPV immune evasion mechanisms have been described (for review, see Refs. 70Tindle R.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 71Kanodia S. Fahey L.M. Kast W.M. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2007; 7: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 72Stanley M.A. Pett M.R. Coleman N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 1456-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) including down-regulation of components of the antigen-processing machinery and MHC class I molecules (73Georgopoulos N.T. Proffitt J.L. Blair G.E. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4930-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 74Brady C.S. Bartholomew J.S. Burt D.J. Duggan-Keen M.F. Glenville S. Telford N. Little A.M. Davidson J.A. Jimenez P. Ruiz-Cabello F. Garrido F. Stern P.L. Tissue Antigens. 2000; 55: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), resulting in decreased presentation of antigenic peptides. Furthermore, precise and direct identification of T cell epitopes expressed on HPV-transformed cells has been lacking. Instead, determination of relevant epitopes has been inferred by bioinformatic prediction, synthetic peptide HLA binding studies, and peripheral T cell functional activation readouts employing various immunologic assays. However, because the success of a therapeutic vaccine is dependent on accurate identification of HPV epitopes displayed as pMHC on HPV-infected target cells or HPV-transformed tumor cells, it is essential to define HPV-16 E6 and E7 T cell epitopes that are naturally processed and presented on the surface of virally altered cells. Only those HPV peptide/MHC class I complexes are capable of being recognized by cytolytic T lymphocytes to target destruction of transformed cells.To this end, we have developed a new methodology, nanospray MS3 Poisson detection mass spectrometry. This methodology works by filtering the ion beam through two stages of mass selection and fragmentation (generating MS3 spectra) and detecting a target molecule by a probabilistic measure of the target's known dissociation patterns in the MS3 spectra. The methodology combines instrumental and ionization optimizations in a detection mode format to provide a high dynamic range from limited sample amounts. An instrumental geometry in which a quadrupole filter is placed in front of an ion trap (QTrap 4000) achieves a high duty cycle for MS3 spectra. Static nanospray avoids losses from surface exposure associated with chromatography and in its low (a few nanoliters per minute) flow, an optimal conversion of molecules in the condensed phase into gas phase ions.Our findings are that none of the clinically targeted A2 peptides employed in epitope-based T cell vaccines to date could be detected on HPV-16-transformed cell lines tested herein. Two examples of this discordance are of particular note. The E786–93 peptide has been previously reported to be by far the best HLA-A*0201-binding peptide derived from HPV-16 (46Kast W.M. Brandt R.M. Sidney J. Drijfhout J.W. Kubo R.T. Grey H.M. Melief C.J. Sette A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3904-3912PubMed Google Scholar).

When subcellular organellar mass was estimated with organelle-specific fluorescence dyes, we observed that most membranous organelles progressively increase in mass during cell senescence. This increase was accompanied by an increase in membrane lipids and augmented expression of lipogenic enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase (FAS), ATP citrate lyase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The mature form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 was also elevated. Increased expression of these lipogenic effectors was further observed in the liver tissues of aging Fischer 344 rats. Ectopic expression of mature form of SREBP-1 in both Chang cells and primary young human diploid fibroblasts was enough to induce senescence. Blocking lipogenesis with FAS inhibitors (cerulenin and C75) and via siRNA-mediated silencing of SREBP-1 and ATP citrate lyase significantly attenuated H2O2-induced senescence. Finally, old human diploid fibroblasts were effectively reversed to young-like cells by challenging with FAS inhibitors. Our results suggest that enhanced lipogenesis is not only a common event, but also critically involved in senescence via SREBP-1 induction, thereby contributing to the increase in organelle mass (as a part of cell mass), a novel indicator of senescence.

https://openalex.org/W2033952499,"Methamphetamine (METH) is an addictive psychostimulant whose societal impact is on the rise. Emerging evidence suggests that psychostimulants alter synaptic plasticity in the brain—which may partly account for their adverse effects. While it is known that METH increases the extracellular concentration of monoamines dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, it is not clear how METH alters glutamatergic transmission. Within this context, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of acute and systemic METH on basal synaptic transmission and long-term potentiation (LTP; an activity-induced increase in synaptic efficacy) in CA1 sub-field in the hippocampus. Both the acute ex vivo application of METH to hippocampal slices and systemic administration of METH decreased LTP. Interestingly, the acute ex vivo application of METH at a concentration of 30 or 60 µM increased baseline synaptic transmission as well as decreased LTP. Pretreatment with eticlopride (D2-like receptor antagonist) did not alter the effects of METH on synaptic transmission or LTP. In contrast, pretreatment with D1/D5 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 or 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN-190 abrogated the effect of METH on synaptic transmission. Furthermore, METH did not increase baseline synaptic transmission in D1 dopamine receptor haploinsufficient mice. Our findings suggest that METH affects excitatory synaptic transmission via activation of dopamine and serotonin receptor systems in the hippocampus.

https://openalex.org/W1979144895,"Thyroid hormone (TR) and liver X (LXR) receptors are transcription factors involved in lipogenesis. Both receptors recognize the same consensus DNA-response element in vitro. It was previously shown that their signaling pathways interact in the control of cholesterol elimination in the liver. In the present study, carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP), a major transcription factor controlling the activation of glucose-induced lipogenesis in liver, is characterized as a direct target of thyroid hormones (TH) in liver and white adipose tissue (WAT), the two main lipogenic tissues in mice. Using genetic and molecular approaches, ChREBP is shown to be specifically regulated by TRbeta but not by TRalpha in vivo, even in WAT where both TR isoforms are expressed. However, this isotype specificity is not found in vitro. This TRbeta specific regulation correlates with the loss of TH-induced lipogenesis in TRbeta(-/-) mice. Fasting/refeeding experiments show that TRbeta is not required for the activation of ChREBP expression particularly marked in WAT following refeeding. However, TH can stimulate ChREBP expression in WAT even under fasting conditions, suggesting completely independent pathways. Because ChREBP has been described as an LXR target, the interaction of LXR and TRbeta in ChREBP regulation was assayed both in vitro and in vivo. Each receptor recognizes a different response element on the ChREBP promoter, located only 8 bp apart. There is a cross-talk between LXR and TRbeta signaling on the ChREBP promoter in liver but not in WAT where LXR does not regulate ChREBP expression. The molecular basis for this cross-talk has been determined in in vitro systems."
https://openalex.org/W2022008267,"Understanding stopover decisions of long-distance migratory birds is crucial for conservation and management of these species along their migratory flyway. Recently, an increasing number of Barnacle geese breeding in the Russian Arctic have delayed their departure from their wintering site in The Netherlands by approximately one month and have reduced their staging duration at stopover sites in the Baltic accordingly. Consequently, this extended stay increases agricultural damage in The Netherlands. Using a dynamic state variable approach we explored three hypotheses about the underlying causes of these changes in migratory behavior, possibly related to changes in (i) onset of spring, (ii) potential intake rates and (iii) predation danger at wintering and stopover sites. Our simulations showed that the observed advance in onset of spring contradicts the observed delay of departure, whereas both increased predation danger and decreased intake rates in the Baltic can explain the delay. Decreased intake rates are expected as a result of increased competition for food in the growing Barnacle goose population. However, the effect of predation danger in the model was particularly strong, and we hypothesize that Barnacle geese avoid Baltic stopover sites as a response to the rapidly increasing number of avian predators in the area. Therefore, danger should be considered as an important factor influencing Barnacle goose migratory behavior, and receive more attention in empirical studies."

LptD inserts lipopolysaccharides in the OM. It is also the only β-barrel protein with more than two cysteine residues. We found that surAdsbC mutants, but not skpdsbC mutants, exhibit a synthetic phenotype. They have a decreased OM integrity, which is due to the lack of the isomerase activity of DsbC. We also isolated DsbC in a mixed disulfide complex with LptD. As such, LptD is identified as the first substrate of DsbC that is localized in the OM.

https://openalex.org/W2036765075,"C1qs are key components of the classical complement pathway. They have been well documented in human and mammals, but little is known about their molecular and functional characteristics in fish. In the present study, full-length cDNAs of c1qA, c1qB, and c1qC from zebrafish (Danio rerio) were cloned, revealing the conservation of their chromosomal synteny and organization between zebrafish and other species. For functional analysis, the globular heads of C1qA (ghA), C1qB (ghB), and C1qC (ghC) were expressed in Escherichia coli as soluble proteins. Hemolytic inhibitory assays showed that hemolytic activity in carp serum can be inhibited significantly by anti-C1qA, -C1qB, and -C1qC of zebrafish, respectively, indicating that C1qA, C1qB, and C1qC are involved in the classical pathway and are conserved functionally from fish to human. Zebrafish C1qs also could specifically bind to heat-aggregated zebrafish IgM, human IgG, and IgM. The involvement of globular head modules in the C1q-dependent classical pathway demonstrates the structural and functional conservation of these molecules in the classical pathway and their IgM or IgG binding sites during evolution. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that c1qA, c1qB, and c1qC may be formed by duplications of a single copy of c1qB and that the C1q family is, evolutionarily, closely related to the Emu family. This study improves current understanding of the evolutionary history of the C1q family and C1q-mediated immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2049941552,"In many songbirds the larger vocal repertoire of males is associated with sexual dimorphism of the vocal control centers and muscles of the vocal organ, the syrinx. However, it is largely unknown how these differences are translated into different acoustic behavior.Here we show that the sound generating structures of the syrinx, the labia and the associated cartilaginous framework, also display sexual dimorphism. One of the bronchial half rings that position and tense the labia is larger in males, and the size and shape of the labia differ between males and females. The functional consequences of these differences were explored by denervating syringeal muscles. After denervation, both sexes produced equally low fundamental frequencies, but the driving pressure generally increased and was higher in males. Denervation strongly affected the relationship between driving pressure and fundamental frequency.The syringeal modifications in the male syrinx, in concert with dimorphisms in neural control and muscle mass, are most likely the foundation for the potential to generate an enhanced frequency range. Sexually dimorphic vocal behavior therefore arises from finely tuned modifications at every level of the motor cascade. This sexual dimorphism in frequency control illustrates a significant evolutionary step towards increased vocal complexity in birds."
https://openalex.org/W1978634130,"Although cloned embryos generated by somatic/embryonic stem cell nuclear transfer (SECNT) certainly give rise to viable individuals, they can often undergo embryonic arrest at any stage of embryogenesis, leading to diverse morphological abnormalities. In an effort to gain further insights into reprogramming and the properties of SECNT embryos, we performed a large-scale gene expression profiling of 87 single blastocysts using GeneChip microarrays. Sertoli cells, cumulus cells, and embryonic stem cells were used as donor cells. The gene expression profiles of 87 blastocysts were subjected to microarray analysis. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, the gene expression profiles were clearly classified into 3 clusters corresponding to the type of donor cell. The results revealed that each type of SECNT embryo had a unique gene expression profile that was strictly dependent upon the type of donor cells, although there was considerable variation among the individual profiles within each group. This suggests that the reprogramming process is distinct for embryos cloned from different types of donor cells. Furthermore, on the basis of the results of comparison analysis, we identified 35 genes that were inappropriately reprogrammed in most of the SECNT embryos; our findings demonstrated that some of these genes, such as Asz1, Xlr3a and App, were appropriately reprogrammed only in the embryos with a transcriptional profile that was the closest to that of the controls. Our findings provide a framework to further understand the reprogramming in SECNT embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2072856670,"Despite great functional diversity, characterization of the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold proteins that encompass a superfamily of hydrolases, heterophilic adhesion proteins, and chaperone domains reveals a common structural motif. By incorporating the R451C mutation found in neuroligin (NLGN) and associated with autism and the thyroglobulin G2320R (G221R in NLGN) mutation responsible for congenital hypothyroidism into NLGN3, we show that mutations in the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold domain influence folding and biosynthetic processing of neuroligin3 as determined by in vitro susceptibility to proteases, glycosylation processing, turnover, and processing rates. We also show altered interactions of the mutant proteins with chaperones in the endoplasmic reticulum and arrest of transport along the secretory pathway with diversion to the proteasome. Time-controlled expression of a fluorescently tagged neuroligin in hippocampal neurons shows that these mutations compromise neuronal trafficking of the protein, with the R451C mutation reducing and the G221R mutation virtually abolishing the export of NLGN3 from the soma to the dendritic spines. Although the R451C mutation causes a local folding defect, the G221R mutation appears responsible for more global misfolding of the protein, reflecting their sequence positions in the structure of the protein. Our results suggest that disease-related mutations in the alpha/beta-hydrolase fold domain share common trafficking deficiencies yet lead to discrete congenital disorders of differing severity in the endocrine and nervous systems."

By comparing seismic reflection profiles with microearthquake distributions in central Japan, we show that repeating microearthquakes occur along the bottom interface of the layer peeling off from the subducting Philippine Sea plate. This region coincides with the location of slow-slip events that may serve as signals for monitoring active underplating."
https://openalex.org/W1997113406,"Background The current therapy of malignant gliomas is based on surgical resection, radio-chemotherapy and chemotherapy. Recent retrospective case-series have highlighted the significance of the extent of resection as a prognostic factor predicting the course of the disease. Complete resection in low-grade gliomas that show no MRI-enhanced images are especially difficult. The aim in this study was to develop a robust, specific, new fluorescent probe for glioma cells that is easy to apply to live tumor biopsies and could identify tumor cells from normal brain cells at all levels of magnification. Methodology/Principal Findings In this investigation we employed brightly fluorescent, photostable quantum dots (QDs) to specifically target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is upregulated in many gliomas. Living glioma and normal cells or tissue biopsies were incubated with QDs coupled to EGF and/or monoclonal antibodies against EGFR for 30 minutes, washed and imaged. The data include results from cell-culture, animal model and ex vivo human tumor biopsies of both low-grade and high-grade gliomas and show high probe specificity. Tumor cells could be visualized from the macroscopic to single cell level with contrast ratios as high as 1000: 1 compared to normal brain tissue. Conclusions/Significance The ability of the targeted probes to clearly distinguish tumor cells in low-grade tumor biopsies, where no enhanced MRI image was obtained, demonstrates the great potential of the method. We propose that future application of specifically targeted fluorescent particles during surgery could allow intraoperative guidance for the removal of residual tumor cells from the resection cavity and thus increase patient survival."

Additional iron could restore bacterial growth in human serum. The observation that other important Gram-positive pathogens are not inhibited by transferrin suggests they have evolved effective mechanisms to circumvent serum iron deprivation.

The Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis can infect humans and is notorious for its potential as a biological weapon (1Dixon T.C. Meselson M. Guillemin J. Hanna P.C. Anthrax N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Depending on the route of infection, B. anthracis causes respiratory, cutaneous, or gastrointestinal anthrax (2Friedlander A.M. Curr. Clin. Topics Inf. Dis. 2000; 20: 335-349PubMed Google Scholar). The most lethal form, respiratory anthrax, is caused by inhalation of dormant bacterial spores, which are taken up by alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells. These spores can germinate within macrophages and hijack them for transport of vegetative bacilli to the lymph nodes. Subsequent spread into the bloodstream often results in sepsis and death (1Dixon T.C. Meselson M. Guillemin J. Hanna P.C. Anthrax N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). The ability to divide within macrophages without inducing an inflammatory reaction depends on the plasmid-encoded tripartite anthrax toxin (pXO1) that blocks intracellular signaling in immune cells (3Baldari C.T.

Intradermal inoculation with B. anthracis spores results in cutaneous anthrax, a milder infection that normally remains localized and resolves spontaneously (6Mayer-Scholl A. Hurwitz R. Brinkmann V.

Recent studies have demonstrated that cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides, expressed by epithelial cells and phagocytes, are also an important component the innate immune response that targets B. anthracis (8McGillivray S.M.

Complement-depleted or C5-deficient mice are much more susceptible to infection with B. anthracis (10Harvill E.T. Lee G. Grippe V.K. Merkel T.J. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4420-4422Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the poly-γ-d glutamic acid capsule (pXO2) makes B. anthracis highly resistant to complement-dependent clearance (11Welkos S.L. Keener T.J. Gibbs P.H. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 795-800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we discover that serum also provides resistance to anthrax propagation via a complement-independent mechanism. In contrast to other Gram-positive pathogens, we find that B. anthracis does not grow in the presence of human serum. We determine that serum resistance is provided by transferrin, identifying a novel antibacterial function of this human iron homeostasis protein. B. anthracis Sterne (pXO1+pXO2-) strains 34F2 and 7702 are both derived from the original Sterne strain isolated by Max Sterne in the 1930's. This strain was subsequently cultivated in different laboratories for many years. B. anthracis Sterne strain 7702, originally from the Pasteur Institute collection (12Cataldi A. Labruyère E. Mock M.

B. anthracis Sterne strain 34F2 and B. anthracis Ames were from the USAMRIID collection. B. anthracis was propagated on Todd Hewitt agar (THA) plates and grown under aerobic conditions at 30 °C; for liquid cultures, bacteria were grown in TH broth (THB) at 37 °C.

Mitchell (University of Glasgow) and was cultured directly from glycerol stock in Brain-Heart Infusion broth. Blood was drawn from healthy human volunteers after informed consent and serum was collected. Normal human serum (nhs) was prepared by pooling sera of 6 different donors and stored at −80 °C.

Bacterial cultures were grown to post-log phase in THB media and diluted 1:10,000 in RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). 50 μl of bacteria were mixed with 50 μl RPMI (untreated controls), serum or transferrin (both diluted in RPMI) in 96-well plates. Iron(III) citrate was obtained from Sigma. Plates were incubated at 37 °C under continuous shaking and surviving bacteria were enumerated by plating serial dilutions on THA. Growth index was calculated as the ratio of bacterial colony forming units (cfu) surviving after incubation versus the initial inoculum. Relative growth was used when growth of B. anthracis was compared with different bacteria (S. aureus, S. pneumonia, GAS, and GBS); in this case growth in buffer alone (RPMI) was set at 100%. Heat-inactivated serum (250 μl) was separated on a Superdex-200 GL 10/300 (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) equilibrated with RPMI 1640 (flow 1 ml/min), and 1-ml fractions were collected. The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (670 kDa), gamma globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B12 (1.4 kDa). Fractions were incubated with 500 cfu of B. anthracis Sterne 7702 and grown overnight at 37 °C. Overnight cultures were subcultured in THB and grown for 7 h after which A600 was assessed. Gel filtration fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Transferrin was detected using peroxidase-labeled goat-anti-transferrin antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). The Trfhpx/hpx mice, maintained on a BALBc/J background, were produced and housed as described previously (16Trenor 3rd, C.C. Campagna D.R. Sellers V.M. Andrews N.C. Fleming M.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trfhpx/hpx mice were treated with weekly intraperitoneal injections of 6 mg of human Trf (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) until weaning. Serum was collected from female mice at 8 weeks of age, when all injected transferrin is degraded. Student's t test analysis was performed using the Microsoft Excel Software. While studying the role of humoral blood components in the defense against Gram-positive pathogens, we observed that growth of B. anthracis Sterne is strongly impaired in the presence of normal human serum (Fig. 1A). In contrast, serum did not affect growth of S. aureus nor S. pneumoniae. The two Sterne strains showed similar growth inhibition at 1% serum but B. anthracis Sterne 7702 was more sensitive at 5% serum. This difference may be due to the fact that these two strains have been cultured under different conditions for many years. Growth inhibition of B. anthracis was dose-dependent and complete at serum concentrations of 1% or higher (Fig. 1B). Serum was bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal to B. anthracis, since the initial bacterial inoculum did not decrease in its presence. Although Gram-positive bacteria have a thick peptidoglycan layer that makes them resistant to complement lysis, we wondered whether bacteriostasis could be complement-dependent. Heat-inactivated serum could still inhibit growth of B. anthracis Sterne, although the activity was somewhat lower than in normal serum (Fig. 1C). This finding suggests that complement contributes to the growth inhibitory effect, but that serum contains another component that blocks growth of anthrax bacilli. To identify the serum component that inhibits growth of B. anthracis, we fractionated heat-inactivated human serum by gel filtration chromatography and analyzed collected fractions for their ability to block growth of B. anthracis (Fig. 2A). We found that the bacteriostatic activity eluted from the column in a single wide peak, indicative of a single protein. The active protein was estimated to have a molecular weight between ∼15–150 kDa (Fig. 2A). (Moderate growth inhibition seen in fractions smaller than 1 kDa can most likely be attributed to high salt). Because the iron regulator human transferrin has a molecular mass of 80 kDa and is relatively abundant in serum (2–4 mg/ml) (17Williams J. Moreton K. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), we tested for the presence of transferrin in the eluted fractions. Immunoblotting with anti-transferrin antibodies shows that transferrin was indeed present in fractions with bacteriostatic activity (Fig. 2A). To confirm that human transferrin indeed causes bacteriostasis of B. anthracis, we incubated purified apo-transferrin with B. anthracis and monitored growth over time. Purified apo-transferrin completely inhibited growth of B. anthracis Sterne 34F2 at concentrations of 10 μg/ml and higher (Fig. 2B). Because B. anthracis strain Sterne is an attenuated, pXO2-minus strain, we also determined whether apo-transferrin affected growth of the fully virulent pXO2-positive Ames strain. Fig. 2C shows that apo-transferrin effectively blocked growth of the Ames strain as well. To show that transferrin is the bacteriostatic component in serum, we studied bacterial growth in serum of hypotransferrinemic (Trfhpx/hpx) mice that carry a spontaneous mutation in the murine transferrin (Trf) locus. These mice have only 1% circulating transferrin levels (16Trenor 3rd, C.C. Campagna D.R. Sellers V.M. Andrews N.C. Fleming M.D. Blood. 2000; 96: 1113-1118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to serum of wild-type mice, we observed that serum of hypotransferrinemic mice could not block growth of B. anthracis (Fig. 2D). We could restore the inhibitory effect by supplementing hypotransferrinemic serum with purified human apo-transferrin. Taken together, these data show that the iron homeostasis protein transferrin blocks growth of B. anthracis in serum. In normal persons, only ∼30% of transferrin in serum is in complex with iron (holo-transferrin), leaving a pool of transferrin with no iron, ∼40% (apo-transferrin) (17Williams J. Moreton K. Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To study whether iron binding by transferrin is important for B. anthracis growth inhibition, we compared growth in the presence of these naturally occurring forms of transferrin. We observed a dose-dependent growth inhibition by apo-transferrin, whereas growth was not affected by holo-transferrin (Fig. 3A). These data strongly suggest that transferrin blocks growth by iron sequestration. However, in the case of Gram-negative bacteria, transferrin has also been suggested to directly injure the bacterial outer membrane (18Aguilera O. Quiros L.M. Fierro J.F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Ellison 3rd, R.T. Giehl T.J. LaForce F.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2774-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because holo-transferrin has a different conformation than apo-transferrin (20Jeffrey P.D. Bewley M.C. MacGillivray R. Mason A.B. Woodworth R.C. Baker E.N.

However, we studied the anti-bacterial mechanism in more detail by analyzing growth in the presence of a recombinant apo-transferrin mutant that does not bind iron, but has the same conformation as wild-type apo-transferrin (15Mason A.B.

Fig. 3B shows that, in contrast to recombinant apo-transferrin, the iron-binding mutant did not block growth of B. anthracis Sterne. Also, recombinant holo-transferrin showed no bacteriostatic activity. Furthermore we showed that growth of B. anthracis in human serum could be restored by supplementation with additional iron (Fig. 3C). Collectively these data show that transferrin effectively blocks the growth of B. anthracis by depriving the bacilli from acquiring the iron that they need to grow. Because our initial experiments in human serum showed that S. aureus and S. pneumoniae could resist the bacteriostatic effects of serum, we re-tested the growth of these and other Gram-positive bacteria in the presence of purified apo-transferrin. Growth of all tested pathogens was unaffected by purified apo-transferrin (Fig. 3D), indicating that they have evolved mechanisms to circumvent the iron scavenging effects of human transferrin. The human innate immune system provides an essential first-line of defense against bacterial infections and is endowed with both cellular and humoral components that eradicate infectious organisms within minutes (22Beutler B. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 845-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In addition to directly killing the infectious organism, a common host defense strategy is to limit growth of the bacterium through deprivation of essential nutrients. The human protein lactoferrin, found at mucosal surfaces and inside neutrophil granules, has been characterized to play a role in host defense by iron sequestration and limitation of bacterial growth (23Legrand D. Pierce A. Elass E. Carpentier M. Mariller C. Mazurier J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2008; 606: 163-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 24Valenti P. Antonini G. Cell. Mol. Life. Sci. 2005; 62: 2576-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In addition, lactoferrin damages bacterial membranes directly via its highly cationic N terminus that inserts into bacterial membranes (25González-Chávez S.A. Arévalo-Gallegos S. Rascón-Cruz Q. Int. J. Antimicrob. Agents. 2009; 33: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 26Bellamy W. Takase M. Yamauchi K. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Transferrin, the serum-homologue of lactoferrin, is well-known for its role in iron homeostasis (27De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Kaplan J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 9: 72-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Transferrin has a high avidity for iron (10−23 m), which ensures effective iron chelation and prevents iron-dependent formation of hydroxyl radicals. Transferrin is comprised of two homologous lobes, each of which binds ferric iron deep in a cleft. Structural studies revealed that iron-bound and iron-free transferrin are conformationally different since iron binding induces large conformational rearrangements (21Wally J. Halbrooks P.J.

Harrison S.C. Walz T. Cell. 2004; 116: 565-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Some studies (performed in the 1970–1980s) theorized that transferrin could also be an important anti-bacterial molecule, but its exact role in controlling infections remained ill-defined (29Oram J.D. Reiter B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 170: 351-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 30Bullen J.J. Ward C.G. Wallis S.N. Infect. Immun. 1974; 10: 443-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Valenti P. Antonini G. Fanelli M.R. Orsi N. Antonini E. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 1982; 21: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For instance, it was not established whether the antibacterial activity was caused by iron deprivation or direct lysis (31Valenti P. Antonini G. Fanelli M.R. Orsi N. Antonini E. Antimicrob. Agents. Chemother. 1982; 21: 840-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 32Bezkorovainy A. Adv. Exp. Med Biol. 1981; 135: 139-154PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that transferrin directly damages and alters the permeability of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (18Aguilera O. Quiros L.M. Fierro J.F. FEBS Lett. 2003; 548: 5-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Ellison 3rd, R.T. Giehl T.J. LaForce F.M. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 2774-2781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) even though the molecule lacks a cationic domain (33Wally J. Buchanan S.K. Biometals. 2007; 20: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using recombinant forms of the molecule, we show for the first time that transferrin inhibits the growth of a bacterial pathogen, in this case the potentially lethal anthrax bacillus, through iron deprivation. Because the iron-binding mutant form of transferrin has the same conformation as apo-transferrin, we can exclude that conformational differences (as occur in the holo versus apo forms) play a role in the lack of activity. Our observation that expression of the poly-γ-d-glutamic acid capsule could not protect bacilli from transferrin-mediated growth inhibition is consistent with the idea that membrane-targeting effects are less likely to play a role. Pathogens have found ways to counteract innate immune defenses to antimicrobial peptides, complement and phagocyte responses (34Foster T.J. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar, 35Nizet V. J. Allergy Clin Immunol. 2007; 120: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Many bacteria have also evolved iron uptake systems that allow them to specifically use host iron sources such as heme or transferrin (36Krewulak K.D. Vogel H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1781-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). For instance, bacteria produce iron chelators that compete with transferrin (37Cornelissen C.N. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: d836-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Among Gram-positive species, only S. aureus is known to express such a molecule: the staphylococcal transferrin-binding protein A (39Taylor J.M. Heinrichs D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observe that S. aureus grows even better in the presence of purified transferrin than in its absence. Our studies indicate that S. pneumoniae is also resistant to the antibacterial effects of transferrin in serum. Whereas the normal ecology of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae involves asymptomatic colonization of human mucosal surfaces, B. anthracis exists in the soil causing a zoonotic infection and only accidentally infects humans, perhaps explaining why it has not evolved transferrin resistance mechanism. In addition, many of the described bacterial iron-uptake systems are highly host-specific. Even though B. anthracis is known to express siderophores, small molecules that chelate iron (40Abergel R.J. Wilson M.K. Arceneaux J.E. Hoette T.M. Strong R.K. Byers B.R. Raymond K.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18499-18503Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we observe that under the relevant physiological conditions (human serum at 37 °C) that we used these molecules are not effective in competing with transferrin in human serum. The sensitivity of B. anthracis to human transferrin could provide an explanation for the observed differences in disease severity between B. anthracis introduced via the skin or the lungs. Anthrax spores that enter the body via the skin have been shown to germinate extracellularly, which allows serum proteins in interstitial tissue fluids to interact with the bacteria and control the infection (41Bischof T.S. Hahn B.L. Sohnle P.G. J. Infect Dis. 2007; 195: 888-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Rossing N. Worm A.M. Clin. Physiol. 1981; 1: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast, inhaled spores are quickly phagocytosed by macrophages in which they germinate intracellularly. In this case, bacilli are protected from serum resistance factors allowing them to initially grow unimpeded, multiply rapidly and potentially cause an overwhelming systemic infection. In conclusion, although the antibacterial properties of transferrin are not generally appreciated, our data show that transferrin is a critical host defense molecule that controls growth of B. anthracis in human serum. We thank Pauline Macheboef and Partho Ghosh for practical assistance and Robert Mak for providing anti-transferrin antibodies."

Maternal distress was measured 6 months postpartum by 9 items covering anxiety, depression and stress. Outcome was childhood overweight at 7-years-of age. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed and information on maternal age, socioeconomic status, pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain, parity, smoking during pregnancy, paternal BMI, birth weight, gestational age at birth, sex, breastfeeding and finally infant weight at 5 and 12 month were included in the analyses.We found, that postpartum distress was not associated with childhood risk of overweight, OR 1.00, 95%CI [0.98-1.02]. Neither was anxiety, depression, or stress exposure, separately. There were no significant differences between the genders. Adjustment for potential confounders did not alter the results.Maternal postpartum distress is apparently not an independent risk factor for childhood overweight at 7-years-of-age. However, we can confirm previous findings of perinatal determinants as high maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, and smoking during pregnancy being risk factors for childhood overweight."
https://openalex.org/W2075671889,"RB1-inducible coiled-coil 1 (RB1CC1, also known as FIP200) plays a role in the enhancement of the RB1 pathway through the direct binding to a GC-rich region 201bp upstream (from the initiation ATG) of the RB1 promoter. Here, we identified hSNF5 and p53 as the binding partners of RB1CC1 by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence assays. Interaction between these molecules and the RB1 pathway was analyzed by the assays of chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase-reporter, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot. The tumor growth suppression by RB1CC1 was evaluated by flow cytometry or by a cell growth assay. The nuclear RB1CC1 complex involving hSNF5 and/or p53 activated transcription of RB1, p16 and p21, and suppressed tumor cell growth. Furthermore, nuclear RB1CC1 expression significantly correlated with those of RB1 and p16 in breast cancer tissue in vivo, and the Ki-67 proliferation index was dependent on p53 as well as RB1CC1. The present study indicates that RB1CC1 together with hSNF5 and/or p53 enhances the RB1 pathway through transcriptional activation of RB1, p16 and p21. Evaluation of RB1CC1 expression combined with RB1 and p53 status is expected to provide useful information in clinical practice and future therapeutic strategies in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2087739897,"The tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily mediates signals critical for regulation of the immune system. One family member, CD40, is important for the efficient activation of antibody-producing B cells and other antigen-presenting cells. The molecules and mechanisms that mediate CD40 signaling are only partially characterized. Proteins known to interact with the cytoplasmic domain of CD40 include members of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family, which regulate signaling and serve as links to other signaling molecules. To identify additional proteins important for CD40 signaling, we used a combined stimulation/immunoprecipitation procedure to isolate CD40 signaling complexes from B cells and characterized the associated proteins by mass spectrometry. In addition to known CD40-interacting proteins, we detected SMAC/DIABLO, HTRA2/Omi, and HOIP/RNF31/PAUL/ZIBRA. We found that these previously unknown CD40-interacting partners were recruited in a TRAF2-dependent manner. HOIP is a ubiquitin ligase capable of mediating NF-kappaB activation through the ubiquitin-dependent activation of IKKgamma. We found that a mutant HOIP molecule engineered to lack ubiquitin ligase activity inhibited the CD40-mediated activation of NF-kappaB. Together, our results demonstrate a powerful approach for the identification of signaling molecules associated with cell surface receptors and indicate an important role for the ubiquitin ligase activity of HOIP in proximal CD40 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2151971963,"The botulinum neurotoxin serotype A light chain (BoNT/A LC) protease is the catalytic component responsible for the neuroparalysis that is characteristic of the disease state botulism. Three related peptide-like molecules (PLMs) were designed using previous information from co-crystal structures, synthesized, and assayed for in vitro inhibition against BoNT/A LC. Our results indicate these PLMS are competitive inhibitors of the BoNT/A LC protease and their K(i) values are in the nM-range. A co-crystal structure for one of these inhibitors was determined and reveals that the PLM, in accord with the goals of our design strategy, simultaneously involves both ionic interactions via its P1 residue and hydrophobic contacts by means of an aromatic group in the P2' position. The PLM adopts a helical conformation similar to previously determined co-crystal structures of PLMs, although there are also major differences to these other structures such as contacts with specific BoNT/A LC residues. Our structure further demonstrates the remarkable plasticity of the substrate binding cleft of the BoNT/A LC protease and provides a paradigm for iterative structure-based design and development of BoNT/A LC inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1991473635,"Bipolar spindle formation is essential for faithful chromosome segregation at mitosis. Because centrosomes define spindle poles, abnormal number and structural organization of centrosomes can lead to loss of spindle bipolarity and genetic integrity. ASAP (aster-associated protein or MAP9) is a centrosome- and spindle-associated protein, the deregulation of which induces severe mitotic defects. Its phosphorylation by Aurora A is required for spindle assembly and mitosis progression. Here, we show that ASAP is localized to the spindle poles by Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) (a mitotic kinase that plays an essential role in centrosome regulation and mitotic spindle assembly) through the γ-TuRC-dependent pathway. We also demonstrate that ASAP is a novel substrate of Plk1 phosphorylation and have identified serine 289 as the major phosphorylation site by Plk1 in vivo. ASAP phosphorylated on serine 289 is localized to centrosomes during mitosis, but this phosphorylation is not required for its Plk1-dependent localization at the spindle poles. We show that phosphorylated ASAP on serine 289 contributes to spindle pole stability in a microtubule-dependent manner. These data reveal a novel function of ASAP in centrosome integrity. Our results highlight dual ASAP regulation by Plk1 and further confirm the importance of ASAP for spindle pole organization, bipolar spindle assembly, and mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2020529936,"Oceanic islands are well known for harboring diverse species assemblages and are frequently the basis of research on adaptive radiation and neoendemism. However, a commonly overlooked role of some islands is their function in preserving ancient lineages that have become extinct everywhere else (paleoendemism). The island archipelago of Bermuda is home to a single species of extant terrestrial vertebrate, the endemic skink Plestiodon (formerly Eumeces) longirostris. The presence of this species is surprising because Bermuda is an isolated, relatively young oceanic island approximately 1000 km from the eastern United States. Here, we apply Bayesian phylogenetic analyses using a relaxed molecular clock to demonstrate that the island of Bermuda, although no older than two million years, is home to the only extant representative of one of the earliest mainland North American Plestiodon lineages, which diverged from its closest living relatives 11.5 to 19.8 million years ago. This implies that, within a short geological time frame, mainland North American ancestors of P. longirostris colonized the recently emergent Bermuda and the entire lineage subsequently vanished from the mainland. Thus, our analyses reveal that Bermuda is an example of a “life raft” preserving millions of years of unique evolutionary history, now at the brink of extinction. Threats such as habitat destruction, littering, and non-native species have severely reduced the population size of this highly endangered lizard."
https://openalex.org/W2109881292,"In the adaptive immune response, immunoglobulins develop that bind specifically to the antigens to which the organism was exposed. Immunoglobulins may bind to known or unknown antigens in a variety of diseases and have been used in the past to identify novel antigens for use as a biomarker. We propose that the immunoglobulins themselves could also be used as biomarkers in antibody-mediated disease. In this proteomic study, rats were immunized with one of two purified antigens, and immunoglobulins from pre- and postimmune sera were analyzed with nano-LC coupled mass spectrometry. It was found that the two treatment groups could be distinguished based on cluster analysis of the immunoglobulin peptides from the immune sera. In addition, we identified 684 specific peptides that were differentially present in one of the two treated groups. We could find an amino acid sequence for 44% of the features in the mass spectra by combining database-driven and de novo sequencing techniques. The latter were essential for sequence identification, as the more common database-driven approach suffers from a poor representation of immunoglobulins in the available databases. Our data show that the development of immunoglobulins during an immune response is not a fully random process, but that instead selection pressures exist that favor the best binding amino acid sequences, and that this selection is shared between different animals. This finding implies that immunoglobulin peptides could indeed be a powerful and easily accessible class of biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2032802725,"MicroRNAs are a large class of post-transcriptional regulators that bind to the 3′ untranslated region of messenger RNAs. They play a critical role in many cellular processes and have been linked to the control of signal transduction pathways. Recent studies indicate that microRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or even as oncogenes when aberrantly expressed. For more general insights of disease-associated microRNAs, we analyzed their impact on human signaling pathways from two perspectives. On a global scale, we found a core set of signaling pathways with enriched tissue-specific microRNA targets across diseases. The function of these pathways reflects the affinity of microRNAs to regulate cellular processes associated with apoptosis, proliferation or development. Comparing cancer and non-cancer related microRNAs, we found no significant differences between both groups. To unveil the interaction and regulation of microRNAs on signaling pathways locally, we analyzed the cellular location and process type of disease-associated microRNA targets and proteins. While disease-associated proteins are highly enriched in extracellular components of the pathway, microRNA targets are preferentially located in the nucleus. Moreover, targets of disease-associated microRNAs preferentially exhibit an inhibitory effect within the pathways in contrast to disease proteins. Our analysis provides systematic insights into the interaction of disease-associated microRNAs and signaling pathways and uncovers differences in cellular locations and process types of microRNA targets and disease-associated proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2042353005,"Background Chemotheraputic drugs often target the microtubule cytoskeleton as a means to disrupt cancer cell mitosis and proliferation. Anti-microtubule drugs inhibit microtubule dynamics, thereby triggering apoptosis when dividing cells activate the mitotic checkpoint. Microtubule dynamics are regulated by microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs); however, we lack a comprehensive understanding about how anti-microtubule agents functionally interact with MAPs. In this report, we test the hypothesis that the cellular levels of microtubule depolymerases, in this case kinesin-13 s, modulate the effectiveness of the microtubule disrupting drug colchicine. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a combination of RNA interference (RNAi), high-throughput microscopy, and time-lapse video microscopy in Drosophila S2 cells to identify a specific MAP, kinesin-like protein 10A (KLP10A), that contributes to the efficacy of the anti-microtubule drug colchicine. KLP10A is an essential microtubule depolymerase throughout the cell cycle. We find that depletion of KLP10A in S2 cells confers resistance to colchicine-induced microtubule depolymerization to a much greater extent than depletion of several other destabilizing MAPs. Using image-based assays, we determined that control cells retained 58% (±2%SEM) of microtubule polymer when after treatment with 2 µM colchicine for 1 hour, while cells depleted of KLP10A by RNAi retained 74% (±1%SEM). Likewise, overexpression of KLP10A-GFP results in increased susceptibility to microtubule depolymerization by colchicine. Conclusions/Significance Our results demonstrate that the efficacy of microtubule destabilization by a pharmacological agent is dependent upon the cellular expression of a microtubule depolymerase. These findings suggest that expression levels of Kif2A, the human kinesin-13 family member, may be an attractive biomarker to assess the effectiveness of anti-microtubule chemotherapies. Knowledge of how MAP expression levels affect the action of anti-microtubule drugs may prove useful for evaluating possible modes of cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1984612887,"Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of both a veterinary wasting disease and human African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness. The cell membrane of the developmental stage found within the mammalian host, the bloodstream form (BSF), is highly dynamic, exhibiting rapid rates of endocytosis and lateral flow of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins. Here, we show that the cell membrane of these organisms is a target for killing by small hydrophobic peptides that increase the rigidity of lipid bilayers. Specifically, we have derived trypanocidal peptides that are based upon the hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequences of human apolipoproteins. These peptides selectively partitioned into the plasma membrane of BSF trypanosomes, resulting in an increase in the rigidity of the bilayer, dramatic changes in cell motility, and subsequent cell death. No killing of the developmental stage found within the insect midgut, the procyclic form, was observed. Additionally, the peptides exhibited no toxicity toward mammalian cell lines and did not induce hemolysis. Studies with model liposomes indicated that bilayer fluidity dictates the susceptibility of membranes to manipulation by hydrophobic peptides. We suggest that the composition of the BSF trypanosome cell membrane confers a high degree of fluidity and unique susceptibility to killing by hydrophobic peptides and is therefore a target for the development of trypanocidal drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2065159330,"Integrin α(IIb)β(3) signaling mediated by kinases and phosphatases participate in hemostasis and thrombosis, in part, by supporting stable platelet adhesion. Our previous studies indicate that the genetic manipulation of PP2Acα (α isoform of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A) negatively regulate the adhesion of human embryonal kidney 293 cells expressing α(IIb)β(3) to fibrinogen. Here, we demonstrated that small interference RNA (siRNA) mediated knockdown of PP2Acα in 293 α(IIb)β(3) cells led to the dephosphorylation of Src Tyr-529, phosphorylation of Src Tyr-418 and an increased Src kinase activity. Conversely, overexpression of PP2Acα decreased the basal Src activity. Pharmacological inhibition of PP2Ac in human platelets or PP2Acα knockdown in primary murine megakaryocytes resulted in Src activation. PP2Acα-depleted 293 α(IIb)β(3) cells did not alter the serine (Ser) phosphorylation of Src but enhanced the Ser-50 phosphorylation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP-1B) with a concomitant increase in the PTP-1B activity. Src activation in the PP2Acα-depleted 293 α(IIb)β(3) cells was abolished by siRNA mediated knockdown of PTP-1B. Pharmacological inhibition of Src or knockdown of Src, PTP-1B blocked the enhanced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and the increased adhesiveness of PP2Acα-depleted 293 α(IIb)β(3) cells to fibrinogen, respectively. Thus, inactivation of PP2Acα promotes hyperphosphorylation of PTP-1B Ser-50, elevates PTP-1B activity, which dephosphorylates Src Tyr-529 to activate Src and its downstream ERK1/2 signaling pathways that regulate α(IIb)β(3) adhesion. Moreover, these studies extend the notion that a cross-talk between Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphatases can fine-tune α(IIb)β(3) outside-in signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2008109928,"HIV-1 Vpr is a virion-associated protein. Its activities link to viral pathogenesis and disease progression of HIV-infected patients. In vitro, Vpr moderately activates HIV-1 replication in proliferating T cells, but it is required for efficient viral infection and replication in vivo in non-dividing cells such as macrophages. How exactly Vpr contributes to viral replication remains elusive. We show here that Vpr stimulates HIV-1 replication at least in part through its interaction with hHR23A, a protein that binds to 19S subunit of the 26S proteasome and shuttles ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome for degradation. The Vpr-proteasome interaction was initially discovered in fission yeast, where Vpr was shown to associate with Mts4 and Mts2, two 19S-associated proteins. The interaction of Vpr with the 19S subunit of the proteasome was further confirmed in mammalian cells where Vpr associates with the mammalian orthologues of fission yeast Mts4 and S5a. Consistently, depletion of hHR23A interrupts interaction of Vpr with proteasome in mammalian cells. Furthermore, Vpr promotes hHR23A-mediated protein-ubiquitination, and down-regulation of hHR23A using RNAi significantly reduced viral replication in non-proliferating MAGI-CCR5 cells and primary macrophages. These findings suggest that Vpr-proteasome interaction might counteract certain host restriction factor(s) to stimulate viral replication in non-dividing cells."

https://openalex.org/W2005726905,"On 22 May, American author Martin Gardner died at the age of 95. Until his last days, he was active and writing for an eager audience. He is well known for his writing on mathematics, science, philosophy of science, theology, and magic. However, few of his admirers knew the full breadth of his intellectual activities, as most were drawn only to some aspect by their own interest. In contrast to our increasingly specialized world, he was involved in many intellectual spheres.

Gardner would be quick to remind us that he was a “journalist.” After getting a B.A. in philosophy at the University of Chicago in 1936, he attended seminary to continue his studies. After a year, he realized that he was training for an academic position, but that his real calling was to be an author. It was a decade before his writing allowed him to earn a decent living. A career in fiction gave way to articles on science, philosophy, and games.

A pivotal article was “The Hermit Scientist” ( Antioch Review , 1950) in which Gardner critiqued three examples of pseudoscience that were very much in the news: the wild theories of writer Immanuel Velikovsky proposing Earth's near collision with other planets; the public craze with unidentified flying objects; and the idea of a metaphysical mind-body relationship touted by the science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard. Gardner's opinions on these topics led to his book In the Name of Science (1952; retitled Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science in 1957), and its impact increased until the 1970s.

Gardner, magician James Randi, and psychologist Ray Hyman decided that a group was needed to address what was then called the “occult explosion,” an alarming escalation of irrationalism in the popular press. Soon they were joined by sociologist Marcello Truzzi and philosopher Paul Kurtz, and the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal was formed. Gardner contributed to their publications regularly for decades, critically examining fringe science and paranormal claims, among other issues.

Gardner is often called the founder of the modern skeptical movement. His clearly written articles drew people in, convinced them that there was a problem worth caring about, and showed how simple argumentation could effectively combat unreason. His writing gave a common voice to those who were reluctant to speak out alone.

Unlike most authors of nonfiction, Gardner had “fans,” the most ardent ones for his 25 years at Scientific American . His “Mathematical Games” column, started in 1956, became so identified with the magazine that many readers said it was the first thing they turned to in each issue. Judging by public pronouncements, book dedications, and thousands of letters written to Gardner, his influence on the study and enjoyment of mathematics may well be unmatched.

Gardner often claimed in interviews that he was unprepared to write a monthly math column, but in fact, he had a lifelong interest in recreational mathematics. Admittedly, his mathematical training was weak, but he said that having to struggle with concepts helped him to write clear explanations. Moreover, he had developed a habit of finding connections between mathematics and the larger world—literature, art, science, philosophy, and magic. This was the secret of the column. He did not make mathematics interesting; he showed that it was interesting.

Gardner's first and last publications were in magic journals, from 1930 to 2010. Although never a performer, he was a constant and respected source of ideas for close-up magic, usually impromptu tricks. He contributed articles on tricks, puzzles, illusions, and science to Physics Teacher magazine for 12 years. He also annotated, or introduced, various editions of the works of his favorite authors. The Annotated Alice (1960) on Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass was his best-selling book, in which he explained associations with mathematics, clever wordplay, and Victorian history, among other fascinating insights.

Gardner's success was due to an extraordinary network of correspondents and his legendary files of information. He was the generous conduit through which ideas flowed, in the magic, math, and pseudoscience communities. His files started in shoe boxes while at college and grew to mammoth proportions. A description of using them, written in 1957, sounds remarkably like a modern description of surfing the Internet.

What motivated Martin Gardner? After a decade of soul-searching, in a 1940 interview he articulated a principle he held for the rest of his life (as expressed by writer Lord Dunsany): “Man is a small thing, and the night is large and full of wonder.” After World War II, he studied with philosopher Rudolf Carnap, which led to his essay “Order and Surprise” (1950). It describes the deep sense of wonder that the natural world impresses upon philosophers and scientists. Over the next 60 years, he would return to this theme. He described himself as a “mysterian” because he believed that even though science will continue to resolve problems, behind every mystery there is another vexing mystery. This spurred most of his best writing. He wrote an entire book ( The Ambidextrous Universe ) about the paradoxical discovery of fundamental asymmetries in particle physics. The mathematical essays concentrated on surprises, unexpected connections, and paradoxes. His main goal was to remind us that we are surrounded by wonderful things.

His antipathy for pseudoscientists was not just because they were cranks, crackpots, or charlatans. He was furious about those who practiced medical hocus-pocus.

We can honor Martin Gardner by pursuing the mysteries that surround us.
