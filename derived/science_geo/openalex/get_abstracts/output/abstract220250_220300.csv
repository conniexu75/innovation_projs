https://openalex.org/W2082213106,"A key step in RNA interference (RNAi) is assembly of the RISC, the protein-siRNA complex that mediates target RNA cleavage. Here, we show that the two strands of an siRNA duplex are not equally eligible for assembly into RISC. Rather, both the absolute and relative stabilities of the base pairs at the 5' ends of the two siRNA strands determine the degree to which each strand participates in the RNAi pathway. siRNA duplexes can be functionally asymmetric, with only one of the two strands able to trigger RNAi. Asymmetry is the hallmark of a related class of small, single-stranded, noncoding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs). We suggest that single-stranded miRNAs are initially generated as siRNA-like duplexes whose structures predestine one strand to enter the RISC and the other strand to be destroyed. Thus, the common step of RISC assembly is an unexpected source of asymmetry for both siRNA function and miRNA biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042486230,"Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) Vif is essential for viral evasion of host antiviral factor CEM15/APOBEC3G. We report that Vif interacts with cellular proteins Cul5, elongins B and C, and Rbx1 to form an Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF)-like complex. The ability of Vif to suppress antiviral activity of APOBEC3G was specifically dependent on Cul5-SCF function, allowing Vif to interact with APOBEC3G and induce its ubiquitination and degradation. A Vif mutant that interacted with APOBEC3G but not with Cul5-SCF was functionally inactive. The Cul5-SCF was also required for Vif function in distantly related simian immunodeficiency virus mac. These results indicate that the conserved Cul5-SCF pathway used by Vif is a potential target for antiviral development."

https://openalex.org/W2108897036,"The established function of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is to promote thyroid follicle development and hormone secretion. The osteoporosis associated with hyperthyroidism is traditionally viewed as a secondary consequence of altered thyroid function. We provide evidence for direct effects of TSH on both components of skeletal remodeling, osteoblastic bone formation, and osteoclastic bone resorption, mediated via the TSH receptor (TSHR) found on osteoblast and osteoclast precursors. Even a 50% reduction in TSHR expression produces profound osteoporosis (bone loss) together with focal osteosclerosis (localized bone formation). TSH inhibits osteoclast formation and survival by attenuating JNK/c-jun and NFκB signaling triggered in response to RANK-L and TNFα. TSH also inhibits osteoblast differentiation and type 1 collagen expression in a Runx-2- and osterix-independent manner by downregulating Wnt (LRP-5) and VEGF (Flk) signaling. These studies define a role for TSH as a single molecular switch in the independent control of both bone formation and resorption."

We show that NO inhibits exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies, endothelial granules that mediate vascular inflammation and thrombosis, by regulating the activity of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). NO inhibits NSF disassembly of soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes by nitrosylating critical cysteine residues of NSF. NO may regulate exocytosis in a variety of physiological processes, including vascular inflammation, neurotransmission, thrombosis, and cytotoxic T lymphocyte cell killing."
https://openalex.org/W1857769113,"Molecular chaperones assist protein folding by facilitating their ""forward"" folding and preventing aggregation. However, once aggregates have formed, these chaperones cannot facilitate protein disaggregation. Bacterial ClpB and its eukaryotic homolog Hsp104 are essential proteins of the heat-shock response, which have the remarkable capacity to rescue stress-damaged proteins from an aggregated state. We have determined the structure of Thermus thermophilus ClpB (TClpB) using a combination of X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Our single-particle reconstruction shows that TClpB forms a two-tiered hexameric ring. The ClpB/Hsp104-linker consists of an 85 A long and mobile coiled coil that is located on the outside of the hexamer. Our mutagenesis and biochemical data show that both the relative position and motion of this coiled coil are critical for chaperone function. Taken together, we propose a mechanism by which an ATP-driven conformational change is coupled to a large coiled-coil motion, which is indispensable for protein disaggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2105844486,"Axon-derived molecules are temporally and spatially required as positive or negative signals to coordinate oligodendrocyte differentiation. Increasing evidence suggests that, in addition to the inhibitory Jagged1/Notch1 signaling cascade, other pathways act via Notch to mediate oligodendrocyte differentiation. The GPI-linked neural cell recognition molecule F3/contactin is clustered during development at the paranodal region, a vital site for axoglial interaction. Here, we show that F3/contactin acts as a functional ligand of Notch. This trans-extracellular interaction triggers gamma-secretase-dependent nuclear translocation of the Notch intracellular domain. F3/Notch signaling promotes oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation and upregulates the myelin-related protein MAG in OLN-93 cells. This can be blocked by dominant negative Notch1, Notch2, and two Deltex1 mutants lacking the RING-H2 finger motif, but not by dominant-negative RBP-J or Hes1 antisense oligonucleotides. Expression of constitutively active Notch1 or Notch2 does not upregulate MAG. Thus, F3/contactin specifically initiates a Notch/Deltex1 signaling pathway that promotes oligodendrocyte maturation and myelination."

https://openalex.org/W1998848584,"Transcript-specific translational control is generally directed by binding of trans-acting proteins to structural elements in the untranslated region (UTR) of the target mRNA. Here, we elucidate a translational silencing mechanism involving regulated release of an integral ribosomal protein and subsequent binding to its target mRNA. Human ribosomal protein L13a was identified as a candidate interferon-Gamma-Activated Inhibitor of Translation (GAIT) of ceruloplasmin (Cp) mRNA by a genetic screen for Cp 3'-UTR binding proteins. In vitro activity of L13a was shown by inhibition of target mRNA translation by recombinant protein. In response to interferon-gamma in vivo, the entire cellular pool of L13a was phosphorylated and released from the 60S ribosomal subunit. Released L13a specifically bound the 3'-UTR GAIT element of Cp mRNA and silenced translation. We propose a model in which the ribosome functions not only as a protein synthesis machine, but also as a depot for regulatory proteins that modulate translation."
https://openalex.org/W2025983848,"Airway epithelial cells are unresponsive to endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) exposure under normal conditions. This study demonstrates that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection results in increased sensitivity to this environmental exposure. Infection with RSV results in increased expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 mRNA, protein, and increased TLR4 membrane localization. This permits significantly enhanced LPS binding to the epithelial monolayer that is blocked by disruption of the Golgi. The increased TLR4 results in an LPS-induced inflammatory response as demonstrated by increased mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity, IL-8 production, and tumor necrosis factor α production. RSV infection also allowed for tumor necrosis factor α production subsequent to TLR4 cross-linking with an immobilized antibody. These data suggest that RSV infection sensitizes airway epithelium to a subsequent environmental exposure (LPS) by altered expression and membrane localization of TLR4.

Recent evidence in intestinal epithelial cells suggests that cells that are in constant contact with pathogenic microbes and other environmental exposures express some of the TLRs at very low levels (10Melmed G. Thomas L.S. Lee N. Tesfay S.Y. Lukasek K. Michelsen K.S. Zhou Y. Hu B. Arditi M. Abreu M.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1406-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 11Abreu M.T. Arnold E.T.

Arnold E.T. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1609-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). More particularly, these studies suggest that in intestinal epithelial cells, TLR4 is in low abundance, localized in the Golgi, and not present on the plasma membrane. The airway epithelium is another region that is in constant contact with multiple pathogen-related antigens and other environmental agents. These exposures, with the exception of significant pathogen load or an immunosuppressed host, do not normally elicit an immunological response. A recent study by Tsutsumi-Ishii and Nagaoka (13Tsutsumi-Ishii Y. Nagaoka I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4226-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) suggests that the intestinal epithelial cell lack of TLR4 is also true of airway epithelial cells. They found no surface expression of TLR4 and a lack of LPS responsiveness (13Tsutsumi-Ishii Y. Nagaoka I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4226-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).The relative tolerance to foreign antigens that is demonstrated by normal airway epithelial cells is altered in people with asthma and after RSV infection. Asthma and RSV infection are characterized by non-specific responses to both infectious agents and environmental exposures that include heightened inflammatory responses and hyper-responsive airways. The factors that predispose a particular individual to developing asthma are for the most part unclear. One early exposure that has been linked to the subsequent development of asthma is a severe infection with RSV during the first year of life (14Eigen H. J. Pediatr. 1999; 135: 1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Stein R.T. Sherrill D. Morgan W.J. Holberg C.J. Halonen M. Taussig L.M. Wright A.L. Martinez F.D.

The correlation is especially clear if the RSV infection results in hospitalization for bronchiolitis and other respiratory complications (15Stein R.T. Sherrill D. Morgan W.J. Holberg C.J. Halonen M.

Pract. 1997; 45: 473-481PubMed Google Scholar).RSV is found ubiquitously in the environment. Serious illness, however, is for the most part found only in very young children and immunosuppressed adults. It is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus and is a member of the family Paramyxoviridae. Entry into the host cell (primarily the respiratory epithelium) is by cell surface fusion. Eleven genes and their encoded proteins have been identified for RSV. These include the F or fusion protein, the G attachment protein, nucleocapsid proteins, a polymerase subunit, two N or non-structural proteins, and M2-2, a RNA regulatory protein (18Dickens L.E. Collins P.L. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 364-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The F protein has been demonstrated to signal via TLR4 (19Haeberle H.A. Takizawa R. Casola A. Brasier A.R.

Dis. 2002; 186: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), TLR4 signaling in macrophages was found to be an important component of the early RSV response. RSV has not only been shown to predispose children to the later development of asthma, but the presence of asthma sensitizes to both subsequent viral infections and environmental responses (including LPS). The increased responsiveness of the asthmatic and RSV-infected airways suggests the possibility of alterations in inflammation-related receptor expression as sequelae to an asthma and RSV infection phenotype.One ubiquitous environmental exposure that clearly triggers acute attacks in children with established asthma and after RSV infection is LPS (15Stein R.T.

Various studies have shown that it is a component of household dusts, products of carbon combustion, grain dust, and plant-derived allergens (22Braun-Fahrlander C. Riedler J. Herz U. Eder W. Waser M. Grize L. Maisch S. Carr D. Gerlach F. Bufe A. Lauener R.P. Schierl R. Renz H. Nowak D. von Mutius E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). The effect of endotoxin on established asthma is clear. There is controversy, however, regarding the role of endotoxin in the development of asthma. Some studies suggest that early exposure to endotoxin protects children from subsequent development of asthma (23Illi S. von Mutius E. Lau S. Bergmann R. Niggemann B. Sommerfeld C. Wahn U. BMJ. 2001; 322: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 24Sengler C. Lau S. Wahn U. Nickel R. Respir. Res. 2002; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Lau S. Nickel R.

Immunol. 2002; 2: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas other observations provide little evidence for a protective effect of early endotoxin exposure (28Vernooy J.H. Dentener M.A. van Suylen R.J. Buurman W.A. Wouters E.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). A recent study by Eisenbarth et al. (29Eisenbarth S.C. Piggott D.A. Huleatt J.W. Visintin I. Herrick C.A. Bottomly K. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) may explain, in part, these conflicting observations. They showed that low dose LPS exposure can function as an adjuvant for allergen-induced Th2 responses in a murine model of asthma (22Braun-Fahrlander C. Riedler J. Herz U. Eder W. Waser M. Grize L. Maisch S. Carr D. Gerlach F. Bufe A. Lauener R.P. Schierl R. Renz H. Nowak D. von Mutius E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). This adjuvant effect of LPS requires the presence of TLR4 as it does not occur in C3H/Hej mice, which have a non-functional TLR4. They also showed that this low dose effect of LPS (facilitation of Th2 responses) differs from high dose exposure that facilitates protective Th1 responses. These observations suggest a complicated role for LPS in the development of asthma that may depend on a number of interacting factors, including dose, genetics, and other environmental exposures.In this study, we evaluated first the LPS responsiveness of a lung epithelial cell line and then the effect of RSV infection on TLR4 expression and membrane localization. The findings of the study include: RSV-induced TLR4 expression and membrane localization, increased binding of LPS to lung epithelial cells via a Golgi transport-dependent mechanism, and the conversion of lung epithelial cells from LPS-non-responsive to LPS-responsive cells. The basic observations (increased TLR4 and MD-2, as well as increased LPS binding) were confirmed in a number of other epithelial lines, including newly isolated human bronchotracheal epithelial cells. As a composite, these studies suggest that RSV infection alters epithelial environmental responsiveness via an effect on expression and function of the LPS receptor, TLR4.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals, including brefeldin A, were obtained from Sigma and Calbiochem. Protease inhibitors were obtained from Roche Applied Science. LPS was obtained from LIST Biologicals, Campbell, CA. Antibodies to TLR4 were obtained from AbCam, Cambridge, UK (extracellular domain) and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA (intracellular domain and TLR4/MD-2 complex (HTA-125)). Antibodies for use in the IL-8 and TNFα ELISAs were from R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN. Nitrocellulose and ECL Plus were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Antibody to phosphorylated ERK was obtained from Cell Signaling, Beverly MA. Other antibodies and developing antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ALEXA-conjugated reagents were obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR.Epithelial Cell Culture and Viral Infection—A549 lung epithelial cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, CCL-185, Manassas, VA. Cells were maintained in 100-mm tissue culture flasks (Corning, Corning, NY) in minimal essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For infection, cells at ∼80% confluency were treated with 1 × 106 TCID50 of human RSV, strain A-2. Viral stocks were obtained from Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Columbia, MD. The initial stock (1 × 109 TCID50) was aliquoted and kept frozen at -135 °C. A fresh aliquot was thawed for each experiment. The virus was never refrozen.Other Epithelial Cells—All protocols were approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Primary lung epithelial cells (HAE) were enzymatically isolated from bronchial epithelium of human donor lungs, as described previously (30Karp P.H. Moninger T.O. Weber S.P. Nesselhauf T.S. Launspach J.L. Zabner J. Welsh M.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 188: 115-137PubMed Google Scholar).

HAE were used immediately after isolation (with no subculturing). Human tracheobronchial epithelial cells (hTBE) were obtained as described previously (32Joseph T.D. Look D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47136-47142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells were isolated from tracheal and bronchial mucosa by enzymatic dissociation and cultured in Laboratory of Carcinogenesis-8e medium on plates coated with collagen/albumin for study up to passage 10. HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (CCL-2) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 80 μg/ml gentamycin. All lines were infected with RSV in subconfluent conditions as described for A549 cells.Isolation of Human Alveolar Macrophages—Alveolar macrophages were obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage as described previously (33Monick M.M.

Briefly, normal volunteers with a lifetime non-smoking history, no acute or chronic illness, and no current medications underwent bronchoalveolar lavage. Differential cell counts were determined using a Wright-Giemsa-stained cytocentrifuge preparation. All cell preparations had between 90 and 100% alveolar macrophages. This study was approved by the Committee for Investigations Involving Human Subjects at the University of Iowa.Isolation of Human Blood Monocytes—180 ml of heparinized blood was obtained by venipuncture of the same volunteers who underwent bronchoscopy. Monocytes were then separated from the remaining mononuclear cells (T cells, NK cells, etc.) by removal of all non-monocytes with an antibody mixture, which cross-links the targeted cells to red blood cells before using a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (Sigma) (RosetteSep mixture from StemCell Technologies. Monocyte purity was evaluated using Wright-Giemsa staining and was greater than 95%.Isolation of Protein Extracts—Whole cell protein was obtained by lysing the cells on ice for 20 min in 500 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 protease minitab (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml and 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (catalog number 524625, Calbiochem). The lysates were then sonicated for 20 s and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Cytosol/membrane protein fractions were obtained by using an identical lysis buffer except for the lack of detergent. After sonication and an initial slow spin to remove the nuclei and debris, the lysates were spun at 55,000 rpm for 1 h to pellet the membranes. The supernatant was saved as cytosol, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer including detergent. After 30 min at 4 °C and another sonication, membrane debris was removed by a 14,000-rpm spin.Western Analysis—Western analysis for the presence of particular proteins or for phosphorylated forms of proteins was performed as described previously (37Thomas K.W.

Cell proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose with a Bio-Rad semidry transfer system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal loading of the protein groups on the blots was evaluated using Ponceau S, a staining solution designed for staining proteins on nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose was then blocked with 5% milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with the primary antibody at dilutions of 1:500-1:2000 overnight. The blots were washed four times with TTBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (1:5000-1:20,000). Immunoreactive bands were developed using a chemiluminescent substrate, ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). An autoradiograph was obtained, with exposure times of 10 s to 2 min.IL-8 and TNFα Release—A549 cells were infected with RSV with and without the addition of LPS (1 μg/ml) for 5-24 h. The culture supernatant was saved, and IL-8 or TNFα was measured by ELISA using the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems).TLR4 Cross-linking—In these studies, A549 cells were infected with RSV for 16 h at 106 TCID50. The cells were then subcultured, seeded onto 96-well plates (5 × 104/well) precoated with anti-TLR4 (HTA125) antibody or control antibody, and cultured for a further 24 h. Supernatants were harvested, and TNFα was measured. The antibody binding was performed as follows: sterile high protein binding polystyrene plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with 3.3 μg/ml anti-TLR4 (HTA125) or an isotype control (anti-mouse IgG, Class 2a) in PBS. The plates were washed four times with cold PBS before addition of the cells.Isolation of RNA—Total RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantitated using RiboGreen kit (Molecular Probes). RNA samples were stored at -70 °C.Real-time RT-PCR Detection of TLR4 and MD-2—1 μg of total RNA was reversed-transcribed to cDNA using RETROscript RT-PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR in a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ system as follows: in a 0.2-ml PCR tube (Bio-Rad), 2 μl of cDNA was added to 48 μl of PCR reaction mixture containing 2 mm each dNTP (Invitrogen), 3.0 mm MgCl2 (Invitrogen), 1:15,000 SYBR Green I DNA dye (Molecular Probes), 0.2 μm each of sense and antisense primers (IDT, Coralville, IA), and 2.5 units of Platimum TaqDNA (Invitrogen). Amplification and data collection were performed as described previously (35Monick M.M. Robeff P.K. Butler N.S. Flaherty D.M. Carter A.B. Peterson M.W. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32992-33000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Primers for human TLR4, MD-2 and HPRT genes are as follows (5′ to 3′): TLR4, forward, ACA-ACC-TCC-CCT-TCT-CAA-CC; reverse, TGA-GAT-GTC-CAA-TGG-GGA-AG; MD-2, forward, TTC-CAC-CCT-GTT-TTC-TTC-CA; reverse, TCA-TCA-GAT-CCT-CGG-CAA-AT; HPRT, forward, TTG-GAA-AGG-GTG-TTT-ATT-CCT-C; reverse, TCC-CCT-GTT-GAC-TGG-TCA-TT.Quantitation of mRNA—For each sample assayed, the threshold cycles (Ct) for reactions amplifying TLR4, MD-2, and HPRT were determined. The gene-specific Ct for each sample was corrected by subtracting the Ct for HPRT (ΔCt). Untreated controls were chosen as the reference samples, and the ΔCt values for all experimental samples were subtracted by the ΔCt values for the control samples (ΔΔCt). Finally, sample mRNA abundance, relative to control mRNA abundance, was calculated by the formula 2-(ΔΔCt). Validity of this approach was confirmed by using serial 10-fold dilutions of template containing experimental and HPRT genes. The amplification efficiencies for experimental and HPRT amplimers were found to be identical.Confocal Microscopy—Subconfluent cultures of A549 cells in Lab-Tek® II chamber slides were infected with RSV. For LPS binding and uptake assays, the cells were incubated with ALEXA488-labeled LPS at the final concentration of 5 μg/ml for 1 h at 37 °C, washed several times with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cell nuclei were counterstained with 7-aminoactinomycin D. Slide chambers were cover-slipped using Vectashield® (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed by using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope at the University of Iowa Central Microscopy Research Facility. Ten random fields (512 × 512 pixels each) were collected for each experimental group. A representative picture is shown for each condition.Flow Cytometry (FACS) Analysis—A549 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 60-mm tissue culture dishes or 24-well tissue culture dishes, RSV was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 12-24 h. For LPS binding, LPS-ALEXA488 (5 μg/ml) was incubated with the cells for the final hour. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then harvested by trypsinization. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stored in 70% ethanol at -20 °C until analysis. Analysis for LPS-ALEXA488 was done by flow cytometry, (FACScan™, BD Biosciences) using CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences). Staining for TLR4 was done by harvesting the cells by trypsinization following RSV infection and then staining first with a receptor-specific antibody and then with a secondary antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin or ALEXA488.Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed on densitometry data, ELISA results, and real-time PCR data. Significance was determined by Student's t test.RESULTSLung Epithelial Cells Are LPS-tolerant—We evaluated the ability of A549 cells to produce IL-8 after LPS exposure. As a comparison, human blood monocytes and human alveolar macrophages were treated with LPS. IL-8 is used in these studies as a marker of epithelial cell inflammation. It can be produced by monocytes, T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells after exposure to cytokines, bacteria, bacterial products, and viruses (40Mukaida N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: L566-L577Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To evaluate LPS responsiveness, alveolar macrophages, blood monocytes, and A549 epithelial cells were all cultured with LPS (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. The supernatants were collected, and IL-8 production was analyzed. Fig. 1 demonstrates that both alveolar macrophages and blood monocytes produce large amounts (100-ng range) of IL-8. In contrast, A549 cells produced less than 10 ng/ml during the same time frame. This amount is not different from unstimulated cells.Lung Epithelial Cells Produce Minimal Amounts of TLR4 mRNA—Because of the lack of LPS-induced IL-8 in A549 cells, we next compared the amounts of TLR4 mRNA in alveolar macrophages (LPS-sensitive cells) versus A549 cells. Unstimulated cells were isolated, and TLR4 mRNA levels were quantified using real-time RT-PCR. Fig. 2 shows the ratio of TLR4 mRNA to mRNA levels of the housekeeping gene, HPRT. HPRT levels in the two cell types are comparable. There is an approximate 1000-fold difference in TLR4 mRNA levels in alveolar macrophages as compared with A549 cells. This suggests the possibility that the lack of IL-8 produced following LPS exposure in A549 cells might be due to a lack of TLR4.Fig. 2Airway epithelial cells produce very small amounts of TLR4 mRNA at baseline. Alveolar macrophages shortly after isolation from the lungs of normal volunteers and A549 cells were lysed, and RNA was isolated. Equal amounts of mRNA (see “Experimental Procedures”) were analyzed for TLR4 and HPRT mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. Comparison between cell types was done by determining the ratio of TLR4 mRNA to the housekeeping gene, HPRT, for both alveolar macrophages and A549 cells. The experiment was repeated three separate times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RSV Increases TLR4 Expression and Membrane Localization—To investigate the effect of RSV infection on TLR4 expression, A549 cells were infected with RSV for various times and harvested for RNA and whole cell protein. Fig. 3, A and B, demonstrate that RSV increases TLR4 mRNA and protein amounts (A549 cells). To determine that the RSV-induced increase in TLR4 was not specific to A549 cells, two primary cell lines (HAE and hTBE) and one unrelated epithelial cell line (HeLa) were infected with RSV for 16 h, and TLR4 mRNA analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Fig. 3B demonstrates that, in newly isolated airway epithelial cells (HAE), in a non-transformed primary lung epithelial line (hTBE), and in an adenocarcinoma epithelial line (HeLa), RSV increases expression of TLR4 mRNA. To evaluate the effect of RSV on surface expression of TLR4, A549 cells were cultured in the presence of RSV for 16 h. Cytosol/membrane protein fractions were obtained, and Western analysis was performed for TLR4. RSV infection caused a significant increase in the amount of TLR4 present in the membrane fraction of lung epithelial cells (Fig. 3C). Surface expression of TLR4 was also evaluated using fluorescent antibodies and a fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) in non-permeabilized cells and demonstrated the same increase in surface TLR4 (Fig. 3D).Fig. 3RSV infection induces TLR4 mRNA, protein, and membrane localization. A549 cells were infected with 106 TCID50 RSV for various times. A, Western analysis of whole cell proteins using an antibody to TLR4 (AbCam, AB1436). This blot is representative of four separate experiments. Densitometry is shown as -fold increase (experimental value/control value). B, mRNA levels, expressed as -fold increase (experimental value/control value) of four epithelial lines (A549 cells, HAE, hTBE, and HeLa cells). A549 cells were infected with 106 TCID50 RSV for various times. The other lines were infected with an identical viral load and cultured for 16 h before ha"
https://openalex.org/W2066723778,"The Rac1 guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, including actin dynamics, proliferation, apoptosis, adhesion, and migration resulting from signaling by multiple receptors, including the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). We used conditional gene targeting to generate mice with specific Rac1 deficiency in the B cell lineage. In the absence of both Rac1 and the highly related Rac2, B cell development was almost completely blocked. Both GTPases were required to transduce BCR signals leading to proliferation, survival and up-regulation of BAFF-R, a receptor for BAFF, a key survival molecule required for B cell development and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2089273088,"Unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum cause trans-autophosphorylation of the bifunctional transmembrane kinase Ire1, which induces its endoribonuclease activity. The endoribonuclease initiates nonconventional splicing of HAC1 messenger RNA to trigger the unfolded-protein response (UPR). We explored the role of Ire1's kinase domain by sensitizing it through site-directed mutagenesis to the ATP-competitive inhibitor 1NM-PP1. Paradoxically, rather than being inhibited by 1NM-PP1, drug-sensitized Ire1 mutants required 1NM-PP1 as a cofactor for activation. In the presence of 1NM-PP1, drug-sensitized Ire1 bypassed mutations that inactivate its kinase activity and induced a full UPR. Thus, rather than through phosphorylation per se, a conformational change in the kinase domain triggered by occupancy of the active site with a ligand leads to activation of all known downstream functions."
https://openalex.org/W2118177072,"Genetic knockout of the transcriptional corepressor CtBP in mouse embryo fibroblasts upregulates several genes involved in apoptosis. We predicted, therefore, that a propensity toward apoptosis might be regulated through changes in cellular CtBP. To identify pathways involved in this regulation, we screened a mouse embryo cDNA library with an E1A-CtBP complex and identified the homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), which had previously been linked to UV-directed apoptosis through its ability to phosphorylate p53. Expression of HIPK2 or exposure to UV irradiation reduced CtBP levels via a proteosome-mediated pathway. The UV effect was prevented by coexpression of kinase-inactive HIPK2 or reduction in HIPK2 levels via siRNA. Mutation of the residue phosphorylated by HIPK2 prevented UV- and HIPK2-directed CtBP clearance. Finally, reduction in CtBP levels, either by genetic knockout or siRNA, promoted apoptosis in p53-deficient cells. These findings provide a pathway for UV-induced apoptosis in cells lacking p53."

https://openalex.org/W2022755028,"Anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), flavonol synthase (FLS), and flavanone 3beta-hydroxylase (FHT) are involved in the biosynthesis of flavonoids in plants and are all members of the family of 2-oxoglutarate- and ferrous iron-dependent oxygenases. ANS, FLS, and FHT are closely related by sequence and catalyze oxidation of the flavonoid ""C ring""; they have been shown to have overlapping substrate and product selectivities. In the initial steps of catalysis, 2-oxoglutarate and dioxygen are thought to react at the ferrous iron center producing succinate, carbon dioxide, and a reactive ferryl intermediate, the latter of which can then affect oxidation of the flavonoid substrate. Here we describe work on ANS, FLS, and FHT utilizing several different substrates carried out in 18O2/16OH2, 16O2/18OH2, and 18O2/18OH2 atmospheres. In the 18O2/16OH2 atmosphere close to complete incorporation of a single 18O label was observed in the dihydroflavonol products (e.g. (2R,3R)-trans-dihydrokaempferol) from incubations of flavanones (e.g. (2S)naringenin) with FHT, ANS, and FLS. This and other evidence supports the intermediacy of a reactive oxidizing species, the oxygen of which does not exchange with that of water. In the case of products formed by oxidation of flavonoid substrates with a C-3 hydroxyl group (e.g. (2R,3R)-trans-dihydroquercetin), the results imply that oxygen exchange can occur at a stage subsequent to initial oxidation of the C-ring, probably via an enzyme-bound C-3 ketone/3,3-gem-diol intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1991376375,"Apolipoprotein-mediated release of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids was induced in HEK293 cells by expressing human ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) and ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) proteins, whether transient or stable, to generate cholesterol-rich high density lipoprotein (HDL). Green fluorescent protein (GFP) attached at their C termini did not influence the lipid release reactions. Transfected ABCA7-GFP induced apolipoprotein-mediated assembly of cholesterol-containing HDL also in L929 cells, which otherwise generate only cholesterol-deficient HDL with their endogenous ABCA1. Time-dependent release of cholesterol and phospholipid by apolipoprotein A (apoA)-I was parallel both with ABCA1 and with ABCA7 when highly expressed in HEK293 cells, but dose-dependent profiles of lipid release on apoA-I and apoA-II were somewhat different between ABCA1 and ABCA7. Analyses of the stable clones with ABCA1-GFP (293/2c) and ABCA7-GFP (293/6c) by using the same vector indicated some differences in regulation of their activities by protein kinase modulators. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP increased ABCA1-GFP and the release of cholesterol and phospholipid in 293/2c but increased neither ABCA7-GFP nor the lipid release in 293/6c. Expression of ABCA1-GFP- and apoA-I-mediated lipid release were enhanced in parallel by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in 293/2c cells. In contrast, the same treatment of 293/6c increased ABCA7-GFP, but apoA-I-mediated lipid release was significantly suppressed. Despite these different responses to PMA, all of the effects of PMA were reversed by a specific protein kinase C inhibitor Gö6976, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to protein kinase C activation. A thiol protease inhibitor, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, increased the protein levels of ABCA1-GFP in 293/2c and ABCA7-GFP in 293/6c, indicating their common degradation pathway. The data indicated that human ABCA7 would compensate the function of ABCA1 for release of cell cholesterol in a certain condition(s), but post-transcriptional regulation of their activity is different.

Cholesterol is essential for all animal cells as a membrane constituent for regulation of its general physicochemical properties and functions of specific domains. Cellular cholesterol can be derived by de novo synthesis or externally supplied via the uptake of cholesterol-containing lipoprotein particles. In contrast, most of the cells are unable to catabolize cholesterol so that cholesterol molecules must be removed from the cells and transported to the liver for their conversion to bile acids as a major exit route of the body cholesterol. Thus cholesterol transport from the peripheral cells to the liver is an essential part of cholesterol homeostasis, both for cells and for the body.

Lipid-free apolipoproteins with amphiphilic α-helical segments were demonstrated to remove cellular lipids to generate cholesterol-containing HDL (1.Hara H. Yokoyama S. J. Biol.

ABC transporter G1 (ABCG1), an ABC transporter protein of a “half-size” structure family, has also been reported to regulate the apolipoprotein A (apoA)-I-mediated lipid release from lipid-laden macrophages (10.Klucken J. Büchler C. Orsó E. Kaminski W.E. Porsch-Özcürümez M. Liebisch G. Kapinsky M. Diederich W. Drobnik W. Dean M. Allikmets R. Schmitz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 817-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether this protein can generate HDL in the absence of ABCA1. ABC transporter A7 (ABCA7) is another member of the same ABCA subfamily of “full-size” transporter as ABCA1, and its cDNA has been cloned from the human macrophage and spleen cDNA libraries exhibiting high homology to other human ABC transporters (11.Kaminski W.E. Piehler A. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). ABCA7 has also been identified as the autoantigen SS-N, an epitope of Sjögren's syndrome, which was found homologous to the putative first extracellular domain of ABCA1 (12.Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S. Nagase T. Aoki R. Kioka N. Amachi T. Yokoyama S. Ueda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

ABCA7 mRNA and protein were induced in differentiated macrophages from human peripheral monocytes, and it was apparently expressed inversely to the cellular cholesterol level (11.Kaminski W.E. Piehler A. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 782-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although an exact role of ABCA7 in cellular cholesterol homeostasis is unknown, it may play a relevant role in regulation of cholesterol turnover in some specific cells such as macrophages. Recently, it was reported that mouse ABCA7 promotes apoA-I-mediated phospholipid release but failed to release cholesterol (13.Wang N. Lan D. Gerbod-Giannone M. Linsel-Nitschke P. Jehle A.W. Chen W. Martinez L.O. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42906-42912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Here we report that human ABCA7 mediates apolipoprotein-dependent generation of HDL by releasing both cellular cholesterol and phospholipid even in the absence of ABCA1. Although the reaction is largely similar to that of human ABCA1, apparent affinity of apolipoproteins for the cells is different. Regulations of its expression and activity by protein kinase activators are also different from those of ABCA1. DNA Construction and Transfection—Full-length cDNAs for human ABCA1 and ABCA7 were cloned as described previously (12.Tanaka A.R. Ikeda Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Arakawa R. Sadanami K. Kidera A. Nakagawa S.

They were introduced to pcDNA3.1/Hygro (Invitrogen), pCMV6c, and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to obtain constructs for the proteins without or with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at their C terminus. All the vectors have an immediate early promoter of cytomegalovirus promoter for expression of cDNA. HEK293 and L929 cells were obtained from Health Science Research Resources Bank and maintained in 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium (DF) supplemented with 10% (v/v) of fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen) under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. cDNAs were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells to which the cDNAs were permanently introduced were selected with G418, and clones with high level expression of the fusion proteins were further selected according to the fluorescent intensity with GFP.

Expression levels of ABCA1-GFP protein and ABCA7-GFP protein were also measured in situ with an FL600 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek Inc.). Cellular fluorescence was measured as fluorescent intensity per unit area. GFP-derived derived fluorescence was calculated by subtracting background. Intracellular localization of GFP-containing protein was examined by their fluorescence images obtained by using an Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a MicroRadiance confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Apolipoproteins—ApoA-I and apoA-II were isolated from human plasma HDL fraction (density 1.09-1.21) and stored at -80 °C until use as described previously (16.Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J.

Cellular Lipid Release Assay—Cells were subcultured in 6-well trays (TPP catalogue number 92406) at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/well with 10% FCS-DF medium. After a 48-h incubation, the cells were washed once with buffer H (Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5) and 14 mm glucose), and incubated in 1 ml/well of DF medium containing 0.02% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lipid acceptors (apoA-I, apoA-II, and 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin). Buffer H supplemented with amino acids (Invitrogen catalogue number 11140-50) was used instead of DF medium in some experiments to reduce the endogenous fluorescence background in DF medium. Lipid content in the medium and cells was determined after the indicated incubation times. Procedures for lipid extraction and enzymatic assays for cholesterol and choline-phospholipids were described previously (18.Abe-Dohmae S. Suzuki S. Wada Y. Aburatani H. Vance D.E. Yokoyama S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 3080-3086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The solution was collected from the bottom into 13 fractions. The contents of cholesterol and choline-phospholipids as well as the density were determined for each fraction. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Scheffé's test. A p value less than 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. Parent HEK293 cells did not respond to apolipoproteins to release either cholesterol or phospholipid (Table I). Treatment with dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dBcAMP) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) with or prior to apoA-I stimulation had no effect either (Table I and data not shown). Transient expression of ABCA1 cDNA and ABCA7 cDNA in HEK293 cells resulted in apoA-I-mediated release of both cholesterol and phospholipid in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1), and attachment of GFP to the C terminus of ABCA7 or ABCA1 did not influence these lipid releases (see below). For further investigation of the functions of ABCA7, we therefore obtained stable clones expressing high levels of ABCA1-GFP protein and ABCA7-GFP protein.Table IApoA-I-mediated lipid release from parent HEK293 cells treated with protein kinase stimulantsapoA-I++++dBcAMP++PMA++Ch0.02 ± 0.01−0.01 ± 0.030.05 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.000.02 ± 0.01PL0.53 ± 0.000.62 ± 0.120.69 ± 0.070.62 ± 0.070.59 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab Release of cholesterol and phospholipid by incubation with apoA-I was demonstrated at least in three independent clones highly expressing ABCA1-GFP and also three clones expressing ABCA7-GFP, indicating that the reaction is not clone-specific but cDNA-specific. Western blotting data of parent HEK293 cells, the cells with or without transient expression of ABCA1 and ABCA7, and ABCA1-GFP-expressing clone (293/2c) and ABCA7-GFP-expressing clone (293/6c) are shown in Fig. 2. Neither ABCA1 nor ABCA7 protein was detected in parent HEK293 cells. ABCA1- and ABCA7-containing bands were detected at the position consistent with those of GFP-attached molecules in 293/2c and 293/6c cells, as ABCA1-GFP and ABCA7-GFP at 260-270 and 240-260 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2, C-E). ABCA1 protein expression level per cell protein in 293/2c cells was estimated as about 30-fold of that in human fibroblast WI38 and mouse fibroblast L929 by Western blotting analysis (data not shown). GFP protein expression was ∼1:3 between 293/2c and 293/6c cells based on Western blotting analysis results (Fig. 2C) and measurement of fluorescence (see Figs. 7C and 9C, compare the group 0). Confocal microscopic analysis revealed that ABCA1-GFP (20.Tanaka A.R. Abe-Dohmae S. Ohnishi T. Aoki R. Morinaga G. Okuhira K. Ikeda Y. Kano F. Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Murata M. Yokoyama S.

Ch, cholesterol; PL, phospholipid.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Typical profiles of lipid release by apoA-I and apoA-II from 293/2c and 293/6c cells are shown in Fig. 3. LysoPC assay confirmed that most of the choline-phospholipids released to the medium in the absence of apolipoproteins was lysoPC and that its level was independent of apolipoprotein concentration (data not shown). The dose-dependent curve of the reaction by apoA-II was similar to that of apoA-I with respect to molar concentration of the proteins for both cholesterol and choline-phospholipid (Fig. 3). These results indicated that ABCA7 directly promotes both cholesterol and phospholipid efflux to apoA-I, just as ABCA1 does. The releases of phospholipid and cholesterol appear parallel by increasing concentrations of apoA-I and apoA-II in 293/2c (ABCA1-GFP) and 293/6c (ABCA7-GFP). The lipid release seems to reach the maximum at lower concentration of apolipoprotein with the ABCA1-expresing cells (293/2c) than the ABCA7-expressing cells (293/6c). The EC50 for the apoa-I mediated release of cholesterol and phospholipid from 293/6c cells was ∼4.5 and 4.2 μg/ml (0.16 and 0.15 μm), respectively, whereas 1.8 and 1.2 μg/ml (0.064 and 0.043 μm) for that from 293/2c cells (Fig. 3 and data not shown). Time course analysis of apoA-I-mediated lipid release supported the idea of simultaneous release of phospholipid and cholesterol both from 293/2c cells and from 293/6c cells as cholesterol and phospholipid in the medium were well detectable as early as 1 h after apoA-I stimulation, and they increased linearly for 8 h (Fig. 4). Density gradient analysis of the medium demonstrated that both cholesterol and phospholipid were recovered in the fractions with a density peak at around 1.08 g/ml, indicating that HDL particles were generated from the ABCA7-GFP-expressing cells similarly to the ABCA1-GFP-expressing cells (Fig. 5).Fig. 4Simultaneous and time-dependent increase in apoA-I-mediated release of cholesterol (Ch) and choline-phospholipid (PL) from 293/2c and 293/6c cells. 293/2c (A and B) and 293/6c (C and D) cells were cultured for 48 h as in Fig. 3. After washing with buffer H, cells were incubated in 0.02% BSA-DF containing 10 μg/ml apoA-I. After the incubation time indicated, cholesterol (A and C) and choline-phospholipid (B and D) content in the medium was measured. Results shown are representative from two independent sets of experiments after subtraction of the background.

We reported elsewhere that L929 cells release phospholipid but not cholesterol by apoA-I (22.Yamauchi Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1585: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, parent L929 cells released only phospholipid to apoA-I even at high concentrations of apoA-I (open symbols). Stable expression of ABCA7-GFP protein in L929 cells caused substantial release of cholesterol together with enhancement of phospholipid release (closed symbols). The level of endogenous ABCA1 expression was not affected in L929 by transfection and expression of ABCA7 (Fig. 6C). Both dBcAMP and PMA enhanced apoA-I-mediated lipid release and ABCA1-GFP protein level in 293/2c. In the presence of dBcAMP (300 μm) or PMA (320 nm) with apoA-I, significant increase was induced in cholesterol and phospholipid release from 293/2c cells (Fig. 7, A and B, open columns). The increase of the lipid release was correlated with elevation of ABCA1-GFP protein level evaluated by GFP-derived fluorescence intensity and Western blotting analysis (Figs. 7C and 8A, lanes 2-7). The effects of dBcAMP and PMA were slightly synergistic, although not additive, in the condition tested. Previous works demonstrated protection of ABCA1 by apolipoprotein against thiol protease-mediated degradation (15.Arakawa R. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22426-22429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22.Yamauchi Y. Abe-Dohmae S. Yokoyama S. Biochim. Biophys.

ApoA-I increased protein levels of ABCA1 (Fig. 8A) and ABCA1-GFP (Fig. 7C and other data not shown) expressed in HEK293 cells, consistent with the previous similar experiments (23.Wang N. Chen W.

A thiol protease inhibitor, N-acetyl-Leu-Leunorleucinal (ALLN), enhanced apoA-I-mediated lipid release and ABCA1-GFP protein level as well as the increase of GFP-derived fluorescence in 293/2c (Figs. 7, A-C, and 8A). In contrast, treatment with dBcAMP did not affect apoA-I-mediated cholesterol or phospholipid release in 293/6c cells, and PMA decreased release of both lipids (Fig. 9, A and B, shadowed columns). On the other hand, apoA-I and ALLN caused the increase of ABCA7-GFP in 293/6c, although the increase in cholesterol and phospholipid release was not statistically significant (Figs. 8B, 9, A and B, hatched columns). ABCA7-GFP protein level was not significantly affected either by dBcAMP, whereas it was slightly up-regulated by PMA (Figs. 8B and 9C). None of the compounds tested influenced non-specific cholesterol release to 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin from 293/2c or 293/6c (data not shown). These effects of dBcAMP, PMA, and apoA-I were similar in HEK293 cells transiently or stably expressing ABCA7 (Fig. 8B, lanes 1-4, and data not shown) Induction of ABCA1 and ABCA7 by dBcAMP or PMA was further investigated in 293/2c and 293/6c cells, respectively, by monitoring their GFP-derived fluorescence (Fig. 10). In 293/2c cells, PMA induced the transient increase of ABCA1-GFP fluorescence, as the increase was evident after 2 h, reaching a peak at 8-12 h (Fig. 10A). dBcAMP-induced fluorescence increase was rather continuous at least up to 30 h after a time lag of 4-6 h. The effect of these two compounds were additive. Continuous monitoring of cellular fluorescence in the fluorescence-free medium yielded similar results (data not shown). Being consistent with these results, the apoA-I-mediated lipid release from 293/2c for 4 h was not affected by dBcAMP but was enhanced by PMA (data not shown). In 293/6c cells, fluorescence level was changed neither by dBcAMP nor by PMA (Fig. 10B). Fluorescent levels were increased in parallel with lipid release in 293/2c cells when treated with ALLN, whereas the increase was slight and unsustainable in 293/6c (data not shown). Gö6976, a PKC inhibitor (25.Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G. Hug H. Marme D. Schachtele C. J. Biol.

In 293/2c cells, the enhancement of apoA-I-mediated lipid release and ABCA1-GFP induction was inhibited (Figs. 8A and 11, A-C). In 293/6c cells, suppression of the apoA-I-mediated lipid release by PMA was recovered (Fig. 11, D and E), whereas the ABCA7-GFP level was reduced to the control level (Figs. 8B and 11F). Gö6976 alone had no significant effects on apoA-I-mediated lipid release from 293/2c or 293/6c (Fig. 11). The function and its regulation of human ABCA7 was studied"

In this study, we show that Chk1 interacts with Hsp90, a molecular chaperone that participates in the folding, assembly, maturation, and stabilization of specific proteins known as clients. Consistent with Chk1 being an Hsp90 client, we also found that Chk1 but not Chk2 is destabilized in cells treated with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG). 17-AAG-mediated Chk1 loss blocked the ability of Chk1 to target Cdc25A for proteolytic destruction, demonstrating that the Chk1 signaling pathway was disrupted in the 17-AAG-treated cells. Finally, 17-AAG-mediated disruption of Chk1 activation dramatically sensitized various tumor cells to gemcitabine, an S phase-active chemotherapeutic agent. Collectively, our studies identify Chk1 as a novel Hsp90 client and suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of Hsp90 may sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapeutic agents by disrupting Chk1 function during replication stress.

Hsp90 is a ubiquitously expressed and abundant molecular chaperone that participates in the folding, assembly, maturation, and stabilization of specific proteins (known as clients). Hsp90 carries out these functions as an integral component of a multiprotein chaperone complex that contains additional chaperones and co-chaperones (reviewed in Refs. 1Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 157-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Neckers L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S55-S61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 3Pratt W. Toft D. Exp. Biol. Med. 2003; 228: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Hsp90 regulates client function by cycling between two physiologically important states. In its ATP-bound state, Hsp90 interacts with co-chaperones Cdc37, p23, and an assortment of immunophilin-like proteins, forming a complex that stabilizes and protects client proteins from proteasomal degradation (1Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 157-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Neckers L. Trends Mol.

In its ADP-bound form, Hsp90 recruits Hsp70 and p60/Hop, forming a complex that targets clients for proteasomal degradation. Many new Hsp90 clients have been discovered recently with the aid of the Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin, radicicol, and their derivatives. These agents occupy the Hsp90 ATP-binding site, mimicking the ADP-bound state and targeting clients to the proteasome for degradation (4Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W.

Several of these clients, such as Akt, Her2/Neu, Bcr-Abl, and Raf-1, are important participants in signaling pathways that drive tumor cell proliferation and survival (8Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar, 9Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. Ann.

In addition to their role in proliferation, the constitutive activation of these signaling proteins also enhances the survival of tumor cells following DNA damage. Thus, Hsp90-directed therapy has been viewed as a mechanism to simultaneously target numerous oncogenic signaling pathways and sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic agents (2Neckers L. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: S55-S61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 12Blagosklonny M.V. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although the oncogenic signaling pathways enhance survival following DNA damage, DNA damage also activates checkpoint signaling pathways that play pivotal roles in the survival of genotoxin-treated cells. The DNA damage-activated checkpoint pathways are evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways that regulate cell cycle progression, programmed cell death, and DNA repair (reviewed in Refs. 13Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar and 14Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). One checkpoint signaling pathway that has emerged as a key regulator of cellular responses is the Chk1 signaling pathway, which is activated by replication stress and various types of DNA damage. Following replication fork stalling, single-stranded regions of DNA accumulate that bind the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (15Walter J. Newport J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 16Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A.

RPA binding is then followed by the chromatin recruitment of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase ATR and its binding partner ATRIP (18Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). The stalled fork also recruits DNA polymerase α (16Lupardus P.J. Byun T. Yee M.C. Hekmat-Nejad M. Cimprich K.A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), which then participates in the Rad17-dependent recruitment of the PCNA-like Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) clamp complex to chromatin (17You Z.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Once bound to chromatin, the 9-1-1 complex facilitates the ATR-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 (reviewed in Ref. 20Melo J. Toczyski D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Activated Chk1 performs several functions that promote cell survival. First, Chk1 increases the time available for DNA repair by arresting cells in G2. This arrest occurs when Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25C and Cdc25A, two cell cycle phosphatases that activate the Cdk1-cyclin B complex (reviewed in Ref. 21Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, activated Chk1 slows progression through S phase by blocking the firing of unfired origins of the replication (22Guo N. Faller D.V. Vaziri C. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 23Heffernan T.P. Simpson D.A. Frank A.R. Heinloth A.N. Paules R.S. Cordeiro-Stone M. Kaufmann W.K. Mol.

In this checkpoint, Chk1 phosphorylates Cdc25A, leading to Cdc25A degradation (24Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 26Shimuta K. Nakajo N. Uto K. Hayano Y. Okazaki K. Sagata N.

Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Because Cdc25A is required for activation of Cdk2 complexes, which then control the firing of origins of replication, activation of this pathway blocks S phase progression (28Sexl V. Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. Ashmun R. Beach D. Roussel M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 29Blomberg I. Hoffman I. Mol.

Although the relevant substrate is not known, in the absence of Chk1 function, the stalled forks irreversibly collapse. Correspondingly, disruption of the Chk1 signaling pathway is associated with increased sensitivity to genotoxins. For example, cells lacking the upstream regulators Hus1 and Rad9 are highly sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (32Weiss R.S. Enoch T. Leder P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1886-1898PubMed Google Scholar, 33Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Oestreich A.J. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

Additionally, cells in which Chk1 has been deleted by gene targeting are sensitive to the replication inhibitor aphidicolin and ionizing radiation (25Zachos G. Rainey M.D. Gillespie D.A.

Taken together, these observations have raised the possibility that inhibitors of the Chk1 signaling pathway may be useful clinical agents to sensitize tumor cells to genotoxic chemotherapy agents; however, no clinically viable Chk1 inhibitor has yet emerged. Although a variety of previous studies have implicated Hsp90 function in signaling pathways regulating cell growth, survival, and apoptosis, the role of Hsp90 in checkpoint signaling has not been explored. Moreover, it remains unclear how Hsp90 inhibitors sensitize tumor cells to genotoxic chemotherapeutics. In the present study, we investigated whether Hsp90 regulates genotoxin-induced checkpoint signaling pathways. We report that Chk1 is an Hsp90 client that is lost from cells treated with 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), 1The abbreviations used are: 17-AAG17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycinGSTglutathione S-transferaseHAhemagglutininMTS3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethony phenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium. a geldanamycin derivative that is used in clinical trials for the treatment of tumors.

Cell Culture, Cell Cycle Analysis, and Cell Transfection—HeLa, OVCAR3, and ML-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cell cycle was analyzed by incubating trypsinized cells in 0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 1 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. Cell cycle profiles were obtained by flow cytometry and analyzed with CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). For HeLa cell transfections, the cells were trypsinized (0.5–1 × 107 cells/transfection), resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, and resuspend in 0.35 ml of the same medium. Plasmid DNA (40 μg/transfection) dissolved in RPMI 1640 was then added to the cells and incubated for 5 min. The cell-DNA mix was transferred to a 0.4-cm electroporation cuvette and electroporated with a 10-mS, 350-V pulse in a BTX T820 square wave electroporator. The cells were then replated and cultured for 20–24 h. Reagents and Antibodies—17-AAG was obtained from R. Schultz (Developmental Therapeutics Program, National Cancer Institute) and from T. Mueller (Kosan Biosciences). Purified GST-Cdc25C (amino acids 200–256) was prepared as described (42Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T.

Chk1 Kinase Assays—HeLa cells (1 × 107) were transfected with 2 μg of pEF-BOS-Chk1-HA2 and 38 μg of empty vector as described above. Following overnight incubation, the cells were pretreated with Me2SO or 17-AAG for 1 h prior to treatment with gemcitabine. Following an additional 1-h incubation, the cells were lysed, and HA-tagged Chk1 was immunoprecipitated using HA-conjugated agarose following a previously described Chk1 assay procedure (48Zhao S. Weng Y.C. Yuan S.S. Lin Y.T. Hsu H.C. Lin S.C. Gerbino E. Song M.H. Zdzienicka M.Z. Gatti R.A. Shay J.W. Ziv Y. Shiloh Y. Lee E.Y. Nature. 2000; 405: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The immunopurified Chk1 was then incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and the Chk1 substrate GST-Cdc25C (encoding amino acids 200–256 of Cdc25C) at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were terminated by adding 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The kinase reactions were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized using an Amersham Biosciences storm 840 Phosphorimager. Immunoprecipitations—HeLa cells were plated in 10-cm dishes and grown to 90% confluence prior to cell lysis. Approximately 3 × 107 cells were lysed for 10 min on ice in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 nm microcystin-LR, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin. To identify the Chk1-Hsp90 interaction, the buffer described above was supplemented with 20 mm sodium molybdate. The lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C at 15,000 × g. The clarified lysates were then immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies. Washed immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with antibodies as described above to detect associated proteins. Immunoblotting—The cell lysates were prepared as described for immunoprecipitations. The cell lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Anti-phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) immunoblotting was performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Cell Signaling Technology). To detect HA-tagged proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp90, the immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with biotinylated anti-HA antibody. Biotinylated anti-HA antibody was detected with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. All other immunoblots were performed as previously described (45Volkmer E. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 567-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 46Burtelow M.A. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26343-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Cell Viability—The cells were treated with varying concentrations of gemcitabine and 17-AAG for 24–48 h and stained with trypan blue. Viable (trypan blue-excluding) and nonviable (trypan blue-stained) cells were then counted using a hemocytometer. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethonyphenol)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assays were performed by plating 15,000 cells/well in 96-well plates, treating with drugs as described, and processing according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). The Hsp90 Inhibitor 17-AAG Selectively Destabilizes Chk1— Many key signaling proteins in mammalian cells are Hsp90 clients. One way to identify potential Hsp90 clients is to examine whether a given protein is destabilized when cells are treated with an Hsp90 inhibitor. To examine whether any of the proteins in the Chk1 signaling pathway are potential Hsp90 clients, we treated HeLa cells with 1 μm 17-AAG, a concentration that maximally disrupts Hsp90 function (49Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Munster P.N. Rosen N. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 50Munster P.N. Srethapakdi M. Moasser M.M. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2945-2952PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular levels of Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, Rad17, ATR, and Chk1 were then examined by immunoblotting at various time points after 17-AAG addition (Fig. 1A). The levels of Rad9, Hus1, Rad1, Rad17, and ATR were not affected by 17-AAG treatment. In contrast, Chk1 levels were reduced by an 8-h 17-AAG treatment and were maximally suppressed after 24 h of exposure (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Radicicol, a structurally unrelated Hsp90 inhibitor also depleted Chk1 (data not shown). We also examined whether Chk1 disappeared in OVCAR3 cells (Fig. 1B), an ovarian tumor line, and ML-1 cells (Fig. 1C), a myeloid leukemia cell line. In both cell lines, 17-AAG promoted Chk1 loss, demonstrating that the effect of 17-AAG on Chk1 levels is not limited to a single cell line. To determine whether another checkpoint protein kinase was affected by Hsp90 inhibition, we also examined Chk2 levels in all three 17-AAG-treated cell lines (Fig. 1). Like Chk1, Chk2 is also activated by DNA damage but responds primarily to double-stranded DNA breaks in an ATM-dependent manner. Unlike Chk1, Chk2 levels did not decrease with 17-AAG treatment. Taken together, these results indicated that Chk1 is selectively lost when Hsp90 is inhibited. Chk1 levels are low in cells in G1/G0, (51Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Kaneko Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The fact that geldanamycin and 17-AAG induce G1 and G2/M arrest (50Munster P.N. Srethapakdi M. Moasser M.M. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2945-2952PubMed Google Scholar, 52Nimmanapalli R. O'Bryan E.

DiStefano F. Workman P. Clarke P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4003-4009PubMed Google Scholar) raised the possibility that 17-AAG-induced Chk1 loss was merely the result of cell cycle redistribution caused by 17-AAG. To address this question, we devised a strategy to arrest cells in S phase, where Chk1 levels are high (51Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Kaneko Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were blocked in S phase by treating them with a low concentration of gemcitabine, a nucleoside analog that is incorporated by DNA polymerase into replicating DNA, blocking further chain elongation (55Kaye S.B. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 78: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 56Noble S. Goa K.L. Drugs. 1997; 54: 447-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Gemcitabine-treated HeLa cells accumulated in S phase (Fig. 2A) and activated the Chk1 signaling pathway as evidenced by Chk1 phosphorylation on Ser345 (Fig. 2B), a site that is phosphorylated by ATR and is essential for Chk1 activation (57Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 58Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). As previously reported, treatment with 17-AAG alone resulted in an accumulation of cells in G1 and G2/M (Fig. 2A). In contrast, when the cells were pretreated with gemcitabine, which slowed their progression through S phase, and then treated with 17-AAG, they remained in S phase. Under these conditions, Chk1 levels were also dramatically reduced (Fig. 2B, lane 4), and, correspondingly, Chk1 phosphorylation on Ser345 was not detected. This demonstration that Chk1 is lost in S phase-arrested cells indicates that Chk1 loss is not due to cell cycle arrest in G1. Chk1 Interacts with Hsp90 —Because many proteins that are destabilized by 17-AAG treatment are bona fide Hsp90 clients, the results in Figs. 1 and 2 raised the possibility that Chk1 may also be an Hsp90 client. An additional characteristic of Hsp90 clients is that they interact with Hsp90. To evaluate a potential Chk1-Hsp90 interaction, we immunoprecipitated endogenous Chk1 and the previously identified Hsp90 client Akt (59Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 60Basso A.D. Solit D.B. Chiosis G. Giri B. Tsichlis P. Rosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39858-39866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) from HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 3A). No Hsp90 was found in the preimmune serum control, whereas both Akt and Chk1 co-immunoprecipitated with Hsp90. We also performed the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiment. However, because Chk1 co-migrates with immunoglobulin heavy chain, we always detected the co-migrating immunoglobulin heavy chain when we immunoblotted for Chk1 (data not shown). To circumvent this problem, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with HA-tagged Chk1 and immunoblotted the immunoprecipitates with biotinylated anti-HA monoclonal antibody, which allowed detection of Chk1 in the Hsp90 immunoprecipitates without interference from the heavy chain (Fig. 3B). As has been reported previously for other Hsp90 clients (61Fujita N. Sato S. Ishida A. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10346-10353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 62Grammatikakis N. Lin J.H. Grammatikakis A. Tsichlis P.N. Cochran B.H. Mol.

A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), Hsp90 inhibition decreased the interaction between Hsp90 and Chk1. As controls, we also examined the interaction between Hsp90 and two additional HA-tagged proteins: Hus1, which is not an Hsp90 client, and c-Raf, a bona fide Hsp90 client. As expected, Hus1 did not co-precipitate with Hsp90, whereas c-Raf associated strongly with Hsp90. Like the Hsp90-Chk1 interaction, the Hsp90-c-Raf interaction was also disrupted by 17-AAG. These results, in conjunction with the results in Fig. 1, strongly suggest that Chk1 is indeed an Hsp90 client. The Chk1 Signaling Pathway Is Not Rapidly Inhibited in 17-AAG-treated Cells—The results presented above demonstrated that Chk1 is an Hsp90 client and that Chk1 is slowly lost from 17-AAG-treated cells. However, Hsp90 inhibition occurs quickly following 17-AAG treatment, and some clients, such as the progesterone receptor, rapidly lose their ability to respond to stimuli when Hsp90 is inhibited (64Smith D.F. Whitesell L. Nair S.C. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hsp90 inhibition rapidly affects the ability of Chk1 to respond to upstream signals and to be activated by genotoxic stress, we pretreated cells with 17-AAG for 1 h and asked whether Chk1 was still phosphorylated on Ser345 by its upstream activating kinase ATR. As shown in Fig. 4A, 17-AAG did not block Chk1 phosphorylation, indicating that even when Hsp90 is inhibited, this client still responds to upstream signals. Moreover, these results also indicate that short term Hsp90 inhibition does not block any of the upstream events required for Chk1 phosphorylation. To assess the effect of Hsp90 inhibition on Chk1 catalytic activity, we developed a Chk1 assay using transiently expressed HA-tagged Chk1 in HeLa cells. (We were unable to analyze endogenous Chk1 activity in any cell line we assayed (data not shown).) Treatment of HeLa cells with gemcitabine activated the catalytic activity of Chk1 (Fig. 4B), and this activation was not blocked by a 1-h pretreatment with 17-AAG. Taken together, these results suggest that Hsp90 is not required to continuously maintain Chk1 in a state that is able to receive and respond to upstream activating signals. 17-AAG-mediated Chk1 Loss Blocks Cdc25A Loss—Chk1-mediated Cdc25A phosphorylation leads to Cdc25A proteolytic destruction, thereby blocking cell cycle progression (24Zhao H.

https://openalex.org/W2017664937,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase is a widely expressed enzyme that catalyzes the essentially irreversible cleavage of the signaling molecule sphingosine 1-phosphate. To investigate whether sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase influences mammalian cell fate decisions, a recombinant human sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase fused to green fluorescent protein was expressed in HEK293 cells. The recombinant enzyme was active, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, and reduced baseline sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate levels. Stable overexpression led to diminished viability under stress, which was attributed to an increase in apoptosis and was reversible in a dose-dependent manner by exogenous sphingosine 1-phosphate. In contrast to sphingosine 1-phosphate, the products of the lyase reaction had no effect on apoptosis. Lyase enzymatic activity was required to potentiate apoptosis, because cells expressing a catalytically inactive enzyme behaved like controls. Stress increased the amounts of long- and very long-chain ceramides in HEK293 cells, and this was enhanced in cells overexpressing wild type but not catalytically inactive lyase. The ceramide increases appeared to be required for apoptosis, because inhibition of ceramide synthase with fumonisin B1 decreased apoptosis in lyase-overexpressing cells. Thus, sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase overexpression in HEK293 cells decreases sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate amounts but elevates stress-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis. This identifies sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase as a dual modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate and ceramide metabolism as well as a regulator of cell fate decisions and, hence, a potential target for diseases with an imbalance in these biomodulators, such as cancer.

S1P has been shown to activate an extracellular signaling pathway mediated through a family of specific G protein-coupled receptors (1.Kluk M. Hla T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 72-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 2.Pyne S. Pyne N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, evidence indicates that S1P also mediates effects through a receptor-independent mechanism by functioning as a second messenger within cells (3.Payne S. Milstien S. Spiegel S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 54-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Intracellular S1P levels are regulated primarily by three highly conserved enzymes: sphingosine kinase (SPHK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of sphingosine-producing S1P, S1P phosphatase (S1PP), which reverses the former reaction, and S1P lyase (SPL), a PLP-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the essentially irreversible cleavage of S1P at the C2-3 carboncarbon bond, yielding ethanolamine phosphate and a long-chain aldehyde (4.Maceyka M.

Toward that end, altered SPL expression in a variety of cell lines and mutant model systems has yielded pronounced effects and severe phenotypes.

In mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, disruption of the SPL gene enhances cellular differentiation in response to retinoic acid (12.Kihara A. Ikeda M. Kariya Y. Lee E. Lee Y. Igarashi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14578-14585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Dictyostelium discoideum SPL expression is required for global functions, including embryogenesis, reproduction, survival, and movement (13.Herr D. Fyrst H. Phan V. Heinecke K. Georges R. Harris G. Saba J. Development. 2003; 130: 2443-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14.Mendel J. Heinecke K. Fyrst H. Saba J. J. Biol.

These observations indicate that SPL has important and, in some cases, essential functions in cells and organisms. The effects of manipulating SPL expression are presumed, and in some cases have been demonstrated, to be secondary to alterations in intracellular pools of S1P and its availability to carry out downstream signaling functions. However, the specific intracellular mechanisms by which SPL exerts its effects are not well understood.In this study, a recombinant human SPL-GFP fusion protein was expressed in HEK293 cells to elevate SPL activity and diminish cellular S1P. Somewhat unexpectedly, stable expression also enhanced stress-induced increases in ceramide. Overexpression of catalytically active SPL also increased apoptosis, which was reversed by the addition of exogenous S1P or the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1. In contrast, the products of the reaction catalyzed by SPL, ethanolamine phosphate, and long-chain aldehydes, did not promote apoptosis. These studies show that SPL can affect cell fate and influence sphingolipid metabolism beyond the regulation of intracellular S1P.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—d-erythro-Sphingosine, fumonisin B1, ethanolamine phosphate, and MTT reagent were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO), [4,5-3H]d-erythro-dihydrosphingosine 1-phosphate (DHS1P) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO), S1P was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), ISP-1 was from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA), Sequenase 2.0 and [l-14C]serine were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ), and Taq polymerase and PCR reagents were from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). Hexadecenal and hexadecanal were synthesized essentially as described previously (16.Baumann W. Schmid H. Mangold H. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 132-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).cDNA Cloning—BLAST search using the mouse SPL cDNA sequence against GenBank™ dbEST identified two homologous human EST sequences, GenBank™ accession numbers T86263 and AA338781 (17.Zhou J. Saba J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). T86263 was homologous to the 3′-end and AA338781 to the 5′ region of mouse SPL. To clone the overlapping region of these two ESTs, primers H070F2 (Table I) and H967R2 were used for PCR amplification of the target cDNA from a human cDNA library constructed in the yeast shuttle vector pADNS (18.Colicelli J. Birchmeier C. Michaeli T. O'Neill K. Riggs M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3599-3603Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This PCR product was then cloned into pBluescript, and DNA sequencing was performed using the Sanger method (19.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52361) Google Scholar). To clone the remainder of the 5′-end of the hSPL cDNA, a generic primer, ADHP2 (based on the vector's promoter sequence), and a gene-specific primer, H967R3 (based on EST sequence T86263), were used for PCR amplification using the same cDNA library. The coding region of the hSPL cDNA was then re-cloned by RT-PCR amplification of total RNA from normal human diploid fibroblasts using N-terminal primer 5′-H967 and C-terminal primer 3′-H967. This RT-PCR product was cloned into pBluescript SK(+) at KpnI/XhoI sites to give plasmid, pBS/hSPL.Table ISequence of primers used for PCR and RT-PCR cloning of hSPL cDNAPrimerSequenceH070F25′-CGCATATGATTTTGGAAGTATACTCCACAAAAGC-3′H967R25′-CATGCGGCCGCGGAGAACCATTCCATCTGGCTGCCC-3′ADHP25′-TACAATGTCTATCCCAGAAACTCA-3′H967R35′-GTCGCGGCCGCATAGATGGCACCCATTCCTGTGG-3′5′-H9675′-GCTGGTACCATATGCCTAGCACAGACCTTCTGATGTTGAAG-3′3′-H9675′-GACTCGAGACTAGAAAGGGTCCAAGTTCAGTGG-3′ Open table in a new tab DNA Vector Constructs—The hSPL coding sequence was subcloned into pcDNA3.0 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at KpnI/NotI sites with an engineered ribosome binding site corresponding to the Kozak sequence, GCCACCATGG, for efficient expression in mammalian cells (20.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This construct is referred to as pc-hSPL. A change of the coding sequence from +4 C to +4 G after the start codon ATG changes the codon for a proline to that of an alanine residue. The pc-hSPL-GFP fusion construct was generated by cloning of the GFP coding region (a gift from G. Watson, Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute, Oakland, CA) in-frame with the C terminus of hSPL in pc-hSPL.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Tissue Culture Facility UCSF, San Francisco, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.25 μg/ml), except where otherwise noted. For transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded at 1.5 × 106 cells in 60-mm dishes in normal medium. After 20 h, cells were transfected with the appropriate vector construct using Effectene™ transfection reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Transfection efficiency was determined by fluorescence microscopy by quantifying the proportion of GFP-positive cells. For transient transfection experiments, cells were harvested at 24-48 h after transfection. To obtain stably transfected cell lines, cells were exposed to selection medium containing G418 at 1 mg/ml at 48 h after transfection. Single clones of stably transfected cells were isolated and selected for evaluation according to the most intense green fluorescence indicating strongest protein expression of recombinant hSPL. S1P (dissolved in methanol prior to use) was added at 12 h after serum deprivation; fumonisin B1 (dissolved in PBS) was added 24 h prior to harvest. Ethanolamine phosphate was dissolved in water. Hexadecanal and hexadecenal were dissolved in ethanol and delivered in a 1:1 molar complex with bovine serum albumin.Western Blotting—For detection of mammalian SPL protein, an antibody was raised in rabbit against a peptide sequence comprised of 10 amino acid residues (residue #559-568, Ser-Gln-Met-Asn-Gly-Ser-ProLys-Pro-His-COO-) at the C terminus of the hSPL protein (Genmed Synthesis, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed by repeated freeze-thawing in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in the same buffer. For each lane, 50 μg of protein from the pellet was separated by 8% SDS-PAGE prior to immunoblotting with the above antibody. Bands were visualized with chemiluminescent reagent, BM Chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse/rabbit IgG. For cytochrome c release, cells were harvested at 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post-serum deprivation, lysed by suspension in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm potassium chloride, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 15 μg/ml chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A) and homogenized with glass beads. Mitochondria-free cytosolic extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g in a microcentrifuge for 5 min to remove the nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min to pellet mitochondria, and this supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Twenty micrograms of S-100 proteins from each sample were electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, followed by Western transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in a solution containing 5% dry fat-free milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies, either mouse anti-cytochrome c (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) or mouse anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit II (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), were diluted 1:2,000 in the blocking buffer and were incubated with the membranes for 90 min, followed by four washes of 5 min each in blocking buffer. Secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Pierce, Rockford, IL), were diluted 1:15,000 in blocking buffer and allowed to react with the washed membranes for 60 min followed by three washes of 5 min each in blocking buffer and a last wash in PBS alone. The antibody-antigen complexes were visualized using a SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit from Pierce following the manufacturer's instructions.SPL Assay—Cells were homogenized by glass bead disruption and vortexing for 15 min in extraction buffer (21.Van Veldhoven P.P. Mannaerts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12502-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude membrane fractions were obtained by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Pellets were resuspended by sonication for 5-s intervals with repeats at low voltage. Protein content was determined by the Bradford method using Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA). SPL activity was determined using [4,5-3H]d-erythro-DHS1P as substrate. 50 μg of protein was assayed, and reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 60 min.SPL-GFP Localization and Microscopy—Co-localization of recombinant SPL to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was performed by comparing the pattern of fluorescence from the hSPL-GFP fusion protein versus that of a red fluorescent protein containing the ER targeting sequence of calreticulin and the ER retention sequence KDEL in HEK293 cells stably expressing hSPL-GFP and transiently transfected with the mammalian expression vector pDsRed2-ER (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Cells were grown on glass slides and visualized using a Zeiss 510 UV-visible laser scanning confocal microscope and Zeiss Plan-Apo 100×, 1.4 numerical aperture objective. The optical section thickness of both channels was equalized by adjusting the pinhole diameters of each channel. Channel one was set to one Airy; channel two was changed accordingly. The DsRed2 was excited by a 543-nm excitation light, and emitted fluorescence was collected through an LP 560 emission filter. The GFP was excited by a 488-nm excitation light, and emitted fluorescence was collected through a 505-550 BP emission filter. Image processing and visualization was performed using Bitplane Imaris software running on a Windows XP workstation.Sphingolipid Measurements—For sphingolipid measurements in stably transfected cell lines, sphingolipids were analyzed by liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization, and tandem mass spectrometry as described previously (22.Sullards M.C. Merrill Jr, A.H. Science's STKE. 2001; 67: PL1Google Scholar, 23.Sullards M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 312: 32-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The internal standards for quantitation of the sphingolipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).Labeling and Isolation of Cellular Sphingolipids and Phospholipids—Biosynthesis of sphingolipids was determined by following incorporation of l-[14C]serine into newly synthesized sphingolipids as previously described (24.van Echten-Deckert G. Zschoche A. Bar T. Schmidt R. Raths A. Heinemann T. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15825-15833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells per dish in 100-mm dishes and grown under standard conditions in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 24 h. Medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing 1 μCi/ml l-[14C-]serine (specific activity, 57 mCi/mmol). After 24 h, cells were harvested and lipids extracted from cell pellets by incubating with chloroform/methanol/water/pyridine (60:30:6:1, v/v) for 48 h at 50 °C. After extraction, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and 25% of the supernatant was removed for phospholipid analysis. To isolate sphingolipids, the remaining extract was treated with mild alkaline hydrolysis (100 mm methanolic NaOH at 37 °C for 2 h), neutralized with glacial acetic acid, desalted by reversed-phase chromatography on LiChroprep RP18, applied to 60-mm silica TLC plates, and chromatographed with chloroform/methanol/0.22% CaCl2 (60:35:8, v/v). Phospholipids were applied to silica gel HL TLC plates and chromatographed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (25:15:4:2, v/v) as previously described (25.Skipski V. Peterson R. Barclay M. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Lipids were visualized by autoradiography and identified by their RF values, and radioactivity incorporated was determined by scraping and liquid scintillation counting. Sphingolipid biosynthesis was estimated by measuring l-[14C]serine incorporation into total cellular sphingolipids as well as into total sphingomyelin and was normalized independently to the number of cells harvested and to total cellular phosphatidylcholine (26.Ramstedt B. Leppimaki P. Axberg M. Slotte J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-specific mutagenesis was performed by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Denatured plasmid containing the hSPL cDNA was annealed to a set of mutagenic primers (same target sequence on both DNA strands), 5′-GCATTTCAGCTGACACCCATCTGTATGGCTATGCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGCATAGCCATACAGATGGGTGTCAGCTGAAATGC-3′, which contain the mutagenic codon CTG for leucine (lysine → leucine). The mutagenesis reaction was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction. The mutated plasmid construct, referred to as pc-hSPL(K353L)-GFP, was then sequenced to confirm the mutation.Cell Proliferation (MTT) Assay—Equal number of cells was grown in 96-well plates under the stated conditions for up to 60 h. At the designated time points, MTT reagent was added to a final dilution of 1:10, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Supernatant was removed by aspiration, 100 μl of Me2SO was added to each well, and plates were covered with foil and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cell proliferation was determined by absorbance at 570 nm. Readings were maintained in the range of 0.75-1.25 relative units of optical density by choosing the optimal cell density when seeding the cells.Caspase-3 Assay—Cell lysates were prepared by sonicating pellets in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm DTT) for 15 s on ice twice, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and extraction of the supernatant. Caspase-3 activity was determined by fluorometric assay measuring the release of the fluorescent moiety 7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (AFC) from the C terminus of the peptide substrate N-acetyl-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (Biomol Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). 50 μg of protein was assayed in reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, 0.1% CHAPS, 1% sucrose, 2 mm DTT) at room temperature over 2 h. Fluorescence activity was measured every 15 min at 400-nm excitation and 505-nm emission wavelength. Enzyme activity was calculated by regression analysis as nanomoles of free AFC/min/mg of protein.RESULTSCloning and Characterization of Recombinant Human SPL—We previously reported the identification of SPL cDNA from Mus musculus (17.Zhou J. Saba J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 502-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Using the BLAST search program we compared the mouse SPL cDNA sequence against the Genbank™ EST data base and identified two homologous human EST sequences. Using this EST sequence information and a PCR cloning strategy as described under “Experimental Procedures,” we cloned human SPL (hSPL) cDNA from a human cDNA library. The coding region of hSPL was then re-cloned by RT-PCR from normal human diploid fibroblast RNA, and resequenced on both strands. This full-length open reading frame of hSPL cDNA contains 1707 nucleotides (GenBank™ accession number AF144638) encoding 568 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 63,482 Da. This sequence is consistent with that recently published by others (27.Van Veldhoven P.P. Gijsbers S. Mannaerts G.P. Vermeesch J.R. Brys V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To confirm that the cloned sequence encoded human SPL, it was expressed in the S. cerevisiae Δdpl1 mutant strain, which is devoid of SPL enzyme activity and is especially sensitive to the toxic effects of exogenous d-erythro-sphingosine. Expression of hSPL in this background using the pYES2 yeast expression vector (Invitrogen) resulted in correction of sphingosine hypersensitivity and restoration of SPL enzyme activity (data not shown).Overexpression of Recombinant hSPL in HEK293 Cells— HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with hSPL using the pcDNA3.0 expression system. Western blotting with an antibody recognizing mouse and human SPL demonstrated a large increase in hSPL protein in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. The endogenous SPL protein, however, was not detectable under these immunoblotting conditions (Fig. 1). As shown in Table II, the majority of both the endogenous and recombinant hSPL activity resides in the membrane fraction. Furthermore, SPL activity in the membrane fraction of extracts from hSPL-transfected HEK293 cells was more than 100-fold higher than vector transfected cells, indicating that the recombinant protein is active. A fusion protein constructed to contain hSPL and GFP, pc-hSPL-GFP, localized to the ER (Fig. 2) and demonstrated similar activity to recombinant hSPL, as shown in Fig. 3.Table IISPL activity in membrane and cytosol of untransfected and human SPL-transfected HEK293 cells Unmanipulated or transiently pc-hSPL-transfected HEK293 cells were propagated for 48 h after transfection.

To determine whether human SPL expression directly affects cell fate decisions, cell lines stably expressing the hSPL-GFP fusion protein were generated. In all experiments, pooled stable transfectants were employed, to avoid potential mutations or artifacts associated with the selection and propagation of individual clones from single transfected cells. The hSPL-GFP-overexpressing cells demonstrated a 19-fold increase in SPL activity compared with cells stably transfected with a GFP control construct (Fig. 3). Under normal growth conditions, cells overexpressing hSPL-GFP appeared morphologically similar to the control cells; growth characteristics, as determined by cell number and MTT assay, were indistinguishable (Fig. 4). However, when deprived of serum, the two groups behaved differently. Whereas the control cells exhibited a leveling off of the growth curve, the hSPL-GFP-expressing cells demonstrated a marked reduction in cell number beginning at 36 h and continuing through 60 h of culture.Fig. 4Diminished viability of cells overexpressing human SPL. HEK293 cells stably transfected with either empty vector or pc-hSPL-GFP were grown in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were then replaced into medium containing either 0% or 10% fetal calf serum. Aliquots were removed at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 h after reseeding and were analyzed for viability using the MTT assay. Closed squares represent vector-transfected HEK293 cells in medium containing 10% serum; open squares represent pc-hSPL-GFP-transfected HEK293 cells in medium containing 10% serum; closed circles represent vector-transfected HEK293 cells in serum-free medium; open circles represent pc-hSPL-GFP-transfected HEK293 cells in serum-free medium.

We have studied a series of synthetic lipid A mimetic compounds known as aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates in which the length of the secondary acyl chain has been systematically varied. Using transcriptional profiling of human monocytes and responses of Toll-like receptor 4 complex cell transfectants, we demonstrate a clear dependence of length on secondary acyl chain on Toll-like receptor 4 activation. Compounds with secondary acyl chains less than eight carbons in length have dramatically reduced activity, and substitutions of the left-sided secondary acyl chain had the most important effect on the Toll-like receptor 4 agonist activity of these molecules. The structure-function relationships of these compounds assessed via the induction of chemokines and cytokines following in vivo administration closely mirrored those seen with cell-based studies.

The ability of an organism to protect itself from microbial challenge requires the rapid recognition of “pathogen-associated molecular patterns,” conserved structural motifs found throughout the microbial world. Toll-like receptors are a family of structurally related surface receptors that play an important role in transducing an inflammatory signal in response to pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition. Toll was originally identified as a Drosophila gene essential for embryonic development and antifungal immunity (1Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar).

Acta. 2001; 1518: 157-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). While all TLRs have similar structural features (e.g. extracellular leucine-rich repeats and cytoplasmic domains with homology to the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor), each TLR alone as a homodimer (e.g. TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, and TLR9) or in combination with another TLR as a heterodimer (e.g. TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6) is capable of recognizing distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns due to unique structural motifs (5Takeda K. Kaisho T. Akira S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 335-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (4751) Google Scholar). Interestingly several natural and synthetic TLR ligands have been demonstrated to have significant clinical utility both as vaccine adjuvants and as stand-alone immunomodulatory agents (6Persing D.H.

One of the best studied interactions between a microbial pathogen-associated molecular pattern and a TLR is the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, by TLR4 (for a review, see Ref. 9Kimbrell D.A. Beutler B. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Beutler and colleagues (10Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E.

Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6451) Google Scholar) first identified TLR4 as the “LPS receptor” by positional cloning studies in the LPS hyporesponder mouse strains C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr. The critical role of TLR4 in the transduction of an inflammatory signal by LPS has been confirmed in studies using mice with a deletion of TLR4. In addition, two additional proteins have been identified that interact with TLR4 and are implicated in LPS recognition, MD-2 and CD14. MD-2 is a secreted molecule that physically interacts with TLR4 (11da Silva Correia J. Soldau K. Christen U. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21129-21135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), and genetic data (12Poltorak A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Citterio S. Beutler B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2163-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) suggest that this molecule is required for LPS signaling via TLR4. CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane protein (devoid of a cytoplasmic signaling domain) with LPS binding activity. Collectively TLR4, MD-2, and CD14 form a trimolecular LPS receptor complex. The delineation of the precise molecular events associated with LPS binding and initiation of the signaling cascades via TLR4 remains an area of intense investigation. Lipid A is the active component of the LPS molecule that stimulates the TLR4 receptor complex (13Baker P.J. Hraba T. Taylor C.E. Myers K.R. Takayama K. Qureshi N. Stuetz P. Kusumoto S. Hasegawa A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 2694-2701Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid A structures show considerable variability between bacterial species, and individual Gram-negative species can modulate the structure of the lipid A on their surface in the context of infection (14Bishop R.E. Gibbons H.S. Guina T. Trent M.S. Miller S.I. Raetz C.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5071-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 15Guo L. Lim K.B. Poduje C.M. Daniel M. Gunn J.S. Hackett M. Miller S.I. Cell. 1998; 95: 189-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). These structural differences, in particular the degree of acylation, can dramatically modify their proinflammatory capacity. In general, highly acylated (e.g. hexa-acylated lipid A from Escherichia coli or Salmonella species) tend to be potent inflammatory stimulators, while less acylated lipid A structures (e.g. lipidIVA and lipid A from certain periodontal bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis) tend to be less inflammatory or even display LPS antagonist activity (16Mullarkey M. Rose J.R. Bristol J. Kawata T. Kimura A. Kobayashi S. Przetak M. Chow J. Gusovsky F. Christ W.J. Rossignol D.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Because these studies have generally used natural biological preparations of LPS, detailed structure-function studies of the interaction between lipid A and the TLR4 complex have not been possible. Important questions remain regarding the precise region of the lipid A molecule that is required to stimulate the TLR4 complex and the effect of specific changes in the lipid A molecule on CD14 and/or MD-2 dependence of TLR4 stimulation and the transcriptional responses that ensue. To address these questions, we have studied a series of synthetic lipid A mimetic compounds known as aminoalkyl glucosaminide phosphates (AGPs) (17Johnson D.A. Sowell C.G. Johnson C.L. Livesay M.T. Keegan D.S. Rhodes M.J. Ulrich J.T. Ward J.R. Cantrell J.L. Brookshire V.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2273-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The AGP classes of lipids are monosaccharide lipid A mimetics of a biologically active hexa-acylated component present in the widely used adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL® adjuvant). Because AGPs are prepared by chemical synthesis, we have been able to generate a library of closely related molecules with defined modifications in the acyl chain length. Using transcriptional profiling of human monocytes, responses of TLR4 receptor complex cell transfectants, and in vivo cytokine and chemokine responses, we were able to perform a detailed structure-function analysis of these hexa-acylated lipid A mimetics. Herein we demonstrate a clear dependence of TLR4 agonist activity on normal fatty acid (“secondary”) chain length with changes in either of the sugar secondary acyl chains having a more dramatic effect on function of the molecules than changes in the aglycon secondary acyl chain. Furthermore we highlight the potential utility of certain members of this novel class of compounds as stand-alone immunomodulators based on their TLR4 agonist activity. Chemical Synthesis of AGPs—The compounds used in this study are shown in Fig. 1 and were synthesized as described previously (17Johnson D.A. Sowell C.G. Johnson C.L. Livesay M.T. Keegan D.S. Rhodes M.J. Ulrich J.T. Ward J.R. Cantrell J.L. Brookshire V.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2273-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphates or AGPs are a class of lipid A mimetics in which the reducing sugar of lipid A has been replaced with an N-acylated aminoalkyl aglycon unit. The AGPs evaluated in this study (Fig. 1) contain an l-serine-based aglycon unit as well as three (R)-3-n-alkanoyloxytetradecanoyl residues comprised of even-numbered normal fatty acyl chains between 6 and 14 carbon atoms in length. The AGPs were prepared as described previously by a highly convergent method, which allowed chemical differentiation of the hydroxyl and amino groups and sequential introduction of the (R)-3-n-alkanoyloxytetradecanoyl residues. The seryl AGPs were purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (to >95% purity) and analyzed as their triethylammonium salts by standard analytical methods. Reagents—LPS from E. coli 0127:B8 was used as a positive control stimulant in all experiments and was purchased from Sigma, reconstituted in water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and frozen at -20 °C until use. Recombinant human interferon γ was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), reconstituted in phosphate-buffered saline, stored at -80 °C, and used at 1000 units/ml to activate macrophages. Human Monocyte-derived Macrophages—Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were derived by apheresis from healthy donors, purified over a Ficoll Hypaque 1.077 gradient, and stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Monocyte-derived macrophages were generated from adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells as described previously (18Probst P. Skeiky Y.A. Steeves M. Gervassi A. Grabstein K.H. Reed S.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2634-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the 5th day of culture, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with the indicated AGP concentrations. After 24 h of culture, the supernatant was removed and frozen at -20 °C until determination of cytokines by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). To prepare RNA for microarray experiments, the cell concentration was adjusted to 8 × 106 cells/ml, and 1 ml of this cell suspension was placed into each well of a 12-well plate (Corning, Corning, NY). On the 5th day, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with an AGP at 1 μg/ml. After 6 h of stimulation, the medium was carefully removed from all wells of the same stimulation, pooled, frozen, and then analyzed by ELISA for the presence of tumor-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). RNA was isolated from adherent cells by adding 0.5 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen) to each well of the plates, the cells were resuspended by pipetting up and down repeatedly, and all liquid was immediately frozen at -80 °C. For RNA isolation, the samples were thawed, and the cells were lysed by adding 1-mm zirconia beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) and vortexing for 45 s. After a chloroform extraction, the RNA was precipitated, and the integrity was checked by gel electrophoresis. RNA Amplification, cDNA Synthesis, and Probe Labeling—Total RNA was amplified by the modified Eberwine (“antisense”) RNA amplification protocol (19Luo L. Salunga R.C. Guo H. Bittner A. Joy K.C.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). All reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. After amplification, the concentration of antisense RNA was measured by spectrophotometry, and the quality was determined by gel electrophoresis. Amplified RNA (1.2 μg) was diluted in 16 μl of water and used as template for cDNA synthesis. All reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Probes were labeled as described elsewhere (22Mujumdar S.R. Mujumdar R.B. Grant C.M. Waggoner A.S. Bioconjug. Chem. 1996; 7: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Transfection of HeLa Cells and Reporter Assay—A HeLa cell transient transfection system was used to determine the roles of human TLR4, CD14, and MD-2 in the cellular response to AGPs. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen). HeLa cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate and transfected with 50 ng of IL-8 promoter-driven luciferase reporter and 10 ng of the indicated plasmids (23da Silva Correia J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The human CD14 cDNA used in this study was described previously (24Lee J.D. Kravchenko V. Kirkland T.N. Han J. Mackman N. Moriarty A. Leturcq D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9930-9934Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Human TLR4 cDNA was a kind gift of Dr. C. Janeway. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were stimulated for 6 h, lysed, and then analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity. A β-galactosidase construct was used for the normalization of enzyme activity (23da Silva Correia J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). 293 cells were stably transfected with TLR2, then transiently transfected with TLR1 and TLR6, and exposed to heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Cytokine ELISA—Monocyte-derived macrophages were cultivated as described elsewhere (18Probst P. Skeiky Y.A. Steeves M. Gervassi A. Grabstein K.H. Reed S.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2634-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After 5 days of culture, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium to which AGPs were added at the concentrations indicated. After 24 h, the supernatants were collected and stored at -20 °C until the day of analysis. Supernatants were analyzed for TNF-α by ELISA assay using an anti-human TNF-α antibody and a biotinylated anti-human TNF-α antibody (BD Biosciences). Clone Selection and PCR—Numerous human genes of interest were selected from the literature, and their cDNAs and expressed sequence tags were identified in GenBank™. This list of genes of interest included cytokines and cytokine receptors, chemokines and chemokine receptors, TLRs and TLR-associated proteins, adhesion molecules, kinases and phosphatases involved in signaling, transcription factors, a number of NFκB-controlled genes, apoptosis-related genes, and numerous miscellaneous genes of interest. Most of the cDNAs and expressed sequence tags used in this study were purchased from Research Genetics Invitrogen. A small number of clones were extracted form our in-house clone collections. E. coli clones were streaked on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates supplemented with an appropriate antibiotic, and single colonies served as the inoculum for the high throughput cultivation on 96-well plates (100 μl/well). After 24 h of cultivation, 1 μl of this cell suspension was collected and used as template to amplify plasmid inserts by PCR. PCR products were then screened on 1% agarose gels, purified using 96-well multiscreen PCR plates (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and eluted with 50% Me2SO, resulting in a concentration of DNA averaging 150 ng/μl. Finally PCR products were submitted for nucleotide sequencing to our in-house sequencing facility. The nucleotide sequence was submitted for BLAST search against GenBank™ to identify the human gene. Suitable PCR products were transferred to 384-well plates and stored at -80 °C prior to printing. Printing of Arrays—Approximately 1200 PCR products and controls were spotted onto 42 CMT-GAPS2 coated slides in triplicate (Corning) using an Affymetrix 417 arrayer (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Humidity control was maintained in the range of 45-52% using an ultrasonic humidifier (Model 696, Sunbeam, Boca Raton, FL). Following printing, the arrayed slides were UV cross-linked at 90 mJ overnight (Stratalinker, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and baked for 2 h at 80 °C. Prior to hybridization, the slides were prehybridized for a minimum of 45 min in a buffer consisting of 5× SSC, 1% bovine serum albumin, 25% formamide, and 0.1% SDS. Overall array quality was confirmed by hybridization to a Cy3 end-labeled, M13-reverse oligonucleotide (Qiagen Operon, Alameda, CA). Probe Labeling and Hybridization—Fluorescently labeled probes were generated from 1.5 μg of antisense RNA amplified as described above. The Cy3- (treated) or Cy5 (untreated)-labeled probes were generated using the amino-allyl method described elsewhere (25Hegde P. Qi R. Abernathy K. Gay C. Dharap S. Gaspard R. Hughes J.E. Snesrud E. Lee N. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 548-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar) and included in the microarray resources section of The Institute of Genomic Research (TIGR) Web site. To determine the sensitivity of the microarray, validate the labeling reaction, and test RNA quality, Arabidopsis control RNA (Spot Report-3, Stratagene) was spiked into each probe sample prior to cDNA synthesis. The corresponding Arabidopsis cDNAs were arrayed on each slide with a variety of human housekeeping control genes (β-actin, α-tubulin, phospholipase A2, transferrin, ribosomal protein s9, highly basic protein, and major histocompatibility complex class 1) in each of the four quadrants of the array. Probes were checked for successful labeling by spectrophotometry using a 2- or 5-μl cuvette and a Genespec 3 unit (MiraiBio Inc., Alameda, CA). Hybridizations and posthybridization washes were carried out as described by the slide manufacturer (Corning) for Me2SO arrays using a formamide hybridization buffer. Hydrophobic coverslips (Hybrislip, Grace Biolabs, Bend, OR) were used in place of glass coverslips. Two individual hybridizations were performed for each sample with similar results, and results of one hybridization are shown. Microarray Data Acquisition and Analysis—Following washing of arrays, slides were scanned using an Affymetrix 418 microarray scanner and saved as 16-bit TIFF files (Affymetrix). The Cy3 and Cy5 images for each array were overlaid, gridded, and quantified using Imagene software (Biodiscovery, Marina del Rey, CA). Hybridization data quality was evaluated using the mean signal to noise ratios for all cDNA spots, the mean signal to noise ratios for control spots, treated to untreated ratios for control, and spike-in spots and spot morphology. Normalization and further data analysis was performed using GeneSpring (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). The hybridization intensity of each spot was normalized to the median intensity of all non-control spots on the array. One-sample Student's t test p values (Table I) were calculated by GeneSpring to determine whether the mean normalized expression levels were statistically different from 1.0 (treated versus untreated).Table IGene expression Expression data (-fold scale) of genes affected in monocyte-derived macrophages are shown. Genes were selected based on stimulation with CRX-527 (10-10-10) (expression of ≥2- or ≤-0.5-fold with a t test p value ≤0.05) and are compared with CRX-560 (12-12-12), CRX-560 (14-14-14), and LPS.

Blood was collected 2 h following administration of the compounds, and the concentrations of serum cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) and chemokines (RANTES, MCP1, MIP1α, and KC) were determined using a custom Lincoplex cytokine array (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) and a Luminex 100 IS system (Luminex, Austin, TX). The results presented are the average of five mice/group with the error bars based on S.E. values. Chemical Structure of the Synthetic Lipid A Mimetics, AGPs—We previously described the synthesis of the AGP class of compounds, which are composed of a monosaccharide unit glycosidically linked to an N-acylated aminoalkyl aglycon unit (17Johnson D.A. Sowell C.G. Johnson C.L. Livesay M.T. Keegan D.S. Rhodes M.J. Ulrich J.T. Ward J.R. Cantrell J.L. Brookshire V.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1999; 9: 2273-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chemical synthesis readily permits variations in the fatty acid residues and the chemical nature and charge of the aglycon unit. In this study, we focused on changes in acyl chain length within a family of AGP molecules possessing an l-serine-based aglycon unit, the so-called “l-seryl” family. As shown in Fig. 1, every member of this family has 14 carbon atoms in the “primary” fatty acid, which is the β-hydroxy fatty acid attached directly to the AGP backbone. β-Hydroxymyristic acid is the most common of the primary fatty acids present in lipid A. With respect to the normal or secondary fatty acid chain length, we have synthesized compounds with 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-carbon acyl chains (Fig. 1A). In addition, we prepared a series of hybrid molecules based on the structure of CRX-527 (10-10-10) in which one or two of the 10-carbon acyl chains of CRX-527 (10-10-10) have been replaced with a six-carbon acyl chain (Fig. 1B). Collectively these compounds were used in a variety of cell-based and an in vivo model to determine structure-activity relationships related to AGP acyl chain length and stimulation via TLR4. Cytokine Production by Human Monocytes Is Dependent on AGP Acyl Chain Length and Position—While TLR4 is expressed on a variety of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells, monocytes and macrophages have been frequently studied as physiologically relevant LPS-sensitive cells (26Yang S.

The hallmark of monocyte and macrophage activation through Toll-like receptors is the activation of NFκB and the subsequent release of TNF-α and other cytokines and chemokines (28Xing Z. Jordana M. Kirpalani H. Driscoll K.E. Schall T.J. Gauldie J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 10: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). To determine the activity of our synthetic lipid A mimetic, AGPs, we exposed human monocyte-derived macrophages (21Van Gelder R.N. von Zastrow M.E. Yool A. Dement W.C. Barchas J.D. Eberwine J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) from three donors to various concentrations of these compounds and measured released TNF-α in the supernatant by ELISA. Fig. 2 shows the ELISA results for TNF-α presented as the average response from three donors. As shown in Fig. 2A, the amount of TNF-α release in response to the AGPs varied as a function of the secondary acyl chain (SAC) length. Specifically treatment of cells with AGPs carrying SACs 10 carbons or greater in length (CRX-527 (10-10-10), CRX-560 (12-12-12), and CRX-512 (14-14-14)) resulted in the production of TNF-α (Fig. 2A). In marked contrast, the compounds with SACs less than 10 carbons (CRX-526 (6-6-6) and CRX-555 (8-8-8)) did not elicit the production of TNF-α by the same cells (Fig. 2A) alone or with co-incubation of the cells with interferon γ (data not shown). Co-administration of interferon γ to the cells in addition to the respective AGPs augmented the induced levels of TNF-α observed but did not alter the relationship between acyl chain length and activity (data not shown). We consistently found that the compound with the 10-carbon SAC (CRX-527 (10-10-10)) was the most potent tested, maximally active at a concentration of less than or equal to 1 ng/ml. Compounds with SAC lengths of 12 and 14 carbon atoms were considerably less potent than CRX-527 (10-10-10) and showed a more clear dose-response relationship in the ng/ml to μg/ml concentration range (Fig. 2A). The same potency relationship was seen when these compounds were tested for the production of TNF-α using the U937 and THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cell lines (data not shown). These data highlighted a clear depen"

We found that L. monocytogenes lacking the lipoate protein ligase LplA1 was defective for growth specifically in the host cytosol and was less virulent in animals by a factor of 300. A major target for LplA1, the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), lacked a critical lipoyl modification when the DeltalplA1 strain was grown intracellularly, which suggests that abortive growth was due to loss of PDH function. Thus, the use of host-derived lipoic acid may be a critical process for in vivo replication of bacterial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2171705091,"Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world. Here, we identify a cDNA encoding a novel mucin protein, shown previously to be up-regulated in IgAN patients, from a human kidney cDNA library. This protein contains a mucin tandem repeat of 19 amino acids consisting of many threonine, serine, and proline residues and likely to be extensively O-glycosylated; thus, this gene was classified in the mucin family and named MUC20. The human MUC20 gene contains at least four exons and is localized close to MUC4 on chromosome 3q29. We found variations in repeat numbers in the mucin tandem domain, suggesting polymorphism of this region. Northern blot and reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that human MUC20 mRNA was expressed most highly in kidney and moderately in placenta, colon, lung, prostate, and liver. Immunohistochemical analysis of human kidney revealed that MUC20 protein was localized in the proximal tubules. Immunoblotting analysis of MUC20 proteins produced in Madin-Darby canine kidney and HEK293 cells indicated the localization of MUC20 protein in a membrane fraction and extensive posttranslational modification. Immunoelectron microscopy of MUC20-producing Madin-Darby canine kidney cells demonstrated that MUC20 protein was localized on the plasma membrane. Expression of MUC20 mRNA in a human kidney cell line was up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor-α, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or lipopolysaccharide. Two species of MUC20 mRNA (hMUC20-L and hMUC20-S), resulting from alternative transcription, were identified in human tissue, whereas only one variant was observed in mouse tissues. Mouse MUC20 mRNA was expressed in the epithelial cells of proximal tubules, and the expression increased dramatically with the progression of lupus nephritis in the kidney of MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice. Moreover, the expression of mouse MUC20 was augmented in renal tissues acutely injured by cisplatin or unilateral ureteral obstruction. These characteristics suggest that the production of MUC20 is correlated with development and progression of IgAN and other renal injuries. Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world. Here, we identify a cDNA encoding a novel mucin protein, shown previously to be up-regulated in IgAN patients, from a human kidney cDNA library.

Expression of MUC20 mRNA in a human kidney cell line was up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor-α, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, or lipopolysaccharide. Two species of MUC20 mRNA (hMUC20-L and hMUC20-S), resulting from alternative transcription, were identified in human tissue, whereas only one variant was observed in mouse tissues. Mouse MUC20 mRNA was expressed in the epithelial cells of proximal tubules, and the expression increased dramatically with the progression of lupus nephritis in the kidney of MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice. Moreover, the expression of mouse MUC20 was augmented in renal tissues acutely injured by cisplatin or unilateral ureteral obstruction. These characteristics suggest that the production of MUC20 is correlated with development and progression of IgAN and other renal injuries. Epithelial cell injury in renal tissue is a feature of many acute and chronic kidney diseases. Among the morphological changes observed are loss of the proximal tubular brush border, loss of cellular polarity, and dedifferentiation and apoptosis of the proximal tubule epithelial cells. During progression of renal injury, necrotic tubular epithelial cells detach from the basement membrane and cause intraluminal obstruction. After surviving dedifferentiated cells spread over the denuded basement membrane, functional epithelia are reformed by the dedifferentiated cells undergoing mitogenesis, redifferentiation, and re-establishment of normal epithelial polarity (1.Thadhani R. Pascual M. Bonventre J.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1448-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar, 2.Sheridan A.M. Bonventre J.V. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Although these processes are well described at the histological level, very little is known about the molecular levels involved. To date, some mucin proteins, such as MUC1, MUC3, and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), have been identified as proteins likely to regulate these renal events. MUC1 mRNA is expressed in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts; MUC3 mRNA is in the proximal tubules and is overexpressed in renal cell carcinoma patients (3.Leroy X. Copin M.C. Devisme L. Buisine M.P. Aubert J.P. Gosselin B. Porchet N. Histopathology. 2002; 40: 450-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). KIM-1 mRNA is drastically up-regulated in the epithelial cells of the regenerating proximal tubules following ischemia (4.Ichimura T. Bonventre J.V. Bailly V. Wei H. Hession C.A. Cate R.L.

In general, mucins are divided into two structurally and functionally distinct classes, the secreted and the transmembrane types. Human MUC2, MUC5A, MUC5B, MUC6, MUC7, MUC8, and MUC9 are classified as secreted types (5.Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol.

Some of the mucin genes are clustered in the human genome, e.g. MUC2, MUC5A, MUC5B, and MUC6 genes are located on chromosome 11p15.5 (22.Pigny P. Guyonnet-Duperat V. Hill A.S. Pratt W.S.

Recently, we have identified several cDNA fragments with altered expression in renal tissues of patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), 1The abbreviations used are: IgAN, immunoglobulin A nephropathy; BUN, blood urea nitrogen; DIG, digoxigenin; Dox, doxycycline; EST, expressed sequence tag; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; IL, interleukin; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; UUO, unilateral ureteral obstruction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; NCBI, National Center for Biotechnology Information; h, human; m, mouse. using the Gene Logic proprietary READS® mRNA differential display technology (23.Prashar Y.

Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we obtained a human cDNA encoding a novel mucin membrane protein, MUC20. Here we describe the molecular cloning, genomic structure, and expression analysis of MUC20 in human normal tissues as well as in animal models of renal injury. Cloning of the Human MUC20 cDNA and Its Genomic DNAs—A full-length cDNA encoding human MUC20 was obtained by an oligonucleotide-pulling method. Briefly, a gene-specific oligonucleotide was designed based on the sequence of the EST22972 fragment identified as described previously (24.Waga I. Yamamoto J. Sasai H. Munger W.E. Hogan S. Preston G.A. Jennette J.C. Falk R.J. Alcorta D.A. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and labeled with biotin. The biotin-labeled oligonucleotide was used for hybridization with single-stranded plasmid DNAs derived from a human kidney cDNA library (Origene) following the procedures of Sambrook et al. (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1985: 8.3-8.82Google Scholar). The hybridized cDNAs were separated by streptavidin-conjugated beads and then eluted by heating. After the eluted cDNAs were converted to double-stranded plasmid DNAs, the longest cDNA was sequenced. A human genomic DNA library (λFIX II) was purchased from Stratagene and screened (1.0 × 106 plaques) with the human MUC20 cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) by random priming. Hybridization was performed as described previously (26.Nakamura M. Watanabe H. Kubo Y. Yokoyama M. Matsumoto T. Sasai H. Nishi Y. Recept. Channels. 1998; 5: 255-271PubMed Google Scholar). The human MUC20 gene-bearing plasmids were converted from the isolated phage DNAs purified from positive plaques and subjected to restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. Cloning of the Mouse MUC20 cDNA—Searching the mouse EST data base yielded two EST fragments, BF119189 and BE689844, with high identities to human MUC20. We then isolated and sequenced the mouse cognate from a mouse kidney cDNA library (Takara) by PCR screening based on the sequences of these ESTs. RACE PCR—RACE PCR of the 5′-terminus of MUC20 mRNA was carried out using a SMART™ RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's protocol. For analysis of human MUC20 mRNA, the primary PCR amplification was performed using the oligonucleotide 5′-CTTCTGTGGAGGTGTGAGCCAATGT-3′ as a gene-specific primer and total RNA from the human kidney (Clontech) as a template. Secondary PCR amplifications were conducted using oligonucleotides 5′-CCTGTGATGGTCTGAACTGTGGTCA-3′, 5′-CTCCCCTGGTCTCTGCTTCTGGAAT-3′, and 5′-CACTTCTGTGTCGTCCGTTGTCATC-3′ as gene-specific primers A–C, respectively. For the analysis of the mouse MUC20 mRNA, the primary PCR amplification was carried out using the oligonucleotide 5′-CAGTTCTGGGGCTGTTGCTTGGTGTCA-3′ as a gene-specific primer and total RNA prepared from kidney as a template. The secondary PCR amplifications were conducted by using oligonucleotides 5′-AGGGTCAATTCAATAGGCGAGATGGTC-3′, 5′-GGGTATCCAGGAATGACGGTGCAGGGG-3′, and 5′-ATGGTTCAGGGGAAGTGGTTTGGGTAT-3′ as gene-specific primers A–C, respectively. Southern Blot Analysis of Genomic DNA—Human and mouse genomic DNAs (Clontech) were digested with various restriction enzymes. The digested fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences), and then hybridized at 65 °C with an [α-32P]-labeled probe described below. For the human blot hybridization, two probe fragments, the exon-2 and the exon-4 segments, were prepared by PCR using primer sets 5′-TGAAGAGGCAAAGACACTCACAATG-3′ and 5′-CTGTTGGGGGCTTCATCGTGGTCTT-3′ for the exon-2 probe and 5′-AACTCCACGCCCACGCGCCT-3′ and 5′-GGAAGCACACAGATGGGTGA-3′ for the exon-4 probe, with the human MUC20 cDNA as a template. For the mouse blotting analysis, the probe fragment corresponding to the exon-2 segment was prepared by PCR using the primer set, 5′-ATGGAAGTGTCCACCTTCACTC-3′, and 5′-TGTGCCAGTTTGGACAGTGC-3′, with the mouse MUC20 cDNA as a template. PCR was carried out for 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 55 °C for 0.5 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min using a model 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analysis of the Polymorphic Region of Human MUC20 —Cell lines used in these experiments were purchased from the following sources: human neuroblastoma cell lines, NB69, CHP134, LA-N-1, NB9, NB16, TNB-1, LA-N-5, LA-N-2, NB-I, and MC-NB-1 were purchased from Riken Gene Bank, and human kidney cell lines, 769-P, and OS-RC-2 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and cell lines were grown as recommended by the suppliers. Genomic DNAs were prepared from these cell lines as described (27.Aldridge J. Kunkel L. Bruns G. Tantravahi U. Lalande M. Brewster T. Moreau E. Wilson M. Bromley W. Roderick T. Latt S.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1984; 36: 546-564PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate repeat numbers, the tandem domains in the human MUC20 gene derived from these cell lines were amplified by PCR using the specific primer set 5′-CCCTTTGCACCGATGACAG-3′ and 5′-TTCCAGGGGATTCCTGCT-3′ under the thermal cycling conditions described above. The PCR-amplified fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham Biosciences), and then detected by Southern blot analysis using a fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-CACACCTCCACAGAAGCTAAG-3′), complementary to the repeat region of MUC20, as a probe. Northern Blot Analysis—Multiple tissue Northern blots of human and mouse tissues were purchased from Clontech and hybridized with the [α-32P]-labeled human exon-2, human exon-4, or mouse exon-2 DNAs prepared as described above. Hybridization was performed as described previously (26.Nakamura M. Watanabe H. Kubo Y. Yokoyama M. Matsumoto T. Sasai H. Nishi Y. Recept. Channels. 1998; 5: 255-271PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting filters were autoradiographed with a BAS2000 system (Fuji Film). RT-PCR—Poly(A)+ RNAs from human brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, placenta, and skeletal muscle were purchased from Clontech. Human kidney cell lines ACHN, OS-RC-2, 769-P, TUHR-4-TKB, and A704 were purchased from ATCC and grown as recommended for each cell line. ACHN cells were stimulated with transforming growth factor-β (2 ng/ml; Peprotech), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 μm; Sigma), lipopolysaccharide (10 μg/ml; Sigma), IL-1β (0.4 ng/ml; Peprotech), IL-6 (100 ng/ml; Peprotech), IL-8 (250 ng/ml; Peprotech), or tumor necrosis factor-α (100 ng/ml; Peprotech) for 14 h. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out using an Advantage™ RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech) following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed under the thermal cycling conditions described above. The primer sets were as follows: for human MUC20 mRNA, 5′-AACTCCACGCCCACGCGCCT-3′ and 5′-GGAAGCACACAGATGGGTGA-3′, and for mouse MUC20 mRNA, 5′-ACCCTTTGTACCGATGACAGCTCTGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAGTGGATGCAGATGTTGTAGGATG-3′. The primers used for GAPDH mRNA detection were purchased from Clontech. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was reverse-transcribed using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed using probes with SYBER Green (Molecular Probes) on an ABI PRISM 7000 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The primer pairs used for the PCR amplification were as follows: for mouse MUC20 mRNA, 5′-CGTGGCCTCCCCTAAGGA-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGGCGTGCAGTT-3′, and for mouse collagen type I mRNA, 5′-AGAGCATGACCGATGGATTCC-3′ and 5′-TTGCCAGTCTGCTGGTCCATG-3′. The primers used for GAPDH mRNA were purchased from Clontech. Cells and Transfections—The pBI-MUC20 plasmid was constructed by cloning of a C-terminally FLAG-tagged human MUC20 cDNA prepared by PCR into the pBI-L vector (Clontech). All materials for a Tet-Off system, including human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) Tet-Off cells, were purchased from Clontech. The cells were grown in the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) as recommended. For generation of the cell lines stably expressing the FLAG-tagged human MUC20, both pBI-MUC20 and pTK-Hyg plasmids (ratio 10:1) were co-transfected into Tet-Off MDCK or Tet-Off HEK293 cells using GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene) as described in the manufacturer's procedure, and then hygromycin-resistant clones were selected. Hygromycin-resistant clonal lines were established by limiting dilution, and the production of MUC20 protein in each line was confirmed by immunoblotting analysis with an anti-FLAG (M2) antibody (Sigma). Immunoblotting—A rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-MUC20, was raised against the N-terminal domain of human MUC20 using a synthetic peptide, RGAKRISPARETRSFTK (residues 46–62), coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. For immunoblotting, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin). The resulting lysates were centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and then the postnuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g to separate the membrane pellet fractions and the cytosolic supernatants. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Proteins (5 μg) were analyzed by immunoblotting with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and specific bands were detected with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunocytochemistry—MDCK/tet-MUC20 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min. After blocking with Tris-glycine and an endogenous biotin blocking kit (DAKO), the cells were further blocked with antibody diluent containing 2% goat normal serum and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated with polyclonal antibody against human MUC20 or rabbit IgG at 1 μg/ml. The cells were washed and incubated with biotinylated F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) at 5 μg/ml. Visualization was done with labeled streptavidin-boitin system (labeled streptavidin biotin kit, DAKO). The cells were postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and embedded in Epon. Ultrathin sections were examined with a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope at 75 kV without counterstaining. Animals—Female MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice (SLC Japan) were sacrificed under anesthesia at different ages (1–9 months), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was measured using an autoanalyzer (COBAS FARA; Roche Applied Science). Acute renal injury was induced in Charles River CD-1 mice (male, 6 weeks old, Charles River, Japan) by subcutaneous administration of cisplatin (18 mg/kg; Nippon Kayaku), and both serum creatinine and BUN were measured to evaluate renal damage using the autoanalyzer. Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) was induced in C57Bl(B6) mice (male, 8 weeks old, Charles River, Japan) as described (28.Yang J. Dai C. Liu Y. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2464-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Collagen type I mRNA in the kidney was measured by quantitative RT-PCR, and the content of hydroxyproline was quantified as described (29.Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 55: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization—Two fragments (fragment 5-1, 747 bp, and fragment 7-11, 892 bp) were prepared from mouse MUC20 cDNA by PCR, using the following primer sets: 5′-ATGGAAGTGTCCACCTTCACTC-3′ and 5′-TGTGCCAGTTTGGACAGTGC-3′ for fragment 5-1, and 5′-AGCACCTGTCTTCAGAGAGC-3′ and 5′-TGCTCAGTGAGGTCCTTAGG-3′ for fragment 7-11, with the mouse MUC20 cDNA as a template. As a positive control, a fragment of mouse TSC-22 was also synthesized by PCR using specific primers 5′-AAGTGGAAGTTCTGAAGGAGC-3′ and 5′-TAAGATAGCCTAGGTCCCAGC-3′, with the mouse TSC-22 cDNA as a template. After subcloning the PCR products into the pGEN-T vector (Promega) followed by linearization of each plasmid with appropriate restriction enzymes, digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled single-stranded antisense and sense probes were generated using T7 and Sp6 RNA polymerases (Roche Applied Science), respectively, using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). Five-, 9-, 23-, and 60-week-old MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr mice and 23-week-old C57Bl(B6) mice were anesthetized with ethyl ether and fixed by cardiac perfusion with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Dissected kidneys were further fixed in the same fixative overnight at 4 °C. Cryosections of 10 μm were dried at 45 °C for 2 h and rinsed three times with PBS for 5 min each followed by one rinse with distilled water for 5 min. After incubation in 0.2 n HCl for 20 min and then in a 10 μg/ml proteinase K solution for 20 min, the sections were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 5 min. After equilibration with glycine in PBS twice for 15 min each, the sections were dehydrated with graded alcohol and air-dried for 10 min. DIG-labeled cRNA probes were denatured at 85 °C for 5 min. The resulting sections were incubated with probe at 50 °C overnight, washed with 2× SSC at 50 °C twice for 15 min each and at 55 °C for 1 h, followed by a 1-h wash with 0.2× SSC at 55 °C. Immunohistochemical detection of DIG using an alkaline phosphatase-labeled antibody was performed as recommended by Roche Applied Science (30.Boehringer Mannheim (1992) Boehringer Mannheim Technical Bulletin, Non-radioactive in Situ Hybridization Application Manual, Indianapolis, INGoogle Scholar). After stopping the reaction, sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h and counterstained with methyl green. Cloning of Human and Mouse MUC20 cDNAs—EST22972 is a gene fragment whose expression was shown to be up-regulated in renal tissues of IgAN patients (24.Waga I. Yamamoto J. Sasai H. Munger W.E. Hogan S. Preston G.A. Jennette J.C. Falk R.J. Alcorta D.A. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1253-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To isolate the full-length cDNA corresponding to the EST22972 fragment, we screened a human kidney cDNA library with an oligonucleotide probe based on the sequence of EST22972. A clone was isolated, and sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame encoding 503 amino acids with several hydrophobic domains, suggesting that this protein is a membrane protein (Fig. 1, A and B). In addition, this protein has 3 tandem repeats of 19 amino acids mainly consisting of threonine, serine, and proline residues likely to be extensively O-glycosylated (Fig. 1A). Because of the similarity of this tandem domain to sequences conserved among mucins, we named this clone MUC20. A BLAST search (31.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70758) Google Scholar) of the mouse data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) revealed that mouse ESTs BF119189 and BE689844 had the highest homology to the human MUC20 cDNA. By a PCR screen employing the sequences of these ESTs, we isolated a mouse cognate from a mouse kidney cDNA library. Fig. 1A shows the amino acid sequence alignment of the proteins encoded by the human and mouse clones. The predicted sequence of mouse MUC20, consisting of 656 amino acids, shows similar characteristics to human MUC20, such as bearing several hydrophobic domains and three mucin repeats of 18 amino acids in its N-terminal region. The sequences are most similar in the C-terminal domain (48% identity overall and 62% identity in the C-terminal 50 amino acids) but less similar in the N-terminal portions. Interestingly, the position and sequence of the mucin tandem domain of mouse MUC20 do not coincide with those of human MUC20, although the predominance of threonines, serines, and prolines in this domain is conserved. Genomic Structure and Alternative Transcription of Human MUC20 —Next, we characterized the genomic structure of human MUC20. By screening ∼1.0 × 106 plaques of a human genomic library with the human MUC20 coding region, we obtained 24 positive clones. Analysis of the genomic fragments revealed that the isolated human MUC20 cDNA was derived from three exons. Significantly, the genomic DNA clone encoded 6 repeats of the tandem sequence in the mucin domain (data not shown), whereas the cDNA clone encoded only three. An EST clone (GenBank™/EBI Data Bank accession number AK027314), which was isolated from a human 10-week whole embryo cDNA library, showed significant identity with the human MUC20 cDNA. Comparison of the AK027314 protein with human MUC20 revealed an additional hydrophobic peptide of 35 amino acids at the N terminus of AK027314 (Fig. 2A). Therefore, we termed the AK027314 type of human MUC20 as hMUC20-L and the shorter one encoded by our cDNA clone as hMUC20-S. We searched the NCBI data base for the exon encoding the additional N-terminal peptide of hMUC20-L. The exon was found ∼3.6 kbp upstream from the exon-2 of the MUC20 gene (Fig. 2, A and B). These results raised the possibility of alternative promoters that gave rise to the different forms of the human MUC20 mRNA. To rule out the possibility that the hMUC20-S cDNA was produced from an immature mRNA containing unspliced introns, we performed 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) on MUC20 mRNA from human kidney using three sets of primers. As shown in Fig. 2C, each set of primers amplified a single species of DNA, and sequence analysis revealed that each of these DNAs had the same 5′-end as the hMUC20-S cDNA. These results indicate that at least two transcriptional start points exist in the hMUC20 gene, encoding two isoforms of the hMUC20 protein with different N-terminal sequences. These results also suggest that hMUC20-S is expressed highly in human kidney, whereas hMUC20-L was not detected in these experimental conditions, although it was isolated from human 10-week-old whole embryo. Interestingly, the sequence of the N-terminal peptide of hMUC20-L shows high identity to that of mouse MUC20, indicating that the isolated mouse MUC20 could be the coun"
https://openalex.org/W2145183379,"Serum response factor (SRF) is required for the expression of a wide variety of muscle-specific genes that are expressed upon differentiation and is thus required for both striated and smooth muscle differentiation in addition to its role in regulating growth factor-inducible genes. A heart and smooth muscle-specific SRF co-activator, myocardin, has been shown to be required for cardiac development and smooth muscle differentiation. However, no such co-factors of SRF have been identified in the skeletal myogenic differentiation program. Myocardin and the related transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1/MAL/MRTF-A) can strongly potentiate the activity of SRF. Here we report the cloning of the third member of the myocardin/MKL family in humans, <i>MKL2</i>. MKL2 binds to and activates SRF similar to myocardin and MKL1. To determine the role of these factors in skeletal myogenic differentiation we used a dominant negative MKL2 to show that the MKL family of proteins is required for skeletal myogenic differentiation. Expression of the dominant negative protein in C2C12 skeletal myoblasts blocked the differentiation-induced expression of the SRF target genes skeletal α-actin and α-myosin heavy chain and blocked differentiation of the myoblasts to myotubes <i>in vitro</i>. C2C12 cells express both MKL1 and MKL2, but not myocardin, implicating MKL1 and/or MKL2 in the requirement for skeletal myogenic differentiation. MKL1 was predominantly cytoplasmic in C2C12 cells, with a small amount in the nucleus, however, no movement of MKL1 to the nucleus was observed upon differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2064598430,"Intracellular calcium signals are responsible for initiating a spectrum of physiological responses. The caldendrins/calcium-binding proteins (CaBPs) represent mammal-specific members of the CaM superfamily. CaBPs display a restricted pattern of expression in neuronal/retinal tissues, suggesting a specialized role in Ca2+ signaling in these cell types. Recently, it was reported that a splice variant of CaBP1 functionally interacts with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors to elicit channel activation in the absence of InsP3 (Yang, J., McBride, S., Mak, D.-O. D., Vardi, N., Palczewski, K., Haeseleer, F., and Foskett, J. K. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 7711–7716). These data indicate a new mode of InsP3 receptor modulation and hence control of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in neuronal tissues. We have analyzed the biochemistry of the long form splice variant of CaBP1 (L-CaBP1) and show that, in vitro, a recombinant form of the protein is able to bind Ca2+ with high affinity and undergo a conformational change. We also describe the localization of endogenous and overexpressed L-CaBP1 in the model neuroendocrine PC12 cell system, where it was associated with the plasma membrane and Golgi complex in a myristoylation-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that overexpressed L-CaBP1 is able to substantially suppress rises in [Ca2+]i in response to physiological agonists acting on purinergic receptors and that this inhibition is due in large part to blockade of release from intracellular Ca2+ stores. The related protein neuronal calcium sensor-1 was without effect on the [Ca2+]i responses to agonist stimulation. Measurement of [Ca2+] within the ER of permeabilized PC12 cells demonstrated that LCaBP1 directly inhibited InsP3-mediated Ca2+ release. Expression of L-CaBP1 also inhibited histamine-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations in HeLa cells. Together, these data suggest that L-CaBP1 is able to specifically regulate InsP3 receptor-mediated alterations in [Ca2+]i during agonist stimulation.

Calcium is a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger in all vertebrate cells (1.Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4423) Google Scholar). Intracellular resting free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) is acutely maintained at around 100 nm via a variety of mechanisms, and even small local rises above this base line are able to elicit dramatic cellular responses. Rises in [Ca2+]i are generated through two primary routes (2.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4190) Google Scholar). First, many physiological agonists activate Ca2+ channels that mediate the direct entry of extracellular Ca2+. Second, [Ca2+]i can be elevated through release of sequestered Ca2+ from intracellular stores (3.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6164) Google Scholar), most notably the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CaBP, calcium-binding protein; L-CaBP1, long splice isoform of CaBP1; Tr-CaBP1, truncated form of CaBP1; CaM, calmodulin; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, InsP3 receptor; InsP3R1, type I InsP3R; IP3R3, type III InsP3R; NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; RyR, ryanodine receptor; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CaBP, calcium-binding protein; L-CaBP1, long splice isoform of CaBP1; Tr-CaBP1, truncated form of CaBP1; CaM, calmodulin; ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; InsP3R, InsP3 receptor; InsP3R1, type I InsP3R; IP3R3, type III InsP3R; NCS, neuronal calcium sensor; RyR, ryanodine receptor; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Ca2+ release from intracellular stores is controlled predominantly by two related Ca2+ channel families, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor (InsP3R) and the ryanodine receptor (RyR). InsP3Rs couple to extracellular stimuli that drive the activation of phospholipase C and subsequent liberation of the soluble second messenger InsP3. Activation of ER-localized InsP3Rs by InsP3 in turn elicits Ca2+ release into the cytosol. InsP3R activity can be further modulated by direct binding of Ca2+ itself, and this regulation explains a form of calciuminduced calcium release that is responsible for the establishment of complex regenerative Ca2+ signals within cells (2.Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4190) Google Scholar). In neurons, such Ca2+ signals have been intimately linked to processes as divergent as neurodegeneration, neurite outgrowth, alterations in neuronal gene expression, and neurotransmitter release (4.Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1750) Google Scholar, 5.Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A.

Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Factors affecting the generation and propagation of intracellular Ca2+ signals therefore represent potential critical integrators of neuronal responses to complex and varied stimuli. Although Ca2+ is capable of eliciting direct cellular responses such as the aforementioned gating of InsP3Rs, many of its effects are registered indirectly through specific Ca2+-binding proteins. Calmodulin (CaM) is a universal Ca2+-binding protein, homologues of which are present in all eukaryotes (11.Chin D. Means A.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar), and a large number of Ca2+ driven alterations in cell physiology can be mapped to its Ca2+ sensing activity. CaM coordinates Ca2+ ions through specialized EF-hand domains, and a large number of related proteins have now been characterized. In neurons, these include the neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of Ca2+-binding proteins (12.Burgoyne R.D. Weiss J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). More recently, a group of CaM-like proteins, termed caldendrins (13.Laube G. Seidenbecher C.I. Richter K. Dieterich D.C. Hoffman B. Landwehr M. Smalla K.-H. Winter C. Bockers T.M. Wolf G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1247-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) have been identified that are vertebrate-specific and display a predominantly neuronal/retinal pattern of expression (14.Seidenbecher C.I. Langnaese K. Sanmarti-Vila L. Boeckers T.M. Smalla K.-H. Sabel B.A. Garner C.C. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreutz M.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 514: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It has since been reported that members of the CaBP family are able to interact with and modulate the activity of InsP3Rs (17.Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Uniquely, it has been suggested that CaBPs may be capable of activating the InsP3R independently of the natural ligand InsP3. The ability to release stored Ca2+ in the absence of InsP3 production represents a potentially important new mechanism for the generation of intracellular Ca2+ signals in neuronal cell types. It has also been proposed that CaBPs may additionally harbor the capacity to negatively regulate influx of extracellular Ca2+ through a direct inhibitory interaction with plasma membrane P/Q type Ca2+ channels (18.Lee A. Westenbroek R.E. Haseseleer F. Palczewski K. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Preliminary results therefore seem to indicate that members of the CaBP subfamily represent important new neuronal Ca2+-sensing proteins that can control multiple Ca2+ fluxes in the modulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling. No data are available concerning the effect of CaBPs on agonist-induced Ca2+ signals in intact cells. Several splice variants of CaBP1 and caldendrin have been identified. In this study, we have attempted to analyze the effect of long form CaBP1 (L-CaBP1) protein on intracellular Ca2+ signals in the model neuroendocrine PC12 cell system. We show by Western blotting and immunofluorescence that endogenous L-CaBP1 is detectable in PC12 cells and that a recombinantly expressed form of the protein is able to bind Ca2+ in vitro with high affinity. An overexpressed, EYFP-tagged, version of L-CaBP1 displays a dual plasma membrane/perinuclear localization in PC12 cells, which mirrors the localization of the endogenous protein. It seems likely that the wild-type protein is myristoylated in vivo, since mutation of its putative N-terminal myristoylation motif causes a complete abolition of membrane association. In addition, the localization of both InsP3R1 and InsP3R3 with L-CaBP1-EYFP has been studied. Using pulldown type in vitro experiments, we also show that recombinant GST-L-CaBP1 is able to specifically interact with the type I InsP3R and the Cav2.1-α1A channel subunit from rat brain extracts in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Furthermore, we have applied confocal imaging to monitor intracellular Ca2+ responses in cells overexpressing L-CaBP1, a truncated version of this protein (Tr-CaBP1), and the related neuronal Ca2+-sensing protein, NCS-1. The data presented show that, in vivo, in neuroendocrine cells that endogenously express L-CaBP1, overexpression of the protein dramatically inhibits intracellular Ca2+ rises due to release from InsP3R-sensitive intracellular stores. Cloning of DNA Constructs—The long form of human CaBP1 (LCaBP1; GenBank™ accession number AF169149) was amplified by PCR from human brain cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using an Omn-E dry block thermocycler (Hybaid, Middlesex, UK) and Bio-X-Act DNA polymerase (Bioline, London, UK) with primers containing restriction endonuclease sites (underlined) for subsequent cloning: sense (HindIII), 5′-GCCGAAGCTTATGGGCAACTGTGTCAAGTATCC-3′; antisense (SacII), 5′-GCCGCCGCGGGCGGGACATCATCCGGAC-3′; sense (BamHI), 5′-GCCGGGATCCATGGGCAACTGTGTCAAGTATCC-3′; antisense (XhoI), 5′-GCCGCTCGAGTCAGCGGGACATCATCCGGAC-3′. Tr-CaBP1 was amplified by PCR from the wild-type template using the following primers containing restriction endonuclease sites (underlined) for subsequent cloning: sense (HindIII): 5′-GCCGAAGCTTCTGCGACCAGAGGAAATTG-3′; antisense (SacII), 5′-GCCGCCGCGGGCGGGACATCATCCGGAC-3′; sense (BamHI), 5′-GCCGGGATCCCTGCGACCAGAGGAAATTG-3′; antisense (XhoI), 5′-GCCGCTCGAGTCAGCGGGACATCATCCGGAC-3′. HindIII/SacII-digested PCR products were ligated into EYFP-N1 (Clontech) for imaging and immunofluorescence studies. BamHI/XhoI-digested PCR products were ligated into pGex-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for recombinant protein expression. BamHI/XhoI-digested LCaBP1 PCR product was additionally ligated into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) for expression of untagged protein. NCS-1 was amplified by PCR from an existing expression construct (19.McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) using the following primers for subsequent subcloning into the pGex-6P-1 vector: sense (BamHI), 5′-GCCGGGATCCATGGGGAAATCCAACAGCAAG-3′; antisense (XhoI), 5′-GCCGCTCGAGCTATACCAGCCCGTCGTAGAG-3′. The CaBP1-EYFP(G2A) mutant was generated from wild-type CaBP1-EYFP template by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange™ system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers were as follows: sense, 5′-CTCGAGCTCAAGCTTATGG(G/C)CAACTGTGTCAAGTATC-3′; antisense, 5′-GATACTTGACACAGTTG(C/G)CCATAAGCTTGAGCTCGAG-3′. Nucleotides in parentheses indicate bases that were changed to generate the appropriate amino acid substitution. All DNA constructs were checked by automated sequencing (Oswel, Southampton, UK). Expression and Purification of GST-tagged Proteins—pGex-LCaBP1, pGex-Tr-CaBP1, and pGex-NCS-1 plasmids were transformed into BL-21 (DE3) Escherichia coli (Stratagene), and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Proteins were purified from cytosolic fractions on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For proteolytic removal of the GST moiety, glutathione-Sepharose beads with bound GST fusion proteins were washed extensively in prescission buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated with 40 units of prescission protease (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. Supernatants containing GST-free protein were collected following centrifugation. Fluorescence Measurements of Ca2+ Binding to L-CaBP1 and NCS-1— GST-free NCS-1 and L-CaBP1 (both at 1 μm) were incubated in Ca2+-free buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 139 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid). An emission spectrum was obtained by excitation of protein samples at 280 nm and collection of emission fluorescence between 290 and 410 nm using an LS-5 luminescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). CaCl2 was then added stepwise to samples, with mixing, to give calculated free Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μm (19.McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22768-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). After each addition of Ca2+, a new spectrum was obtained as described above. Buffer alone and buffer plus 10 μm free Ca2+ control spectra were obtained using the same protocol. Percentages of Ca2+-dependent changes in peak fluorescence intensity were then calculated and plotted as a function of free Ca2+ concentration. Binding of GST-L-CaBP1 to Rat Brain Membrane Protein Extracts— Rat brain membrane protein fractions were prepared as previously described (20.Haynes L.P. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). GST-L-CaBP1, GST-NCS-1, or GST (all at 1 μm) were immobilized onto 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose that had been prewashed in membrane buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100) with or without 1 μm free Ca2+ by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C. 500 μl of rat brain membrane protein extract containing 0 or 1 μm free Ca2+ was then added to the appropriate samples, and binding was allowed to proceed for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation. Sepharose pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed extensively in the binding buffer. Final pellets were extracted in 50 μl of SDS dissociation buffer (125 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 10% (w/v) sucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mm EDTA), and samples were boiled for 5 min. Bound proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE (12.5% gel), and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting via transverse electrophoresis. Proteins were detected with anti-InsP3R1 antibody (1:500; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO) or anti-Cav2.1-α1A (1:500; Sigma) and visualized using ECL-Plus reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Production of Anti-CaBP1 Antiserum—Anti-CaBP1 was raised against the prescission-cleaved, GST-free form of recombinant L-CaBP1 by immunization of rabbits with 100 μg of protein/animal (CovalAb, Cambridge, UK) and affinity-purified by binding to recombinant protein and elution before use. Localization of EYFP and ECFP Constructs and Immunofluorescence—PC12 cells (0.25 × 106 cells/well) were plated onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 1 μg of either EYFP-N1 control plasmid or 1 μg of CaBP1-EYFP, Tr-CaBP1-EYFP, or L-CaBP1 (G2A)-EYFP constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For co-localization of CaBP1-EYFP with NCS-1-ECFP (21.O'Callaghan D.W. Hasdemir B. Leighton M. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4833-4845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or ECFP-ER (Clontech), cells were transfected with 1 μg of each construct. 24 h following transfection, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. For staining of endogenous L-CaBP1 or co-staining experiments with InsP3R1 or InsP3R3 antibodies, cells were then incubated in PBT (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. Cells were subsequently incubated with anti-CaBP1 (1:50), anti-InsP3R1 (1:50), or anti-InsP3R3 (1:50, BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) followed by incubation with an appropriate species-specific biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were then washed and incubated with a streptavidin-Texas Red-conjugated tertiary antibody (1:50; Amersham Biosciences) prior to mounting of coverslips onto glass slides. All images were captured using laser-scanning confocal microscopy with a Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) using a 22-μm pin hole and a ×63 water immersion objective with a 1.2 numerical aperture. For optimal imaging of the spatial distribution of EYFP, the cells were excited at 514 nm and light was collected at 545–625 nm. Texas Red was imaged using excitation at 543 nm and light collection at 600–650 nm. For dual imaging of EYFP and ECFP, the cells were excited at 514 nm with light collected at 560–600 nm for EYFP or excited at 458 nm with light collected at 465–500 nm for ECFP detection. Images were exported as Tiff files and compiled in CorelDraw. Imaging of Intracellular [Ca2+] in PC12 Cells—PC12 cells (0.75 × 106 cells/well) were plated onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 2 μg of either EYFP-N1 control plasmid or 2 μg of CaBP1-EYFP, Tr-CaBP1-EYFP, L-CaBP1(G2A)-EYFP, or NCS-1-EYFP constructs using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were washed in Krebs buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 145 mm NaCl, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4) and then incubated with 1 μm X-rhod-1 AM (Molecular Probes Europe BV, Leiden, The Netherlands) in Krebs buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed extensively in Krebs buffer before imaging using laser-scanning confocal microscopy. An EYFP image was taken prior to each experiment to permit distinction between transfected/untransfected cells. X-rhod-1 was imaged using the Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope with excitation at 543 nm and light collection at 600–650 nm. X-rhod-1 was used in the study of PC12 cells rather than Fura Red (22.O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), since the latter dye could not be successfully loaded into PC12 cells, and other dyes were not compatible with measurements in EYFP-expressing cells. The X-rhod-1 fluorescence was diffusely and uniformly distributed, suggesting cytosolic localization of the probe. Imaging of Intracellular Ca2+ Changes in HeLa Cells—HeLa cells (0.75 × 106 cells/well) were plated onto glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 2 μg of L-CaBP1-EYFP using FuGene6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were washed in Krebs buffer and then incubated with 1 μm Fura Red AM (Molecular Probes) in Krebs buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed extensively in Krebs buffer before imaging of intracellular Ca2+ using the Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope. An EYFP image was taken prior to each experiment to permit distinction between transfected and nontransfected cells. For the monitoring of Fura Red fluorescence, cells were excited at 488 nm, and light was collected at 625–725 nm. Imaging of InsP3-induced Ca2+ Release from Permeabilized PC12 Cells—PC12 cells (0.75 × 106 cells/well) were plated onto collagen-coated glass coverslips and transiently transfected with 1 μg of ECFP-N1 plasmid and 1 μg of pcDNA-L-CaBP1 construct using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 24–48 h post-transfection, cells were washed in Krebs buffer and then incubated with Mag-fluo4 AM (Molecular Probes) in Krebs buffer for 45 min at 37 °C to allow dye loading into the ER. Cells were washed extensively in Krebs and then perfused for 5 min with KGEPMgATP buffer (20 mm PIPES (pH 6.5), 139 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2). Cells were then perfused with KGEP-MgATP buffer containing 20 μm digitonin (Calbiochem) for 6 min (23.Graham M.E. Gerke V. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and subsequently stimulated with 10 μm InsP3 in KGEPMgATP for 1 min. All images were collected using the Leica TCS-SP-MP microscope with excitation at 488 nm with collection of emission fluorescence between 500 and 560 nm. The data on Mag-fluo4 fluorescence were corrected for photobleaching during the time course of the experiment. An ECFP image was taken prior to each experiment to permit distinction between transfected and nontransfected cells. Expression of Recombinant Proteins, Analysis of Ca2+ Binding, and Interactions with InsP3R1 and Cav2.1α1A—In order to examine the in vitro biochemical properties of L-CaBP1, we generated a series of GST fusion protein constructs that were purified from E. coli lysates. Fig. 1A depicts SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified versions of GST-NCS-1, GST-L-CaBP1, and GST-Tr-CaBP1 (lanes 1–3). Tr-CaBP1 corresponds to c-CaBP1 as used in the study by Yang et al. (17.Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). This construct represents an N-terminally truncated version of the short form splice variant of CaBP1 (15.Haeseleer F. Sokal I. Verlinde C.L.M.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Pronin A.N.

This truncation eliminates a putative glycine myristoylation site at position 2 in the full-length protein. We have included this construct in our analysis, since in the original report the recombinant version of this protein was able to dramatically stimulate InsP3R activity. The related Ca2+-binding protein NCS-1 (19.McFerran B.W. Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol.

Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) utilized the GST-free forms of the recombinantly expressed proteins, which were obtained by proteolytic cleavage of the GST fusion constructs. We used the same proteolytic treatment to generate GST-free forms of L-CaBP1, Tr-CaBP1, and NCS-1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 4–6). It is apparent from PAGE analysis that proteolytic removal of GST was efficient for both NCS-1 and L-CaBP1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, similar treatment of Tr-CaBP1 resulted in severe degradation of the protein, formation of high molecular weight aggregates, and almost no recovery of the GST-free form (Fig. 1A, lane 6). Binding of Ca2+ to the GST-free forms of both L-CaBP1 and NCS-1 was examined in vitro by monitoring changes in protein conformation upon Ca2+ binding (24.McFerran B.W. Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30258-30265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) as determined by alterations in tryptophan (NCS-1) or tyrosine (L-CaBP1) fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 1B). From these experiments, it is clear that both NCS-1 and L-CaBP1 are capable, in vitro, of binding Ca2+ with affinities in the submicromolar range (KD for both L-CaBP1 and NCS-1 was between 0.1 and 0.3 μm free Ca2+). This demonstrates that binding of Ca2+ to L-CaBP1 is of high affinity and drives a significant conformational change in the protein. Recent reports have suggested that L-CaBP1 is able to interact with plasma membrane P/Q type Ca2+ channels (18.Lee A. Westenbroek R.E. Haseseleer F. Palczewski K. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and that Tr-CaBP1 is able to interact with InsP3R types 1 and 3 (17.Yang J. McBride S. Mak D.-O.D. Vardi N. Palczewski K. Haeseleer F. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7711-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These reports are somewhat confusing in that the interaction with P/Q type channels appears to be independent of Ca2+, and interactions of Tr-CaBP1 with InsP3Rs involve binding to a form of CaBP1 that is not expressed endogenously in cells. In an attempt to resolve these issues, we analyzed the binding of GST-L-CaBP1 to rat brain protein extracts in the absence or presence of 1 μm free Ca2+. In our hands, GST-LCaBP1 seemed to interact with both the InsP3R1 and the α1A subunit of the P/Q type Ca2+ channel in an acutely Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C and D). InsP3R1 was present in rat brain membrane protein extracts (Fig. 1C, lane 1) (26.Wojcikiewicz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11678-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and bound to GST-L-CaBP1 only in the presence of free Ca2+ (Fig. 1C, lane 4 versus lane 5). This interaction was specific for L-CaBP1, since no binding was observed to GST-NCS-1 in either the presence or absence of free Ca2+ (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). Samples from the same binding experiments were also probed with an antibody specific for the α1A subunit of the P/Q type Ca2+ channel (Fig. 1D). Binding of GST-L-CaBP1 to the α1A subunit was observable only in the presence of free Ca2+ (Fig. 1D, lanes 5 and 6"

The mechanism and signaling pathway regulating these currents in rat β-cells were investigated using the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin 4. Inhibition of Kv currents resulted from a 20-mV leftward shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. Blocking cAMP or protein kinase A (PKA) signaling (Rp-cAMP and H-89, respectively) prevented the inhibition of currents by exendin 4. However, direct activation of this pathway alone by intracellular dialysis of cAMP or the PKA catalytic subunit (cPKA) could not inhibit currents, implicating a role for alternative signaling pathways. A number of phosphorylation sites associated with phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase activation were up-regulated in GLP-1-treated MIN6 insulinoma cells, and the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin could prevent antagonism of β-cell currents by exendin 4. Antagonists of Src family kinases (PP1) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (AG1478) also prevented current inhibition by exendin 4, demonstrating a role for Src kinase-mediated trans-activation of the EGF tyrosine kinase receptor. Accordingly, the EGF receptor agonist betacellulin could replicate the effects of exendin 4 in the presence of elevated intracellular cAMP. Downstream, the PKCζ pseudosubstrate inhibitor could prevent current inhibition by exendin 4. Therefore, antagonism of β-cell Kv currents by GLP-1 receptor activation requires both cAMP/PKA and PI3 kinase/PKCζ signaling via trans-activation of the EGF receptor.

Weston A.H. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1995; 28: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In pancreatic islet β-cells, Kv channels repolarize glucose-stimulated action potentials, limit entry of Ca2+ through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, and therefore act as negative regulators of insulin secretion (2MacDonald P.E.

Importantly, because β-cell Kv channels are closed under resting conditions, the excitatory and insulinotropic effects of Kv channel antagonists are glucose-dependent (6Henquin J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 77: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 7Atwater I. Ribalet B. Rojas E. J.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is secreted by intestinal l-cells in response to nutrient ingestion (8Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Although known to exert effects on cell growth and proliferation, satiety, and intestinal motility, the most well recognized action of GLP-1 is to enhance insulin secretion from pancreatic islet β-cells (9MacDonald P.E. El Kholy W. Riedel M.J. Salapatek A.M. Light P.E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 434-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GLP-1 and its analogues are under intense investigation as potential treatments for type-2 diabetes, because their insulinotropic effect is dependent upon elevated glucose, avoiding the potentially dangerous complication of hypoglycemia (10Drucker D.J. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 531-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The actions of GLP-1 are mediated by the G protein-coupled GLP-1 receptor and result from effects on many targets within the β-cell, the most well characterized being the cAMP and PKA-dependent inhibition of KATP channels (9MacDonald P.E. El Kholy W. Riedel M.J. Salapatek A.M. Light P.E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 434-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence also demonstrates a cAMP-dependent and PKA-independent component to the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1, mediated by enhanced Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum via activation of cAMP guanine nucleotide exchange factor II (Epac2) (11Kashima Y. Miki T. Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Kang G. Chepurny O.G. Holz G.G. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 375-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently (13MacDonald P.E. Salapatek A.M. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 443-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we reported that GLP-1 and the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin 4 antagonizes Kv currents in rat β-cells (13MacDonald P.E. Salapatek A.M. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 443-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because this likely contributes to the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1, particularly the glucose dependence, we investigated the mechanism of Kv current reduction and the signal transduction pathway(s) involved. We show that exendin 4 antagonizes Kv currents in rat β-cells by causing a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation. We further demonstrate that antagonism of Kv channels by exendin 4 depends on activation of both the cAMP/PKA and phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI3)-kinase/PKCζ signaling pathways. Activation of PI3 kinase can result from an Src kinase-mediated trans-activation of the EGF receptor. This study provides a novel dual-signal pathway mechanism for the regulation of Kv currents. Additionally, the present work suggests a potential mechanism contributing to the glucose dependence of the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1. Reagents—Exendin 4 and GLP-1 were from Bachem (Torrance, CA). AG1428 and PP1 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Betacellulin, cAMP, GMP-PNP, H-89, insulin, MgATP, PD98059, Rp-cAMPs, and tetraethylammonium were from Sigma-Aldrich. Bisindolylmaleimide, calphostin C, rapamycin, TPA, wortmannin, the constitutively active PKA catalytic subunit, and the PKCζ pseudosubstrate were from Calbiochem. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was from BIOLOG Life Science Institute (Bremen, Germany). When necessary, reagents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich). Final solutions contained no greater than 0.01% dimethyl sulfoxide, and control solutions contained the same when appropriate. Anti-V5 antibody (1:10000) was from Sigma-Aldrich, anti-Kv2.1 antibody (1:1000) was from Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), and anti-EGF receptor antibody (1:1000) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). EGF receptor (erbB-1)-specific primers were as follows: forward, 5′-ACCTGTGTGAAGAAGTGCCC-3′; and reverse, 5′-ACTGGCAGGATGTGAAGGTC-3′.

Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes in RMPI 1640 medium with 2.5 mm glucose, 0.25% HEPES, 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (penicillin-streptomycin from Invitrogen) and cultured for 1–3 days prior to electrophysiological recordings. MIN6 insulinoma cells (passage 35–40), from S. Seino (Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Japan), were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and β-mercaptoethanol (2 μl/500 ml) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. HIT-T15 cells (passage 80–95), from R. P. Robertson (Pacific NW Research Institute, Seattle, WA), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (penicillin-streptomycin from Invitrogen) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Electrophysiology—Cells were patch-clamped in the whole-cell configuration using an EPC-9 amplifier and PULSE software (HEKA Electronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes were prepared from 1.5-mm thin walled borosilicate glass tubes using a two-stage micropipette puller (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan) and had typical resistances of 3–6 megaohms when fire polished and filled with intracellular solution containing the following (in mm): KCl, 140; MgCl2·6H20, 1; EGTA, 1; HEPES, 10; MgATP, 5; pH 7.25 with KOH. Extracellular solutions contained the following (in mm): NaCl, 140; CaCl2, 2; KCl, 4; MgCl2·6H2O, 1; HEPES, 10; pH 7.30 with NaOH. β-Cells were positively identified by the lack of an inward voltage-dependent Na+ current from a holding potential of -70 mV (15Gopel S. Kanno T. Barg S. Galvanovskis J. Rorsman P. J. Physiol. 1999; 521: 717-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 16Lou X.L. Yu X. Chen X.K. Duan K.L. He L.M. Qu A.L. Xu T. Zhou Z. J. Physiol. 2003; 548: 191-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Outward currents were elicited from a holding potential of -70 mV by a series of 500-ms depolarizing pulses in 20-mV increments to +70 mV or by a single depolarizing pulse to +30 mV for 500 ms or 8 s. Sustained outward current was taken as the mean current during the final 25 ms of the depolarization. The voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation was investigated by holding the cells at potentials from -80 to +30 mV for 15 s followed by a 5-ms pre-pulse to -70 mV and a 500-ms depolarization to +30 mV to elicit outward currents. Electrophysiological recordings were obtained at 32–35 °C and normalized to cell capacitance. The bath (∼0.5 ml) was perfused continuously at 1 ml/min (Minipuls peristaltic pump; Gilson Inc., Middleton, WI). Currents were filtered upon acquisition at 10 kHz, and capacitive transients were cancelled with the automatic compensation functions of the Pulse software (HEKA Electronik). Whole-cell conductance was calculated as G = I/(V - Veq), where G is whole-cell conductance, I is current, V is the test potential, and Veq is the equilibrium potential of K+ (-94.1 mV under the present conditions). Current-voltage relationships were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance followed by a Tukey post-test to compare currents elicited at various voltages. Voltage dependence of activation and steady-state inactivation curves were fit with a Boltzman function: G/Gmax = 1/[1 + exp([V -V50]/s)], where G is whole-cell conductance, V is test potential, V50 is the voltage at which half the channels are inactivated, and s is the slope of the curve, using Prism 3.03 (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA). Time constants of activation or inactivation were derived by fitting the waveform with either a single or double exponential function using PulseFit software (HEKA Electronik) and compared using the Student's t test (two groups). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—HIT-T15 cells, plated in 10-cm culture dishes, were transfected with a construct expressing a V5-His-tagged GLP-1 receptor in the pcDNA3.1-V5-His vector (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Thirty h after transfection, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm imidazole). Fifty μl of lysate was saved as the non-immunoprecipitated sample, whereas 25 μl of a 50% slurry of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) was added to the remainder and mixed gently for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 s at 15000 × g, and the pellet was washed twice with washing buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm imidazole). Protein was eluted with 3 × 35 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 mm imidazole). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (5MacDonald P.E.

Twenty-five μg of protein from each sample was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to PVDF-Plus™ membrane (Fisher). Primary antibodies (see above) were detected with appropriate secondary antibodies (sheep anti-mouse, 1:3000 and donkey anti-rabbit, 1:7500; Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. Visualization was by chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to Kodak film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 5 s to 10 min. Phospho-site Screen—MIN6 cells were grown in monolayer to 70–80% confluence in 10-cm dishes, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and pre-incubated for 30 min with a Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing the following (in mm): NaCl, 115; KCl, 5; NaHCO3, 24; CaCl2, 2.5; MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; glucose, 5; and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The cells were washed twice again with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer and incubated in the same with or without 10-7m GLP-1 for 10 min. Whole cell proteins were extracted from MIN6 cells treated with GLP-1 using lysis buffer containing the following (in mm): MOPS, 20; EGTA, 2; EDTA, 5; sodium fluoride, 30; β-glycerophosphate, 40; sodium pyrophosphate, 10; sodium orthovanadate, 2; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1; benzamidine, 3; pepstatin A, 0.005; leupeptin, 0.01; and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 0.5% Triton X-100 at pH 7.0.

Western blotting for Kv2.1 and V5-His-tagged GLP-1 receptor demonstrated the abundant expression of Kv2.1 and no expression of the GLP-1 receptor construct in whole lysates from untransfected HIT-T15 cells (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Whole lysates from HIT-T15 cells transfected with the GLP-1 receptor construct showed abundant expression of both Kv2.1 and the GLP-1 receptor (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Immunoprecipitation of lysates from untransfected HIT-T15 cells did not pull down Kv2.1 protein (Fig. 1A, lane 3), whereas Kv2.1 could be pulled down from lysates of cells expressing the tagged GLP-1 receptor (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Rat β-cells were voltage-clamped in the whole-cell configuration at near-physiological temperatures (32–35 °C). Outward voltage-dependent K+ currents were similar to those we have reported previously (4MacDonald P.E. Sewing S. Wang J. Joseph J.W. Smukler S.R. Sakellaropoulos G. Wang J. Saleh M.C. Chan C.B.

Maximum steady-state outward currents were blocked by 40.8 ± 4.1% (n = 9, p < 0.001) upon perfusion of GLP-1 (10-8m) (Fig. 1B). To ensure that currents were stable, control currents were recorded every min for ∼5 min prior to addition of GLP-1. Kv currents were maximally inhibited at ∼6 min after exposure to GLP-1 (Fig. 1C). Partial washout of this effect was observed (not shown). However, because of technical difficulties in recording from cells at 32–35 °C for prolonged periods (>20 min), experiments were not of sufficient duration to observe complete washout. Subsequent experiments were performed using the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin 4, which has a recently demonstrated therapeutic relevance in clinical trials (19Egan J.M. Meneilly G.S. Elahi D. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 284: E1072-E1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Confirming our previous studies (13MacDonald P.E. Salapatek A.M. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 443-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), exendin 4 (10-8m) inhibited voltage-dependent outward K+ currents from rat β-cells by 43.4 ± 6.3% (n = 7, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2A). At a concentration two orders of magnitude lower (10-10m), exendin 4 antagonized rat β-cell voltage-dependent K+ currents by 20.8 ± 3.9% (n = 4, p < 0.05). The current activation time constant in the presence of 10-8m exendin 4 (τa = 3.14 ± 0.27 ms, n = 7) was not significantly different from controls (τa = 2.69 ± 0.22 ms, n = 7) (Fig. 2B). We reported previously (18MacDonald P.E. Salapatek A.M. Wheeler M.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that rat β-cell Kv currents inactivate with both fast (τf) and slow (τs) time constants at 32–35 °C (18MacDonald P.E. Salapatek A.M. Wheeler M.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 546: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Neither τf nor τs in the presence of 10-8m exendin 4 (τf = 303.4 ± 45.1 ms and τs = 2.00 ± 0.20 s, n = 7) were different from controls (τf = 258.5 ± 54.5 ms and τs = 2.52 ± 0.42 s, n = 7) (Fig. 2B). The contribution of fast inactivation to total inactivation was also not changed (41.2 ± 5.9 versus 36.7 ± 2.9%, n = 7). Also, the voltage dependence of current activation under control conditions (V50 = -7.57 ± 4.31 mV, n = 7) was not significantly different after treatment with 10-8m exendin 4 (V50 = -9.77 ± 5.15 mV, n = 7) (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the reduction in Kv currents results from an ∼20-mV hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation from -43.4 ± 3.2 to -66.6 ± 5.1 mV (n = 4 and 3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 2C). cAMP/PKA Signaling Is Necessary but Not Sufficient for Antagonism of Kv Currents by Exendin 4 —The importance of cAMP/PKA signaling for the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 receptor activation is well known (9MacDonald P.E. El Kholy W. Riedel M.J. Salapatek A.M. Light P.E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 434-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of cAMP and PKA signaling in the inhibitory effect of exendin 4 on Kv currents, β-cells were pre-treated (30 min) with either the cAMP antagonist Rp-cAMPs (100 μm, n = 5) or the PKA antagonist H-89 (1 μm, n = 6). Voltage-dependent outward K+ currents in cells pre-treated with either antagonist were not different from untreated cells and could not be antagonized significantly by treatment with exendin 4 (10-8m) (Fig. 3A). These results demonstrate the necessity of the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway for Kv current inhibition by exendin 4. Because activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by GLP-1 is mediated by G-protein activation of adenylyl cyclase (9MacDonald P.E. El Kholy W. Riedel M.J. Salapatek A.M. Light P.E. Wheeler M.B. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 434-442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether general G-protein activation was sufficient to reproduce the inhibitory effect of GLP-1 receptor activation on β-cell Kv channels. Inclusion of the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue GMP-PNP (10 nm) in the pipette solution decreased outward K+ current (by 55.7 ± 6.0%, n = 8, p < 0.001) similar to exendin 4 (Fig. 3B). We next investigated whether direct activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway could replicate this inhibitory effect. Addition of cAMP (100 μm) to the pipette solution was unable to decrease voltage-dependent outward K+ currents in rat β-cells (n = 7) (Fig. 3B). Also, intracellular dialysis of the constitutively active PKA catalytic subunit (200 units/ml) had no effect on currents compared with dimethyl sulfoxide controls (n = 6), which were themselves not different from untreated cells (Fig. 3B). Forskolin (5 μm) and isobutylmethylxanthine (100 μm) together blocked currents by 35.6 ± 7.5% (n = 5, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3B). However, forskolin (and its inactive analogs) directly inhibit Kv currents in insulin secreting cells (20Zunkler B.J. Trube G. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pflugers Arch. 1988; 411: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Su J. Yu H. Lenka N. Hescheler J. Ullrich S. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Additionally, β-cell Kv currents could not be antagonized by treatment with the Epac-selective cAMP analog 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (50 μm, n = 7) (Fig. 3B). Our inability to antagonize voltage-dependent K+ channels in β-cells by activating the cAMP/PKA pathway is in agreement with previous reports (20Zunkler B.J. Trube G. Ohno-Shosaku T. Pflugers Arch. 1988; 411: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Su J. Yu H. Lenka N. Hescheler J. Ullrich S. Pflugers Arch. 2001; 442: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and suggests that additional pathway(s) are also required for the inhibitory action of GLP-1. Phospho-site Screening Identifies PI3 Kinase as an Additional Candidate Pathway—To identify candidate signaling pathways that may be involved in the GLP-1 receptor-mediated reduction of voltage-dependent K+ currents, MIN6 insulinoma cells were treated with GLP-1 (10-7m) for 10 min, and protein lysates were screened with multiple phosphosite-specific antibodies using the Kinetworks™ KPPS 1.1 screen. MIN6 insulinoma cells were used in this case, because they allow for preparation of the necessary amount of protein lysates for the phospho-screen, and in our hands they exhibit good insulin secretory responses to GLP-1 (∼1.5-fold).

https://openalex.org/W2133398895,"Amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea is a remarkable transglucosidase from family 13 of the glycoside-hydrolases that synthesizes an insoluble amylose-like polymer from sucrose in the absence of any primer. Amylosucrase shares strong structural similarities with α-amylases. Exactly how this enzyme catalyzes the formation of α-1,4-glucan and which structural features are involved in this unique functionality existing in family 13 are important questions still not fully answered. Here, we provide evidence that amylosucrase initializes polymer formation by releasing, through sucrose hydrolysis, a glucose molecule that is subsequently used as the first acceptor molecule. Maltooligosaccharides of increasing size were produced and successively elongated at their nonreducing ends until they reached a critical size and concentration, causing precipitation. The ability of amylosucrase to bind and to elongate maltooligosaccharides is notably due to the presence of key residues at the OB1 acceptor binding site that contribute strongly to the guidance (Arg415, subsite +4) and the correct positioning (Asp394 and Arg446, subsite +1) of acceptor molecules. On the other hand, Arg226 (subsites +2/+3) limits the binding of maltooligosaccharides, resulting in the accumulation of small products (G to G3) in the medium. A remarkable mutant (R226A), activated by the products it forms, was generated. It yields twice as much insoluble glucan as the wild-type enzyme and leads to the production of lower quantities of by-products.

This transglucosidase catalyzes the synthesis of an insoluble amylose-like polymer from sucrose (3.Hehre E.J. Hamilton D.M. Carlson A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 267-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a cheap and easily available agroresource. This is in contrast to starch or glycogen synthases (4.Preiss J. Ozbun J.L. Hawker J.S. Greenberg E. Lammel C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1973; 210: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which require nucleotide-activated sugar as a donor. Amylosucrase is thus attractive for the industrial synthesis of amylose-like polymers and for the modification of glucans (in particular to form nondigestible glucans) (5.Potocki de Montalk G.

Remarkably, amylosucrase is the only member of GH family 13 displaying polymerase activity and is clearly unique in this family that mainly contains starch-degrading enzymes. Amylosucrase was first isolated in the culture supernatant of Neisseria perflava (3.Hehre E.J. Hamilton D.M. Carlson A.S. J. Biol.

Recombinant amylosucrase from Neisseria polysaccharea (AS) has been the most extensively studied amylosucrase. The gene encoding AS (1.Potocki de Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been cloned, and its product has been purified to homogeneity. Characterization of the reaction products synthesized from sucrose substrate showed that sucrose isomers (turanose and trehalulose), glucose, maltose, and maltotriose were also produced besides the insoluble polymer containing only α-1,4-glucosidic linkages (1.Potocki de Montalk G.

No soluble maltooligosaccharides longer than maltotriose were detected in the reaction mixture, suggesting that the polymer chain remained bound to the enzyme and was elongated via a processive mechanism, as opposed to a nonprocessive mechanism during which the chain would be released after each glucosyl residue transfer. However, the initiation step, the direction of elongation, and its mechanism were not investigated further to absolutely confirm a processive elongation. More generally, the mechanism of polymer synthesis catalyzed by glucansucrases is still a subject of debate. According to Robyt et al. (13.Robyt J.F. Kimble B.K. Walseth T.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1974; 165: 634-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), dextran synthesis catalyzed by dextransucrase, a glucansucrase produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B-512F classified in GH family 70, follows a processive mechanism with an elongation by the reducing end involving two active sites. In contrast, a mode of polymer elongation by the nonreducing end is proposed by Mooser et al. (14.Mooser G. Hefta S.A. Paxton R.J. Shively J.E. Lee T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8916-8922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Mooser G. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 187-221Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To date, neither of these mechanisms has been elucidated at the molecular level because of the absence of any three-dimensional structure for glucansucrases.The AS three-dimensional structure is the only glucansucrase structure to have been solved (16.Skov L.K. Mirza O. Henriksen A. Potocki de Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Sarçabal P. Willemot R.M. Monsan P. Gajhede M. J. Biol.

It reveals the three common domains usually found in GH family 13: a catalytic (β/α)8-barrel fold called the A-domain, a B-domain between β-strand 3 and α-helix 3, and a C-terminal Greek key domain (16.Skov L.K.

Unlike glucansucrases of GH family 70 from lactic acid bacteria (dextransucrase, alternansucrase, and mutansucrase) (17.Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Sarçabal P. Potocki de Montalk G. Monsan P. J. Mol. Catal. 2000; 10: 117-128Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar), for which a circularly permutated (β/α)8-barrel-fold is predicted (18.MacGregor E.A. Jespersen H.M. Svensson B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the catalytic A-domain of AS adopts a nonpermutated (β/α)8-barrel fold like all of the enzymes of GH family 13 (19.Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Structural analyses supported by single-site mutational experiments enabled the assignment of the nucleophile (Asp286) and of the acid/base catalyst (Glu328) (20.Sarçabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki de Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The importance of three additional residues (Asp393, His187, and His392), also conserved in GH family 13 and known to assist in catalysis, has been demonstrated. As a member of GH family 13, it has been assumed that AS catalysis proceeds through an α-retaining mechanism involving the formation of a covalent glucosyl-enzyme intermediate (21.Koshland D.E. Biol.

Four residues not conserved in GH family 13 were found to occupy key positions; Asp144 and Arg509 form a salt bridge that blocks the bottom of the active site, and Asp394 and Arg446 interact with the fructosyl ring at subsite +1. These amino acids are thought to be responsible for the specificity of AS toward sucrose (24.Mirza O. Skov L.K. Remaud-Simeon M. Potocki de Montalk G. Albenne C. Monsan P. Gajhede M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 47741-47747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) revealed the presence of three oligosaccharide binding sites named OB1, OB2, and OB3 (Fig. 1). OB1 spans the -1 and +1 binding sites (the active site) and five additional acceptor subsites (+2, +3, +4, +5, and +6), which were mapped out and numbered according to the nomenclature defined by Davies et al. (27.Davies G.J. Wilson K.S. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The nonreducing end of the maltoheptaose (G7) molecule bound in OB1 occupies the -1 subsite. OB2 is more distant from the active site and is exposed at the surface of the protein in the B′-domain. OB3 is situated in the C-domain, and its function has not been attributed. Of the 57 residues of the B′-domain, 6 have contacts to G7 at OB2, and 8 have contacts to G7 at OB1. Consequently, this domain is thought to play a pivotal role in structural changes and in the polymerase activity (26.Skov L.K. Mirza O. Sprog⊘e D. Dar I. Remaud-Simeon M. Albenne C. Monsan P.

First, this required a detailed biochemical investigation of the kinetics of polymer synthesis from sucrose using sensitive analytical methods. Biochemical data were then examined with respect to the structural information of AS in complex with maltoheptaose (26.Skov L.K. Mirza O. Sprog⊘e D. Dar I. Remaud-Simeon M. Albenne C. Monsan P.

This enabled the identification of key residues at the OB1 site involved in the polymerization process. Several variants with altered properties were obtained and opened the route to the rational design of AS with improved reaction specificity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid and Bacterial Strains—The pGST-AS encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST; 26 kDa) fused to AS (70 kDa) (1.Potocki de Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to express the fusion gene and for site-directed mutagenesis. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was used as the host of pGST-AS encoding wild-type or mutated AS.Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of the AS gene was carried out with the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), as previously described (20.Sarçabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki de Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The procedure utilized the pGST-AS double-stranded DNA vector and two synthetic oligonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector. Primers contained the desired mutation (boldface type in the following sequences) and were designed to create or remove (asterisks) a restriction site (underlined in the following sequences and identified after each), which was used to screen the correct mutation. The following primers were used to construct the mutant enzymes: R226A_for, 5′-GACCGGACCCTGGCCGAAATCTTCCCCGACCAGCACCCG-3′ AvaII; R226A_rev:5′-CGGGTGCTGGTCGGGGAAGATTTCGGCCAGGGTCCGGTC-3′ AvaII; D394A_for, 5′-CGCAGCCACGACGCCATCGGCTGGACCTTTGCC-3′ AvaII; D394A_rev, 5′-GGCAAAGGTCCAGCCGAT-GGCGTCGTGGCTGCG-3′ AvaII; R415A_for, 5′-GCATACCTAGGCATAAGCGGCTACGACCACGCCCAATTCCTC-3′ AvrII; R451A_rev, 5′-GAGGAATTGGGCGTGGTCGTAGCCGCTTATGCCTAGGTATGC-3′ AvrII; R446A_for, 5′-GGCGACTGCGCTGTCAGTGGTACAGCGGCGGC-3′ SacII*; R446A_rev, 5′-GCCGCCGCTGTACCACTGACAGCGCAGTCGCC-3′ SacII*. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Genome Express, Grenoble, France).Enzyme Extraction Methods—E. coli carrying the recombinant pGST-AS plasmid encoding the wild-type and mutated AS gene was grown on LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg·ml-1) and isopropyl-β-thiogalactopyranoside (1 mm) for 10 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (8000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended, and concentrated to an A600 of 80 in PBS buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3). The intracellular enzyme was extracted by sonication, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to the extract and mixed for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was used as the source for enzyme purification.Purification of Wild-type and Mutated AS—Amylosucrase was purified by affinity chromatography of the GST/AS fusion protein on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (1.Potocki de Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Planchot V. Monsan P. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 375-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since pure GST/AS fusion protein possesses the same function and the same efficiency as pure AS (data not shown), enzymes were purified simply to the GST/AS fusion protein stage (96 kDa).The enzymes (wild-type or mutated) were obtained and stored in elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The protein content was determined by the micro-Bradford method, using bovine serum albumin as a standard (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Electrophoresis of pure enzymes was carried out with the PHAST system (Amersham Biosciences), using PhastGel™ gradient 8-25 (Amersham Biosciences) ready made gels under denaturing conditions. Staining with 0.5% (w/v) AgNO3 led to a single-band profile.Kinetics of Soluble Compound Formation from 100 mm Sucrose Using Wild-type AS—Reaction in the presence of 100 mm sucrose was carried out at 30 °C in PBS buffer at pH 7.3, using pure wild-type AS at 375 mg/liter. During sucrose consumption, a white precipitate was observed in the medium, corresponding to the insoluble polymer. The soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g). During the reaction (2 h), samples from the soluble fraction were collected at regular intervals from 5 min and analyzed using HPLC on Dionex, C18, and Aminex columns for quantification. At the end of the reaction, the insoluble fraction was solubilized and analyzed by HPAEC (see “Carbohydrate Analysis”).Effect of Sucrose Concentration on the Distribution of the Products Synthesized by Wild-type AS—Reactions with the wild-type AS at 375 mg/liter were performed at 30 °C in PBS buffer at pH 7.3 in the presence of sucrose concentrations ranging from 100 to 900 mm. The sucrose was totally consumed except from 900 mm. At the end of the reaction, the soluble and insoluble (when formed) fractions were separated by centrifugation (5 min, 10,000 × g) and analyzed by HPAEC. The yields of the soluble compounds were determined by HPLC analyses (see “Carbohydrate Analysis”) and were expressed as a percentage of the sucrose consumed. The quantity of insoluble glucan synthesized was determined as the difference between the amount of sucrose consumed and the amount of glucosyl residues released by hydrolysis or in the form of soluble oligosaccharides.Comparison of Wild-type and Mutated AS—To compare wild-type and mutated enzymes, reactions were carried out at 30 °C in PBS buffer at pH 7.3 in the presence of 100 mm sucrose alone or supplemented with 30 g/liter glycogen. Purified wild-type or mutated GST/AS was employed at the following concentrations of AS (calculated to approach the same activity for each reaction): wild type, 100 mg/liter; R226A, 72 mg/liter; D394A, 247 mg/liter; R415A, 272 mg/liter; R446A, 120 mg/liter.At the end of the reaction in the presence of sucrose alone, the soluble and insoluble (when formed) fractions were separated and analyzed as described above for the wild-type AS assay. When glycogen was present in the medium, only the soluble fraction was analyzed by HPAEC.The specific activities were determined by measuring the initial rate of sucrose consumption, in the assay conditions. The specific activity of the variants was expressed relative to the specific activity of the wild-type AS.Carbohydrate Analysis—Soluble and insoluble oligosaccharides and sucrose isomers produced during the reaction were identified by HPAEC using a Dionex Carbo-Pack PA100 column at 25 °C. Before analysis, the insoluble fraction was first washed three times with one volume of water and solubilized in one volume of 1 m KOH at 4 °C for 15 h. Mobile phase (150 mm NaOH) was used at a 1 ml/min flow rate with a sodium acetate gradient (from 6 to 600 mm in 60 min). Detection was performed using a Dionex ED40 module with a gold working electrode and an Ag/AgCl pH reference. HPAEC allowed quantification of sucrose isomers.Sucrose, glucose, and fructose concentrations were measured by ion exchange chromatography at 25 °C using an Aminex HP87H column (Bio-Rad), with 8.5 mm H2SO4 at 0.5 ml/min as eluant. Detection was performed by refractometry.Maltooligosaccharide quantification was performed at 25 °C with an octadecyl reverse-phase chromatography column (C18) (Bischoff Chromatography), eluted with water at 0.5 ml/min. Detection was performed by refractometry.Fluorimetry—The fluorimetry experiments were performed using the inactive mutant E328Q purified as described previously (20.Sarçabal P. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Potocki de Montalk G. Svensson B. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The spectrum of denaturation was obtained using purified E328Q variant at 50 mg/liter in fluorimetry buffer (30 mm MOPS, 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.0) without any substrate or supplemented with 100 mm sucrose, 20 mm maltoheptaose or 10 g/liter glycogen. Thermal denaturation was followed at the rate of 1 °C/min at 334 nm.RESULTSCharacterization of the Soluble and Insoluble Products Synthesized by Wild-type AS in the Presence of 100 mm Sucrose—To investigate the mode of polymer formation, reaction in the presence of 100 mm sucrose was first performed using wild-type AS. The soluble and insoluble fractions formed were both analyzed by HPAEC.The chromatogram of the soluble fraction (Fig. 2A, Table I) shows the presence of glucose (G), maltose (G2), maltotriose (G3), and sucrose isomers (turanose and trehalulose) that were previously described by Potocki de Montalk et al. (12.Potocki de Montalk G. Remaud-Simeon M. Willemot R.M. Sarçabal P. Planchot V. Monsan P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, it also reveals the presence of maltooligosaccharides (MOS) longer than G3 that were not detected in the initial studies. In fact, all species between G4 and G25 were found in the soluble fraction. However, MOS from G4 to G25 were detected at very low concentrations (ranging from 0.03 to 0.05 mm) compared with G, G2, and G3 (from 2 to 5 mm) (Fig. 3). Thus, only 12% of the glucosyl units were incorporated from sucrose into these MOS, whereas the yield of G to G3 reached 26% (Table I).Fig. 2Dionex HPAEC profile of the soluble and insoluble fractions, obtained at the end of the reaction (t = 2 h) using wild-type AS in the presence of 100 mm sucrose.A, full scale of the profile of the soluble fraction; B, superposition of the profile of the soluble fraction (black) (enlarged scale) with the profile of the insoluble fraction (blue).

It also shows the presence of MOS from G4 to at least G35. The yield of the insoluble fraction was calculated from the difference between the amount of sucrose consumed and the glucosyl units incorporated into soluble saccharides and reached 45%.Kinetic Study of the Formation of Soluble Oligosaccharides Synthesized by Wild-type AS from 100 mm Sucrose—The production of glucose, sucrose isomers, and soluble MOS from G2 to G25 was followed versus time and is shown in Fig. 3, A and B. For clarity, we only report in Fig. 3B the concentrations of MOS from G4 to G13.Glucose appeared first in the medium followed by maltose and maltotriose. Maltotetraose was detected 5 min after the start of the reaction, whereas MOS having a degree of polymerization (DP) higher than 4 appeared after a delay of 20 min and were synthesized at almost the same rate (Fig. 3B). Sucrose isomer formation increased with the accumulation of fructose in the reaction medium (Fig. 3A). During the first 30 min of the reaction, all of the glucosyl moieties consumed were found to be present as glucose and soluble oligosaccharides from DP2 to DP25 (data not shown). Notably, no insoluble fraction was formed. After a 30-min reaction, the glucose incorporated into the soluble products no longer accounted for the sucrose consumed. The deficit observed is due to the formation of the insoluble fraction. This demonstrates that, during their elongation, maltooligosaccharides precipitate once they reach a critical length and concentration.Influence of Initial Sucrose Concentration on the Distribution of the Products Synthesized by Wild-type AS—In order to examine the influence of the initial sucrose concentration on the polymerization reaction, the products synthesized by wild-type AS in the presence of sucrose ranging from 100 to 900 mm were analyzed.

SIPS is not prevented by telomere elongation, indicating that, unlike replicative senescence, it is triggered by nonspecific genome-wide DNA damage rather than by telomere shortening. ATM, the product of the gene mutated in individuals with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), plays a central role in cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Whether ATM also mediates signaling that leads to SIPS was investigated with the use of normal and AT fibroblasts stably transfected with an expression vector for the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT). Expression of hTERT in AT fibroblasts resulted in telomere elongation and prevented premature replicative senescence, but it did not rescue the defect in G1 checkpoint activation or the hypersensitivity of the cells to IR. Despite these remaining defects in the DNA damage response, hTERT-expressing AT fibroblasts exhibited characteristics of senescence on exposure to IR or H2O2 in such a manner that triggers SIPS in normal fibroblasts. These characteristics included the adoption of an enlarged and flattened morphology, positive staining for senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, termination of DNA synthesis, and accumulation of p53, p21WAF1, and p16INK4A. The phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), which mediates signaling that leads to senescence, was also detected in both IR- or H2O2-treated AT and normal fibroblasts expressing hTERT. These results suggest that the ATM-dependent signaling pathway triggered by DNA damage is dispensable for activation of p38 MAPK and SIPS in response to IR or oxidative stress.

Culture of primary cells for many generations eventually results in a loss of proliferative potential, a phenomenon referred to as replicative senescence or, more generally, as cellular senescence. Cellular senescence can also be induced by stressful conditions (1.Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Replicative senescence likely results from the shortening of telomeres to such an extent that the chromosome ends are not fully masked from recognition by the proteins responsible for double strand break repair. Whereas primary human fibroblasts, which lack telomerase activity, normally exhibit a finite life span in culture (2.Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp.

Although rodent cells in culture also undergo senescence, this phenotype is attributable to unsuitable conditions (culture shock) or to growth arrest mediated by p53 and p19Arf, not to telomere shortening per se. In contrast, the major signaling pathway responsible for senescence in human cells, including that due to telomere shortening, is mediated by RB and p16INK4A (4.Shay J.W. Wright W.E.

Some oncogenes, such as those for c-Myc and E2F1, trigger apoptosis (6.Hermeking H. Eick D. Science. 1994; 265: 2091-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar, 7.Kowalik T.F. DeGregori J. Leone G. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1998; 9: 113-118PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others, such as those for Ras and Raf, trigger a permanent and irreversible cell cycle arrest that is reminiscent of replicative senescence and termed oncogenic stress-induced senescence (8.Serrano M.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Such senescence-like growth arrest induced by oncogenic Ras is accompanied by the accumulation of growth inhibitors such as p53 and p16INK4A (8.Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrac M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W.

The induction of premature senescence or apoptosis is important for tumor suppression in the presence of oncogenic stimuli.Cells subjected to other types of sublethal stress also enter a state that closely resembles replicative senescence and is referred to as stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) (10.Toussaint O.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5210-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) thus enter SIPS. Cells undergoing SIPS manifest all the major characteristics of replicatively senescent cells, including an enlarged flattened morphology and positive staining for senescence-associated (SA) β-galactosidase activity. Rapid shortening of telomeres is also associated with SIPS (10.Toussaint O. Medrano E.E. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 927-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Overexpression of antioxidant proteins in human fibroblasts slows the rate of telomere shortening and extends their life span (18.Serra V. von Zglinicki T. Lorenz M. Saretzki G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6824-6830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Accelerated telomere shortening caused by oxidative stress has thus been suggested as a cause of SIPS (10.Toussaint O. Medrano E.E. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 927-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 19.von Zglinicki T. Trends Biochem.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 229-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, no difference in SIPS induction was detected between parental and hTERT-expressing human fibroblasts after exposure to H2O2 or to ultraviolet or x-radiation, and telomere shortening was not apparent in the hTERT-expressing cells during SIPS induction (21.Gorbunova V. Seluanov A. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38540-38549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These observations thus indicate that, in contrast to replicative senescence, SIPS cannot be prevented by hTERT-mediated telomere elongation (21.Gorbunova V. Seluanov A. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38540-38549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). They further suggest that SIPS is triggered not only by telomere shortening but also by nonspecific genome-wide DNA damage. Senescence induced by oncogenic Ras is prevented by inhibition of the activity of the p38 (stress-activated) isoform of mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), suggesting that activation of p38 MAPK is essential for oncogenic stress-induced senescence (22.Wang W. Chen J.X. Liao R. Deng Q. Zhou J.J. Huang S. Sun P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3389-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The activation of p38 MAPK also contributes to the onset of senescence induced by telomere shortening, oxidative stress, culture shock, or activation of Ras-Raf signaling (23.Iwasa H. Han J. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathway responsible for p38 MAPK activation during SIPS induction is not well characterized.Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive neurological degeneration, telangiectasia, growth retardation, specific immunodeficiency, high sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR), an increased incidence of malignancy, and premature aging of the skin and hair (24.Sedgwick R.P.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 177-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Mitotic cells, such as fibroblasts and lymphoblasts, from individuals with AT exhibit a variety of anomalies in culture include an increased sensitivity to IR and radiomimetic agents, radioresistant DNA synthesis, chromosomal instability, a reduced life span, and an increased rate of telomere loss (26.Taylor A.M.

ATM, the product of the gene mutated in AT patients, regulates the phosphorylation of many proteins important in cell cycle checkpoints triggered by DNA damage and in DNA repair, including c-Abl, NBS1, BRCA1, Chk2, p53, MDM2, FANCD2, and SMC1 (32.Baskaran R.

ATM thus plays a central role in the response to DNA damage by contributing to the G1, S, and G2-M cell cycle checkpoints (33.Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Jackson S.P. Mulhern T.D. Cell Death & Differ. 2001; 8: 1052-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 34.Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar, 35.Appella E.

For example, ATM phosphorylates and activates Chk2 in response to IR, resulting in the stabilization and activation of p53, the induction of p21WAF1 (p21CIP1) expression, and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase (36.Anderson C.W.

ATM has recently been shown to contribute to telomere maintenance and to senescence signaling originating from telomeres (45.Wong K.K. Maser R.S. Bachoo R.M. Menon J. Carrasco D.R. Gu Y. Alt F.W.

In addition to its role as a damage sensor for cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair, ATM mediates up-regulation of ATF3, a target of p38 MAPK, in cells exposed to IR (47.Kool J. Hamdi M. Cornelissen-Steijger P. van der Eb A.J. Terleth C. van Dam H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4235-4242Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggesting that it acts as a trigger for stress-related MAPK signaling by activating c-Abl (32.Baskaran R. Wood L.D. Whitaker L.L. Canman C.E. Morgan S.E. Xu Y. Barlow C. Baltimore D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Kastan M.B. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1997; 387: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). ATM has thus been proposed to function as a stress sensor in SIPS (48.Barzilai A. Rotman G. Shiloh Y. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). It has not been possible to study SIPS in AT cells, however, because of their premature replicative senescence. To evaluate the possible role of ATM in SIPS, we therefore established hTERT-expressing AT fibroblasts and examined whether SIPS is induced in these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Infection—Primary human dermal fibroblasts established from a normal individual (YMM) or from individuals with AT (AT1KY, AT2KY, AT4KY, AT5KY, AT6KY, and AT1OS) were cultured under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (49.Ejima Y. Sasaki M.S. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The retroviral vector pMX-puro-hTERT (23.Iwasa H. Han J. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and Phenix-A retroviral packaging cells were kindly provided by F. Ishikawa (Kyoto University), T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo), and G. P. Nolan (Stanford University). For retrovirus production, we transfected Phenix-A cells with pMX-puro-hTERT with the use of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The resulting retroviruses were used to infect fibroblasts, which were then selected in medium containing puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). To examine the kinetics of cell proliferation, we plated hTERT-expressing and parental primary fibroblasts (2 × 105 cells) in 95-mm-diameter culture dishes and determined the cell number with a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) at each passage. The number of population doublings (PD value) was calculated from PD = log(Nf/N0)/log 2, where Nf is the final cell number and N0 is the initial number of seeded cells.Determination of Telomerase Activity and Telomere Length—Telomerase activity was determined by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) with the use of a TPAPeze kit (Intergen, Purchase, NY). Telomere length was measured with a terminal restriction fragment (TRF) assay. Genomic DNA (5 μg) was thus digested with HinfI and RsaI, and the resulting fragments were subjected to Southern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled telomeric oligonucleotide probe, (TTAGGG)4; hybridization was performed for 12–15 h at 37 °C in a solution containing 0.75 m NaCl, 30 mm sodium citrate, and 1% SDS. Signals were visualized by autoradiography.Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were labeled for the indicated times with 10 μm bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), fixed with 70% ethanol, and stained with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody to BrdUrd (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and with propidium iodide (Sigma). The cellular content of DNA was determined by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur instrument, and analysis of the resulting data was carried out with CELL Quest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).Clonogenic Assay—Clonogenic assays were performed as described previously (26.Taylor A.M. Harnden D.G. Arlett C.F. Harcourt S.A. Lehmann A.R. Stevens S. Bridges B.A. Nature. 1975; 258: 427-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Cells in the exponential phase of growth were plated on 95-mm culture dishes, incubated for 24 h, and then irradiated at room temperature, at the indicated doses, with a 137Cs γ-ray source at a rate of 1.143 Gy/min. The number of cells per dish was chosen to ensure that ∼100 colonies would survive the particular treatment. After 2 weeks, cells were fixed with methanol:acetic acid (3:1, v/v) and stained with crystal violet. Only colonies containing >50 cells were judged to be derived from viable clonogenic cells.Induction and Analysis of SIPS—For x-irradiation, cells (5 × 105) were seeded in 95-mm dishes, incubated for 3 days, and exposed to 55 Gy of x-radiation at a rate of 7.32 Gy/min (21.Gorbunova V. Seluanov A. Pereira-Smith O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38540-38549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For H2O2 treatment, cells were exposed to 500 μm H2O2 for 2 h at 37 °C. All cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cultured for 10 days in culture medium, fixed, stained for SA β-galactosidase activity as described (50.Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelly C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5613) Google Scholar), and counterstained with propidium iodide.Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 125 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m NaF, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration of the lysate was determined with the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL), after which samples (50 μg of protein) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with mouse monoclonal antibodies to ATM (2C-1; GeneTex, San Antonio, TX), sheep polyclonal antibodies to Chk2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), mouse monoclonal antibodies to p53 (Ab-6; Oncogene Research, Cambridge, MA), mouse monoclonal antibodies to p21WAF1 (F-5; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal antibodies to α -tubulin (B-5-1-2, Sigma), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p16INK4A (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p38 MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or mouse monoclonal antibodies to phosphorylated (Thr180 and Tyr182) p38 MAPK (28B10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immune complexes were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL Plus system (Amersham Bioscience, Piscataway, NJ).RESULTSEstablishment of hTERT-expressing AT Fibroblasts—Primary fibroblasts derived from individuals with AT exhibit a variety of abnormalities, including defective cell cycle checkpoint function in response to DNA damage as well as rapid shortening of telomere length and consequent premature replicative senescence. To examine the role of ATM in SIPS, we established primary fibroblasts from a normal individual (normal/TERT) and from AT patients (AT/TERT) that stably express hTERT as a result of infection with a recombinant retrovirus. The cells were selected and expanded as polyclonal populations. Telomerase activity was detected by the TRAP assay in AT1KY/TERT, AT2KY/TERT, AT4KY/TERT, AT5KY/TERT, AT6KY/TERT, and AT1OS/TERT cells as well as in normal/TERT cells but not in the corresponding parental cells (Fig. 1A; data not shown). Reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction analysis also revealed the presence of hTERT mRNA in AT/TERT and normal/TERT cells but not in the corresponding parental cells (data not shown). The TRF assay showed that the telomere length of AT/TERT cells was extended to >12 kb, compared with ∼4–11 kb for parental AT cells (Fig. 1B). Whereas parental AT cells underwent replicative senescence after ∼24 PDs (Fig. 2A), AT/TERT cells survived for >70 to 100 PDs (Fig. 2B, data not shown). These results indicated that the telomere elongation induced by expression of hTERT allowed AT cells to overcome premature replicative senescence.Fig. 2Proliferation of parental (A) and hTERT-expressing (B) AT fibroblasts. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105 per 95-mm dish and passaged (after 7–9 days) before they achieved confluence. The number of cells was determined at each passage, and the PD value was calculated. For parental cells, time zero was defined as the time of initial plating; for hTERT-expressing cells, it was defined as the beginning of retroviral infection.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Defective Checkpoint Function in AT/TERT Cells Exposed to IR—AT fibroblasts show defective cell cycle checkpoint responses to DNA damage induced by IR (51.Kastan M.B.

To examine whether the abnormality of the G1 cell cycle checkpoint in AT fibroblasts was rescued by hTERT expression, we exposed asynchronous normal/TERT or AT/TERT cells to IR and determined the numbers of cells in G1, S, and G2-M phases of the cell cycle 8 h thereafter by flow cytometry. The proportion of normal/TERT cells in S phase (BrdUrd-positive) was greatly reduced 8 h after irradiation, whereas IR had no effect on the proportion of AT/TERT cells in S phase (Fig. 3A). The IR-induced G1 checkpoint is triggered by sequential signaling by ATM, Chk2, p53, and p21WAF1 (40.Takai H. Naka K. Okada Y. Watanabe M. Harada N. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Nakanishi M. Suzuki H. Nagashima K. Sawa H. Ikeda K. Motoyama N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Although ATM was detected in normal/TERT cells, this protein was not apparent in AT/TERT cells by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 3B). The IR-induced phosphorylation and activation of Chk2, as revealed by a decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the protein, were also evident in normal/TERT cells but not in AT/TERT cells (Fig. 3B). Consistent with these observations, up-regulation of p21WAF1 in response to IR was apparent in normal/TERT cells but not in AT/TERT cells (Fig. 3B). Activation of the ATM-Chk2-p53-p21WAF1 signaling pathway by IR was thus impaired in the AT/TERT cells. Like primary AT fibroblasts, AT/TERT cells also exhibit a defective G1 cell cycle checkpoint as a result of their ATM deficiency.Fig. 3Defective G1 checkpoint response to IR in hTERT-expressing AT fibroblasts. A, cell cycle analysis. Asynchronous normal/TERT or AT/TERT cells were exposed (or not) to 4 Gy of x-radiation (1.6 Gy/min) and then cultured for 7 h in the absence and 1 h in the presence of 10 μm BrdUrd. The cells were then fixed, stained with both fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies to BrdUrd and propidium iodide, and analyzed by flow cytometry. B, analysis of signaling via the ATM-Chk2-p53-p21WAF1 pathway. hTERT-expressing normal and AT fibroblasts were irradiated as in A and, after incubation for 2 h, lysed and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the indicated proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Radiosensitivity of AT/TERT Cells—AT fibroblasts are markedly more sensitive to IR than are normal cells. To examine whether hTERT expression affected the radiosensitivity of AT cells, we performed a clonogenic survival assay after exposure of AT/TERT, normal/TERT, and the corresponding parental cells to various doses of IR. Consistent with previous report, both AT/TERT cells and primary AT fibroblasts were hypersensitive to IR in comparison with normal fibroblast and normal/TERT cells (Fig. 4) (41.Wood L.D.

Kallmann's syndrome, clinically characterized by anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, is due to an abnormality in the migration of olfactory and GnRH neurons. We recently characterized the human FNC-B4 cell line, which retains properties present in vivo in both olfactory and GnRH neurons. In this study, we found that FNC-B4 neurons expressed GnRH receptor and responded to GnRH with time- and dose-dependent increases in GnRH gene expression and protein release (up to 5-fold). In addition, GnRH and its analogs stimulated cAMP production and calcium mobilization, although at different biological thresholds (nanomolar for cAMP and micromolar concentrations for calcium). We also observed that GnRH triggered axon growth, actin cytoskeleton remodeling, and a dose-dependent increase in migration (up to 3–4-fold), whereas it down-regulated nestin expression. All these effects were blocked by a specific GnRH receptor antagonist, cetrorelix. We suggest that GnRH, secreted by olfactory neuroblasts, acts in an autocrine pattern to promote differentiation and migration of those cells that diverge from the olfactory sensory lineage and are committed to becoming GnRH neurons.

GnRH neurons are unique in that they arise from progenitor cells located outside of the central nervous system, in the olfactory placode. These neurons migrate through the nasal septum into the basal forebrain, where they establish their final scattered distribution within the septal and hypothalamic regions of the brain (1.Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 2.Wray S. Grant P. Gainer H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the migration of the hypothalamic GnRH-producing neurons from the nasal region along the olfactory placode axons into the brain are still not fully understood. A detailed understanding of the process of GnRH migration clearly requires a complete cellular and molecular characterization of the GnRH neuron during early development. The physical migration of the GnRH neuron is well established. These cells migrate along olfactory axon bundles and reach the brain (nasal-forebrain junction). Recent studies (3.Kramer P.R. Wray S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1824-1834PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Schwanzel-Fukuda M. Pfaff D.W. Prog. Brain Res. 2002; 141: 59-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) highlight some trophic factors and potential guidance molecules that are involved in this process and that appear to play a role in the establishment and maintenance of the olfactory networks. Two immortalized GnRH-expressing neuronal cell lines, GT1 and GN, represent useful model systems for in vitro study of GnRH neuron biology. These cell lines have been isolated from tumors induced by genetically targeting the expression of the simian virus 40 large T antigen in mouse GnRH neurons (5.Mellon P.L. Windle J.J. Goldsmith P.C.

However, the factors that regulate the outgrowth and targeting of olfactory axons from the nose to the hypothalamus during embryogenesis have not yet been identified in humans. The GnRH-secreting neurons migrate across the nasal septum into the preoptic area, where they reside and project axons to the median eminence. Disruption of the migratory process, as expressed by olfactory axon targeting, is most likely a pathogenic factor for severe forms of reproductive dysfunctions and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, such as Kallmann's syndrome (13.Rugarli E.I. Lutz B. Kuratani S.C. Wawersik S. Borsani G. Ballabio A. Eichele G. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Kallmann's syndrome is considered a congenital form of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. It is characterized by the association of an inability to smell (anosmia) with a defect in gonadal development due to GnRH deficiency (13.Rugarli E.I. Lutz B. Kuratani S.C. Wawersik S. Borsani G.

However, in humans, Kallmann's syndrome is characterized by considerable clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Some individuals with Kallmann's syndrome also display synkinesia, eye movement abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, pes cavus, unilateral renal agenesia, and cleft palate (13.Rugarli E.I.

For the congenital forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the genes currently recognized are KAL and FGFR1, associated with Kallmann's syndrome; DAX 1, associated with adrenohypoplasia congenita; GnRH receptor, associated with resistance to GnRH therapy; and three loci also associated with obesity, leptin (OB), leptin receptor (DB), and prohormone convertase (PC1) (17.Seminara S.B.

A less well characterized group of acquired hypogonadotropic hypogonadism encompasses a wide range of disorders such as infiltrative processes and space-occupying lesions, i.e. hemochromatosis, pituitary adenomas, and other tumors. Some forms of idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, without an identifiable cause, develop after puberty, arising in sexually mature men. This adult-onset hypogonadotropic hypogonadism represents one of the few treatable forms of male infertility (15.Nachtigall L.B. Boepple P.A. Pralong F.P. Crowley Jr, W.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 410-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our contribution to clarify this complex biological problem has been to utilize the human GnRH-secreting neuronal cell line, FNC-B4 neurons (21.Vannelli G.B. Ensoli F. Zonefrati R. Kubota Y.

These primary long term cell cultures have been established, cloned, and propagated in vitro from human fetal olfactory epithelium (21.Vannelli G.B. Ensoli F. Zonefrati R. Kubota Y. Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Camici G. Barni T. Thiele C.J. Balboni G.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4382-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FNC-B4 cells expressed both neuronal proteins and olfactory genes and were responsive to odorant stimuli. They also maintained neuroendocrine properties. FNC-B4 neurons not only produced GnRH and responded to sex steroids, but they were sensitive to odorants in terms of GnRH production (22.Barni T. Maggi M. Fantoni G. Granchi S. Mancina R. Gulisano M.

Neuroendocrinology. 1999; 70: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), also modulated their secretory pattern. Thus, FNC-B4 cells with both olfactory and neuroendocrine characteristics, such as those that may occur in the human olfactory epithelium during organogenesis, provide an useful in vitro tool to study those factors potentially involved in olfactory or neuroendocrine phenotype commitment in humans. In the current paper, a new role for GnRH is presented. GnRH can modulate the differentiation and migration of GnRH-secreting neurons, FNC-B4 cells, by receptor-mediated mechanisms. Chemicals—GnRH (2200 Ci/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences; the GnRH radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit was obtained from Buhlmann Laboratories AG (Allschwil, Switzerland). GnRH agonist buserelin (d-tert-butyl-Ser6-des-Gly10-Pro9-ethylamide-GnRH) was purchased from Sigma. GnRH antagonist cetrorelix (Ac-d-Nal (2)1, d-Phe (4Cl)2, d-Pal (3)3, d-Cit6, d-Ala10) was purchased from ASTA Medica GmbH (Frankfurt, Germany). Antisera—The following monoclonal antibodies (MA) were used for immunocytochemical or immunoblot analysis: mouse MA to human pituitary GnRH-R (F1G4), kindly provided by Dr. A. A. Karande, Department of Biochemistry, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India (27.Karande A.A. Rajeshwari K. Schol D.J. Hilgers J.H.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 114: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); mouse MA to human vimentin (Vm; clone V9); mouse MA to human GAP43 (clone NCL-GAP43); and MA to human neurofilament 200 (NF200) (clone N52) were from Sigma; mouse MA to human actin (C-2) sc-8432 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); and mouse MA to human nestin (clone 10C2) was from Chemicon International Inc. (Temecula, CA). Other reagents were obtained at the highest grade available from commercial sources. Cell Cultures—The primary neuroblast long term cell culture, FNC-B4, was established, cloned, and propagated in vitro from human fetal olfactory epithelium, as described previously (21.Vannelli G.B. Ensoli F. Zonefrati R. Kubota Y. Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Camici G. Barni T. Thiele C.J. Balboni G.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4382-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cells have the some properties as those of immature neurons, they can differentiate and express neuronal markers and olfactory genes, as well as neuroendocrine characteristics (21.Vannelli G.B. Ensoli F. Zonefrati R. Kubota Y. Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Camici G. Barni T. Thiele C.J. Balboni G.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4382-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Barni T. Maggi M. Fantoni G.

FNC-B4 cells, grown as a monolayer, are non-tumorigenic and have a normal human karyotype. FNC-B4 cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Coon's modified F-12 medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum (Laboratoires Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), antibiotic/antimycotic solution (penicillin, 100 IU/ml; streptomycin, 100 μg/ml). Coon's modified F-12 medium was purchased from Irvine Scientific (Santa Ana, CA). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR Amplification—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using an RNeasy Midi Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA (500 ng) was retrotranscribed and then amplified using a Superscript One Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Specific oligonucleotide primers for the GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) mRNA were purchased from Invitrogen. The specific primers for human GnRH-R covered a 353-bp region of the human GnRH-R mRNA sequence, as deposited in the GenBank™ at NCBI (accession number NM_000406). The sequence of the sense primers was 5′-GTG TTG TGA AAG CCA GAC CA-3′. The sequence of the antisense primers was 5′-GTG GGA TGC TGT TGT TGA TG-3′. The contamination of genomic DNA was excluded by performing 35 cycles of amplification without retrotranscription. The integrity of the total RNA was verified by performing RT-PCR for the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The sequences of primers for GAPDH were: 5′-CCA TGG AGA AGG CTG GGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAA AGT TGT CAT GGA TGA CC-3′ (antisense) (28.Peri A. Dubin N.H. Dhanireddy R. Mukherjee A.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR—Primers and probes for β-actin and GnRH were as follows (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA): β-actin forward primer, 5′-TCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTACGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAGCGGAACCGCTCATTGCCAATGG-3′; the specific fluorescent probe, 5′-FAM-ATGCCCCCCCATGCCATCCTGCGTp-3′; GnRH forward primer, 5′-TGATTGTGCATTCATGTGCCT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCCACGCACGAAGTCAGTAGA-3′; the specific fluorescent probe for GnRH, 5′-FAM-AAGCCAATTCAAAAACTCCTAGCTGGCCTTAp-3′. Quantitative mRNA analysis was performed by simultaneous amplification of a target sequence, i.e. β-actin and GnRH, together with a housekeeping gene (GAPDH) (20× concentrated primer/probe mix, VIC®-labeled probe; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Probes were cleaved by the 5′-3′ exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase, allowing for the generation of target-specific fluorescence, followed and analyzed by real-time PCR assay in Micro-Amp optical 96-well plate using the automated ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The use of different labeled sets of probes allowed for the simultaneous analysis of several targets. GAPDH primers and probe concentrations have been lowered by Applied Biosystems to achieve the same Ct (cycle threshold) values obtained in the above single-plex PCR but lower Rn (fluorescence values); this ensured the ability of exactly quantifying target copy numbers without limiting the housekeeping (GAPDH) reaction. Real-time PCR was performed in a 25-μl final volume with 2× universal master mix, 1× GAPDH mix, 300 nm primer sets and 200 nm probes (either GnRH or β-actin), and 50 ng of cDNA. PCR was carried out with the following universal profile: 2 min at 50 °C (uracil-N-glycosylase activity), 3 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C for 40 cycles. Results were analyzed by ABI Prism Sequence Detection System software (version 1.7) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and plotted by Microsoft Excel Software (Microsoft Excel Corp., New York, NY). SDS-PAGE, Western Blot Analysis, and Immunoblotting—FNC-B4, DU145, HeLa, and LNCaP cells, grown to confluence, were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+/Mg2+-free), centrifuged, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EGTA). Protein concentration was measured according to Bradford (29.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) by the Coomassie Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Aliquots containing 30 μg of proteins were diluted in 2× reducing Laemmli's sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, 2.5% pyronin, and 100 mm dithiothreitol) and loaded onto 8 and 10% SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon-P transfer membranes polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore®, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in 5% BSA-TTBS buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl), washed in TTBS, and incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies (F1G4 antibody 1:2000; anti-actin antibody 1:500; anti-nestin antibody 1:500) diluted in 2% BSA-TTBS, followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary IgG (Sigma). Finally, the reacted proteins were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL; Roche Diagnostics). Binding Studies—Binding studies were performed as described previously (23.Maggi M. Barni T. Fantoni G. Mancina R. Pupilli C. Luconi M. Crescioli C. Serio M. Vannelli G.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 85: 1658-1665PubMed Google Scholar). Confluent FNC-B4 cells were washed once with 20 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5% BSA, pH 7.4, and incubated in 200 μl of the same binding medium at 22 °C for 60 min with fixed concentrations (15–50 pm) of [125I]GnRH in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled GnRH (10–11-10–7m). After incubation, the cells were washed extensively using ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% BSA, solubilized in 0.5 n NaOH, and the cell-bound radioactivity was determined. Measurements were obtained in triplicate. Cell counts routinely varied by less than 10% in each of the wells. GnRH RIA—Immunoreactive GnRH was extracted from conditioned media of FNC-B4 cells with chilled absolute ethanol (–20 C°), evaporated to dryness, and subjected to RIA using a commercial kit (Buhlmann Laboratories AG, Allschwil, Switzerland), as described previously (22.Barni T. Maggi M. Fantoni G. Granchi S. Mancina R. Gulisano M. Marra F. Macorsini E. Luconi M. Rotella C. Serio M. Balboni G.C. Vannelli G.B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 4266-4273PubMed Google Scholar). Before extraction, the recovery of unlabeled GnRH added to the media was 81%. A close parallelism with the standard curve was found when serial dilution of FNC-B4 cell conditioned media or extracts of the arcuate nucleus of the rat hypothalamus were subjected to RIA. Digital Video Imaging of Intracellular Free Calcium—Digital video imaging of the intracellular-free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual human FNC-B4 cells was performed as described previously (30.Pinzani M. Failli P. Ruocco C. Casini A. Milani S. Baldi E. Giotti A. Gentilini P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Human neurons were grown to subconfluence in complete culture medium on round glass coverslips (25-mm diameter, 0.2-mm thick) for 72 h and then incubated for 48 h in serum-free medium. Cells were then loaded with 10 μmol/liter Fura-2/AM and 15% Pluronic F-127 for 30 min at 22 °C. [Ca2+]i was measured in Fura-2-loaded cells in HEPES-NaHCO3 buffer containing 140 mmol/liter NaCl, 3 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter NaH2PO4, 12 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 1.2 mmol/liter MgCl2, 1.0 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, and 10 mmol/liter glucose, pH 7.4. Ratio images (340/380 nm) were collected every 3 s, and calibration curves were obtained for each cell preparation (30.Pinzani M. Failli P. Ruocco C. Casini A. Milani S. Baldi E. Giotti A. Gentilini P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). GnRH or an analog (buserelin) (from 10 μm to 100 nm) were added directly to the perfusion chamber immediately after recording the [Ca2+]i basal value. In parallel experiments, cells were preincubated with 0.1–1 μm cetrorelix for 10 min before the addition of GnRH or buserelin. cAMP Determination—Cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to subconfluence in Coon's modified F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. After removing the medium, cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in assay buffer (0.025 mol/liter Tris acetate, 0.25 mol/liter sucrose, 0.5% BSA, 5 mmol/liter glucose, and 0.6 mmol/liter 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of buserelin or GnRH. Experiments were also performed by incubating FNC-B4 cells with a fixed (1 μm) concentration of cetrorelix. To stop the reaction, equal volumes of cold (–20 °C) absolute ethanol were added, and samples were reconstituted with 50 mmol/liter sodium acetate, pH 6.2, after vacuum drying. cAMP was determined in 100-μl aliquots of the supernatant using both an enzyme immunoassay kit (EIA system; Amersham Biosciences) and an RIA kit (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) as described previously (21.Vannelli G.B. Ensoli F. Zonefrati R. Kubota Y. Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Camici G. Barni T. Thiele C.J. Balboni G.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4382-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine BSA as standard. All assays were performed in duplicate. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Microscopy—FNC-B4 cells were cultured on glass coverslips in serum-free medium for 18 h and then left untreated or incubated with GnRH or buserelin. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde 3.7%, pH 7.4, for 10 min and then permeabilized for 10 min with phosphate-buffered saline (Ca2+/Mg2+-free) containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunostaining was performed as described previously (21.Vannelli G.B. Ensoli F. Zonefrati R. Kubota Y. Arcangeli A. Becchetti A. Camici G. Barni T. Thiele C.J. Balboni G.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4382-4394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using anti-vimentin (1:100), anti-GAP43 (1: 50), anti-neurofilament (1:200), anti-actin (1:100), and anti-nestin (1: 200) antibodies, followed by A-11001 Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) conjugate (1:200) antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). F-actin was stained with rhodamine phalloidin (1:50) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in the permeabilization solution for 45 min at room temperature. Cells were viewed with a laser scanner confocal microscope (MRC 600; Bio-Rad Laboratories) equipped with a Nikon diaphot inverted microscope or with Nikon Microphot-FX microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Chemotactic Assay—Cell migration was carried out as described previously (31.Carloni V. Romanelli R.G. Pinzani M. Laffi G. Gentilini P. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 522-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Briefly, modified Boyden chambers (Nuclepore Inc., Pleasanton, CA), equipped with a 13-mm diameter and an 8-μm porosity polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filters were used; the filters were coated with 20 μg/ml human type I collagen (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA) for 30 min at 37 °C. Confluent FNC-B4 cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h and then treated with increasing concentrations of GnRH or buserelin, in the presence or absence of cetrorelix used at 10–7m and pertussis toxin (PTX; 100 ng/ml). After mild trypsinization with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, a 210-μl aliquot, corresponding to 4 × 104 cells/Boyden chamber, was added to the top wells and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 6 h. After incubation, the migrated cells were fixed in 96% methanol and stained with Harris' hematoxylin solution. Chemotaxis was quantitated by counting six randomly chosen fields per filter, and results were expressed as the number of cells/high power field. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance, followed by Duncan's test and by unpaired and paired Student's t test, with the level of p < 0.05 accepted as statistically significant. The computer program ALLFIT was used for the analysis of sigmoidal dose-response curves (32.De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding data were evaluated quantitatively with nonlinear least square curve fitting using the computer program LIGAND (33.Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal.

Previously identified cross-links derived from these molecules have nearly always required more than one molecule of each type, although this is physiologically less likely than a reaction involving a single molecule. Here we provide indirect but strong evidence for a malondialdehyde-derived cross-link requiring just one malondialdehyde molecule to link arginine and lysine, giving 2-ornithinyl-4-methyl(1ϵ-lysyl)1,3-imidazole following a 4-day incubation of albumin with 8 mm malondialdehyde. This cross-link was identified as its partial degradation product Nϵ-(2-carboxyl,2-aminoethane)-Nϵ-methanoyl-lysine by NMR and mass spectrometry. Analysis of plasma from treated diabetic patients revealed that one patient levels had as high as 0.46%, 0.67% of their lysine/arginine residues modified by this cross-link, although others had lower levels. Alkaline hydrolysis of serum albumin also revealed two acid-labile malondialdehyde adducts of histidine in significant quantities, the isomers 4- and 2-ethylidene-histidine. These constituted up to 0.93% of the histidines in treated diabetic patients. Although collagen is readily cross-linked by malondialdehyde, none of these particular products could be found in incubations of collagen with malondialdehyde.

Commun. 1988; 151: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Many of these have only one functional group, leaving the most toxic major products as 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde (MDA), 1The abbreviations used are: MDA, malondialdehyde; BSA, bovine serum albumin; 2EH, 2-ethylidene histidine; 4EH, 4-ethylidene histidine; NNL, Nϵ-(2-carboxyl,2-aminoethane)-Nϵϵ-methanoyl-lysine; OMLI, 2-ornithinyl-4-methyl(1ϵ-lysyl)1,3-imidazole; MS, mass spectroscopy. the latter being the focus of this paper. These oxidation products, mainly derived from the fats carried by lipoprotein, are implicated in the progression of atheroma by reacting with the collagen arterial wall. Compared with many aldehydes, MDA is relatively nonreactive at neutral pH as it has a pKa value of 4.46, above which it favors the enolate salt form (3.Slatter D.A. Murray M Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) stabilized by a conjugated Π-bond system. Resonance stabilization reduces the electrophilicity of MDA, decreasing its reactivity with protein-based amine groups such as lysine and arginine, for example, in comparison with reaction with glutaraldehyde. Thus, MDA has a half-life in vitro with 10 mm lysine of approximately 2 days (3.Slatter D.A. Murray M Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, free MDA is removed from the bloodstream much faster, having a half-life of ∼2 h in rats (4.Siu G.M. Draper H.H. Lipids. 1982; 17: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), with 2-propenal adducts being detected in urine (2.Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5903) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a significant proportion of MDA has a longer half-life in vivo because it binds to protein amine groups mainly as a temporary and unstable 3-iminoprop-1-en-1-ol adduct, β-lysylaminoacrolein (5.Slatter D.A. Bolton C.H. Bailey A.J. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The presence of these labile MDA adducts is supported by various ways of measuring MDA, which indicate that at least 80% MDA in tissues is bound reversibly to protein in vivo (5.Slatter D.A. Bolton C.H. Bailey A.J. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Incubation of collageneous rat tail tendon in a 10 mm MDA solution for 24 h at 37 °C and pH 7.4 induces structural changes in collagen, increasing both the mechanical brittleness and insolubility of the fibers and forcing the conclusion that extensive cross-linking has occurred. We have shown that MDA and acetaldehyde can react with collagen to give a potential cross-linking dihydropyridine product (3.Slatter D.A. Murray M Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and others (6.Tuma D.J. Kearley M.L. Thiele G.M. Worrall S. Haver A. Klassen L.W. Sorrell M.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.Yamada S. Kumazawa S. Ishii T. Nakayama T. Itakura K. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Sakai K. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have confirmed this finding. However, under the same conditions, 70 mm MDA hardly cross-links 25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (8.Mooradian A.D. Reinacher D. Li J.P. Pinnas J.L. Nutrition. 2001; 17: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), 2D. A. Slatter, N. C. Avery, and A. J. Bailey, unpublished observations. as demonstrated by the absence of an observable dimer band on SDS-PAGE gels after this time period. On the other hand, heavy cross-linking of BSA is observed when the reaction is carried out in the presence of acetaldehyde but not acetaldehyde alone, suggesting synergy between the two reagents (8.Mooradian A.D. Reinacher D. Li J.P. Pinnas J.L. Nutrition. 2001; 17: 619-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Several MDA cross-links have been proposed involving synergy with other reactive agents, but MDA crosslinks of collagen may also involve reaction with the existing enzymatic cross-links (3.Slatter D.A. Murray M Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Other potential cross-links and MDA-derived adducts beyond β-LAA commonly require more than one MDA molecule being required to form the proposed structure, even in the presence of acetaldehyde (3.Slatter D.A. Murray M Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6.Tuma D.J. Kearley M.L. Thiele G.M. Worrall S. Haver A. Klassen L.W. Sorrell M.F. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 7.Yamada S. Kumazawa S. Ishii T. Nakayama T. Itakura K. Shibata N. Kobayashi M. Sakai K. Osawa T. Uchida K. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1187-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Gomez-Sanchez A. Hermosin I. May I. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 229: 307-322Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Such a reaction would be less likely under physiological conditions because MDA is at very low serum concentrations, and even in a “glycation hotspot,” the environment of an atherosclerotic plaque (10.Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1708-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) would be competing with many other oxidized fatty acid or sugar products for reactive lysine. In addition, blood clearance rates of even lightly glycated proteins or erythrocytes are considerably faster than normal (11.Nagai R. Matsumoto K. Ling X. Suzuki H. Araki T. Horiuchi S. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1714-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 12.Wautier J.L. Wautier M.P. Schmidt A.-M. Anderson G.M. Hori O. Zoukourian C. Capron L. Chappey O. Yan S.-D. Brett J. Guillausseau P.-J. Stern D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7742-7746Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that either the scavenger receptors will remove MDA-adducted proteins long before a second MDA can react to form any cross-linking structure or that other molecules will react with bound MDA first rather than a second MDA molecule. Therefore, physiologically important MDA cross-links are most likely to involve just one MDA molecule. It is also possible that the rapid formation of MDA cross-links only occurs in the presence of a higher concentration secondary metabolite such as acetaldehyde. Well characterized protein cross-links formed in vivo follow these patterns. For example, pentosidine and DOGDIC (N6-{2-{[(4S)-4-ammonio-5-oxido-5-oxopentyl]amino}-5-[(2S,3R)]-2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl]-3,5,dihydro-4H-imidazol-4-ylidene}-l-lysinate) are derived from a single ribose or glucose molecule cross-linking lysine and arginine (13.Sell D.R. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21597-21602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Biemel K.M. Friedl D.A. Lederer M.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24907-24915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), whereas methylglyoxal-lysine dimer and glyoxal-lysine dimer are derived from two lysines, methylglyoxal or glyoxal, and a secondary metabolite, possibly acetaldehyde (15.Frye E.B. Degenhardt T.P. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18714-18719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Previous studies employing acid hydrolysis did not reveal a cross-link involving a single MDA molecule under pseudo-physiological conditions in vitro (16.Slatter D.A. Paul R.G. Murray M. Bailey A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19661-19669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we report some success in an attempt to isolate an MDA cross-link using alkaline hydrolysis of MDA reacted with both BSA and collagen. Reagents—All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Aldrich unless otherwise specified. High pressure liquid chromatography grade solvents were all used pre-filtered (0.22 μm) and were obtained from Rathburn Chemicals (Walkerburn, Peebleshire, Scotland, United Kingdom). Excess fat and hair were scraped from the skin of 9-month-old guinea pigs. The skin was then shredded in a Moulinette homogenizer to yield a crude collagen preparation. Fats were extracted by stirring in 1 liter of 2:1 chloroform:methanol overnight, the slurry was centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and the remaining material was washed three times in methanol and freeze-dried prior to reaction with MDA. BSA (fat-free, 96%+) was purchased from Sigma (A-6003). Synthesis of Malondialdehyde—[2-C14]Malondialdehyde was synthesized from 1,3-[2-C14]propanediol using the protocol from Summerfield and Tappel (17.Summerfield F.W. Tappel A.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 82: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Non-radioactive MDA was prepared as described previously by re-crystallization following controlled hydrolysis of 1,1,3,3-tetra-ethoxypropane (3.Slatter D.A. Murray M Bailey A.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Reaction of MDA with Proteins—Reactions were carried out without prior sodium borohydride reduction and in a metal-free environment to minimize cross-link and oxidation artifacts (5.Slatter D.A. Bolton C.H. Bailey A.J. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 18.Requena J.R. Fu M.X. Ahmed M.U. Jenkins A.J. Lyons T.J. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19.Price D.L. Rhett P.M. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48967-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) including the oxidation of MDA itself. Samples were stored frozen prior to subsequent analysis. Fat-free BSA (15 g) or crude collagen (15 g) was reacted with 8 mm MDA in 150 ml of 100 mm Chelex-treated phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (19.Price D.L. Rhett P.M. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48967-48972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 20.Van Reyk D.M. Brown A.J. Jessup W. Dean R.T. Free Radic. Res. 1995; 23: 533-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.05% sodium azide and 1 mm diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid under sterile conditions for 48 h at 37 °C. After 48 h, another 8 mm MDA was added and the reaction continued for an additional 48 h. MDA was removed from the BSA by a 3-day dialysis at 4 °C against 2 × 5 liters of 0.05% sodium azide in water and removed from the collagen by five washes of water containing 0.05% sodium azide. Control incubations of BSA in the absence of MDA for 0 or 4 days were carried out to ascertain whether BSA contains or forms non-standard amino acids under these conditions. At the same time, 1 g of BSA or collagen in 10-ml buffer was reacted using 450 KBq of 14C2 MDA. Sample Identification—Hydrolyzed samples were assigned a three-letter code according to their nature. The first letter denoted whether the sample was from collagen (C) or BSA (B), the second letter denoted whether it was a control (C) or MDA-incubated sample (M), and the last letter denoted whether it was acid (A) or alkaline hydrolyzed (L). Thus, eight samples were generated named CCL, CCA, CML, CMA, BCL, BCA, BML, and BMA (Scheme 1). The additional sample BMLm refers to a larger scale alkaline hydrolysis of the incubation of BSA (15 g) with non-radioactive MDA. Alkaline-hydrolyzed plasma samples from five diabetic patients were labeled Pa, Pb, Pc, Pd, and Pe. Specific fractions from semi-preparative ion exchange column separations were then appended to this to give nomenclature such as Pa 56–57. Acid or Alkaline Hydrolysis—Untreated plasma (4 ml) or protein samples from in vitro work were hydrolyzed at 15 mg/ml in 1 m barium hydroxide at 108 °C for 48 h. The alkali were allowed to cool to just below boiling point and neutralized by the addition of a slight excess of cold 2 m ammonium hydrogen carbonate. The barium carbonate solid was removed by centrifugation, whereas the excess ammonium hydrogen carbonate and secondary ammonium carbonate product were removed by freeze-drying. For comparison, samples from in vitro incubations were also hydrolyzed at 10 mg/ml in 6 m HCl at 110 °C for 18 h and then freeze-dried. Residues were re-dissolved in 0.1 pyridine/formate buffer (pH 2.9) at 20 mg/ml prior to ion exchange chromatography. Semi-preparative Ion Exchange Chromatography—Hydrolysates derived from 100 mg of protein were loaded onto a 600 × 12-mm Duolite 225 carboxymethyl polystyrene resin cation exchange column at 60 °C and employed pyridine/formate buffers to separate components by charge as described previously (21.Light N.D. Bailey A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 360-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When using radioactivity, the column fractions were counted using a LKB Wallac 1219 Rack Beta scintillation counter and radioactive peaks located in relation to standard amino acids as described earlier (16.Slatter D.A. Paul R.G. Murray M. Bailey A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19661-19669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All ∼320 mg of the protein from alkaline hydrolysis of 4-ml human plasma were loaded onto the column in one run. Plasma sample fractions were freeze-dried, and fractions of interest were analyzed directly by NMR, mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. Preparative Ion Exchange Chromatography—Sample BMLm was loaded at 15 ml/min onto a 500 × 50-mm Duolite 225 cation exchange column pre-equilibrated in the same 0.1 m pyridine/formate buffer (pH 2.9) as the semi-preparative system. 1 liter of this buffer followed by 2 liters at pH 3.7 (0.75 m pyridine), 2 liters at pH 5.2 (1 m pyridine), and finally 3 liters at pH 8.0 (2 m pyridine) buffers were used to elute amino acids in a stepped gradient. Fractions of 1 liter were taken, and the pyridine/formate was removed by repeated rotary evaporation. Fractions of interest were dissolved in the pH 2.9 pyridine/formate buffer, and the pH was re-adjusted to 2.9. These fractions were then re-chromatographed using the smaller ion exchange column (600 × 12 cm) for improved resolution of the neutral and basic amino acids while incorporating a small amount of radioactive sample as a tracer. Pyridine/formate was again removed by rotary evaporation, and the sample was re-dissolved in 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid for reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (see below). Analytical Amino Acid Analysis—Aliquots from the initial protein hydrolysis samples and purified products from C18 reverse-phase column chromatography were analyzed on an Alpha Plus automatic amino acid analyzer (Amersham Biosciences) using a standard buffer gradient with a Dionex AI 450 data collection system. C18 Reverse-phase Column Chromatography—Radioactive peaks selected for further investigation were applied to a 250 × 21.5-mm Spherisorb ODS1 C18 semi-preparative column at 10 ml/min using a gradient increasing from 0 to 30% acetonitrile over 60 min. Column effluent was monitored by UV at 214 nm, 10-ml fractions were collected, and radioactive peaks were identified for freeze-drying. NMR and Mass Spectrometer Analysis—The three final fractions C1, C2, and C3 from high pressure liquid chromatography separations of in vitro incubations were prepared in 600 μl of 10% D2O with 20 μm trimethylsilylpropionic acid as an internal NMR standard. Using water suppression by a long presaturation pulse, a series of 128 or 256-scan one-dimensional runs were done on a 500-MHz Jeol NMR spectrophotometer in neutral (pH 7.4, 70 and 20 °C) and acidic conditions (pH 3.7, 20 °C). These were supplemented by two-dimensional total correlation (TOCSY, mixing time 60 ms, pH 7.4, 20 °C) and correlated spectroscopy experiments (COSY, pH 7.4, 20 °C) for spin-system identification. Electrospray mass spectroscopy was carried out on a Micromass instrument using acetonitrile as the carrier solvent. The ion exchange purified plasma sample Pa 56–57 contained the most material eluting at similar position on the ion exchange column to fraction C. It was prepared in 550 μl of 10% D2O with trimethylsilylpropionic acid as stated above. Using a gradient pulse for water suppression, a two-dimensional total correlation experiment was run with an accompanying one-dimensional experiment on a 600-MHz Bruker NME spectrophotometer in slightly acidic (mixing time 60 ms, pH 5.7, 20 °C) conditions. This and several other plasma samples were subsequently analyzed using a ThermoFinnigan LCQ classic ion trap mass spectrometer. The procedures undertaken and results outlined below are summarized in Scheme 1. Semi-preparative Ion Exchange Chromatography—Fig. 1 shows the results of semi-preparative cation exchange analysis of hydrolysates of radioactive products from samples BML and CML. In addition to a major peak of unbound radioactivity (peak A), two products were reproducibly identified: peak B, which was found in both collagen, and BSA, whereas peak C was unique to BSA. Peak B was not pursued further, because it co-eluted with the bulk of the amino acids in the preparative run and no adduct of lysine, arginine, or histidine has been seen to elute so early (concurrent with glycine and alanine) on an ion exchange column. Therefore, further separations focused on peak C, which eluted between tyrosine (fractions 46–47) and lysine (fractions 68–69), in the region where most basic amino acid-derived cross-links have been identified. Controls (not shown) showed that the previously characterized N-pyrimidinylornithine from acid hydrolysis (16.Slatter D.A. Paul R.G. Murray M. Bailey A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19661-19669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) eluted at fractions 48–49 and thus cannot account for any of peaks A–C. Amino Acid Analysis of Hydrolyzed Proteins—Fig. 2a, bottom three traces, shows a comparison between acid (sample BMA) and alkal (sample BML) hydrolyses of BSA reacted with MDA before separations plus an amino acid standard for reference (STD). Sample BML contained a new peak at 69.0 min (Fig. 2a, arrow) slightly earlier than the peak of histidine in the standard, which is destroyed by the alkaline hydrolysis protocol. Histidine is seen in sample BMA as a peak at 69.7 min. Apart from the new peak at 69.0 min, no significant differences between sample BML and the control sample BCL (data not shown) could be seen at this stage of the analysis. Furthermore, no significant differences could be observed between samples CML and CCL by amino acid analysis. Identification of MDA adducts from acid hydrolysis has already been done (16.Slatter D.A. Paul R.G. Murray M. Bailey A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19661-19669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and repeat amino acid analysis of samples BCA, CCA, and CMA showed no unexpected peaks. From peak integration, the new amino acid observed in sample BML at 69.0 min is equivalent to 4.25 residues/BSA molecule, assuming that its ninhydrin equivalent is the same as histidine (cf. 1.08, leucine). BSA contains 17 histidines/molecule. From its elution position, this 69-min peak could be the same as the radioactive peak C in Fig. 1. Peak B in Fig. 1 would probably elute somewhere in the 30–45-min region of these amino acid traces. The remaining amino acid traces in Fig. 2, shown here for easy comparison, are from purified products and will be referred to later. Preparative Ion Exchange Chromatography of Sample BMLm—Fractions from the preparative ion exchange column run were evaluated by amino acid analysis. The first of two fractions eluted by the pH 5.2 buffer contained tyrosine and lysine, respectively (data not shown). Because peak C eluted between tyrosine and lysine on the analytical column (Fig. 1), these two fractions, which between them should contain peak C, were freeze-dried and further separated on the semi-preparative ion exchange column to obtain larger quantities of fraction C. The fractions were spiked with radioactivity from the BML sample. C18 Reverse Phase Column Chromatography—All of the fractions containing peak C from incubations BML and BMLm were loaded onto a 250 × 21.5-mm C18 semi-prep column over two runs. Three peaks of radioactivity were detected in peak C (Fig. 3, trace a), giving peaks C1, C2, and C3. An N-pyrimidinylornithine standard (16.Slatter D.A. Paul R.G. Murray M. Bailey A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19661-19669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) detected by light absorbance gave a single peak in a region distinct from C1, C2, and C3 (Fig. 3, trace b). Peaks C1, C2, and C3 were prepared for analysis by NMR and mass spectrometry. Peak C1—Mass spectroscopy of this sample gave a single ion at 182.05 (M + 1) molecular weight (Fig. 4, left traces). The NMR spectrum (Fig. 5) was almost identical to histidine but with one of the 4H or 2H ring protons missing and a new CH-CH3 spin system as identified by two-dimensional COSY experiments (data not shown). Replacement of the 2H or 4H proton of histidine with a = CH-CH3 group plus the removal of a ring N-H proton gives a molecule, either 2-ethylidene histidine (2EH) or 4-ethylidene histidine (4EH), respectively (Fig. 6), that exactly fits both NMR and mass spectroscopy data. The remaining 2/4H proton was observed to shift in a manner akin to a standard histidine proton when the pH was adjusted to pH 3.7 (data not shown).Fig. 5NMR spectra of fractions C1, C2, and C3 at 25 °C, pH 7.4, in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. Peaks denoting 2/4-ethylidene histidine from fractions C1 (4EH) and C2 (2EH) correspond to the non-prefixed Greek annotations in Fig. 6. Peaks denoting the two stereoisomers of NNL shown in Scheme 2 are seen in fractions C2 and C3 and correspond to Greek annotations prefixed by 2L or 3L. Each stereoisomer of NNL has two observable forms depending on whether the amide bond shown in Scheme 2 is cis or trans, the minor form being annotated with an apostrophe. Between 4.4 and 4.8 ppm, fractions C1 and C2 are shown from NMR runs done at the different temperatures shown to separate the ψ proton from bulk water. An inset of sample C2 from 3.65 to 4.05 ppm demonstrates the fast-exchange averaging of the cis and trans forms (2L and 2L′) of NNL as temperature is increased. Peaks separated by a bigger parts/million shift remained in slow to intermediate exchange. For the aromatic region of the spectrum (7.6–8.3 ppm), Peak Q is probably the ring proton from NNL (Scheme 2) but cannot be confidently assigned. The singlet peak at 3.35 ppm in all of C1-C3 is a small unidentified impurity. All of the NMR peaks from the fractions are shown apart from water, the standard, and the two other pyridine impurity peaks in fraction C3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 6The two isomers of ethylidene histidine (2EH and 4EH). The Greek proton annotations are assigned in Fig. 5. Also shown are two possible precursor structures prior to alkaline hydrolysis (see “Discussion”), which yield the observed adduct with the release of a formate ion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 2EH and 4EH may be artifacts of alkaline hydrolysis of an MDA-histidine adduct rather than being a direct product from the reaction among the MDA degradation product, acetaldehyde, and histidine (Fig. 6). All of these structures are more stable Schiff bases than the lysine adduct β-LAA because of additional resonance stabilization from the double bonds in the histidine ring. Peak C2—This fraction contained three sets of peaks by NMR (Figs. 5 and 7) as identified by integrals of their proton peaks. The major one was the other variant of the histidine adducts described above. The ring proton is further downfield (7.83 ppm, peak rH′ in Fig. 5) than the molecule in peak C1 (7.72ppm), making this likely to be 2EH and leaving the Peak C1 adduct as 4EH, although these ring proton shifts are closer together compared with unmodified histidine (8.12 and 7.14 ppm). Similar to peak C1, the mass spectrum of C2 showed a strong peak at 182.05 (Fig. 4). By NMR, the total yield for the both types of histidine adduct was 2.1% of available histidine before the MDA reaction started, of which 31% is the isomer seen in fraction C2; however, there will inevitably have been significant losses during purification. The original amino acid compositional analysis of BML (Fig. 2) suggests that up to 25% of the histidines could have been modified. The second set of peaks was a very small lysine impurity (∼<3%) seen only when separated out by two-dimensional NMR in Fig. 7. This lysine impurity was not a significant feature on the mass spectrum of C2 (Fig. 4) in comparison with other peaks. Unaccounted by either of these first two peak sets, peak C2 contained also two mass spectroscopy peaks at m/z of 243.91 and 262.10 (Fig. 4). The final set of NMR peaks correlating to these masses in peak C2 was observed in several groups, which can be seen more clearly in the total correlation two-dimensional spectrum of this fraction (Fig. 7). Two sets of correlated shifts with equivalent proton intensities could be identified as Nϵ-adducted lysine side chains. These sets had parts/million shifts of 3.73(α), 1.88(β), 1.49/1.42(γ), 1.77(δ), and 3.14(ϵ) annotated as 2L′α-ϵ (Fig. 5) and 3.72(α), 1.87(β), 1.38/1.32(γ), 1.68/1.64(δ), and 3.44/3.32(ϵ) annotated as 2Lα-ϵ. They also had a complex CH-CH2 spin system (Fig. 5, 2L, 2L′ψ, ω) with fine structure that could only be resolved by repeating the one-dimensional spectra at 70 °C (Fig. 5, inset). The coupled proton shifts of 3.98(H) and 3.83(2H) from this CH-CH2 spin system are a triplet and doublet at 70 °C. For this to occur, there must be two isomeric forms of the molecule in slow exchange (<2 s–1) on the NMR time scale at the lower temperature that go into fast exchange at 70 °C(>10 s–1). In other words, these two sets of peaks denoted 2L and 2L′ are two isomers of the same molecule. Finally, two CH singlets were observed in the aromatic region of the spectrum, the one at 8.15 ppm (Fig. 5, 2Lϕ, 2L′ϕ). Daughter ion spectra were obtained from the mass spectroscopy peaks initially observed at m/z 244 and 262 (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W2041337475,"Connexin36 (Cx36) is specifically expressed in neurons and in pancreatic beta-cells. Cx36 functions as a critical regulator of insulin secretion and content in beta-cells. In order to identify the molecular mechanisms that control the beta-cell expression of Cx36, we initiated the characterization of the human 5' regulatory region of the CX36 gene. A 2043-bp fragment of the human CX36 promoter was identified from a human BAC library and fused to a luciferase reporter gene. This promoter region was sufficient to confer specific expression to the reporter gene in insulin-secreting cell lines. Within this 5' regulatory region, a putative neuron-restrictive silencer element conserved between rodent and human species was recognized and binds the neuron-restrictive silencing factor (NRSF/REST). This factor is not expressed in insulin-secreting cells and neurons; it functions as a potent repressor through the recruitment of histone deacetylase to the promoter of neuronal genes. The NRSF-mediated repression of Cx36 in HeLa cells was abolished by trichostatin A, confirming the functional importance of histone deacetylase activity. Ectopic expression, by viral gene transfer, of NRSF/REST in different insulin-secreting beta-cell lines induced a marked reduction in Cx36 mRNA and protein content. Moreover, mutations in the Cx36 neuron-restrictive silencer element relieved the low transcriptional activity of the human CX36 promoter observed in HeLa cells and in INS-1 cells expressing NRSF/REST. The data showed that cx36 gene expression in insulin-producing beta-cell lines is strictly controlled by the transcriptional repressor NRSF/REST indicating that Cx36 participates to the neuronal phenotype of the pancreatic beta-cells."

Several endocytic components and accessory factors contain independently folded phosphoinositide-binding modules that facilitate, in part, membrane placement at the bud site. As the clathrin-coat assembly process progresses toward deeply invaginated buds, focally synthesized phosphoinositides are dephosphorylated, principally through the action of the phosphoinositide polyphosphatase synaptojanin 1. Failure to catabolize polyphosphoinositides retards the fission process and endocytic activity. The long-splice isoform of synaptojanin 1, termed SJ170, contains a carboxyl-terminal extension that harbors interaction motifs for engaging several components of the endocytic machinery. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to DPF and FXDXF sequences, the SJ170 carboxyl terminus contains a novel AP-2 binding sequence, the WXXF motif. The WXXF sequence engages the independently folded α-subunit appendage that projects off the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor core. The endocytic protein kinases AAK1 and GAK also contain functional WXX(FW) motifs in addition to two DPF repeats, whereas stonin 2 harbors three tandem WXXF repeats. Each of the discrete SJ170 adaptor-interaction motifs bind to appendages relatively weakly but, as tandemly arrayed within the SJ170 extension, can cooperate to bind bivalent AP-2 with good apparent affinity. These interactions likely contribute to the appropriate targeting of certain endocytic components to clathrin bud sites assembling at the cell surface.

PtdIns(4,5)P2-specific probes, such as the phospholipase C-δ1 pleckstrin homology domain fused to the green fluorescent protein, reveal a highly selective distribution of this important regulatory phospholipid over the cell surface (1.Stauffer T.P.

In fact, overexpression of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase β promotes AP-2 association with the plasma membrane, increases the number of clathrin-coated pits, and potentiates transferrin uptake (18.Padron D. Wang Y.J. Yamamoto M. Yin H. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). At the nerve terminal, compensatory endocytosis preserves synaptic architecture in the face of ongoing calcium-dependent exocytotic release of neurotransmitter from synaptic vesicles (19.Shupliakov O.

Synaptic vesicle membrane is re-internalized en masse within clathrin-coated vesicles (20.Maycox P.R. Link E. Reetz A. Morris S.A. Jahn R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and, as clathrin-coated intermediates upon the plasma membrane progress toward deeply invaginated buds, PtdIns(4,5)P2 is focally hydrolyzed. The hydrolysis is partly necessary to promote release of the phosphoinositide binding factors such as AP180 and epsin from the budded vesicle (21.Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T.

Targeted disruption of the synaptojanin 1 gene in mice is lethal shortly after birth (21.Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A.

Brain slices and cultured hippocampal neurons derived from synaptojanin nullizygous animals are slow to recover from high-frequency stimulation, and ultrastructural analysis shows that massed, deeply invaginated clathrin-coated buds and coated vesicles accumulate at the periphery of the presynaptic active zone (21.Cremona O.

It thus appears that in the absence of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, vesicle release is delayed and the pool of synaptic vesicles becomes greatly diminished. A generally analogous phenotype is seen in mutant Caenorhabditis elegans lacking functional expression of the synaptojanin orthologue UNC-26 (25.Harris T.W. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Jorgensen E.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In neither case, however, is there a complete arrest of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (21.Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P.

Indeed, disruption of synaptojanin-like phosphatases in S. cerevisiae leads to the inappropriate appearance of PtdIns(4,5)P2 upon intracellular structures (26.Stefan C.J. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), showing that hydrolysis is not a prerequisite for internalization. Synaptojanin 1 is composed of two tandemly arrayed catalytic phosphatase domains, the SacI and inositol 5′-phosphatase homology domains, followed by a carboxyl-terminal proline-rich domain (23.McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Nature. 1996; 379: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 27.Hughes W.E. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 337-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The central inositol 5′-phosphatase domain dephosphorylates PtdIns(4,5)P2 to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. The proximal SacI homology domain is also a phosphatidylinositol phosphatase (28.Guo S. Stolz L.E. Lemrow S.M. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12990-12995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) that preferentially hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate or phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. Thus, synaptojanin 1 is a phosphoinositide polyphosphatase that can regenerate phosphatidylinositol by sequential dephosphorylation reactions. In humans, the gene for synaptojanin 1 is located on chromosome 21 (29.Cremona O. Nimmakayalu M. Haffner C. Bray-Ward P. Ward D.C. De Camilli P. Cytogenet. Cell. Genet. 2000; 88: 89-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is some evidence for increased expression in Down's syndrome (30.Arai Y. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. Becker L.E. Takashima S.

Lachman H.M. Mol. Psychiatry. 2001; 6: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The relatively abundant 145-kDa synaptojanin 1 isoform (SJ145) is thought to be recruited to the clathrin lattice on the presynaptic plasma membrane in the brain by the interaction of the carboxyl-terminal proline-rich sequences with the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of endocytic proteins like endophilin or amphiphysin (33.Brodin L. Low P. Shupliakov O. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 34.Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the non-neuronal 170-kDa long splice isoform of synaptojanin 1, termed SJ170, harbors a novel AP-2 adaptor-binding element absent from SJ145. This interaction determinant engages the α-subunit appendage and likely promotes efficient targeting of the polyphosphatase to the assembling clathrin lattice in non-neuronal cells. A functionally analogous WXX(FW) sequence is also found in the endocytic protein kinases AAK1 and GAK/auxilin 2, and multiple copies in stonin 2 promote AP-2 association. DNA Constructs—Plasmids encoding the murine AP-2 αC appendage (αC-subunit residues 701-938), the W840A, R905A, and R916A αC appendage point mutants, the rat β2 appendage (residues 714-951), the rat epsin 1 DPW domain (residues 229-407), the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) protein carboxyl-terminal segment (residues 180-308), and the YSKV internalization sequence of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor each fused to the carboxyl-terminal end of glutathione S-transferase (GST) have been described (35.Traub L.M.

The entire alternatively spliced segment of human SJ170 (residues 1305-1575) was amplified using KIAA0910 (Kazusa Institute, Chiba, Japan) as the template and inserted similarly into pGEX-4T-1. The SJ170M1 fusion protein (residues 1478-1489) was prepared by ligation of complementary oligonucleotides, after annealing and digestion, into EcoRI/XhoI cleaved pGEX-4T-1. The AAK1 plasmids GST-AAK1C1 (residues 547-862), GST-AAK1C2 (residues 671-862), and GST-AAK1C3 (residues 741-862) were prepared in pGEX-4T-1 by PCR utilizing KIAA1048 (Kazusa Institute, Chiba, Japan) as the template. A plasmid encoding human GAK/auxilin 2 (residues 945-1311) fused to GST was kindly provided by Ernst Ungewickell (Mediziniche Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany). The GST-stonin 2-(1-426) was generated by PCR using human clone C14981 (Stratagene) as the template and ligated into pGEX-4T-1. All mutations were introduced into the appropriate vectors using the QuikChange system (Stratagene) with the required mutagenic primer pairs (the sequences of which are all available upon request). All the clones and mutations were verified by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Antibodies—Anti-synaptojanin antiserum was generated in rabbits by immunization with a synthetic peptide (ARKDNIGRNQPSPQAG) derived from the carboxyl-terminal region of rat synaptojanin 1 that is common to both SJ145 and SJ170.

Protein and Tissue Extract Preparation—GST and the various GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 cells. The standard induction protocol entails shifting log-phase cultures (A600 ∼ 0.6) from 37 °C to room temperature and then adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 100 μm. After 3-5 h at room temperature with constant shaking, the bacteria were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × gmax at 4 °C for 15 min and stored at -80 °C until used. Bacteria were lysed on ice in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol with sonication or in B-PER reagent (Pierce). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 23,700 × gmax at 4 °C for 15 min and then the GST fusions were collected on GSH-Sepharose. After extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline, GST fusions were eluted with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm GSH, 5 mm dithiothreitol on ice and dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm dithiothreitol before use in binding assays. Several of the purified fusion proteins were cleaved from the GST with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) while still immobilized upon GSH-Sepharose. Digestion was as recommended by the manufacturer, followed by addition of the irreversible thrombin inhibitor d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 25 μm. Cytosol was prepared from frozen rat brain (PelFreez) by sequential differential centrifugation after homogenization in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete (Roche Diagnostics) protease inhibitor mixture. The 105,000 × gmax supernatant is defined as cytosol and was stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. Undifferentiated PC12 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. Lysates were prepared after collecting the cells by trypsinization and washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Pelleted PC12 cells were solubilized in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 on ice for 30 min in the presence of Complete (Roche) protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Following centrifugation at 20,000 × gmax at 4 °C for 15 min, aliquots of the lysate were stored frozen at -80 °C. Before use, thawed samples of either rat brain cytosol or PC12 cell lysates were adjusted to 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, 125 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (assay buffer) by addition of a ×10 stock and then centrifuged at 245,000 × gmax (TLA-100.4 rotor) at 4 °C for 20 min to remove insoluble particulate material. Binding Assays—Pull-down type assays, in 300 μl total volume, were as described (36.Drake M.T. Downs M.A. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6479-6489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 39.Drake M.T. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28700-28709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Typically, 50-400 μg of GST and the GST fusion proteins were first each immobilized upon ∼25 μl of packed GSH-Sepharose by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous mixing. The Sepharose beads containing the required immobilized proteins were then washed and resuspended to 50 μl in assay buffer. Clarified rat brain cytosol, PC12 cell lysates, or purified, thrombin-cleaved αC or β2 appendage (in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml carrier bovine serum albumin) were added and the tubes were incubated at 4 °C for 60 min with continuous gentle mixing. For the competition assays, thrombin-cleaved proteins were added directly into the assay mixture to a final concentration of 20 μm in the presence of 25 μm d-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone, an irreversible thrombin inhibitor. The GSH-Sepharose beads were then recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 × gmax at 4 °C for 1 min and an aliquot of each supernatant was removed and adjusted to 100 μl with SDS sample buffer. After washing the GSH-Sepharose pellets 4 times each with ∼1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation, the supernatants were aspirated and each pellet resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were resolved on polyacrylamide gels prepared with an altered acrylamide:bis-acrylamide (30:0.4) ratio stock solution. The decreased cross-linking generally improves resolution but also affects the relative mobility of several proteins, most noticeably AP180 and epsin 1. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose in ice-cold 15.6 mm Tris, 120 mm glycine. Blots were usually blocked overnight in 5% nonfat milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and then portions were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated in the individual figure legends. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence. Selective Binding of SJ170 to the AP-2 α Appendage—SJ170 is expressed at much lower levels in peripheral tissues than is SJ145 in the central nervous system. Using antibodies against an epitope common to both isoforms, SJ145 is easily detectable in rat brain extracts, whereas the abundance of SJ170 is below the level of detection in extracts of adult brain, liver, lung, testis, or heart (40.Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The SJ170 isoform only becomes detectable after enrichment with an SH3 domain-binding partner like Grb2 or amphiphysin (40.Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consequently, it has been proposed that the alternatively spliced carboxyl-terminal extension in SJ170 facilitates efficient recruitment to endocytic buds forming at the cell surface (41.Haffner C. Paolo G.D. Rosenthal J.A. de Camilli P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 471-474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Indeed, in extracts from undifferentiated PC12 cells, which contain both SJ145 and SJ170, only the SJ170 isoform associates with immobilized GST-αC appendage in pull-down type assays (Fig. 1, lane d). Importantly, SJ170 does not sediment with immobilized GST alone (lane b), whereas the more abundant SJ145 isoform remains in the soluble fraction under both conditions (lanes a and c). Similar pull-down experiments utilizing rat brain cytosol, with a much higher SJ145 concentration, still shows no interaction with the αC appendage (data not shown). The enrichment of SJ170 in the GST-αC appendage pellet fraction is similar to other known endocytic accessory proteins, including amphiphysin, AP180, and epsin (lane d). By contrast, both SJ145 and SJ170 bind to the SH3 domain of Grb2 (lane f), as reported (40.Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, the failure to detect SJ145 in the GST-αC appendage pellet fraction rules out the possibility that SJ170 is being recruited by the SH3 domain of appendage-bound amphiphysin. These results underscore the importance of the unique SJ170 extension in precise intracellular targeting. A Third AP-2 Binding Sequence within the SJ170 Extension—The alternatively spliced segment unique to SJ170 contains two known types of AP-2 interaction motif, two DPF triplets (1323DPF and 1557DPF) and a 1463FXDXF motif. We have shown previously that a carboxyl-terminal portion of SJ170 devoid of both DPF motifs (GST-SJ170C2, Fig. 2) binds to AP-2 with good apparent affinity (37.Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Yet mutation of the FXDXF sequence to AXAXF only reduces AP-2 association marginally (37.Brett T.J. Traub L.M. Fremont D.H. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether an additional AP-2 adaptor-binding element is present within the SJ170C2 (residues 1454-1530), we sequentially truncated the carboxyl end in the context of a GST fusion protein. Constructs containing only residues 1454-1497 (GST-SJ170C5) or 1454-1489 (GST-SJ170C5.5) bind to AP-2 efficiently (Fig. 2). However, further removal of 7 amino acids (GST-SJ170C6, residues 1454-1482) abolishes the stable interaction with the AP-2 adaptor complex near completely. This identifies residues 1482-1489 as a region that contributes to AP-2 adaptor interactions. This localized tract of SJ170 (residues 1482-1489) could either harbor an independent AP-2 binding motif or contribute structurally to the optimal presentation of the proximal FXDXF sequence. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we fused a restricted region of the carboxyl terminus of SJ170 to GST and assessed adaptor engagement in vitro using rat brain cytosol. Importantly, appending only 12 amino acids of the SJ170 sequence, 1478SNPKGWVTFEEE, to GST (GST-SJ170M1) facilitates a substantial AP-2 interaction (Fig. 3A, lane d compared with lane b). The extent of adaptor binding to the GST-SJ170M1 (lane d) is lower than that seen"
https://openalex.org/W2062793212,"Atypical protein kinase C ι/λ (PKCι/λ) is essential for protein transport in the early secretory pathway. The small GTPase Rab2 selectively recruits the kinase to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) where PKCι/λ phosphorylates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). VTCs are composed of small vesicles and tubules and serve as transport intermediates that shuttle cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. These structures are the first site of segregation of the anterograde and retrograde pathways. When Rab2 binds to a VTC subcompartment, the subsequent recruitment of PKCι/λ and soluble components, including COPI (coatomer and ADP-ribosylation factor), results in the release of retrograde-directed vesicles. Because Rab2 stimulates PKCι/λ membrane association in a dose-dependent manner, we investigated whether the two proteins physically interact. Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro assays, we found that Rab2 interacts directly with PKCι/λ and that this interaction occurs through the Rab2 amino terminus (residues 1–19) and the PKCι/λ regulatory domain. A mutant lacking the PKCι/λ binding domain (Rab2N′Δ19) was functionally characterized. In contrast to Rab2, Rab2N′Δ19 failed to recruit PKCι/λ to normal rat kidney microsomes in a quantitative binding assay. To determine whether Rab2 modulates the ability of PKCι/λ to phosphorylate GAPDH, an in vitro kinase assay was supplemented with Rab2 or Rab2N′Δ19. Rab2 inhibited PKCι/λ-dependent GAPDH phosphorylation, whereas no effect was observed when the assay was performed with the aminoterminal truncation mutant. These results suggest that a downstream effector recruited to the VTC stimulates PKCι/λ-mediated GAPDH phosphorylation by alleviating the inhibition imposed by Rab2-PKCι/λ interaction.

The Rab family of small GTPases regulates membrane traffic in the exocytic and endocytic pathways (1Martinez O. Goud B. Biochim. Biophys.

These essential proteins alternate between a GTP- and GDP-bound conformation, which catalyzes a cycle of membrane association and release to the cytosol. Rab proteins bind to specific intracellular compartments and promote recruitment of soluble components that facilitate membrane fission, cytoskeletal interaction, and vesicle tethering/docking (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-119Crossref Scopus (2686) Google Scholar, 3Hammer J.A. Wu X.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4Waters M.G. Pfeffer S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignments indicate that the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of Rab proteins are highly divergent and therefore potential sites for protein-protein interaction with unique effectors that regulate compartment-specific transport events. In that regard, the amino terminus of Rab5 was found to play a critical role in Rab5-dependent early endosome fusion (5Steele-Mortimer O. Clague M.J. Huber L.A. Chavrier P. Gruenberg J. Gorvel J.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Stenmark H. Valencia A. Martinez O. Ullrich O. Goud B. Zerial M.

Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Rab2 is also required for function: Deletion of residues 1–14 attenuated the inhibitory properties of the Rab2 trans dominant mutant (N119I) (8Tisdale E.J. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).

Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29372-29379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Studies were initiated to elucidate the mechanism by which the Rab2 (13-mer) arrests transport and included employing a quantitative binding assay that measures recruitment of transport-related proteins to membranes incubated with the peptide. The Rab2 (13-mer) markedly stimulated recruitment of COPI (coatomer and ADP-ribosylation factor) to normal rat kidney (NRK) cell microsomes in a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent manner (9Tisdale E.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have since identified the participating isoform as PKCι/λ, a member of the atypical subgroup of PKC (11Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This subfamily of kinases plays a critical role in controlling cell growth by interacting with proteins that ultimately link Cdc42-coordinated signaling cascades with cytoskeletal rearrangement and vesicle transport (12Berra E.

Interestingly, the Rab2 (13-mer) not only stimulates COPI membrane association but also promotes membrane binding of PKCι/λ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (10Tisdale E.J. J.

These combined results suggest that the Rab2 amino terminus is necessary for Rab2 activity and that the Rab2 (13-mer) functions as a bona fide Rab2 domain that interacts with one or more components of the trafficking machinery. endoplasmic reticulum vesicular tubular cluster protein kinase C glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase normal rat kidney phosphate-buffered saline guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, β-COP, β-coat protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Tris-buffered saline complementarity-determining region horseradish peroxidase coatomer and ADP-ribosylation factor bovine serum albumin glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay room temperature atypical PKC. endoplasmic reticulum vesicular tubular cluster protein kinase C glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase normal rat kidney phosphate-buffered saline guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, β-COP, β-coat protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Tris-buffered saline complementarity-determining region horseradish peroxidase coatomer and ADP-ribosylation factor bovine serum albumin glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay room temperature atypical PKC. Rab2 is required for membrane transport in the early secretory pathway. This protein immunolocalizes to vesicular tubular clusters (VTCs) that function as transport intermediates between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex (16Chavrier P. Parton R. Hauri H.P. Simons K. Zerial M. Cell. 1990; 62: 317-329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 17Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). These structures are the first site of segregation of the anterograde and retrograde pathways and thereby sort and recycle resident proteins from itinerate proteins destined for secretion (18Aridor M. Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 875-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 19Pelham H.R.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 530-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In our ongoing studies, we found that Rab2 requires PKCι/λ kinase activity to promote retrograde vesicle formation from a VTC subcompartment (11Tisdale E.J. Traffic. 2000; 1: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Tisdale E.J. Wang J. Silver R.B. Artalejo C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38015-38021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The Rab2-generated vesicles lacked anterograde-directed cargo but contained PKCι/λ, COPI, GAPDH, and the recycling protein p53/p58 (10Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2480-2486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 21Tisdale E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that GAPDH is a substrate for PKCι/λ and that GAPDH interacts directly with the PKCι/λ regulatory domain (22Tisdale E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3334-3341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this study, we learned that the PKCι/λ regulatory domain not only binds to GAPDH, but also directly interacts with Rab2 via the Rab2 amino terminus. A Rab2 truncation mutant missing the first 19 residues was unable to bind the kinase. Unlike intact Rab2, Rab2N′Δ19 failed to recruit PKCι/λ and GAPDH to NRK microsomes in a quantitative binding assay. Because PKC-binding proteins are potential regulators of kinase activity, we determined whether Rab2 modulates PKCι/λ enzymatic activity, in vitro. Rab2 caused a dramatic reduction of PKCι/λ-mediated GAPDH phosphorylation. A similar reduction in phosphorylation activity occurred in the presence of the Rab2 (13-mer). However, PKCι/λ-dependent phosphorylation of GAPDH was restored when the in vitro kinase assay was performed in the presence of Rab2N′Δ19. We propose that Rab2 directly interacts with PKCι/λ and inhibits PKCι/λ kinase activity at the VTC. The subsequent recruitment of one or more Rab2 downstream effectors relieves the negative regulation imposed by Rab2 and stimulates PKCι/λ to phosphorylate VTC-associated GAPDH and promote microtubule nucleation. Materials and Methods—Rab2 amino-terminal peptides were synthesized at the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility (Ann Arbor, MI). The cDNA to PKCι was a gift from Dr. Trevor Biden (Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, Australia). The mammalian Matchmaker two-hybrid assay kit was purchased from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Horseradish peroxidase- and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL). Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells (3 × 106) were lysed in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (pH 8.0) and 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice and then clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was precleared with Protein G plus/Protein A-agarose (Novagen, Madison, WI) and subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at RT with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody or with preimmune serum and Protein G plus/Protein A-agarose. The immune complexes were collected by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min, washed 3× with TBS, 1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm NaCl, and then boiled in sample buffer. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked in TBS that contained 5% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20, incubated with an anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody and a monoclonal antibody to PKCι/λ (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), washed, further incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or an anti-mouse antibody and then developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Human Rab2 cDNA was cloned inframe to the EcoRI site of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pM vector and PKCι/λ cDNA cloned in-frame to the EcoRI site of the activation domain in pVP16 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). The two constructs (5 μg each) were co-transfected with the reporter vector pG5CAT (5 μg) that contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene into HeLa cells (106) using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4814) Google Scholar). Control cells were transfected with a combination of vectors as described under “Results.” The cells were collected 72 h post-transfection, lysed in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked in TBS that contained 5% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20, incubated with an anti-CAT polyclonal antibody (Invitrogen), washed, further incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). GST-PKCι/λ Pull-down—The cDNA encoding PKCι was amplified by PCR using a 5′ primer that included a BamHI site and sequence complementary to PKCι (5′-GGATCCATGTCCCACACGGTCGCAGGC) in tandem with a 3′-antisense primer that included an EcoRI site (5′-CCGAATTCGGATCAGACACATTCTTCTGC), and then cloned inframe to the BamH1 and EcoR1 sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). The PKCι/λ regulatory domain was generated by PCR using a 5′-oligonucleotide primer that contained a BamHI site, 5′-GGATCCATGTCCCACACGGTCGCAGGC, in tandem with the 3′-antisense oligonucleotide, 5′-GCGAATTCTCACCAATCAAAATCCTGAAGACCTAG, and then cloned in-frame to the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T. The PKCι/λ catalytic domain was generated by PCR using a 5′ primer that included a BamHI site, 5′-CGGGATCCTTGCTCCGGGTAATAGGAAAGGAAGT, and the 3′-antisense primer that included an EcoRI site, 5′-CCGAATTCGGATCAGACACATTCTTCTGC, and then cloned in-frame to the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pGEX-2T. BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) cells that contained the recombinant plasmids were grown at 37 °C to 0.6 A600 and then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The liquid culture was centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in cold TBS, sonicated, and centrifuged at 12,000 RPM for 20 min, and then the supernatant was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of TBS, and the fusion protein eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione. GST-PKCι/λ, GST-PKCι/λ (regulatory (reg)), GST-PKCι/λ (catalytic (cat)), or GST (5 μg) were preincubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 1 h at room temperature, collected by centrifugation at 4,000 RPM for min, and then washed 3× with TBS and 1% Triton X-100 to remove any unbound protein. The beads were resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm GTPγS, or 10 μm GDP (ICN Biochemicals Inc., Irvine, CA), then 5 μg of purified recombinant Rab2 was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h at RT. The beads were washed 4× with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl, and the bound proteins were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was blocked in TBS that contained 5% BSA and 0.5% Tween 20, and the membrane was probed with an affinity-purified Rab2 polyclonal antibody, washed, incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL. Overlay Binding Assay—Purified recombinant Rab2 (5 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was incubated in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1% BSA, 10 μm GTPγS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL), and 10 μg/ml purified recombinant PKCι/λ for 4 h at RT (22Tisdale E.J.

After incubation, the blot was washed with TBS, and then probed with an anti-PKCι/λ monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), washed, further incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and then developed with ECL. Construction of Rab2 Amino-terminal Deletion Mutants—Amino-terminal deletions of human Rab2 were generated by PCR using 5′-oligonucleotides primers that included an NdeI site and sequence complementary to Rab2 that introduced a start codon at the respective deletion site, Δ8, 5′-GGCATATGTACATCATAATCGGCGACACA; Δ14, 5′-GGCATATGACAGGTGTTGGTAAATCATGC; and Δ19, 5′-GGCATATGTCATGCTTATTGCTACAGTTTACAGAC, in tandem with the antisense primer that encoded for a BamH1 site: 5′-CCGCGGATCCTCAACAGCAGCCCCCAGC. The amplified products were subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites in pET3a (Novagen), and the sequence was verified by DNA analysis. Purification of Recombinant Rab2 Protein and in Vitro Prenylation— Purification of recombinant Rab2 was performed as previously described (21Tisdale E.J. Mol. Biol.

A 1-liter culture was grown to 0.6 A600 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, and then homogenized by 20 passes with a Dounce tissue grinder. Lysozyme (400 μg/ml), DNase I (40 μg/ml), and 25 mm MgCl2 were added to the homogenate, and the mixture was allowed to digest for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a 70-ml column containing Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with Buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1.0 mm EDTA), washed with 2 bed volumes of Buffer A, then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–400 mm) in Buffer A. 3-ml fractions were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with a Rab2 polyclonal antibody. Rab2-enriched fractions were pooled, concentrated, and applied to a 200-ml column containing Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with Buffer A. Fractions containing Rab2 or Rab2N′Δ19 were identified by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, then pooled, and concentrated. Typically, the protein prepared from this procedure was ∼90% pure. For use in the assays, the purified protein was first prenylated in an in vitro reaction. The isoprenylation reaction was performed in a total volume of 500 μl that contained 5.0 μg of recombinant Rab2, 100 μg of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (Sigma), or 30 pmol of [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (10 Ci/mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc., St. Louis, MO), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μl of rat liver cytosol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 unit of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C and then desalted through a 10-ml column of Sephadex G-25 (Amersham Biosciences) to remove incompatible reagents that may inhibit the binding assay. The fraction containing prenylated Rab2 was collected and concentrated, and the protein concentration was determined by Micro BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Routinely, 40–45% of the total Rab2 and Rab2N′Δ19 was prenylated as determined by phase separation in Triton X-114. Triton X-114 partitioning was performed as described previously (8Tisdale E.J.

Briefly, Nunc immunomodules were coated with peptides and purified Rab2 amino-terminal truncated recombinant proteins (1 μg/100 μl of 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6) listed in Table I at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed in TBS, blocked in TBS and 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37 °C, additionally washed in TBS, and then incubated with 5 μg of purified recombinant PKCι/λ for 3 h at 37 °C. After each well was washed 3× with TBS, a monoclonal antibody to PKCι/λ (BD Biosciences) in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm GTPγS was added for 2 h at 37 °C, washed, and further incubated with an anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary reagent for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were again washed with TBS, developed with Sigma FAST p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and then read at 405 nm on a microplate reader.Table IBinding studies to map PKC ι/λ binding domain in Rab2 ELISA was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicate.Peptides and Rab2 truncation proteinsA405Rab2365 ± 23Rab2 N′Δ8261 ± 16Rab2 N′Δ1488 ± 5Rab2 N′Δ190Rab2 (20-211)0(7-mer) AYAYLFK94 ± 7(13-mer) AYAYLFKYIIIGD234 ± 14(Random) AYKAGYIDLYIFI0(19-mer) AYAYLFKYIIIGDTGVGK312 ± 27 Open table in a new tab Measurement of PKCι/λ Kinase Activity—The purification of His-tagged PKCι/λ was as previously described (22Tisdale E.J.

His6-PKCι/λ (2 μg) was incubated in kinase buffer containing 35 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 μm GTPγS, phosphatidylserine (100 μg/ml as sonicated vesicles; Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.), 1 μg of rabbit muscle GAPDH (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) for 20 min at 32 °C. Purified recombinant Rab2, Rab2N′Δ19, or Rab2 (13-mer) were added to the concentration indicated under “Results.” The reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Quantitative Microsomal-binding Assay—NRK cells were washed 3× with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped off the dish with a rubber policeman into 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 mm mannitol, then broken with 15 passes through a 27-gauge syringe. The broken cells were pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed and re-centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resultant pellet containing ER, pre-Golgi, and Golgi membranes was washed with 1 m KCl in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) for 10 min on ice to remove peripherally associated proteins and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.2) and 250 mm mannitol and employed in the binding reaction (9Tisdale E.J.

Membranes (30 μg of total protein) were added to a reaction mixture that contained 27.5 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 2.75 mm MgOAc, 65 mm KOAc, 5 mm EGTA, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 0.2 unit of rabbit muscle creatine kinase. Recombinant Rab2 and Rab2N′Δ19 were added at the concentrations indicated under “Results,” and the reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min. The reactions were supplemented with rat liver cytosol (50 μg) and 2.0 μm GTPγS and then shifted to 37 °C and incubated for 10 min. The binding reaction was terminated by transferring the samples to ice and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to obtain a pellet (P1). The supernatant (20,000 × g) was re-centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min in a micro-ultracentrifuge (Sorval Discovery M120) to recover released vesicles (P2). P1 and P2 were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose in 25 mm Tris (pH 8.3), 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. The blot was blocked in TBS, which contained 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.5% Tween 20, incubated with a monoclonal antibody to PKCι/λ (BD Biosciences), a monoclonal antibody to GAPDH (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to the EAGE peptide of β-COP (9Tisdale E.J.

Rab2 Interacts Directly with PKCι/λ—Because Rab2 recruits PKCι/λ to membranes in a dose-dependent manner, we used a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to determine whether Rab2-PKCι/λ physically associate. First, the detergent lysate from HeLa cells was incubated with preimmune serum or with an affinity-purified anti-Rab2 polyclonal antibody. Western blot analysis of the immune complex showed that Rab2 and PKCι/λ specifically co-immunoprecipitated, whereas no interaction was detected with preimmune serum (Fig. 1A). To further verify Rab2-PKCι/λ interaction in vivo, we employed a mammalian two-hybrid assay. This system allows the detection of transient and weak protein-protein interactions. For this assay, Rab2 cDNA was used as bait and cloned into pM to generate a GAL4 DNA-binding domain-Rab2 fusion protein, whereas PKCι/λ cDNA that serves as prey was cloned into pVP16 to generate a VP16 activation domain-PKC ι/λ fusion protein. HeLa cells were co-transfected with these two constructs and with a reporter plasmid that contains the CAT gene. If the two fusion proteins interact in vivo, transcription of the CAT reporter gene is activated. Three days post-transfection, the cells were lysed in sample buffer, and the lysate was separated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-CAT polyclonal antibody. Fig. 1B shows that cells co-transfected with pM-Rab2 and pVP16-PKCι/λ expressed ∼15-fold higher level of CAT protein compared with controls cells indicating that Rab2 and PKCι/λ interacted in vivo. This potential in vivo interaction was further evaluated in a blot overlay assay that is routinely used to identify PKC-interacting proteins (22Tisdale E.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1999163997,"The hypercholesterolemia characteristic of apolipoprotein (apoE)-deficient mice fed on a regular chow diet is caused by the abnormal accumulation of apoB-48-carrying remnants of chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins in the plasma. Treatment of apoE-deficient mice with ciprofibrate or other peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonists severely aggravates their hypercholesterolemia by interfering with one or more mechanisms of remnant removal from the circulation that do not require mediation by apoE (Fu, T., Kashireddy, P., and Borensztajn, J. (2003) Biochem. J. 373, 941–947). In the present investigation we report that ciprofibrate treatment causes the down-regulation of hepatic scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) protein expression in the livers of apoE-deficient mice. On cessation of the treatment SR-BI expression returns to its pretreatment levels, coinciding with a reversal of the hypercholesterolemia to base-line concentrations. Restoration of SR-BI expression in ciprofibrate-treated apoE-deficient mice by recombinant adenoviral gene transfer abolishes the ciprofibrate-induced over accumulation of apoB-48-carrying remnants in the plasma. We also report that remnants isolated from the plasma of ciprofibrate-treated apoE-deficient mice bind to murine SR-BI expressed in stably transfected cultured cells. These observations suggest that, in addition to its well established role as high density lipoprotein receptor, SR-BI can also function as a remnant receptor responsible for the clearance of remnants from the circulation of apoE-deficient mice.

The normal catabolism of apolipoprotein (apoB-48) 1The abbreviations used are: apoapolipoproteinVLDLvery low density lipoproteinLDLRlow density lipoprotein receptorLRPlow density lipoprotein receptor-related proteinHDLhigh density lipoproteinSR-BIscavenger receptor class B, type IAd.mSR-BImurine SR-BI recombinant adenovirusAd.lacZlacZ recombinant adenovirusLDLlow density lipoprotein.-carrying very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and chylomicrons secreted into the circulation by the liver and intestine, respectively, can be divided into three distinct steps. The first step is the formation of remnant particles by a process that consists of the partial degradation of the lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase present on the endothelial surface of capillaries in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. The second step is the transport of the newly formed remnant particles through the circulation to the liver, and the third and final step is the endocytosis of the remnants by hepatocytes (1Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal animals, the endocytosis of remnants is an efficient process that begins when apoE, which is present on the surface of the lipoproteins, binds with high affinity to the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and/or low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) present on the surface of hepatocytes and is completed with the cellular internalization of the receptor-remnant complex (2Havel R.J. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 141: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The essential role of apoE in the endocytosis of remnants by hepatocytes is clearly evident in mice lacking this apoprotein. In these mice, remnants accumulate in the plasma, giving rise to a marked hypercholesterolemia that precipitates the formation of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta (3Plump A.S. Smith J.D. Hayek T. Aalto-Setala K. Walsh A. Verstuyft J.G. Rubin E.M. Breslow J.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 4Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). It is notable, however, that in apoE-deficient mice fed with a diet that is low in fat and cholesterol, this hypercholesterolemia is maintained within a relatively narrow range (400–600 mg/dl) despite the continuous generation of remnants from the VLDL and chylomicrons that are secreted into the circulation (3Plump A.S.

Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar). Clearly, in the absence of apoE other mechanisms operate in the hepatic uptake of remnants that prevent their excessive accumulation in the plasma, thus retarding, although not preventing, the development of atherosclerotic lesions. apolipoprotein very low density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein high density lipoprotein scavenger receptor class B, type I murine SR-BI recombinant adenovirus lacZ recombinant adenovirus low density lipoprotein. Several mechanisms of hepatic uptake of remnants, which are independent of the mediation by apoE, have been proposed. Both LDLR and LRP have been reported to bind lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, and it has been hypothesized that these two enzymes, when present on the surface of remnant particles, may act as ligands for these receptors and thus mediate the endocytosis of the lipoprotein particles (1Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2173-2192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) has also been hypothesized as being capable of mediating the hepatic uptake of remnants in the absence of apoE (5Crawford S.E. Borensztajn J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 797-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SR-BI binds anionic phospholipids with great affinity (6Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and it is possible that it may bind the anionic phospholipids that are present on the surface of remnant particles. Recently, Mardones et al. (7Mardones P. Pilon A. Bouly M. Duran D. Nishimoto T. Arai H. Kozarsky K.F. Altayo M. Miquel J.F. Luc G. Clavey V. Staels B. Rigotti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7884-7890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) reported that the expression of SR-BI protein in the liver of normal mice is down-regulated when these animals are treated with fibrates. In a recent study from this laboratory we showed that the treatment of apoE-deficient mice with ciprofibrate as well as other peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonists causes an over accumulation of lipoprotein remnants in the circulation (8Fu T. Kashireddy P. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We provided evidence that this over accumulation of remnants in the plasma is not because of their overproduction but is due, instead, to inhibition of their apoE-independent mechanism of clearance from the circulation. In combination, these observations suggested the possibility that the fibrate-induced over accumulation of remnants in the plasma of apoE-deficient mice might have resulted from the down-regulation of hepatic SR-BI expression. In the present report we provide evidence that, as in normal animals, SR-BI expression in the livers of apoE-deficient mice is suppressed by ciprofibrate and that the over accumulation of remnants in the plasma of these animals can be reversed by restoration of hepatic SR-BI by gene transfer. We conclude that, in addition to its well established role in HDL metabolism, SR-BI may function as a remnant receptor in apoE-deficient mice. Animals—Homozygous female apoE-deficient mice on the C57Bl/6J background were obtained from Taconic Farms (Germantown, NY). They were housed (four animals per cage) under 12-h cycles of light and darkness and were fed a normal rodent chow diet (Teklad diet TD 7022, Harlan Teklad, Madison, WI), with or without the addition of 0.05% (w/w) ciprofibrate. At specified times, blood samples (40–100 μl) were obtained from a tail vein and collected in heparinized capillary tubes, always between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. Recombinant Adenovirus Infection—Two groups of apoE-deficient mice (15–20 weeks old) treated with ciprofibrate for 30 days were injected through a tail vein with either 5 × 1010 particles of murine SR-BI recombinant adenovirus (Ad.mSR-BI) or with 1 × 1011 particles of lacZ recombinant adenovirus (Ad.lacZ) as control for the adenoviral infection. Both the Ad.mSR-BI and the Ad.lacZ were constructed as previously reported (9Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting Analysis—For the detection of SR-BI, mouse liver and adrenal postnuclear lysates (30 μg/sample in reducing Laemmli sample buffers) were run on a 10% Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dried milk and then probed overnight either with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) against murine SR-BI (1:1500 dilution in TBST) or a monoclonal antibody (clone AC-15, Sigma) against β-actin (1:5000 dilution in TBST) (used as protein loading control). For the detection of plasma apoB plasma was pooled from five mice, diluted (1:8, v/v) with denaturing sample buffer, heated to 70 °C for 10 min, run on a 3–8% Tris acetate gel using the NuPAGE electrophoresis system (Invitrogen), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a wet electrophoretic transfer system (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed on the nitrocellulose membranes with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Biodesign International, Saco, ME) against mouse apoB-48/apoB-100 (1:300 dilution in TBST) as described previously (8Fu T. Kashireddy P. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Antibody binding to protein was detected with goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1:2000 dilution in TBST) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). When indicated, scanning densitometry analysis of the blots was performed on a Macintosh computer using the National Institutes of Health Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). Preparation and Labeling of Remnants—Lipoprotein remnants were isolated from pooled plasma obtained from 8–10 apoE-deficient mice treated with ciprofibrate. The density of the plasma was adjusted to 1.019 g/ml by the addition of NaCl, layered under an NaCl solution of 1.019 g/ml density, and spun at 80,000 × g for 1 8 h at 15 °CinanL5–75 ultracentrifuge (Beckman) in an SW 55Ti rotor. The floating layer of remnants was harvested and dialyzed against serum-free Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. For the labeling of the remnants, 5 μCi of [1α,2α-3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether (44.0 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences) dissolved in 1 ml of toluene were added to a 12 × 75-mm glass tube, and the solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Dialyzed remnants (7.5 mg/ml cholesterol) were then added (0.3–0.5 ml) to the isotope-containing tube and incubated with gentle shaking for 4–6 h at room temperature. In preliminary experiments we established that after reisolation of the remnants by ultracentrifugation all the radioactive label was associated with the lipoproteins, and none was present in the aqueous phase. Cell Culture and Binding Assays—Professor Monty Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) generously provided the cells used for the remnant-binding assays. ldlA cells (clone 7) are LDL receptordeficient CHO cell mutants that express very little SR-BI protein (10Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). They were maintained in medium A (Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum). ldlA[mSR-BI] cells (10Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) are stably transfected ldlA cells that express murine SR-BI and were maintained as stock cultures in medium A supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml G418 (medium B). For the binding assays, ldlA cells and ldlA[mSR-BI] cells were plated (1 × 105 cells/well) in six-well culture plates in medium A or B, respectively, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. Seventy-two hours later media A and B were removed and replaced with serum-free medium A containing isolated lipoprotein remnants labeled with [1α,2α-3H]cholesteryl oleyl ether. When indicated, affinity purified goat polyclonal antibody raised against SR-BI (catalog no. sc-14607, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the incubating cells. After 4 h of incubation the labeled medium was removed, and the cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then detached from the wells by the addition of 1 ml of trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA) (Invitrogen) and quantitatively transferred to scintillation vials for radioactivity counting. Measurements of plasma cholesterol were carried out by a microplate assay technique using enzymic assay reagent kits (Sigma). Female normal and apoE-deficient mice (15–20 weeks of age) were fed with a low fat, low cholesterol chow diet with or without 0.05% ciprofibrate for 30 days. In agreement with previous observations, ciprofibrate treatment caused a significant increase in the plasma cholesterol levels of the apoE-deficient mice (1282 ± 103 versus 482 ± 85 mg/dl; mean ± S.D., n = 7) but caused no significant changes in the control animals (102 ± 12 versus 98 ± 8 mg/dl; mean ± S.D., n = 7). SR-BI is normally highly expressed in liver as well as in the adrenal gland where it functions in the uptake of HDL cholesterol for storage and synthesis of steroid hormones. Fig. 1 shows the Western blot analysis of SR-BI in the adrenals and livers of control mice and apoE-deficient mice fed with a chow diet with or without ciprofibrate for 30 days. In agreement with the findings by Mardones et al. (7Mardones P. Pilon A. Bouly M. Duran D. Nishimoto T. Arai H. Kozarsky K.F. Altayo M. Miquel J.F. Luc G. Clavey V. Staels B. Rigotti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7884-7890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), ciprofibrate treatment caused a marked decrease in the SR-BI content in the livers of the control mice. A similar down-regulation of SR-BI was also observed in the livers of the apoE-deficient mice. In contrast, ciprofibrate treatment did not affect the SR-BI content in the adrenals of either normal or apoE-deficient mice. Metabolic changes caused by the treatment of rodents with fibrates are reversible on cessation of the treatment (11Staels B. van Tol A. Skretting G. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 727-735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reddy J.K. Chu R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 176-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the enhanced hypercholesterolemia and the decrease in hepatic SR-BI expression observed in apoE-deficient mice treated with ciprofibrate could be reversed by stopping the treatment. Fig. 2a shows that 14 days after removal of ciprofibrate from the chow diet, the plasma cholesterol levels returned to their pretreatment concentrations. This decrease in the hypercholesterolemia was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the SR-BI content of the livers as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 2b). To determine whether the observed increase in SR-BI expression was, in fact, responsible for the decrease in plasma cholesterol levels, we investigated how a transient increase in the SR-BI expression in the livers of ciprofibrate-treated mice by recombinant adenoviral gene transfer would affect their plasma cholesterol levels. Fig. 3 shows the cholesterol levels in the plasma of ciprofibrate-treated apoE-deficient mice injected with Ad.mSR-BI or with the control Ad.lacZ. It is apparent that within 3 days of the gene transfer, the highly elevated plasma cholesterol levels (1300 ± 131) had decreased to levels found in untreated mice (426 ± 167). These levels remained low for approximately 9 days and gradually increased, returning to their original high levels by 18 days. The Western blot analysis of SR-BI in these mice is shown in Fig. 4. It is clear that 3 days after Ad.mSR-BI injection, and coinciding with the precipitous decrease in plasma cholesterol levels (Fig. 3), the expression of SR-BI in the liver was greatly increased. By 18 days after injection, the content of SR-BI was markedly decreased from its 3-day peak levels, again coinciding with the return of plasma cholesterol to its ciprofibrate-induced elevated levels.Fig. 3Plasma cholesterol levels in ciprofibrate-treated apoE-deficient mice after adenovirus injection. Animals maintained on a chow diet containing 0.05% ciprofibrate for 30 days were injected through a tail vein with either 5 × 1010 particles of murine SR-BI recombinant adenovirus (•) or with 1 × 1011 particles of lacZ recombinant adenovirus (○) as control for the adenoviral infection. Plasma cholesterol levels are expressed as mean ± S.D., n = 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Assessment of SR-BI levels in livers of ciprofibratetreated apoE-/- mice after adenovirus injection.

Kashireddy P. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because a major function of SR-BI is its ability to mediate the selective cellular uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol (13Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) we investigated whether the decrease in plasma cholesterol in the mice injected with Ad.mSR-BI (Fig. 3) was due to the removal of remnants from circulation or to a selective uptake of cholesterol from these lipoproteins. Fig. 5 shows the Western blot analysis of apoB in the plasma of apoE-deficient mice treated with ciprofibrate. It is clear that the changes in plasma apoB-48 levels paralleled the changes in plasma cholesterol levels (Fig. 3), suggesting that the remnant particles, rather than only their cholesterol moiety, were cleared from circulation. Fig. 5 also indicates that the decrease in plasma levels of apoB-48 in the mice injected with Ad.mSR-BI was accompanied by an increase in the levels of apoB-100, possibly due to an enhanced synthesis of apoB-100-carrying VLDL by the liver as a result of the increased availability of triacylglycerol fatty acids carried by the remnants into the hepatocytes. The results described above clearly suggested that SR-BI is involved in the removal of chylomicron remnants from the circulation of apoE-deficient mice. To seek more direct evidence for this possibility, we carried out an in vitro experiment in which remnants isolated from ciprofibrate-treated apoE-deficient mice were labeled with [3H]cholesteryl ether and incubated with cells stably transfected with murine SR-BI. The results in Fig. 6 show that, under the experimental conditions used, significantly more radioactivity became associated with the ldlA[mSR-BI] cells (p < 0.05) than with the nontransfected ldlA cells. To determine whether this difference was, in fact, due to the ability of SR-BI to bind the remnant particles, we carried out the incubation of the ldlA[mSR-BI] cells with the 3H-labeled remnants in the presence of anti SR-BI antibody. Fig. 6 shows that in the presence of the antibodies, significantly less radioactivity (p < 0.05) became associated with the cells, a finding consistent with the involvement of SR-BI in the recognition of lipoprotein remnants. SR-BI is a multiligand cell surface receptor capable of binding HDL, LDL, VLDL, and liposomes containing anionic phospholipids (13Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), and as suggested by the present investigation, it can also recognize lipoprotein remnants (Fig. 6). Whereas the primary function of SR-BI appears to be in mediating the selective cellular uptake of HDL cholesterol esters by hepatocytes and steroidogenic cells (13Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the results of the present investigation suggest that in apoE-deficient mice SR-BI can also function in the clearance of apoB-48-carrying lipoprotein remnants from circulation, presumably by acting as a receptor for these lipoproteins. This putative function of SR-BI as a remnant receptor may not, however, be operational in normal animals. In normal animals remnants are readily cleared from the circulation even when their hepatic SR-BI is absent (by targeted gene mutation (14Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar)) or is down-regulated, e.g. when mice are treated with fibrates (8Fu T. Kashireddy P. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The present finding suggests that it is only when the efficient apoE-dependent mechanism of hepatic remnant uptake is absent that SR-BI becomes effective in the process of remnant uptake. If this is the case, however, why do apoE-deficient mice that are not treated with fibrate accumulate remnants in circulation, despite the fact that their hepatic SR-BI is not down-regulated? We hypothesize that, in vivo, SR-BI does not bind remnants until their concentration in the plasma becomes sufficiently high (>500 mg/dl cholesterol) to efficiently compete with other lipoproteins that can also bind to this receptor. Once this high threshold for competition is reached, SR-BI becomes as effective as the LDLR and LRP in the clearance process, as demonstrated by the fact that in apoE-deficient mice consuming a normal diet plasma cholesterol levels remain relatively stable despite the unabated generation of remnants from chylomicrons and VLDL secreted into the circulation. Although the main function of SR-BI appears to be in mediating the selective uptake of HDL cholesterol (13Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the results presented here demonstrate that the transient expression of SR-BI in the livers of ciprofibrate-treated apoE-deficient mice injected with Ad.mSR-BI results in the reduction of plasma remnant cholesterol and apoB-48 (Figs. 3 and 5). The ability of SR-BI to function in reducing plasma concentrations of apoB-carrying plasma lipoproteins has been reported previously. The liver-specific overexpression of SR-BI in normal mice has been shown to cause a significant decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL cholesterol and apoB levels (15Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 16Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The transient overexpression of SR-BI in LDLR-deficient mice, using the same adenoviral gene transfer protocol as in the present study, also caused significant decreases in plasma apoB levels (17Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Glick J.M. Krieger M. Rader D.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 721-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby SR-BI causes the reduction in plasma apoB carried by remnants, as described here, or the apoB carried by VLDL and/or LDL remains to be determined. A possible explanation for our findings is that SR-BI mediates the endocytosis of the entire remnant particle. Evidence is available that SR-BI is an endocytic receptor that can mediate the uptake of HDL, although not its degradation (18Silver D.L. Wang N. Xiao X. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25287-25293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Another possible explanation is that SR-BI mediates the selective uptake of cholesterol from the remnants and that the liver cells then take up the cholesterol-depleted particles through a different mechanism that does not involve the mediation of apoE. It also remains to be determined how remnants are recognized by SR-BI. Phosphatidylserine is a remnant surface component that could presumably serve as ligand for SR-BI. Rigotti et al. (6Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SR-BI binds anionic phospholipids with great affinity, and other investigators (19Fluiter K. van Berkel T.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that liposomes of anionic phospholipids can inhibit the SR-BI-mediated binding of HDL to isolated rat hepatocytes. We have previously demonstrated that apoE-free chylomicron remnants generated by the lipolytic action of hepatic lipase are relatively enriched in phosphatidylserine (5Crawford S.E. Borensztajn J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 797-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These remnants can be readily taken up by the liver by an apoE-independent mechanism (5Crawford S.E. Borensztajn J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 797-805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that in apoE-deficient mice lipoprotein lipase-generated remnants are further lipolyzed by hepatic lipase generating phosphatidylserine-enriched particles that can bind to SR-BI and be endocytosed by hepatocytes. ApoA-I is another remnant surface component that could serve as a ligand for SR-BI. ApoA-I has been suggested to mediate the binding of HDL to SR-BI (13Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). It is of interest that chylomicron and VLDL remnants that accumulate in the plasma of apoE-deficient mice are enriched in apoA-I (4Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1840) Google Scholar) and could thus also mediate the recognition of these lipoproteins by SR-BI. In conclusion, the results of the present investigation suggest that SR-BI, a multiligand receptor known to be capable of binding HDL as well as VLDL, LDL, and anionic phospholipids, may also function as a receptor for apoB-48-carrying lipoprotein remnants when the normal, apoE-mediated process of remnant endocytosis by hepatocytes is defective. Whether SR-BI mediates the endocytosis of the remnants or the selective uptake of their cholesterol moiety remains to be determined. The identity of the remnant surface component that can be recognized by SR-BI also remains to be determined. The present findings underscore the fact that the liver uses multiple mechanisms for clearing remnants from the circulation. In normal mice, the liver takes up remnants through the mediation of the LDLR. When this receptor is absent or defective the process of remnant uptake is taken over by the multiligand receptor LRP. The present results suggest that when remnants lack apoE and are thus unable to be taken up by both LDLR and LRP, the uptake process is taken over by SR-BI. It is of interest that in animals in which LDLR, LRP, and SR-BI are unable to take up remnants, e.g. apoE-deficient mice treated with fibrates, the concentration of remnants in circulation rises severalfold above base-line levels but eventually reaches a stable plateau (8Fu T. Kashireddy P. Borensztajn J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the plateau is maintained because in those animals still another mechanism becomes operational to ensure the removal of remnants from circulation.

https://openalex.org/W1994149833,"Although glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) acts as a potent survival factor for dopaminergic neurons, it is not known whether GDNF can directly alter dopamine synthesis. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis, and its activity is regulated by phosphorylation on three seryl residues: Ser-19, Ser-31, and Ser-40. Using a TH-expressing human neuroblastoma cell line and rat primary mesencephalic neuron cultures, the present study examined whether GDNF alters the phosphorylation of TH and whether these changes are accompanied by increased enzymatic activity. Exposure to GDNF did not alter the TH protein level in either neuroblastoma cells or in primary neurons. However, significant increases in the phosphorylation of Ser-31 and Ser-40 were detected within minutes of GDNF application in both cell types. Enhanced Ser-31 and Ser-40 phosphorylation was associated with increased TH activity but not dopamine synthesis in neuroblastoma cells, possibly because of the absence of l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity in these cells. In contrast, increased phosphorylation of Ser-31 and Ser-40 was found to enhance dopamine synthesis in primary neurons. Pharmacological experiments show that Erk and protein kinase A phosphorylate Ser-31 and Ser-40, respectively, and that their inhibition blocked both TH phosphorylation and activity.

Our results indicate that, in addition to its role as a survival factor for dopaminergic neurons, GDNF can directly increase dopamine synthesis. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter of the mesostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical neural projections, regulates various neurological functions including memory, attention, motivation, reward, and motor control. Alterations in the levels of this neurotransmitter have been linked to pathological conditions such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, psychosis, drug dependence, dementia, and attention deficit. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) 1The abbreviations used are: GDNF, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase; l-DOPA, 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine; RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Pan, pantothenate. is a potent survival factor for dopamine neurons and is necessary for differentiation and maintenance of this phenotype. GDNF administration protects dopaminergic neurons from neurotoxin- and axotomy-induced death. These beneficial effects of GDNF have led to the suggestion that this trophic factor could be used as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (1.Nutt J.G. Burchiel K.J. Comella C.L. Jankovic J. Lang A.E. Laws Jr., E.R. Lozano A.M. Penn R.D. Simpson Jr., R.K. Stacy M. Wooten G.F. Neurology. 2003; 60: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In addition to preventing the death of dopaminergic neurons, several studies have reported that GDNF can enhance dopamine levels and increase the quantal size of small synaptic vesicles in dopaminergic neurons (2.Beck K.D. Irwin I. Valverde J. Brennan T.J. Langston J.W. Hefti F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 665-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 3.Pothos E.N. Davila V. Sulzer D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4106-4118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possible mechanism for the increases in dopamine levels and quantal size is stimulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (EC 1.14.16.2, tyrosine 3-monooxygenase; l-tyrosine tetrahydropteridine:oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating); TH) activity. TH is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of dopamine, and therefore, the activity of this enzyme is likely to be a key determinant of dopamine levels. Although there have been reports of higher TH levels and more TH-positive neurons in physically or chemically lesioned animals treated with GDNF, others (4.Winkler C. Sauer H. Lee C.S. Bjorklund A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7206-7215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Kearns C.M. Cass W.A. Smoot K. Kryscio R. Gash D.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7111-7118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Lu X. Hagg T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 388: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) indicate that GDNF cannot reverse injury-induced decreases in TH levels. These apparently contradictory results are likely to be caused by the following two factors: 1) difficulty in distinguishing the effect of GDNF as a survival factor from its ability to modulate dopamine synthesis in these in vivo studies; and 2) TH protein levels may not directly reflect its activity and dopamine biosynthesis. Although enhanced transcription and translation can increase TH protein levels, the enzymatic activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the protein (7.Lew J.Y. Garcia-Espana A. Lee K.Y. Carr K.D. Goldstein M. Haycock J.W. Meller E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of seryl residues (Ser-19, Ser-31, and Ser-40) has been observed both in vitro and in situ, and protein kinases that phosphorylate each of these sites have been identified in part (8.Fitzpatrick P.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 355-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). These studies report that phosphorylation at Ser-31 and Ser-40 correlates with stimulation of dopamine synthesis (9.Lindgren N. Xu Z.Q. Herrera-Marschitz M. Haycock J. Hokfelt T. Fisone G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 773-780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effect of GDNF on phosphorylation of TH and its enzymatic activity have not been examined. The present study uses a TH-expressing human neuroblastoma cell line and rat primary mesencephalic neuronal cultures in order to examine the effect of GDNF on TH phosphorylation. TH enzymatic activity and dopamine synthesis were measured to examine whether GDNF-mediated alterations in TH phosphorylation are accompanied by changes in enzymatic activity and dopamine synthesis. Materials—A BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Human recombinant GDNF and rat recombinant GDNF were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-synaptophysin polyclonal antibody and Alexa dye-conjugated secondary antibody were purchased from DakoCytomation (Carpinteria, CA) and Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), respectively. Pan-specific anti-TH polyclonal antibody, phospho-specific antibody for rat TH (Ser-31 and Ser-40), and anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Anti-phospho-Erk1/2 polyclonal antibody and LY294002 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Okadaic acid and PD098059 were from Calbiochem. 3,5-[3H]l-Tyrosine and [1-14C]l-tyrosine were obtained from Amersham Biosciences and Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA), respectively. (Rp)-cAMP was from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). U0126, D, l-6-Met-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterine, l-tyrosine, ascorbic acid, and catalase were purchased from Sigma. Culture media and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. BE(2)-C Cell Culture—Cells in culture were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, non-essential amino acids, and an antibiotics/antimycotics mixture (100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B) in Falcon culture flasks (BD Biosciences). It has been reported that high serum concentration induces dopamine phenotype in these cells (10.Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Reis D.J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1981; 1: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After four to six passages in 10% serum, the serum concentration was raised to 20% for an additional two to four passages. Cells were then re-plated either in 35-mm Falcon culture dishes or in 24-well culture plates (BD Biosciences) at a density of 1 × 105/cm2 and treated with 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) plus 20% fetal bovine serum for 6 days. Culture medium and RA were renewed every other day. Exposure to retinoic acid for 6 days resulted in differentiation of cells to a dopamine neuronal phenotype as determined by morphology and immunoreactivity for synaptophysin and TH. Differentiated cells were used for the TH phosphorylation and activity experiments. Serum Deprivation and GDNF Treatment for BE(2)-C Cells—Human recombinant GDNF was reconstituted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 50 μg/ml as recommended by the manufacturer and stored at -80 °C until used. Cells were washed with DMEM/F-12 culture medium two times followed by incubation in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with non-essential amino acids and antibiotics/antimycotics mixture with or without 50 ng/ml GDNF. Control cells received an equivalent amount of BSA. GDNF was maintained throughout the incubation period. Cells were harvested either immediately, 10, 30, or 60 min, or 3 or 6 h following treatment and lysed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 μm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μm okadaic acid. Extracts were snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C until needed. For the inhibition studies using the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 (5 μm) or PD098059 (25 μm) or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm), cells were preincubated in the culture medium containing an inhibitor at the indicated concentration for an hour before serum deprivation. Following the incubation, cells were washed with DMEM/F-12 followed by incubation in serum-deprived culture medium including the inhibitor in the presence or absence of GDNF for 60 min. Cells were lysed, and extracts were prepared as described above. Prior to use, the cell lysate was sonicated, and the amount of protein in each sample was measured by a Bradford assay using BSA as the standard. Primary Mesencephalic Neuronal Culture—Primary neurons were cultured from E15 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos. The ventral mesencephalic tissue was dissected out in an ice-cold DMEM/F-12 culture medium followed by treatment with phosphate buffered-saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 15 min. The treatment was terminated by adding an equal volume of the culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The tissue was resuspended in the culture medium and triturated using a 1-ml pipette tip 10 times followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Suspended cells were removed, and clumped materials at the bottom of the tube were again triturated using a 200-μl pipette tip 10 times and kept on ice for additional 10 min. Suspended cells were collected and combined, followed by centrifugation at 250 × g. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in poly-l-lysine-coated 35-mm culture dish or 24-well plate (Falcon) at a density of 3 × 105 cells/cm2 for 36 h. The cells were treated with 5 μm cytosine 1-β-d-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) for 24 h and switched to the serum-free culture medium containing neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 component, 2 mm GlutaMax-1, and the antibiotics/antimycotics mixture (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in the same medium for an additional 10 days prior to use. Rat GDNF was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 50 ng/ml, and the cells were incubated for 30 min unless otherwise described. Addition of protein kinase A inhibitor (Rp)-cAMP (50 μm) or U0126 (5 or 50 μm) to cultured neurons, cell lysis, and sample preparations were carried out as described above for BE(2)-C cells. Immunohistochemical Staining—For the immunohistochemical staining, cells were washed briefly in PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for an hour at 4 °C. Following fixation, cells were washed in 10 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4 (TBS), and permeabilized with ice-cold methanol for 5 min followed by blocking with 5% normal goat serum for an hour at room temperature. Cells were incubated with Pan-specific anti-TH polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution), anti-synaptophysin polyclonal antibody (1:5000 dilution), or anti-NeuN monoclonal antibody (1:2000 dilution) in TBS at 4 °C. Following overnight incubations, cells were washed three times in TBS and incubated with an Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG as suggested by the vendor. Immunoreactivity was detected using a Leica DMIRB microscope, and images were adjusted for size and labeled using Adobe Photoshop 6.0. Production of Phosphorylation-specific Antibodies and Western Blotting—The following phosphorylated peptides (corresponding to the bovine TH sequence) were synthesized and used for immunizing rabbits: phospho-Ser-31, QAEAIMpSPRF (identical to human TH-1 isoform, where pS is phosphoserine); phospho-Ser-40, GRRQpSLIQDAR (human TH-1 sequence GRRQSLIEDAR). Antibodies were sequentially purified first by using phosphopeptide affinity columns, followed by removal of any residual non-phosphorylation-specific antibodies by using non-phosphopeptide columns. Non-phosphorylated specific antibodies for Ser-31 and Ser-40 were produced by immunizing rabbits with the appropriate peptides and then purified using non-phosphopeptide affinity chromatography followed by adsorption against a phosphopeptide column to remove cross-reacting antibodies. The affinity-purified antibodies were characterized by Western blotting. Samples were resolved in SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P (Millipore, Bedford, MA) membrane by using a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) plus 5% BSA and incubated with a primary antibody (1:1000-2500 dilution for phospho- and non-phospho-TH antibodies, 1:50,000 for Pan-specific TH antibody, or 1:2000 for phospho-Erk1/2 antibody) for 3 h at room temperature. The migration of TH was confirmed using a Pan-specific polyclonal antibody, which recognized both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of TH (Chemicon). In addition, commercially available phosphorylation-specific antibodies for Ser-31 or Ser-40 (Chemicon), which recognize rat TH, were also used to corroborate immunoreactivity in rat neuronal culture. Following incubation with the primary antibody, membranes were washed three times for 20 min each in TBST. Immunoreactivity was assessed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and a CDP-star chemiluminescent substrate (Cell Signaling Technology). The optical density of the immunoreactive bands was measured utilizing ImageQuant band-analysis software (Amersham Biosciences). Prior to reprobing, blots were stripped by two 10-min washes in 50 mm NaOH at room temperature. The membrane was then washed extensively with TBST and reblocked for an hour in 2% BSA prior to immunodetection. TH Activity and Dopamine Synthesis Assays—TH catalyzes the hydroxylation of tyrosine to generate 3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine (l-DOPA) and water using dl-6-Met-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterine as a cofactor. TH activity was measured by quantifying tritiated water production from 3,5-[3H]l-tyrosine (water assay), as described previously by Levine et al. (11.Levine R.A. Pollard H.B. Kuhn D.M. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 143: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. 35 μl of cell lysates was added to an equal volume of assay mixtures to yield a final reaction mixture containing 150 mm Tris malate buffer, pH 6.4, 0.35 μCi of 3,5-[3H]l-tyrosine, 50 μm l-tyrosine, 5 mm ascorbic acid, 3 mm dl-6-Met-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterine, and 1500 units of catalase. After an incubation of 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by cooling the samples on ice, followed by addition of 700 μl of 7.5% activated charcoal in 1 n HCl. The samples were then centrifuged, and the aqueous phase was recovered and mixed with 4 ml of Universol (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA) liquid scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation analyzer. Blank values were obtained from identically prepared samples that did not contain cell lysate. The assays were performed in duplicate. An assay to measure dopamine synthesis, which monitors 14CO2 production following the conversion of [1-14C]-l-tyrosine to dopamine, was performed as described previously by Salvatore et al. (12.Salvatore M.F. Waymire J.C. Haycock J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (CO2 assay). BE(2)-C cells were cultured in 24-well plates. Following treatment, cells in each well were equilibrated in 200 μl of HEPES-buffered, pH 7.4 (15 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm ascorbic acid, 5.6 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.9 mm K2HPO4), for 3 min at 37 °C. Each well was fitted with a section of Tygon tubing to enable collection of 14CO2 generated during the enzymatic reaction. Ten μl of HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.1 μCi of [1-14C]l-tyrosine was added in each well and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid was added to terminate the reaction, and a rubber stopper fitted with a suspended plastic well containing Whatman-3 filter paper saturated with Soluen-350 (Packard, Meriden, CT) was placed into the tubing. After allowing absorption of the generated 14CO2 for 2 h, the filter paper was transferred to 4 ml of Universol liquid scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was counted as described above. Blank values were obtained from identically prepared samples that did not contain cells. The assays were performed in duplicate. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by a repeated measures analysis of variance followed by post-hoc analysis. Data were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed using either the integrated optical densities (Western blot) or scintillation counts (enzyme activity assay). Retinoic Acid (RA) Treatment Induces Neuronal Morphology and Increases the Expression of Synaptophysin and TH in BE(2)-C Human Neuroblastoma Cells—RA exposure has been shown to cause differentiation of BE(2)-C cells (10.Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Spengler B.A. Reis D.J. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1981; 1: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13.Bunone G. Borrello M.G. Picetti R. Bongarzone I. Peverali F.A. de Franciscis V. Della Valle G. Pierotti M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), resulting in dopamine-like neurons. BE(2)-C cells were treated with 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid, and morphological changes were examined using phase-contrast microscopy as well as by immunohistochemical staining for TH and synaptophysin, a synaptic-vesicle protein (Fig. 1a). Cells not exposed to RA possess short neurites and show weak synaptophysin and TH immunoreactivity (Fig. 1a). Differentiation by RA is associated with cessation of proliferation and extensive branching of the neuronal processes. By 6 days post-RA exposure, the expression of synaptophysin and TH are markedly increased (Fig. 1a). We next examined if this increase in TH immunoreactivity is accompanied by enhanced TH activity and dopamine synthesis. TH activity using cell extracts and dopamine synthesis in intact cells were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1b shows that RA treatment significantly increases TH activity as compared with the untreated cells. In contrast, measurement of dopamine synthesis by monitoring 14CO2 production did not show any detectable synthesis in either untreated or RA-treated cells (data not shown). This could be due to the absence of l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity, which catalyzes the conversion of l-DOPA to dopamine in these cells. It has been reported that other neuroblastoma cell lines also lack this enzyme and do not synthesize dopamine (14.Ikeda H. Pastuszko A. Ikegaki N. Kennett R.H. Wilson D.F. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 1487-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35.Waymire J.C. Gilmer-Waymire K. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dopamine inhibits its synthesis by directly binding to TH, and this binding of dopamine is blocked when TH is phosphorylated on Ser-40. Thus a lack of dopamine synthesis in BE(2)-C cells minimizes the involvement of Ser-40 phosphorylation in regulating TH activity. These cells are therefore useful in isolating the contribution of Ser-31 phosphorylation to TH activity. Characterization of TH Antibodies—Phosphorylation- and non-phosphorylation-specific antibodies were generated to examine phosphorylation changes in response to treatments. The specificities of the phospho-specific antibodies were evaluated using bacterially expressed bovine TH and by Western blot analysis. Bacterially expressed proteins are not phosphorylated as bacteria lack protein kinases required to phosphorylate TH (15.Daubner S.C. Lauriano C. Haycock J.W. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12639-12646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1c shows that the Pan-specific TH antibody detects bacterially expressed TH. As anticipated, the phosphorylation-specific antibodies for Ser-40 or Ser-31 did not detect bacterially expressed TH. In contrast, the non-phosphorylation-specific antibodies for Ser-40 and Ser-31 reacted with the TH protein. When BE(2)-C cell extracts were used, both phospho-specific antibodies detected a band slightly larger than the band detected in bovine adrenal gland protein extracts (Fig. 1d). This observation is consistent with the reported size difference between human and bovine TH (16.Grima B. Lamouroux A. Boni C. Julien J.F. Javoy-Agid F. Mallet J. Nature. 1987; 326: 707-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 17.Saadat S. Stehle A.D. Lamouroux A. Mallet J. Thoenen H. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The identity of this band was confirmed by reprobing the membranes with a Pan-specific TH antibody (Fig. 1d, right). Neither the Pan-specific nor the phospho-specific antibodies cross-reacted with extracts from Jurkat T-cells, which do not express TH. Furthermore, preincubation of each of the phospho-specific antibodies with 20-fold molar excess of the phosphopeptide used for immunization blocked the corresponding immunoreactivity (Fig. 1d, 4th lane). The linear range for TH immunoreactivity in Western blots was determined for all antibodies by using increasing amounts of protein samples. The immunoreactivity was found to increase in a linear manner with amounts of total protein ranging from 5 to 62 μg (data not shown). Subsequent experiments were performed using 10-30 μg of total proteins. GDNF Treatment Does Not Alter TH Levels—Although previous studies have shown that GDNF is a survival factor for dopamine neurons (4.Winkler C. Sauer H. Lee C.S. Bjorklund A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7206-7215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Beck K.D. Valverde J. Alexi T. Poulsen K. Moffat B. Vandlen R.A. Rosenthal A. Hefti F. Nature. 1995; 373: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), it is not clear if GDNF alters TH protein levels. GDNF binds to two receptors (GFRα1 and GFRα2) that recruit the Ret tyrosine kinase to the lipid raft (19.Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This results in the phosphorylation of Ret at multiple tyrosine residues that serve as docking sites for intracellular signaling molecules (20.Paratcha G. Ledda F. Baars L. Coulpier M. Besset V. Anders J. Scott R. Ibanez C.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 171-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 21.Saarma M. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 427-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By using mRNA prepared from both undifferentiated and differentiated cells, we tested if these cells express GDNF receptors by PCR. The mRNA for ret and gfrα2, but not for gfrα1, are present in both differentiated and undifferentiated BE(2)-C cells (data not shown). To examine whether exposure to GDNF changes TH protein levels, BE(2)-C cell extracts were prepared at different time points following serum deprivation and GDNF exposure, and were analyzed by Western blotting using the Pan-specific TH antibody. The optical density of the immunoreactive band at each time point was normalized with respect to the zero time point and expressed as fold change. A representative Western blot and the summary data compiled from three independent experiments are shown in Fig. 2a. The figure shows that Pan-TH immunoreactivity does not significantly change as a result of serum deprivation or GDNF treatment at any of the time points examined. GDNF Treatment Increases Ser-31 and Ser-40 Phosphorylation—The protein samples used to examine Pan-TH immunoreactivity in Fig. 2a were analyzed for changes in TH phosphorylation. Fig. 2b shows representative Western blots and summary data indicating that serum deprivation did not alter phospho-Ser-40 immunoreactivity at any of the time points examined. In contrast, GDNF treatment significantly increased the phosphorylation of Ser-40 as early as 30 min compared with both the serum-deprived group (*) and the zero time point samples (+) used as controls. This increase in phospho-Ser-40 immunoreactivity was detected for up to 3 h post-GDNF application (Fig. 2b). Changes in Ser-40 phosphorylation were further examined by re-probing the membranes with Ser-40 non-phosphorylation-specific antibodies. The immunoreactivity of non-phospho-Ser-40 did not change as a result of serum deprivation but was significantly decreased as a result of GDNF treatment for up to 60 min (Fig. 2c). Consistent with the observed increases in immunoreactivity by using the phospho-Ser-40 antibody, the immunoreactivity using the non-phospho-Ser-40 shows a corresponding decrease at the time points examined. Fig. 2d shows that serum deprivation increased phospho-Ser-31 immunoreactivity at the 30- and 60-min time points. GDNF treatment significantly augmented phospho-Ser-31 immunoreactivity with changes detected as early as 10 min post-GDNF application and lasting for up to 3 h. A corresponding decrease in non-phospho-Ser-31 immunoreactivity was detected as a result of GDNF exposure, beginning as early as 10 min post-treatment and returning to control values by 3 h (Fig. 2e). Erk Activity Is Required for Ser-31, but Not Ser-40, Phosphorylation—Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of TH on Ser-31 enhances enzymatic activity by increasing the Vmax of the enzyme. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser-40 increases TH activity by increasing the rate of dissociation of inhibitory catecholamines from the enzyme (12.Salvatore M.F. Waymire J.C. Haycock J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30.McCulloch R.I. Daubner S.C. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7273-7278Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the absence of catecholamines, Ser-40 phosphorylation does not increase TH activity (23.Harada W.J. Haycock J.W. Goldstein M. J. Neurochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 67: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been reported (12.Salvatore M.F. Waymire J.C. Haycock J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22.Haycock J.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2002; 116: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) that Erk can phosphorylate Ser-31. Therefore, we examined if the increases in Ser-31 phosphorylation are because of GDNF-mediated Erk activation. A representative Western blot and the summary data compiled from three independent experiments showing the temporal change in phospho-Erk immunoreactivity are shown in Fig. 3a. The phosphorylation of Erk reaches a maximum within 10 min and returns to control values by 6 h following both serum deprivation and/or GDNF exposure. The temporal profile of Erk activation is consistent with it being the Ser-31 phosphorylating kinase. To examine if Ser-31 and Erk phosphorylation co-vary at different concentrations of GDNF, a dose-response study was carried out. Phospho-Ser-31 and phospho-Erk immunoreacti"

In the cellular context, telomerase must elongate its few intended substrates (authentic chromosome ends) without spurious activity on other potential substrates (chromosome ends created by damage, repair, or recombination). Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the biological substrate specificity of telomerase, with most models focusing on protein-protein interactions between telomerase and telomeric chromatin.

This telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) RT replenishes the terminal sequences of linear chromosome ends that are lost with each round of genome replication (reviewed in Ref. 1McEachern M.J. Krauskopf A. Blackburn E.H. Annu. Rev. Gen. 2000; 34: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity can be reconstituted in vitro with only two enzyme components, the telomerase reverse transcriptase protein (TERT) and telomerase RNA (reviewed in Refs. 2Kelleher C. Teixeira M.T. Forstemann K. Lingner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 572-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar and 3Harrington L. Cancer Lett. 2003; 194: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These two evolutionarily conserved subunits and additional holoenzyme proteins are required for telomerase function in the cell. Telomerase is specialized in comparison with viral RT enzymes in two particularly notable ways. First, both in vitro and in vivo, the telomerase active site copies only a precisely bounded template within the telomerase RNA (4Greider C.W. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 5Yu G. Bradley J.D. Attardi L.D. Blackburn E.H. Nature. 1990; 344: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Secondly, as is evident from in vitro assays, primer substrate specificity is determined by hybridization to the RNA template and also by interaction with other single-stranded DNA binding sites in the telomerase RNP (reviewed in Ref. 6Collins K.

To date, it has been difficult to identify which proteins or protein regions provide non-template DNA interaction sites within a telomerase holoenzyme complex. The existence of these “anchor” and “nascent product” binding sites has been inferred from the preferential elongation of in vitro substrates with specific sequence contents in their non-template hybridizing, 5′ regions (e.g. Refs. 7Collins K. Greider C.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1364-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 8Lee M.S. Blackburn E.H. Mol. Cell.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TERT itself can be cross-linked to site-specific locations in a primer 5′ region, in a manner specific for telomeric sequence and dependent on primer 3′ end alignment with the template (13Hammond P.W. Lively T.N. Cech T.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 296-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). 2D. Cunningham and K. Collins, unpublished data.2D. Cunningham and K. Collins, unpublished data. However, TERT cross-link contacts do not necessarily represent the most functionally critical motifs conferring sequence-specific substrate interaction. In fact, in ciliate, yeast, and human telomerase reconstitution experiments, telomerase enzymes lacking some or all holoenzyme proteins have altered substrate binding and elongation properties when compared with wild-type holoenzyme (10Hardy C.D. Schultz C.S. Collins K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4863-4871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 14Collins K. Gandhi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies strongly suggest that the holoenzyme context influences the substrate interaction properties of telomerase RNP. For human telomerase, DNA interaction with protein-based binding sites is the predominant mechanism governing substrate preference in vitro (12Wallweber G. Gryaznov S. Pongracz K. Pruzan R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the physiological relevance of this interaction for telomere length maintenance has not been established: DNA hybridization with the RNA template or protein-protein interactions could be sufficient to recruit and position telomerase RNP at a chromosome end. Consistent with the idea that protein-protein interactions between telomerase and telomeric chromatin play an important regulatory role, in vitro assays have detected normal telomerase activity in extracts of yeast and human cells that nevertheless exhibit an inhibition of telomerase activity at telomeres (17Cohn M. Blackburn E.H. Science. 1995; 269: 396-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 18Lingner J. Cech T.R. Hughes T.R. Lundblad V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This same discrepancy has been observed upon in vivo reconstitution of some yeast and human TERT sequence variants (20Friedman K.L. Cech T.R.

For human TERT (hTERT), substitution of wild-type sequence with the hexapeptide NAAIRS within an N-terminal ∼65 amino acid region or at the extreme C terminus produces a phenotype termed DAT, for “dissociation of activities of telomerase” in vitro and in vivo (22Armbruster B.N. Banik S.S.R. Guo C. Smith A.C. Counter C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 22: 7775-7786Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Banik S.S.R. Guo C. Smith A.C. Margolis S.S. Richardson D.A. Tirado C.A. Counter C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6234-6246Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These and related studies (24Evans S.K. Lundblad V. Science. 1999; 286: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 25Armbruster B.N. Etheridge K.T. Broccoli D. Counter C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have been interpreted to suggest that DAT regions of hTERT and associated holoenzyme proteins mediate the physical localization of telomerase RNP to telomeres, presumably regulating telomerase activity by regulating enzyme recruitment to telomeric chromatin. Direct protein-DNA interaction could also be envisioned as a key determinant of either telomerase physical association with telomeric chromatin (described as “recruitment”) or in the accurate positioning of telomerase at an extreme chromosome 3′ terminus (termed “end-positioning”). Here we show that hTERT DAT variants reconstitute telomerase RNPs that are inhibited in the elongation of telomeric sequence substrate in vitro. Because these variant telomerases exhibit activity comparable with wild-type enzyme when a more artificial sequence substrate capable of template hybridization is used, we suggest that the compromised interaction of single-strand telomeric repeat DNA with telomerase RNP at non-template DNA binding sites prevents DAT-variant telomerase function in telomere length maintenance. Cell Lines and Extracts—Retroviral infections, selection in hygromycin B, cell growth, and telomere length analysis were performed as described previously (26Wong J.M. Kusdra L. Collins K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were made by freeze-thaw lysis. Cells were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and subjected to 3 cycles of rapid quick-freeze and thaw at 37 °C. Lysate was supplemented to 0.4 m NaCl and clarified by centrifugation in a microfuge at maximum speed for 15 min at 4 °C. Extracts were adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl and then quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunopurification shown in Fig. 4 was performed using monoclonal antibodies prebound to protein G-Sepharose, with final buffer conditions of 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were bound for 1 h at 4 °C and were washed in the same buffer. Telomerase Activity Assays by TRAP—A modified version of the original TRAP assay was performed as described previously (27Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Briefly, extracts were diluted 10-fold into TRAP assay buffer and incubated with primer M2 (AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT) or SM2 (AATCCGTCGAGCAGA). Telomerase was heat-denatured before addition of reverse primer CX3 (CCGCGCCCTAACCCTAACCCTA) and PCR amplification. Products were analyzed by electrophoresis using 10% acrylamide non-denaturing gels. For maximal sensitivity to nonspecific inhibition of PCR, we used an internal control (IC) for the PCR amplification step that is larger than the telomerase products. Telomerase Activity Assays by Direct Primer Extension—Whole cell extracts were diluted 3-fold into an activity assay buffer with final concentrations of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm telomeric repeat primer (G3T2A)3, 0.5 mm TTP and dATP, 5 μm unlabeled dGTP, and 2.5 μm [α-32P]dGTP (800 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Product DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis using 9% acrylamide denaturing gels. DAT Phenotype hTERTs Are Catalytically Active yet Defective in Telomere Length Maintenance in Non-transformed Primary Cells—Studies characterizing the hTERT DAT phenotype by Armbruster et al.

HA5 human embryonic kidney cells are mortal but are transformed by expression of a region of simian virus 40 encoding the large T and small t antigens (28Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E.

To examine whether the DAT phenotype is contingent upon an oncogene-mediated regulation of telomerase access to telomeres (26Wong J.M. Kusdra L. Collins K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), we independently expressed wild-type hTERT or one of three different DAT hTERTs in non-transformed primary cell lines. We tested DAT hTERT variants containing NAAIRS substitution within the N-terminal DAT region, substituting amino acids 92–97 (N-DAT92) or amino acids 122–127 (N-DAT122), or at the extreme C terminus, substituting amino acids 1127–1132 (C-DAT1127). Stable expression of N-terminally green fluorescent protein-tagged wild-type hTERT, the two N-DAT hTERTs and C-DAT hTERT (Fig. 1A) was directed by integration of pBABE retroviral expression vectors into both IMR90 primary lung fibroblasts and GM01787 primary dermal fibroblasts. The resulting lines produced comparable levels of tagged wild-type and variant hTERTs as assessed by immunoblot using green fluorescent protein polyclonal antiserum (data not shown).

Parental cell lines or cell cultures selected for expression of retroviral vector without hTERT lacked telomerase activity detectable by TRAP using whole cell extract (Fig. 1, B and C). The restricted S-phase induction of endogenous TERT involved in telomere capping (29Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben-Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W. Kaneko S. Murakami S. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 241-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) is likely to be unaffected in the cell lines generated in this study, because the recombinant hTERT expression constructs produce a low physiological level of TERT accumulation (26Wong J.M. Kusdra L. Collins K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) instead of the high over-expression level required to out-compete endogenous RNP assembly. Telomeric restriction fragment length in all cell lines was evaluated over the course of post-selection population doublings by in-gel Southern hybridization with a telomeric repeat oligonucleotide. Data for the five GM01787 cell lines are shown in Fig. 1D; identical results were obtained for the five IMR90 cell lines (data not shown). Telomere loss occurred with proliferation in the parental primary cell line (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–3) and was prevented by expression of wild-type hTERT (lanes 4–6), as telomere length and telomere hybridization signal increased dramatically upon wild-type hTERT expression. All N-DAT and C-DAT hTERT cell lines continued to experience telomere loss with proliferation (lanes 7–15). These findings reveal that the DAT phenotype is recapitulated in primary cell lines without a requirement for tumor virus transformation, although telomerase RNPs reconstituted in vivo with DAT hTERT variants exhibit levels of telomerase activity comparable with wild-type telomerase RNP in cell extract, telomere length maintenance with cell proliferation is inhibited. DAT Substitutions Compromise Telomeric Repeat Primer Elongation in Vitro—Telomerase activity assays using mammalian cell extract frequently employ the two-step TRAP assay (30Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L.C. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6458) Google Scholar) instead of the “conventional” direct primer elongation assay (31Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) due to the enhanced sensitivity provided by PCR amplification of the telomerase reaction products. A second difference between TRAP and conventional assays is the nature of the substrate. Although conventional assays typically employ a DNA primer with physiological telomeric sequence (e.g. permutations of T2AG3 repeats with the human enzyme), the TRAP assay uses an artificial, non-telomeric substrate (called M2) so that reaction products can be amplified to great abundance by PCR with distinct forward (non-telomeric) and reverse (telomeric) primers. We speculated that the hTERT DAT phenotype could reflect a compromised TERT-DNA interaction specific for telomeric sequence substrates. In this case, DAT-variant telomerase RNPs might reveal their underlying defect in vitro as well as in vivo, if assayed under appropriate conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assayed cell extracts by TRAP (Fig. 1, B and C) and concurrently by conventional assay with the human telomeric repeat oligonucleotide (G3T2A)3 (Fig. 2, A and B). Extracts from GM01787 (Fig. 2A) and IMR90 (Fig. 2B) cell lines were assayed in duplicate; results were reproduced for both cell lines using extracts of cells harvested at different population doublings before senescence. Conventional assays performed with extracts from wild-type hTERT cell lines produced a ladder of product DNAs representing processive repeat synthesis (lanes 3–4), whereas extracts of the parental cell lines produced an irregular background labeling (lanes 1–2). Strikingly, all of the hTERT DAT variants reconstituted telomerase RNPs that were defective in telomeric repeat primer elongation relative to the wild-type TERT RNP (lanes 5–10). The extent of the defect was highly reproducible for each hTERT DAT variant independently, but substantial differences were observed between DAT variants. The N-DAT122 hTERT telomerase RNP generated less product overall and a reduced average product length than the wild-type telomerase RNP, but its activity remained detectable in extracts of both GM01787 and IMR90 lines in all assays that we conducted. In contrast, the N-DAT92 and C-DAT1127 hTERT variants reconstituted telomerase RNPs with little or no detectable activity in conventional assays, even when the same extracts prepared and assayed in parallel by TRAP yielded activity comparable with wild-type. C-DAT Substitution Increases Primer Kmwith an Entirely Non-telomeric Primer and Reduces Telomerase Association with hnRNP C1/C2—The relatively low telomerase RNP accumulation levels in primary cells limit conventional assay sensitivity. We therefore attempted to determine whether defects evident for DAT hTERT telomerase RNPs in the conventional assay could be studied further using a variation of the TRAP assay. For example, we compared wild-type and DAT hTERT extracts using different concentrations of the M2 forward primer. Based on the potential appearance of reduced repeat addition processivity in conventional assays with N-DAT122 RNP (Fig. 2), we also tried reverse primer combinations developed to more accurately capture the initial telomerase product length profile (32Szatmari I. Aradi J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: E3Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In all of these attempts with M2 as substrate, no defect was observed for DAT hTERT telomerase RNPs in any assay (data not shown). The M2 primer is predominantly non-telomeric, derived from a site of aberrant chromosome healing on human chromosome 16 (33Morin G.B. Nature. 1991; 353: 454-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, three nucleotides at the primer 3′ end can hybridize to the beginning of the RNA template (Fig. 3A). Because the nontelomeric M2 primer 5′ end would make less than optimal interactions with the non-template binding sites of wild-type telomerase RNP, template hybridization may provide the predominant affinity for M2 substrate binding. As a result, any DAT-variant defects due to altered substrate interaction with non-template binding sites could be obscured in activity assays employing M2. A shortened version of M2 has been described differing only by removal of the three 3′ nucleotides (Ref. 15Beattie T.L. Zhou W. Robinson M.O. Harrington L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3329-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar; primer SM2, Fig. 3A). We tested this primer in TRAP assays with titrations of cell extract (data not shown) or with a fixed amount of extract titrating SM2 concentration in the telomerase reaction while maintaining constant SM2 concentration in the subsequent PCR (Fig. 3B). The DAT hTERT telomerase RNPs most severely inhibited in the conventional assay (N-DAT92 and C-DAT1127) were also the least active when assayed by TRAP using the SM2 primer. The reduced activity of N-DAT92 and C-DAT1127 telomerase RNPs in SM2 TRAP assays was consistently observed across different extract preparations from both IMR90 (Fig. 3B) and GM01787 (data not shown), whether extracts were normalized by total protein or by M2 TRAP assays performed in parallel. In contrast, the activity of NDAT122 telomerase RNP was not distinguishable from wild-type enzyme under any SM2 assay conditions examined, suggesting assays with SM2 (Fig. 3) are not as sensitive to the DAT defect as assays with telomeric repeat primer (Fig. 2). This difference could derive from a more productive coordination of template and non-template sites in the wild-type enzyme when engaged with a telomeric sequence substrate compared with a non-telomeric sequence substrate. Previous assays have not resolved distinct phenotypes resulting from DAT substitutions at the C terminus of hTERT versus within the ∼65 amino acid, N-terminal DAT “domain.” In the course of our studies, we identified two biochemical features that distinguish the C-DAT telomerase RNP from the two N-DAT telomerase RNPs examined. First, only the C-DAT telomerase RNP displayed a reduced apparent affinity for entirely non-telomeric sequence primer (SM2). This is evident when comparing activity dependence on SM2 primer concentration (Fig. 3B). For wild-type and N-DAT telomerase RNPs, activity saturated well before the maximal SM2 concentration tested (lanes 1–18). In contrast, activity of the C-DAT telomerase RNP increased with increasing SM2 concentration even to the maximal SM2 concentration tested of ∼0.4 μm (lanes 19–24). Secondly, C-DAT telomerase RNP activity was less efficiently immunoprecipitated using antibody against hnRNP C1/C2 (compare Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 7–9) when normalized by input activity (lanes 1–3) or by immunoprecipitation using antibody against hnRNP A1 (lanes 4–6). For example, note that although activity in the hnRNP A1 immunopurified material becomes barely detectable for both wild-type and C-DAT samples by the third dilution (lane 6), activity in the hnRNP C1/C2 immunopurified material remains detectable for the wild-type sample even to the final dilution (Fig. 4A, lane 9) but is barely detectable in the C-DAT sample by the second dilution (Fig. 4B, lane 8). This finding parallels the previous description of reduced hnRNP C1/C2 association with telomerase holoenzyme reconstituted with hTERT bearing a C-terminal tag (34Ford L.F. Suh J.M. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9084-9091Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Various hnRNP proteins have been demonstrated to associate with the mammalian telomerase holoenzyme and/or to influence mammalian telomere length (reviewed in Ref. 35Ford L.P. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 580-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, reduced association with hnRNP C1/C2 could be directly responsible for the C-DAT telomerase RNP defect in substrate affinity. We conclude that the hTERT N terminus and C terminus appear to have distinct roles in establishing the properties of substrate elongation by the telomerase holoenzyme. Our studies reveal that in vivo reconstitution of N-DAT and C-DAT hTERT variants produces telomerase enzymes that are defective in the elongation of a telomeric sequence primer. For a subset of the DAT variants, defects were also observed in the elongation of a non-telomeric substrate that relies exclusively on protein-based, non-template interactions for initial binding to telomerase RNP. All DAT variant telomerase RNPs failed to maintain telomere length in two non-transformed primary cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that the hTERT amino acids substituted by the hexapeptide NAAIRS in this study have important roles in determining DNA substrate usage by telomerase holoenzyme. In addition, our results suggest that the direct interaction of DNA substrate with protein-based sites in telomerase RNP contributes significantly to telomere elongation. The mechanism by which the N-DAT and C-DAT regions of hTERT influence non-template substrate interactions remains speculative. In one plausible model, the TERT N terminus containing the N-DAT region could directly provide affinity or specificity for interaction with telomeric DNA. Alternatively, instead of forming the binding site itself, the N-DAT region could be important for efficient coordination of substrate 3′ hybridization at the template with substrate 5′ interactions at non-template anchor site(s). The hTERT C terminus could contact the N-terminal domain, contributing functions similar to those described above. Alternately, protein side chains at the TERT C terminus could position a protein that provides anchor site contacts with telomeric DNA, such as hnRNP C1/C2. A recent report describes rescue of hTERT N-DAT128 function by its fusion to the telomere repeat binding factor 2 (TRF2) (25Armbruster B.N. Etheridge K.T. Broccoli D. Counter C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although fusion of this N-DAT hTERT to TRF2 did allow partial recovery of telomere length maintenance, it did not achieve the same rate of cell growth or the full level of telomere length maintenance obtained by fusion of wild-type hTERT to TRF2. In addition, only hTERT amino acid substitutions in the C-terminal portion of the N-DAT region recovered detectable telomere length maintenance activity when fused to TRF2. This is in striking correlation with our in vitro activity assay results: hTERT N-DAT122 but not hTERT N-DAT92 retained detectable activity on a telomeric sequence primer (Fig. 2). We propose that instead of rescuing the physical recruitment of DAT-variant telomerase RNPs to telomeric chromatin, fusion to TRF2 decreased the threshold of sequence-specific telomerase RNP-DNA interaction required for recruitment or for proper end-positioning. Our findings suggest that the DAT phenotype reflects defects in different aspects of enzyme function inherent to the telomerase RNP itself. These defects include an altered interaction with DNA and compromised elongation of authentic telomeric repeat substrates.

The binding of the host nuclear protein, hr1-binding protein (hr1-BP), is crucial for the enhancer activity (Habib, S., Pandey, S., Chatterji, U., Burma, S., Ahmad, R., Jain, A., and Hasnain, S. E.

Enhancers are genetic elements that up-regulate gene expression by enhancing transcription of genes, even when placed several thousand nucleotides away in a position or orientation-independent fashion.

It is even active in non-mammalian systems like Xenopus laevis kidney cells or even in the green alga Acetabularia, and, in some cases, it can confer cell specificity or host-range response to the promoter (3Laimins L.A.

Interspersed, however, are nine homologous region (hr) sequences called hr1, hr1a, hr2, hr2a, hr3, hr4a, hr4b, hr4c, and hr5 (5Ayers M.D. Howard S.C. Kuzio J. Lopez-Ferber M. Possee R.D.

The hrs vary in length from 150 to 800 bp and have a modular structure containing two to eight imperfect, 30-bp palindromes with an EcoRI site at the center of each palindrome. Homologous region 1 (hr1) has been shown to be an enhancer for the immediate early gene ie-N and delayed early gene 39k (7Carson D.D. Summers M.D. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 945-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We earlier reported that hr1 enhances transcription from the polyhedrin promoter in a classic enhancer-like manner (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol.

Patent 5,965,393Google Scholar). hr1-mediated enhancement is position- and orientation-independent and can activate transcription to about 10-fold in a plasmid-based transient expression system and to more than 90-fold when inserted as an additional copy within the viral genome (10Hasnain, S. E., Venkaiah, B., and Habib, S. (October 12, 1999) U. S. Patent 5,965,393Google Scholar). Enhancement mediated by hr1 follows the temporal profile of very late gene expression (20–60 h.p.i.) and was a direct function of the number of modules (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). hr1 is bifunctional, i.e. it is both a transcriptional enhancer and an ori of replication (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and these functions of hr1 are independent of each other. Although the palindrome alone is sufficient for the ori function, the palindrome plus the flanking sequence is essential for the enhancer function. A host cell protein, named hr1-BP (9Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28250-28258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which binds very specifically to the palindrome plus the flanking sequence, is required for the enhancer function. We also showed that hr1 can stimulate expression from other homologous promoters like the AcMNPV late promoter cor (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A.

In this study, we describe the ability of the baculovirus hr1 to function as an enhancer, both when placed in cis as well as trans, but not as an ori sequence in heterologous mammalian cells. These cells also contain protein factors that bind to hr1, but these binding proteins are distinct from hr1-BP present in insect cells. This enhancement of gene expression can be exploited for the development of improved vectors for baculovirus-mediated gene delivery in mammalian cells. Cells and Virus—Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) were grown in TNMFH medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (11Chatterji U. Ahmad R. Venkaiah B. Hasnain S.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All the mammalian cell lines used namely, Vero (African monkey kidney epithelial cell line), COS-1 (African green monkey kidney fibroblast-like, SV40-transformed cell line), HepG2 (human hepatocyte cell line), HeLa (human adenocarcinoma cell line), and PS-1 (porcine kidney cell line) cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose. The C6 strain of wild type AcMNPV was used in infection experiments. Recombinant viruses vAclacluc and vAclacluc-hr1 were constructed (10Hasnain, S. E., Venkaiah, B., and Habib, S. (October 12, 1999) U. S. Patent 5,965,393Google Scholar, 11Chatterji U. Ahmad R. Venkaiah B. Hasnain S.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using pBacPAK8 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) baculovirus transfer vectors as per standard procedures. The recombinant viruses were purified and titrated, and viral infection was carried out at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for each virus. To ascertain that equal amounts of viral DNA from the different recombinants had entered the insect cells, equal amounts of the reaction mixtures were dot-blotted onto a nylon membrane after the luciferase assay, followed by probing with the luc cDNA and densitometric scanning (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid pBVluc was constructed by cloning a 3.695-kb fragment from pCEP-X2-luc (containing the CMV promoter, luciferase reporter, and SV40 polyadenylation signal) into the SalI site within the multiple cloning site of pUC18 to generate a 6.38-kb plasmid. pBVluc was linearized by partially digesting with SalI and was ligated to a 750-bp hr1 fragment, released as SalI fragment from pSHhr1 (9Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28250-28258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), to construct various plasmids with different positions, orientation and number of hr1 (Fig. 1A). pBVluc-hr1-U1 (7.13 kb) and pBVluc-hr1-U2 (7.13 kb) have hr1 cloned upstream to the CMV promoter in the same or opposite orientation, respectively, as present in the viral genome relative to the polyhedrin promoter. pBVluc-hr1-U1-U1 (7.88 kb) and pBV-luc-hr1-D1-D1 have two copies of hr1 in the correct orientation upstream or downstream to the promoter, respectively. pBVluc-hr1-D1 and pBV-luc-hr1-D2 have a single hr1 placed downstream to the CMV-luc construct in the right or wrong orientation, respectively. Transient Transfection Assays—Transfection of reporter plasmids into Sf9 insect cells was carried out using Lipofectin as described previously (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Mammalian cell transfections were performed using the reagent LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). Equal numbers of cells were plated onto 6-well plates. Before transfection, the cells were repeatedly washed with serum-free media to remove all traces of sera. 3 μg of plasmid was diluted in 100 μl of serum-free medium, 6 μl of Plus reagent was added to this, and the DNA-Plus mix was incubated for 15 min. This was then added to another tube containing 4 μl of LipofectAMINE diluted in 100 μl of serum-free medium and incubated together for another 15 min, and the DNA LipofectAMINE complex was added to cells and the volume was made up to 1 ml. After 6 h, 1 ml of 20% fetal bovine serum-containing media was added to the cells followed by infection with either wild type or recombinant viruses or transfected with transfer vector plasmid DNAs. Aliquots of infected and/or transfected cells were harvested at different time points, and luciferase or β-galactosidase enzyme expression levels were monitored as described (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Chatterji U. Ahmad R. Venkaiah B. Hasnain S.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All the experiments, both transfections and viral infections, were repeated in duplicate, at least three times. To completely rule out artifacts caused by unequal amounts of transfected DNA entering the cells, it was ascertained that equal amounts of plasmid DNA from the different constructs had entered the insect cells. For this, equal amounts of the reaction mixture, after the respective reporter enzyme assays, were dot-blotted on a nylon membrane and probed with the luc DNA or lacZ DNA as described, followed by densitometric scanning of the dot blots. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from Sf9 cells or the mammalian cells using a modified method (9Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28250-28258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 12Hasnain S.E. Habib S. Jain A. Burma S. Mukherjee B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 20-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Binding reactions with nuclear extracts from both insect and mammalian cells were carried out by incubating 2 μg of nuclear extract with end-labeled fragments of hr1. The reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, and 1 μg (∼1000-fold excess) of poly(dI-dC) at 4 °C for 15 min. The reaction was loaded on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel and fractionated at 150 V in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris-acetate and 1 mm EDTA). In competition experiments, a 20- or 40-fold molar excess of the unlabeled competitor was added to the reaction prior to the addition of the nuclear extract. For studying the effects of various ions on the DNA-protein binding, the salt containing the ion was added to the reaction buffer at the required concentration. To study the inhibition with minor and major groove-binding drugs, the hr1 probe was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with varying concentrations of distamycin A or methyl green and then analyzed for binding by incubation with the nuclear extract. DpnI Sensitivity Assay—Plasmid DNA (2 μg) was transfected into insect and mammalian cells, followed by infection with wild type AcMNPV virus after 24 h or no infection at all as mentioned in the respective figure legends. The total cell DNA was isolated at different time points post transfection or infection as described (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 25 μl of water. To assay for replication, 5 μl of DNA was digested with HindIII to linearize the plasmid and with both HindIII and DpnI to score for DpnI sensitivity (9Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28250-28258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The digested DNA was Southern-transferred and hybridized to32P-labeled pUC18 probe. hr1 Enhances Transcription from the CMV Promoter in a Position- and Orientation-independent Manner in Mammalian Cells—hr1 is a classic enhancer of transcription from the AcMNPV promoters in Sf9 insect cells. To check if hr1 can enhance CMV promoter-driven expression in mammalian cells, transient transfections were performed. The luciferase expression from Vero cells, transiently transfected with reporter plasmids (Fig. 1A) carrying hr1 sequence, was compared with cells transfected with pBVluc lacking the hr1 sequence. The presence of hr1 upstream and in the same orientation relative to the CMV promoter as in the viral genome (pBVluc-hr1-U1), or upstream but in opposite orientation or downstream in either orientation results in ∼3-fold increase in luciferase expression over the control plasmid pBVluc (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, constructs carrying two copies of the hr1 sequence in an upstream or downstream position did not generate any additional effect. Transient transfection experiments with the same constructs were performed in other mammalian cells. About similar enhancement of hr-1-mediated luciferase expression was observed in HepG2 cells and PS-1 cells irrespective of the position and orientation of hr1 relative to the CMV promoter (results not shown). When the same CMV promoter-containing plasmids were transfected into Sf9 cells, a 2.6-fold enhancement is observed (data not shown). These results suggest that hr1 can function as an enhancer of CMV promoter in both mammalian cells and Sf9 cells in a classic enhancer-like fashion. hr1 Can Enhance Expression from Other Promoters and Reporters in Mammalian Cells—To check if hr1-mediated transcriptional enhancement works with other promoters and reporters, the plasmid pBVlacluc-hr1 was used. This plasmid contains the hsp70 promoter-driven β-galactosidase, and the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter-driven luciferase along with a copy of the hr1 sequence element. The expression of the lacZ reporter from cells transfected with this plasmid was compared with a plasmid pUlacluc that did not carry the hr1 sequence. In Vero cells, about 3-fold increase in β-galactosidase expression in the hr1-containing plasmid over the control plasmid is observed (Fig. 2). The enhancement effected by hr1 is more or less similar irrespective of the constructs used (data not shown). COS-1 cells and HepG2 cells also show hr1-mediated increase in transcription, although to a slightly reduced level compared with Vero cells (data not shown). hr1 can, therefore, enhance expression of β-galactosidase from hsp70 promoter in different heterologous host cells. hr1 Can Also Function When Present in trans in Mammalian Cells—Enhancers are basically cis-acting DNA elements. In the recent years, there have been various reports of enhancers capable of working also in trans (13Dunaway M. Droge P. Nature. 1989; 341: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Chen J.-L. Huisinga K.L. Viering M.M. Ou S.A. Wu C.-T. Geyer P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Experiments were accordingly designed to check if hr1, unlike in insect cells, can also function in trans in mammalian cells. pBVluc (a vector lacking hr1 sequence but with the CMV promoter driving luciferase reporter gene transcription) was co-transfected into Vero cells with different amounts of pSHhr1 (a plasmid containing only the hr1 element cloned in pUC18). pUC18 in appropriate concentration was added to the transfection mix to ensure identical amount of total transfected DNA. When Vero cells were transfected with the same amount of pBVluc and increasing amounts (4, 8, and 16 μg) of pSHhr1, an increase in luciferase expression is observed as a direct function of pSHhr1 concentration (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that hr1 sequence can act as an enhancer when present in trans. Furthermore, this enhancement is a direct function of the concentration of the enhancer-carrying plasmid, pSHhr1, in transiently transfected cells. hr1-BP-like Factors in the Mammalian Nuclear Extract Interact Specifically with hr1—The complete hr1 is a 750-bp fragment containing five imperfect palindromes (shown as double-outward arrows in Fig. 4A) with EcoRI site at the center of each palindrome. A complete enhancer module carries an EcoRI palindrome and flanking sequences. Using suitable restriction enzyme sites hr1 was digested into smaller fragments to generate constructs with varying number of palindromes and flanking sequences (Fig. 4A). The 170-bp single-enhancer module was used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to detect for the presence of hr1-binding proteins in mammalian cells. A distinct retardation in the migration of the labeled 170-bp fragment can be seen when the fragment is incubated with mammalian Vero cell nuclear extract (Fig. 4B). The binding of one or more of the Vero cell nuclear factors to hr1 is specific, and this is evident from the observation that the complex can be competed with cold 170-bp hr1 but not with heterologous competitor like pUC18, even when present in high molar excesses. 20- and 40-fold molar excess of cold 170-bp hr1 competitor abolishes the binding (lanes 3 and 4), whereas similar molar excesses of pUC18 (a heterologous competitor) has no effect (lane 5 and 6), demonstrating the specificity of the binding. 90-, 330-, and 420-bp fragments could also bind with high specificity to the mammalian hr1-binding protein (mhr1-BP) present within the mammalian cell nuclear extract (data not shown). These results demonstrate that factors present in mammalian cells interact with high specificity with the hr1 element. Effect of DNA Binding Drugs on the Enhancer-Nuclear Factor Interaction—Actinomycin D is a drug that binds to the minor groove of the DNA, whereas methyl green binds to the major groove. The 170-bp hr1 probe was incubated alone (Fig. 5, lane 1), or with 0.5 mm actinomycin D (lane 2), or 0.5 mm methyl green (lane 8), or with the addition of Vero cell nuclear extract along with different concentrations of actinomycin D (lanes 4–7) or methyl green (lanes 10–13). Complex formation was analyzed by gel retardation assay. It could be seen that increasing concentrations of actinomycin D or methyl green causes a reduction of the DNA-protein complex (Fig. 5, shown by an arrow), although this effect was more evident at higher concentrations of the drugs. As both the major and minor groove-binding drugs at higher concentrations inhibit the hr1-host factor interaction, it appears likely that the interaction of mhr1-BP with the hr1 DNA overlaps both the grooves. Divalent Cations Destabilize the Binding of hr1 to hr1-BP, Whereas Monovalent Cations Stabilize the Binding—In an EMSA where the Vero cell nuclear extract and the 170-bp hr1 probe is incubated with increasing concentration (5–125 mm) of MgCl2, a gradual decrease in the binding is apparent (Fig. 6 shown by an arrow). At concentrations higher than 50 mm a total loss of binding is seen (Fig. 6). Incubation with monovalent cation KCl generates an opposite pattern. At lower than 125 mm concentration of KCl, binding is very weak, however, at a concentration of 1000 mm, a very tight binding is observed (data not shown). These results demonstrate that, although divalent cations destabilize the hr1-mhr1-BP interactions, monovalent cations stabilize the same. The One or More Nuclear Factors That Bind to hr1 in Sf9 and Mammalian Cells Are Not the Same—The AcMNPV hr1 binds to the Sf9 insect cell host protein, hr1-BP, and this binding is crucial for the enhancer function. Having shown that mammalian cells, even though they are not natural hosts to AcMNPV infection, do contain one or more factors that binds to hr1 we investigated whether these factor(s) is(are) similar to those present in Sf9 insect cells. In an EMSA, the 170-bp probe was incubated with 2 μg of Sf9 nuclear extract and 2 μg of Vero nuclear extract. The DNA-protein complex in the two cases has different mobilities (Fig. 7, compare lane 1 with lane 2). When 2 μg of the Vero and Sf9 extracts are incubated together, independent complexes corresponding to complexes generated by the individual extracts are seen (Fig. 7, lane 3). Moreover, when binding reactions were carried out under limiting concentrations of probe and 2 μg each of Sf9 and Vero extracts, the results were similar. This implies that the hr1-binding proteins in the two nuclear extracts are of different molecular sizes and perhaps involve different protein-protein interactions, whereas complexing with hr1 and/or bind to different regions within the hr1, hence they do not compete out each other. These results suggest that, although the mammalian cells indeed contain one or more factors that bind to hr1, these factors are different from the Sf9 hr1-BP in terms of their molecular sizes and possible cognate sequence motifs and/or protein partners involved in such an interaction. hr1 Cannot Function as a Replication Origin in Mammalian Cells—In Sf9 cells, hr1 also functions as an origin of replication. The ori and enhancer activities are independent of each other and are detected using different transfection regimes (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ori activity is scored by a standard method, which is based on the sensitivity of the isolated plasmid to DpnI restriction digestion, which recognizes the target site to be methylated with Dam methylase (15Guarino L.A. Gonzalez M.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 224-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli, which is Dam+ will methylate adenine residue within the GATC recognition site for DpnI, and consequently all its DNA will be digested by the enzyme. However, plasmid DNA that is replicated in mammalian cells (Dam-) will not be methylated at GATC sequence and will therefore be resistant to DpnI digestion. Thus, DpnI can differentiate input plasmid DNA from that which has indeed replicated in the eukaryotic cell. DNA was isolated from mammalian cells transfected with pUC18 and pSHhr1, followed by AcMNPV viral infection after a 24-h gap to ensure the presence of viral factors required for ori function. A control where cells were transfected with pSHhr1 but not infected with virus was also included to check if the hr1 ori activity can occur even in the absence of viral infection. Total DNA was isolated after different time points (6, 12, 24, and 36 h) post-infection or post-transfection (in case of uninfected cells) and assayed for DpnI digestibility. In the control Sf9 cells, a high molecular weight DpnI-resistant form is seen in cells transfected with pSHhr1 followed by viral infection (Fig. 8A, lanes 6, 12, 18, and 24), whereas cells transfected with pSHhr1 but not followed by viral infection do not show any resistant form but were easily digested with DpnI (Fig. 8A, lanes 4, 10, 16, and 22) pointing to their unreplicated status. Cells transfected with pUC18 followed by viral infection are also sensitive to DpnI (Fig. 8A, lanes 2, 8, 14, and 20) reflecting their unreplicated status. In contrast, a DpnI-resistant band is not detected at any point in mammalian HepG2 cells, even in cells transfected with pSHhr1 followed by viral infection (Fig. 8B, lanes 6, 12, 18, and 24). Thus, although in the control Sf9 insect cells, the hr1-containing plasmid can support replication in the presence of viral infection hr1 fails to function as an origin of replication in mammalian cells. A Recombinant Virus Containing Two Promoters Can Infect Mammalian Cells, However, Only the hsp70 Promoter Is Functional Not the Polyhedrin Promoter—Baculoviruses do not replicate in mammalian cells but can enter the cells through a passive endosomal pathway. A recombinant virus containing two promoters and two reporters, luciferase under the control of the baculoviral polh promoter and β-galactosidase under the hsp70 promoter, was used to infect different mammalian cells and control Sf9 cells. After different time points post infection luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed. In the control Sf9 cells (Fig. 9A), luciferase activity follows the typical time profile of polh promoter. Luciferase is detectable at 12 h.p.i., increases steadily from 24 to 36 h.p.i., and is very high at 48 h.p.i. In mammalian cells, there is no luciferase activity (data not shown), which is expected given the fact that polh promoter requires baculovirus encoded factors. The β-galactosidase activity follows a completely different profile. In Sf9 cells this activity, detectable as early as 6 h.p.i., increases only marginally from 12 h.p.i. up to 48 h.p.i. (Fig. 9B, filled bars). The β-galactosidase activity in mammalian cells is very much lower than in insect cells. In COS-1 cells (Fig. 9B, white bars) and HepG2 cells (Fig. 9B, shaded bars), the β-galactosidase activity is detectable at 6 h.p.i., increasing only marginally from 6 to 48 h.p.i. It is interesting to highlight that the observed overwhelming quantitative differences between Sf9 insect cells vis-à-vis mammalian cells is a combined reflection of the replication of baculovirus in the insect cells as well as increased efficiency of the hsp70 promoter. The Drosophila hsp70 promoter is expectedly more active in a homologous insect cell environment than in a mammalian cell. Introduction of an Additional hr1 in the Recombinant Virus Increases the Expression from the hsp70 Promoter in Mammalian Cells—Having shown that the hr1 sequence element can enhance transcription from hsp70 promoter in transient transfections in mammalian cells, we checked for hr1-mediated enhancement when it is present as an additional copy in the virus. A recombinant virus (vAclacluc-hr1) was constructed by introducing an additional copy of the hr1 enhancer stably integrated into the vAclacluc (10Hasnain, S. E., Venkaiah, B., and Habib, S. (October 12, 1999) U. S. Patent 5,965,393Google Scholar, 11Chatterji U. Ahmad R. Venkaiah B. Hasnain S.E. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). More than 2-fold enhancement of expression of β-galactosidase in mammalian cells from hsp70 promoter was seen when vAclacluc-hr1 was used as compared with vAclacluc (Fig. 10). It is important to note that, unlike Sf9 insect cells, mammalian cells do not support baculovirus replication and even then hr1 could enhance expression of a reporter gene driven by a relatively inefficient heterologous insect promoter. The baculovirus AcMNPV hr1, the enhancer under study, is bifunctional, in that it can function both as an enhancer of transcription and an origin of replication. Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells (Sf9) are the natural hosts for AcMNPV, which follows a temporal profile of gene expression and has been used to express heterologous genes. hr1 can act to enhance the expression of genes during all the different phases of infection; the immediate early gene ie-N (or ie-2), the delayed early 39k gene (7Carson D.D. Summers M.D. Guarino L.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 945-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Guarino L.A. Gonzalez M.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 224-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Guarino L.A. Summers M.D. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 215-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the late gene cor and very late polh (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A number of reasons such as the dual role of hr1, its ability to enhance transcription from a wide range of promoters within the host system by recruiting a host factor hr1-BP (9Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28250-28258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the utility of baculovirus-mediated gene transfer into mammalian cells, etc., tempted us to analyze the role of hr1 in mammalian cells and the identification of host factors that could interact with hr1. A search for sequence motifs that interact with known enhancer binding proteins and transcription factors in other viral and animal systems revealed that indeed quite a few of these motifs were present in hr1. The most interesting were the motifs with high homology to the consensus enhancer element motif recognized by the C/EBP family of transcription factors in the long terminal repeat enhancer of the avian leukemia virus (17Bowers W.J. Ruddell A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This motif was repeated (with 1- or 2-bp changes) 3′ to each palindrome in hr1. This motif is incidentally within the region in the flanking sequences, which exhibit high levels of homology. We have demonstrated that hr1 behaves as a classic enhancer of transcription from the CMV promoter in mammalian cells such as kidney cells (Vero and COS-1), liver cells (HepG2), HeLa and porcine cells (PS-1). Enhancement was also seen when the Drosophila hsp70 promoter is used. Furthermore, hr1-mediated action was independent of the reporter gene used. The maximum enhancement was observed in Vero cells, where a consistent 3-fold enhancement was observed in hr1-containing plasmids over control non-hr1 plasmids. In Sf9 cells, the binding of host factor hr1-BP to hr1 is critical for its enhancer function. Identification of specific nuclear factors present in mammalian cells (mhr1-BP) that bind with high affinity and specificity to different regions of hr1 was consistent with the ability of hr1 to function in non-insect host environment. mhr1-BP and hr1-BP are distinct from each other in terms of their molecular sizes, their ion requirements for binding, and the manner in which they approach the DNA. Enhancers are usually cis-acting DNA sequences that upregulate gene expression, the exact mechanism of which is not clear though several models have been put forward. We have demonstrated for the first time that hr1 is capable of enhancing transcription even in trans, i.e. when it is present on another plasmid during co-transfections. There are reports that an enhancer can have effect on another DNA molecule when present in trans (13Dunaway M. Droge P. Nature. 1989; 341: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Chen J.-L. Huisinga K.L. Viering M.M. Ou S.A. Wu C.-T. Geyer P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The long range action of enhancers include their ability to stimulate transcription across homologues. In Drosophila, these effects are called transvection. In certain combinations the cuticle pigmentation gene, called yellow, display intra-allelic complementation, as a result of the action of tissue-specific yellow enhancers present on one chromosome stimulating transcription from the yellow promoter located on the paired homologue (18Morris J.R. Chen J.L. Geyer P.K. Wu C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10740-10745Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although hr1 can exert its influence when present both in “cis” and “trans” in mammalian cells, it can act only in “cis” in insect cells. This could be due to the difference in the properties of the enhancer binding proteins in the two cases (Sf9 hr1-BP and mhr1-BP). mhr1-BP by virtue of its protein-protein interactions may be able to bring about enhancement of transcription from promoters present on another plasmid molecule. hr1-BP has little or no role in the ori function of hr1 (8Habib S. Pandey S. Chatterji U. Burma S. Ahmad R. Jain A. Hasnain S.E. ).DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 9Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28250-28258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), therefore the presence of hr1-BP like factors in mammalian cells should not be of any consequence as far as the ori function is concerned. This was indeed the case as was evident from the inability of the hr1 to support replication in mammalian cells. This also explains why baculoviruses can though enter and transiently express foreign genes in mammalian cells, they cannot replicate in these cells. One could speculate that replication is a more host-specific phenomenon than transcription involving hr and non-hr origins of replication (19Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5182-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Several recent reports have demonstrated that primary human hepatocytes, cell lines of hepatic origin, and other tumor cell lines were able to efficiently take up and transiently express foreign genes under the control of constitutive mammalian promoters using baculoviruses as delivery vehicles (20Hofmann C.

A. 1996; 93: 2348-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) was observed in human and rabbit hepatocytes in vitro, whereas mouse hepatocytes and some other epithelial cell types are targeted at lower rates. The efficiency of baculovirusmediated entry of foreign genes via an endosomal pathway considerably exceeds that by lipid transfection (20Hofmann C. Sandig V. Jennings G. Rudolph M. Schlag P. Strauss M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10099-10103Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Another report shows that baculovirus promoters in mammalian cells can be activated by adenovirus functions (25Knebel D. Doerfler W. Virus Res. 1987; 4: 317-326Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Baculoviruses, therefore, offer an interesting alternative for a safe, self-limiting gene delivery system for gene therapy (24Ghosh S. Parvez M.K. Banerjee K. Sarin S.K. Hasnain S.E. Mol. Ther. 2002; 6: 5-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 26Kost T.A. Condreay J.P.

These viruses provide an added advantage by their ability to package inserts greater than 10 kb. The dual promoter reporter recombinant virus used here provides an ideal tool to study baculovirus-mediated gene delivery into mammalian cells. The baculovirus polyhedrin gene promoter requires insect cell host factors (27Burma S. Mukherjee B. Jain A. Habib S. Hasnain S.E. J. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 81: 998-1010Google Scholar) for its activation and therefore cannot function in a non-insect environment. The transcription ability of the constitutive hsp70 promoter, however, is relatively uniform in different cell lines, except that HepG2 cells show higher levels of reporter activity, consistent with earlier reports that these cells are able to take up baculoviruses more efficiently than other cell lines. The presence of an additional copy of hr1 increases the β-galactosidase expression thereby providing a system for improving the expression of genes delivered via baculovirus in mammalian cells. hr1 therefore can play a major role in enhancing expression of foreign gene in these cells. Baculoviruses have long been used as biopesticides, owing to their small host range. It is possible now to manipulate the virus so as to increase its host range. Although the ability of the hr1 enhancer (10Hasnain, S. E., Venkaiah, B., and Habib, S. (October 12, 1999) U. S. Patent 5,965,393Google Scholar, 34Lo H.R. Chou C.C. Wu T.Y. Yuen J.P. Chao Y.C. J.

Virology. 2003; 310: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the fact that hr1 can positively regulate non-baculoviral promoters both in transient transfections and viral infections without affecting replication makes it an ideal candidate for value addition in baculovirus-mediated gene delivery in mammalian cells (22Condreay J.P.

The two major physiological regulators of aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal zona glomerulosa are angiotensin II (Ang II) 1The abbreviations used are: Ang IIangiotensin IIAT1angiotensin II receptor subtype 1(Bu)2cAMPN6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate[Ca2+]iintracellular calciumCRACcalcium release-activated calciumERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGFXGF109203XJAKJanus tyrosine kinase (soluble receptor-associated tyrosine kinase)LucluciferaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAPK-ERK kinasePKCprotein kinase CRenRenillaStARsteroidogenic acute regulatory proteinSKFSKF96365STATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionTgthapsigarginPP24-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidineAMacetoxymethyl esterRIAradioimmunoassay.1The abbreviations used are: Ang IIangiotensin IIAT1angiotensin II receptor subtype 1(Bu)2cAMPN6,2′-O-dibutyryladenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate[Ca2+]iintracellular calciumCRACcalcium release-activated calciumERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseGFXGF109203XJAKJanus tyrosine kinase (soluble receptor-associated tyrosine kinase)LucluciferaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMEKMAPK-ERK kinasePKCprotein kinase CRenRenillaStARsteroidogenic acute regulatory proteinSKFSKF96365STATsignal transducers and activators of transcriptionTgthapsigarginPP24-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidineAMacetoxymethyl esterRIAradioimmunoassay. and extracellular K+ (1Spat A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 29: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Ang II binds to AT1 G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors that activate phospholipase C and results in the release of diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate from plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (2Rossier M.F. Capponi A.M. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 60: 229-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol stimulates protein kinase C (PKC), while inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate stimulates the release of Ca2+ from internal stores and increases intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels. Depletion of the intracellular calcium stores activates capacitative calcium entry, thus Ang II mediates an influx of external Ca2+ via calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channels (3Penner R. Fasolato C. Hoth M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1993; 3: 368-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 4Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although Ang II has been shown to activate voltage-gated calcium channels, this pathway is not considered a major contributor to the steroidogenic response (5Burnay M.M. Python C.P. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). K+ activation of aldosterone synthesis, on the other hand, is associated with an influx of external Ca2+ via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (6Lotshaw D.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For both of these regulators it has been well established that aldosterone synthesis requires influx of external Ca2+ (2Rossier M.F. Capponi A.M. Vitam. Horm. 2000; 60: 229-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Lotshaw D.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, while both agents activate Ca2+ signaling, the mechanisms leading to aldosterone synthesis are distinct, and the Ang II response cannot be mimicked by K+ depolarization of the plasma membrane (5Burnay M.M.

The Ca2+-dependent mechanisms that mediate the Ang II-stimulated increase in steroidogenesis are required for both the chronic and acute response (9Bird I.M. Mason J.I. Rainey W.E. J. Clin.

Res. 1998; 24: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The chronic response is defined by increased transcription of the steroidogenic cytochrome P450 enzymes required for cortisol and mineralocorticoid biosynthesis (19Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The acute response is characterized by the delivery of cholesterol, the steroid precursor, to the mitochondrial inner membrane where the first enzymatic reaction catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme occurs (20Stocco D.M. Clark B.J. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 221-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). This response is dependent upon the increased de novo synthesis of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) that functions to facilitate cholesterol transport across the mitochondrial membranes (21Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 22Miller W.L. J. Mol.

Our previous studies demonstrated that increased aldosterone synthesis by Ang II and K+ treatment of H295R human adrenocortical cells is paralleled by an increase in the StAR protein (13Clark B.J. Pezzi V. Stocco D.M. Rainey W.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 115: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). StAR mRNA and protein expression have also been shown to be increased by Ang II in both bovine and rat adrenal glomerulosa cells (16Elliott M.E. Goodfriend T.L. Jefcoate C.R. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1669-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Cherradi N. Brandenburger Y. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Stocco D.M. Capponi A.M. Mol.

Steroids. 1997; 62: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore an increase in StAR transcription was observed in bovine glomerulosa cells after high intracellular calcium levels were maintained by ionomycin treatment, suggesting calcium signaling is sufficient for StAR gene regulation (17Cherradi N. Brandenburger Y. Rossier M.F. Vallotton M.B. Stocco D.M. Capponi A.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that Ang II treatment of H295R cells increased both StAR mRNA and protein levels, while K+ treatment increased only StAR protein levels (14Clark B.J. Combs R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4390-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Since both Ang II and K+ increase [Ca2+]i, the current studies were performed to test the premise that StAR transcriptional regulation by Ang II requires more than a general increase in intracellular calcium. Alternatively it may be that calcium localization or threshold levels of calcium are required for the Ang II-dependent StAR transcriptional response (25Bootman M.D. Berridge M.J. Roderick H.L. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R563-R565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In addition to the classical Ang II-activated calcium and PKC signaling pathways, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK1/2 and tyrosine kinase pathways can be activated by Ang II in adrenocortical cells (26McNeill H. Puddefoot J.R. Vinson G.P. Endocr. Res. 1998; 24: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Smith R.D. Baukal A.J. Dent P. Catt K.J.

Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ang II has also been shown to activate ERK1/2 in H295R cells (32Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W.E. Batlle D. Pestell R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22570-22577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 33Natarajan R. Yang D.C. Lanting L. Nadler J.L. Endocrine. 2002; 18: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of ERK1/2 activation did not inhibit the Ang II-stimulated increase in aldosterone synthesis, suggesting this pathway is not involved in the Ang II-dependent steroidogenic response in this cell line (33Natarajan R. Yang D.C. Lanting L. Nadler J.L. Endocrine. 2002; 18: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The evidence that tyrosine kinase signaling pathway(s) may be part of the Ang II response in adrenocortical cells was suggested by studies that reported genistein to be an inhibitor of aldosterone production, calcium influx via CRAC channels in bovine glomerulosa cells, and 3-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in H295R cells (29Bodart V. Ong H. De Lean A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 54: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Aptel H.B. Burnay M.M. Rossier M.F. Capponi A.M. J.

Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). More specifically, inhibition of Src kinase with the inhibitor PP2 was effective in inhibiting Ang II-stimulated aldosterone production in H295R cells. However, the inhibition was present when (22R)-hydroxycholesterol was used as a substrate, indicating that the target was a later step in the pathway beyond StAR (31Sirianni R. Carr B.R. Pezzi V. Rainey W.E. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Activation of the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) pathway mediated by Ang II binding to the AT1 receptor has been well documented for vascular smooth muscle cells (34Frank G.D. Saito S. Motley E.D. Sasaki T. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Inagami T. Eguchi S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Paxton W.G. Heerdt L. Berk B.C.

Signal. 1996; 8: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), but to date there is no report of JAK activation by Ang II in adrenocortical cells. The purpose of this study was to further define the mechanisms required for Ang II-stimulated increase in StAR transcription. The approach was twofold: first, to test the contribution of release of intracellular calcium stores versus influx of extracellular calcium on Ang II-dependent transcriptional activation of StAR, and second, to determine whether Ang II activates JAK and/or ERK1/2 signaling and increases StAR transcription in H295R cells. Materials—H295R cells were a gift from Dr. William E. Rainey, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (Dallas, TX). [Val5]Ang II acetate salt, thapsigargin, dibutyryl-cAMP, SKF96365, GF109203X, PD098059, and progesterone antibody were purchased from Sigma. AG490 was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium, LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent, and penicillin/streptomycin antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen. NuSerum type I and ITS+ Premix culture supplements were supplied by Collaborative Biomed Products (Bedford, MA). The luciferase assay system was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). [3H]Progesterone was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Transient Transfection—H295R cells were maintained in culture using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 2.5% NuSerum, 0.5% antibiotic-antimycotic, and 1% ITS+ Premix culture supplement. The cells were plated in a 24-well plate at 350,000 cells/well the day before cotransfection with -235 bp human StAR-luciferase reporter gene constructs (-235StAR-luc) (1 μg/ml) and either pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmids (1 μg/ml) using LipofectAMINE reagent or phRL-null Renilla plasmids (0.5 μg/ml) using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent. After 6 h, the lipid-plasmid complex was removed, and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium was placed on the cells for 24 h. The cells were then placed in serum-free medium for 16 h and then treated for 6 h in serum-free medium as indicated. After 6 h, the medium was removed, and steroids were measured directly in the medium by radioimmunoassay described below. For cells cotransfected with StAR-luc and pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmids, luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates using the luciferase reporter assay system and measurement with an EG&G Berthold Lumat LB 9507 luminometer. β-Galactosidase enzymatic activity was determined using β-d-galactopyranoside as substrate and measuring absorbance at 595 nm. For cells cotransfected with StAR-luc and phRL-null Renilla plasmids, luciferase and Renilla activities were determined in cell lysates using the dual luciferase reporter assay system. Cell treatments were performed in triplicate within each independent transfection experiment, and the mean values (±S.D.) for luciferase (Luc)/β-galactosidase activity or Luc/Renilla (Ren) activity were determined. The data were then normalized to the untreated control value that was set to 1.0. For the inhibitor studies, the cells were treated with inhibitor alone (no agonist) to determine the effect on basal activity. An increase in basal activity was shown for PD098059, while GF109203X (GFX) and AG490 had no effect on basal activity, and the data shown were normalized to the untreated control value. Intracellular Calcium Measurements—H295R cells were harvested from 75-mm cell culture flasks by trypsin digestion, washed twice with Krebs-Ringer buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer to a final concentration of 107 cells/ml. Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to the cell suspension to a final concentration of 5 μm, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The cells were washed twice with either regular Krebs-Ringer buffer or with calcium-free Krebs-Ringer buffer for measurements without external calcium and resuspended to a final concentration of 106 cells/ml. Fura-2 AM fluorescence was detected using a LS50B spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) connected to a computer for data collection with FL-WinLab software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 2 ml of cells were placed into a quartz cuvette, and all measurements were recorded at 37 °C under constant stirring. Excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm were used to collect the data, and calcium concentrations were determined from fluorescence ratios using software provided with FL-WinLab. Radioimmunoassay—The progesterone level was determined using [3H]progesterone (Amersham Biosciences) and progesterone antibody (Sigma). Unbound progesterone was removed by charcoal extraction, and bound progesterone was measured by scintillation counting. The concentrations of steroid in the medium were determined by extrapolation from a standard curve. The mean values for ng of steroid/ml of medium (±S.D.) were determined, and the data were normalized to the control value that was set to 1.0. Immunoblot Analysis—H295R cells were grown in 60-mm tissue culture dishes to 80% confluence and then placed in serum-free medium for 16 h before treatment. The cells were treated in either the absence or presence of the indicated inhibitor in either serum-free medium alone (control) or medium containing 10 nm Ang II for the indicated time (0.5-2.0 h). Collection of cell lysate and immunoblot analysis were done as described previously (23Stocco D.M. Vitam. Horm. 1999; 55: 399-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) except that protein was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Primary antibodies used were anti-phosphotyrosine-JAK2 (BioSource International, Inc., Camarillo, CA), anti-phospho-p44/42 ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Quantitation of the results was performed using Un-Scan-It (Version 5.1, Silk Scientific Corp.). Statistics—One way analysis of variance followed by a Dunnett post-test using PRISM software (Version 3.0, GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA) was used to determine statistical significance between treatments and between treatment and control. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. The mean values for the normalized data (treated/untreated) from all independent experiments (n ≥ 3) were used for the reporter gene data analysis. Progesterone data analysis was performed using either the normalized data or the raw data (ng of progesterone/ml) from all experiments and treatments, i.e. three experiments with triplicate treatment, n = 9. Extracellular Calcium Is Required for StAR Transcription and Steroid Production—Ang II or (Bu)2cAMP treatment resulted in a 7- or 10-fold increase in StAR promoter activity, respectively, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1A) (14Clark B.J. Combs R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4390-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Steroid production, as measured by both progesterone (Fig. 1B) and aldosterone (Fig. 1C) levels in the cell medium, was correspondingly increased by agonist treatment as well. Aldosterone was increased to a greater degree than was progesterone by Ang II treatment, and this is likely the result of the stimulatory actions of Ang II on aldosterone synthase expression (37Denner K. Rainey W.E. Pezzi V. Bird I.M. Bernhardt R. Mathis J.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 121: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Clyne C.D. Zhang Y. Slutsker L. Mathis J.M. White P.C. Rainey W.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 638-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). For the remainder of the studies, progesterone served as the indicator of increased (or decreased) steroidogenic activity. To determine whether calcium signaling is sufficient for the Ang II-dependent StAR transcriptional response, thapsigargin (Tg) treatment was used to mimic the Ang II-stimulated calcium signaling in H295R cells. Tg is an inhibitor of the calcium ATPase pump of intracellular membranes, therefore, calcium uptake by the intracellular stores is blocked, and depletion of these stores results in activation of plasma membrane CRAC channels and influx of extracellular calcium (5Burnay M.M. Python C.P. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Rossier M.F. Python C.P. Burnay M.M. Schlegel W. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Hajnoczky G. Varnai P. Hollo Z. Christensen S.B. Balla T. Enyedi P. Spat A. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 41Ely J.A. Ambroz C. Baukal A.J. Christensen S.B. Balla T. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18635-18641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, neither StAR promoter-reporter gene activity in transiently transfected H295R cells nor steroid production was significantly increased after Tg treatment. However, the Ang II-stimulated responses were inhibited when the experiments were repeated using calcium-free medium. (Bu)2-cAMP-stimulated StAR reporter gene activity in H295R cells, on the other hand, was less dependent upon calcium compared with Ang II with only a 30% decrease in the response in the absence of calcium in the medium (Fig. 1A). These data indicate that Tg cannot mimic the Ang II response in terms of StAR gene expression but do suggest that an influx of extracellular calcium is required. To confirm that Tg mediated an increase in intracellular calcium levels, H295R cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM, and changes in calcium were measured. First, 10 nm Ang II treatment in the presence of external calcium caused a characteristic transient increase in [Ca2+]i followed by a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 2A, +Ca) (12Bird I.M. Hanley N.A. Word R.A. Mathis J.M. McCarthy J.L. Mason J.I. Rainey W.E. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1555-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The transient rise in [Ca2+]i has been attributed to the release of internal stores, while the sustained levels are a result of influx of extracellular calcium to fill these depleted membrane stores (1Spat A. J. Steroid Biochem. 1988; 29: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 4Parekh A.B. J. Physiol. 2003; 547: 333-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 42Burnay M.M. Vallotton M.B. Capponi A.M. Rossier M.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The maximal [Ca2+]i measured is referred to as peak calcium, while the sustained calcium level is reported as the calcium concentration 3-5 min after agonist treatment. The difference between peak and resting or sustained and resting [Ca2+]i was determined for each treatment, and the data are presented in Table I. 10 nm Ang II treatment resulted in a 2-fold increase in [Ca2+]i over resting levels (Δ peak [Ca2+]i, 239 nm) with sustained calcium levels maintained at 70% over resting levels (Δ sustained [Ca2+]i, 72 nm). In the absence of extracellular calcium, the Ang II-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i was decreased 50% (Δ peak [Ca2+]i, 126 nm) with the sustained calcium levels returning near base-line levels (Δ sustained [Ca2+]i, 27 nm) (Table I). Tg treatment increased peak calcium levels to 143 nm over resting levels and maintained sustained calcium levels at 103 nm above resting levels. Although these data verify that Tg activates calcium signaling in H295R cells, the peak calcium levels achieved with Tg were approximately 40-50% lower than the 10 nm Ang II response in the presence of calcium (Table I). Therefore, we tested whether the lack of a steroidogenic response was due to less calcium released from internal stores. H295R cells were treated with a lower concentration of Ang II (1 nm), and the resulting calcium transient was compared with the 10 nm Ang II and 50 nm Tg responses (Fig. 2, B and C). The peak over resting calcium level (Δ peak [Ca2+]i) with 1.0 nm Ang II treatment was 30 and 50% of the levels obtained with either 10 nm Ang II or 50 nm Tg level, respectively. The sustained calcium levels were also relatively decreased (Table I). StAR reporter gene activity and progesterone synthesis, on the other hand, were significantly increased by 1 nm Ang II treatment (Fig. 3, A and B). Thus, StAR promoter activity is not dependent upon reaching a threshold level of [Ca2+]i as shown by the results with 1 nm Ang II treatment, and increased [Ca2+]i alone is not sufficient for this response as shown by the Tg treatment. This premise is supported by the results with 16 mm K+ treatment where the increased and sustained [Ca2+]i levels were 2-fold greater than that observed with 1 nm Ang II, but K+ treatment failed to similarly stimulate StAR reporter gene activity (Table I and Fig. 3A).Table IChanges in intracellular calcium concentration in H295R cells by agonist treatment Intracellular calcium levels were measured by Fura-2 AM detection as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and all data are shown as nm calcium. Resting calcium levels were recorded for 2 min prior to agonist treatment. Peak Ca2+ is the maximal concentration of calcium, while Δ peak Ca2+ is the difference in peak and resting calcium levels.

In animal cells, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are implicated in the regulation of a number of cellular processes. However, little is known on the functions of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases in Ca2+ signaling in plants. From an Arabidopsis expression library, we isolated cDNA encoding a dual specificity protein phosphatase 1, which is capable of hydrolyzing both phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine residues of the substrates. Using a gel overlay assay, we identified two Ca2+-dependent CaM binding domains (CaMBDI in the N terminus and CaMBDII in the C terminus). Specific binding of CaM to two CaMBD was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis, a gel mobility shift assay, and a competition assay using a Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme. At increasing concentrations of CaM, the biochemical activity of dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 on the p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) substrate was increased, whereas activity on the phosphotyrosine of myelin basic protein (MBP) was inhibited. Our results collectively indicate that calmodulin differentially regulates the activity of protein phosphatase, dependent on the substrate. Based on these findings, we propose that the Ca2+ signaling pathway is mediated by CaM cross-talks with a protein phosphorylation signal pathway in plants via protein dephosphorylation.

In plants and animals, Ca2+ acts as a mediator of stimulus response coupling in the regulation of diverse cellular functions triggered by a variety of biotic and abiotic external stimuli (1.Knight M.R.

In most cases, the active form of CaM (Ca2+-bound) regulates the activity and function of a wide range of CaM-binding proteins (CaMBP), including metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, ion channels, protein kinases/phosphatases, and structural proteins (10.Snedden W.A.

Therefore, CaM acts as a multifunctional protein in Ca2+-mediated signal transduction networks and regulates the activities of proteins that are structurally distinct and opposite proteins, such as protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (12.Cheng S.H.

Protein kinase and phosphatase play central roles in diverse cellular mechanisms (15.Evans D.R.H. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1998; 394: 23-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 16.Schenk P.W.

Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2577) Google Scholar). Protein kinase catalyzes the covalent attachment of a phosphate group to an amino acid side chain with a hydroxyl group. A number of protein kinase types have been widely studied in higher plants. Protein phosphatases are less numerous but more diverse, and can therefore be grouped into Ser/Thr, Tyr, and dual specificity classes according to substrate specificity (18.Smith R.D. Walker J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 101-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 19.Dombradi V. Krieglstein J. Klumpp S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ser/Thr phosphatases were originally subdivided into protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2 (PP2) groups, based on differential sensitivity to the small inhibitors (20.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2143) Google Scholar). PP2 proteins are further distinguished by metal ion requirements. Specifically, PP2C and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) require Mg2+ and Ca2+, respectively, whereas protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) types have no ion requirement (21.Walton K.M. Dixon J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 101-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Proteins of PP1, PP2A, and PP2B groups share high sequence similarity and constitute the protein phosphatase P (PPP) family. In contrast, PP2C proteins display low sequence similarity to the PPP family and compose the protein phosphatase M (PPM) family, together with pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase and other Mg2+-dependent Ser/Thr phosphatases (22.Barford D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 23.Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Interestingly, members of the PPP and PPM families share similar structural folding characteristics (24.Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), suggesting a common mechanism of catalysis. Several conserved acidic residues generate complex metal ions essential to their activities (25.Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol.

A metal-bound water molecule acts as a nucleophile to directly displace phosphate from a specific amino acid of the substrate in an acid-base catalytic mechanism (28.Lohse D.L. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Structure. 1995; 3: 987-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Tyr phosphatases and Ser/Thr phosphatases have distinct evolutionary origins and catalytic mechanisms. Conventional Tyr phosphatases (PTP) are specific for phosphorylated Tyr residues. However, dual specificity phosphatases (DsPTP) act on both phosphorylated Tyr and phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues (29.Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Barsam B. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). PTP and DsPTP contain a catalytic core motif with a conserved Cys residue, which acts as a nucleophile, displacing the phosphate group from the substrate and forming a phosphoryl-cysteinyl intermediate (30.Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This subgroup of Tyr phosphatases regulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in a variety of signal transduction pathways in both animals and yeast (31.Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). In fact, both AtPTP1 and AtDsPTP1 dephosphorylate and deactivate a MAPK protein (AtMPK4) in vitro (32.Xu Q. Fu H.H. Gupta R. Luan S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 33.Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A putative DsPTP gene, AtMKP1, is essential for UV resistance in Arabidopsis (34.Ulm R. Revenkova E. di Sansebastiano G.P. Bechtold N. Paszkowski J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 699-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).The Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (PP2B), is ubiquitous in animals and yeast, and mediates a variety of intracellular signaling pathways (35.Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Studies reporting the in vitro and in vivo effects of introducing heterologous calcineurin in plants indirectly support the existence of functional calcineurin in plants (36.Luan S. Li W. Rusnak F.

A number of potential calcineurin partners have been identified in plants, including immunophilins (39.Chou I.T. Gasser C.S. Plant Mol.

A. 1999; 96: 4718-4723Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, the calcineurin catalytic subunit (calcineurin A) is not encoded by the Arabidopsis genome, and to date, no calcineurin A-related sequences have been reported from other plant species in the public sequence data bases.In the present study, we identify a CaM-binding DsPTP1 (33.Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by screening with HRP-conjugated CaM as a probe. DsPTP1 has distinct biochemical characteristics from calcineurin. Dephosphorylation of pNPP, a common synthetic protein phosphatase substrate, by DsPTP1 was increased in the presence of CaM. However, the tyrosine dephosphorylation activity of DsPTP1 on phosphorylated MBP was inhibited by CaM. Our results demonstrate that Ca2+ signaling mediated by CaM contributes to the protein dephosphorylation mechanism in plants via DsPTP1 regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESScreening of the Arabidopsis cDNA Expression Library—A cDNA expression library was constructed from Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia) in a λZAPII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Arabidopsis calmodulin 2 (AtCaM2) was conjugated to maleimide-activated HRP using the EZ-Link maleimide-activated HRP conjugation kit (Pierce), as described in a previous report (43.Lee S.H. Kim M.C. Heo W.D. Kim J.C. Chung W.S. Park C.Y. Park H.C. Cheong Y.H. Kim C.Y. Lee K.J. Bahk J.D. Lee S.Y. Cho M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1433: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We screened the Arabidopsis cDNA expression library using HRP-conjugated AtCaM2 (AtCaM2::HRP) as a probe. Approximately 5 × 104 pfu cells were plated per 15-cm LB plate, using Escherichia coli XL1-blue MRF (Stratagene) as the host strain. Plates were incubated at 42 °C until plaques appeared and overlaid with nitrocellulose filters previously soaked in 10 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Incubation was continued at 37 °C for 6–8 h, and plates were cooled to 4 °C. Filters were removed and rinsed twice in a large volume of TBS-T (Tris-based saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Next, filters were blocked by incubation in 7% (w/v) nonfat dry milk/TBS-T overnight. Blocked filters were washed three times with TBS-T for 5 min and equilibrated in overlay buffer (50 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h. Membranes were blocked a second time by incubating filters in overlay buffer containing 9% (v/v) gelatin (Sigma), 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20, and 1 mm CaCl2 for 3.5 h. AtCaM2::HRP was added to gelatin-containing buffer at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml, and filters were incubated for 1 h. The final washing was performed in three steps, with each step consisting of 5 repeats of a 5-min wash; first, in TBS-T, 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 mm CaCl2; second, in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Tween 20, 50 mm imidazole-HCl, 0.5 m KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2; and third, in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm MgCl2. Bound CaM::HRP was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Recombinants (5 × 105) were screened, and 50 positive clones were isolated after three rounds of screening. cDNA inserts were recovered by in vivo excision with helper phage (ExAssist, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To confirm binding to CaM, we expressed positive clones as β-galactosidase fusion proteins in E. coli. Clones were examined for CaM binding by a CaM::HRP overlay assay, as described above. In brief, we transformed positive clones into XL1-blue MRF (Stratagene) and induced the expression of β-galactosidase fusion proteins by 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside treatment. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced E. coli crude proteins (20 μg) were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto an Immobilon-MP membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride, Millipore). The membrane was rinsed in TBS-T, blocked by incubation in 7% (w/v) nonfat dry milk/TBS-T overnight, and processed as described above. For determination of Ca2+ independent binding of CaM, 5 mm EGTA was substituted for 1 mm CaCl2 in all overlay buffers. The cDNA sequences of the resulting positive clones were determined from both strands by dideoxynucleotide chain termination, using an automatic DNA sequencer (ABI 373A, Applied Biosystems Inc.).Construction of Deletion Mutants of DsPTP1 cDNA and Site-directed Mutagenesis—For mapping of the CaM binding domain, several serial fragment constructs were generated in a pGEX-5X series vector (Amersham Biosciences). The full-length DsPTP1 cDNA clone was amplified by PCR with a forward (5′) primer containing a BamHI site (5′-GGATCCCCATGAGTTCTAGAGACAGAGGATCACCT-3′) and a reverse (3′) primer containing a SmaI site (5′-CCCGGGTCAAAAGGAAAAAAACTGGTCACTCAC-3′). The PCR product was cloned in pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced to verify the correct construct. The construct was subcloned into the pGEX-5X expression vector, and digested with BamHI and SmaI. This full-length glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion construct was designated D0 (encompassing amino acids 1–198). Serial fragment constructs and other DsPTP were additionally generated by PCR using the following forward (F) and reverse (R) primer sequences: for D1 (amino acids 1–51), forward, containing BamHI (5′-GGATCCCCATGAGTTCTAGAGACAGAGGATCACCT-3′), reverse, containing XhoI (5′-CTCGAGAGGGACATTGTCGTCTCTAT-3′); for D2 (amino acids 52–101), forward, containing EcoRI (5′-GAATTCTCCCTTATTGAACAGGGTCT-3′), reverse, containing XhoI (5′-CTCGAGTCGAACAACCTTGTAAACAA-3′); for D3 (amino acids 102–151), forward, containing EcoRI (5′-GAATTCGTCGTGGATAAGGAAGATAC-3′), reverse, containing XhoI (5′-CTCGAGCATGAGGTAAGCAACAACTA-3′); and D4 (amino acids 152–198) forward, containing EcoRI (5′-GAATTCAAGAAACACGGTATGACTTT-3′), reverse, containing SmaI (5′-CCCGGGTCAAAAGGAAAAAAACTGGTCACTCAC-3′). Further PCR reactions were performed with the following primers: for DsPTP1e (At2g04550) (29.Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Barsam B. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), forward, containing BamHI (5′-GGATCCAGATGAGGAAGAGAGAAAGAGAGAAC-3′) and reverse, containing XhoI (5′-CTCGAGCTAAGAGCCATCCATTGCAATATC-3′; and for DsPTP1b (At3g06110) (29.Kerk D. Bulgrien J. Smith D.W. Barsam B. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 908-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), forward, containing BamHI (5′-GGATCCCGATGGAGAAAGTGGTTGATCTCTTC-3′), reverse, containing XhoI (5′-CTCGAGTCATGCATTACCTTGGATGGATTT-3′). Amplified products were cloned into pGEM-T, and subcloned into a pGEX-5X expression vector using the appropriate restriction enzymes sites.To identify the critical residues in the interactions between CaM and DsPTP1, we introduced several point mutations into the GST::DsPTP1, GST::D1 (CaMBD I), and GST::D4 (CaMBD II) clones. Substitution of single amino acids was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The following forward and reverse primers were employed: for V28R forward, 5′-GAAAAGTATAATGAAAAGCGTAAGAATCAGATA-3′, reverse, 5′-ACGAACAAGAGCTTGTATCTGATTCTTACGCTT; for I32R forward, 5′-GAAAAGGTGAAGAATCAGAGACAAGCTCTTGTT-3′ and reverse, 5′-AACTTTAATAACACGAACAAGAGCTTGTCTCTG-3′; for Q33D forward, 5′-AAGGTGAAGAATCAGATAGATGCTCTTGTTCGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-AGCAACTTTAATAACACGAACAAGAGCATCTAT-3′; for L35R forward, 5′-AAGAATCAGATACAAGCTCGTGTTCGTGTTATT-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGTACGAGCAACTTTAATAACACGAACACGAGC-3′; for V36R forward, 5′-AATCAGATACAAGCTCTTCGTCGTGTTATTAAA-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATAGGTACGAGCAACTTTAATAACACGACGAAG-3′; for L158R forward, 5′-ATGAAGAAACACGGTATGACTAGAGCTCAAGCA, and reverse, 5′-GCTTTTAACATGTTGCAATGCTTGAGCTCTAGT-3′; for L162R forward, 5′-GGTATGACTTTAGCTCAAGCAAGACAACATGTT, and reverse, 5′-CACGGGTCTTTTGCTTTTAACATGTTGTCTCGT-3′; for K166E forward, 5′-GCTCAAGCATTGCAACATGTTGAAAGCAAAAGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-ATTAGGACTTGCCACGGGTCTTTTGCTTTCAAC-3′; for K168E forward, 5′-GCATTGCAACATGTTAAAAGCGAAAGACCGTG-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACCAGCATTAGGACTTGCCACGGGTCTTTCGCT-3′; for R169E forward, 5′-TTGCAACATGTTAAAAGCAAAGAACCCGTGGCA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAAACCAGCATTAGGACTTGCCACGGGTTCTTT-3′; for V171R forward, 5′-CATGTTAAAAGCAAAAGACCCAGAGCAAGTCCT-3′ and reverse, 5′-TCTGATGAAACCAGCATTAGGACTTGCTCTGGG-3′; and for F178R forward, 5′-GTGGCAAGTCCTAATGCTGGTAGAATCAGACAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CTTCTCGAGGTCTTGTCCTTGTCTGATTCTACC-3′.CaM Mobility Shift Assay with a Synthetic Peptide—Peptides corresponding to a stretch of 20 amino acids within CaMBDI (26KVKNQIQALVRVIKVARTYR47) and 28 amino acids (151KKHGMTLAQALQHVKSKRPVASPNAGFI180) in CaMBDII of DsPTP1 were generated at a peptide synthesis facility (Peptron and Peptipharm). The CaM binding abilities of the synthetic peptides were determined from the relative mobility shift of CaM in the presence of the peptide (44.Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). CaM (303 pmol) was incubated with increasing concentrations of peptide (molar ratios: 0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5) in binding buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, plus 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) at room temperature for 1 h. Half the volume of 50% glycerol plus the tracer, bromphenol blue, was added, and mixtures were electrophoresed on 15% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.375 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Gels were run at a constant voltage of 100 V in electrode buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, and either 0.1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue for visualization.Phosphodiesterase Competition Assay—Cyclic nucleotide PDE (phosphodiesterase) assays were performed using commercially available bovine heart CaM-deficient PDE (Sigma). The initial reaction mixture (100 μl) contained buffer (100 mm imidazole-HCl, 2.56 mm cAMP, 5.13 mm MgSO4, 1.28 mm CaCl2) with varying amounts of AtCaM2 (1 to 200 nm) and a fixed concentration of synthetic peptide (100 nm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of PDE (0.5 milliunits/μl). The basal level of enzyme activity was determined in the absence of AtCaM2, and stimulated activity was determined in the presence of AtCaM2 and CaCl2. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was terminated by placing the reaction tubes into a boiling water bath for 5 min and then on ice for 2 min. Following brief centrifugation, 50 μl of alkaline phosphatase (10 units) was added and the mixture incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After vortexing, precipitates were spun down and the supernatant (400 μl) was transferred to a new tube. After adding 1 ml of phosphate reagent (45.Lee S.H. Kim J.C. Lee M.S. Heo W.D. Seo H.Y. Yoon H.W. Hong J.C. Lee S.Y. Bahk J.D. Hwang I. Cho M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21806-21812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the supernatant was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and assayed for Pi at A660. The dissociation constant (Kd) of AtCaM2 for the peptide was calculated from the concentration of AtCaM2 (nm) required to obtain half-maximal (50%) PDE activity, either in the presence (100 nm) or absence of peptide. The following equation was used to calculate dissociation constants (44.Erickson-Viitanen S. DeGrado W.F. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 139: 455-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar): Kd = ([Pt] + K – [CaM])K/([CaM] – K), where [Pt] is the total concentration of peptide added, and [CaM] and K represent the concentrations of CaM required to obtain half-maximal activation of PDE in the presence or absence of peptides, respectively.Yeast Split Ubiquitin Assay—The yeast split ubiquitin assay was performed as described previously (46.Laser H. Bongards C. Schuller J. Heck S. Johnsson N. Lehming N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain JD53 was used for all the experiments. AtCaM2 and DsPTP1 (WT and mutant) cDNA were cloned into pMet-Ste14-Cub-RUra3, replacing yeast Ste14. AtCaM2 and DsPTP1 (WT and mutant) cDNA were cloned into modified versions of the pCup-Nub-Sec62 vector, replacing yeast Sec62 (47.Stagljar I. Korostensky C. Johnsson N. te Heesen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5187-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Interactions between each pair of proteins were tested on selective medium containing 1 mg/ml 5-FOA and selective medium lacking uracil. Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–5 days, unless specified otherwise.Phosphatase Assay—To analyze the generic phosphatase activity of DsPTP1, pNPP (Calbiochem) was used as a substrate. Phosphatase activity at various enzyme concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 μg) of wild-type or mutant DsPTP1 proteins (L35R, K166E, or L35R/K166E) was examined in 100 μl of phosphatase buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing 10 mm pNPP, incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by the addition of 0.25 m NaOH. Absorbance was determined at 405 nm using a spectrophotometer. To analyze phosphatase activity at various indicated calmodulin (AtCaM2) concentrations, reactions were allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 1 h using 5 μg (700 nm) of wild-type or mutant DsPTP1 (L35R, K166E, or L35R/K166E) in the presence (0.1 mm CaCl2) or absence of Ca2+ (5 mm EGTA).For phosphatase assays with another protein substrate, MBP was labeled either at tyrosine ([32P]Tyr MBP) or serine/threonine ([32P]Ser/Thr MBP) residues, using specific protein kinase. Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For tyrosine labeling, 25 units of human c-Src tyrosine kinase (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were incubated with 1 mg of substrate and 50 μCi [32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 50 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm Mg acetate) for 4 h at 30 °C. Radiolabeled MBP was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetic acid, washed three times with cold 20% trichloroacetic acid and twice with cold acetone, air-dried, dissolved in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and stored at 4 °C. For 32P labeling of serine/threonine residues in MBP, the procedure described for Src kinase was applied to 50 units of bovine heart protein kinase A (Sigma) in a different reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2). Labeled protein was purified as described for the Src-labeled substrate.Protein phosphatase activity was determined by measuring the release of free 32P from labeled substrates. Assays were performed as described previously (32.Xu Q. Fu H.H. Gupta R. Luan S. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 33.Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. For calmodulin analysis, 2 μg of wild-type DsPTP1 or mutant protein (L35R, K166E, or L35R/K166E) was mixed with 2 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled substrate in phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol) in a total volume of 150 μl. Following incubation of the reaction mixture at 30 °C for 1 h, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 volumes of 25% trichloroacetic acid. Next, 20 μg of bovine serum albumin (Amresco, Burnsville, MN) was added as carrier protein to facilitate precipitation. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was subjected to liquid scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6000TA). Blank incubations were performed in the absence of DsPTP1. The phosphatase activity of DsPTP1 protein was calculated as percentage dephosphorylation of the substrate after subtraction of blank readings.Furthermore, protein phosphatase activity was confirmed by measuring 32P-labeled substrates. 32P-Labeled substrate (2 × 106 cpm) was added to a 20 μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol and DsPTP1 protein, and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction conditions were similar, except for reaction volume and substrate concentration (2 × 106 cpm). The mixture was separated on 13% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To visualize dephosphorylation activity, the gel was exposed to x-ray films after drying.RESULTSThe Arabidopsis CaM-binding Protein, DsPTP1—To identify the molecular components of Ca2+/CaM-mediated signa"
https://openalex.org/W1997447310,"TRK family proteins, which mediate the concentrative uptake of potassium by plant cells, fungi, and bacteria, resemble primitive potassium channels in sequence and have recently been proposed actually to fold like potassium channels in a 4-MPM motif (Durell, S. R., and Guy, H. R. (1999) <i>Biophys. J.</i> 77, 789 - 807), instead of like conventional substrate porters in the 12-TM motif (Gaber, R. F., Styles, C. A., and Fink, G. R. (1988) <i>Mol. Cell. Biol.</i> 8, 2848-2859). The known fungal members of this family possess a very long hydrophilic loop, positioned intracellularly in the K<sup>+</sup>-channel model and extracellularly in the substrate porter model. This and two shorter hydrophilic segments have been tested as topological markers for the true folding pattern of TRK proteins using <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> Trk2p. Hemagglutinin epitope tags were inserted into all three segments, and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused to the C terminus of Trk2p. The gene constructs were expressed from a high copy plasmid, and sidedness of the tags was determined by native fluorescence (EGFP), indirect immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy. Both the long-loop tag and the C-terminal EGFP fusion allowed abundant protein to reach the plasma membrane and support normal yeast growth. In all determinations, the long-loop tag was localized to the inner surface of the yeast cell plasma membrane, thus strongly supporting the channel-like folding model. Additional observations showed (i) membrane-associated Trk2p to lie in proteolipid rafts; (ii) significant tagged protein, expressed from the plasmid, to be sequestered in cytoplasmic vesicular-tubular clusters; and (iii) suppression of such clusters by yeast growth in 5-10% glycerol. This chaperone-like effect may assist other membrane proteins (overexpressed or heterologously expressed) to function within the yeast plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2002477812,"An embryo-defective mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana was isolated that arrests development at a variety of stages, from as early as the globular stage of embryogenesis to as late as formation of an abnormal bent cotyledon stage embryo. Defects in the suspensor, a normally transient structure derived from the fertilized egg, were often associated with the arrested embryo. The lesion was within a gene encoding a protein with domains characteristic of lariat debranching enzymes, which has been named AtDBR1 (for Arabidopsis thaliana Debranching enzyme 1). Cleavage of the 2′-5′-phosphodiester bond found in excised intron lariats (“debranching”) is essential for turnover of intronic sequences as well as generation of some small nucleolar RNAs. The mutation within AtDBR1 was confirmed by complementation as being responsible for the embryo-lethal phenotype, and the activity of the encoded protein in cleavage of 2′-5′-phosphodiester bonds was verified using an in vitro debranching assay.

Isolation of embryo-defective mutants has been a valuable approach for identification of genes that are essential for plant growth and development and that are not protected by redundancy. Although some embryo-defective mutants, such as lec1 and lec2, represent lesions in genes specific to the embryonic phase (1.West M.A.L. Yee K.M. Danao J. Zimmerman J.L. Fischer R.L. Goldberg R.B.

In these cases, the embryo lethality is due to the fact that a recessive mutation in homozygous state cannot survive past this early point in development. Thus, in a broader sense, many embryo-defective mutants (often referred to as emb mutants) define a set of non-redundant genes essential for life (4.Meinke D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 369-394Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5.McElver J. Tzafrir I. Aux G. Rogers R. Ashby C. Smith K. Thomas C. Schetter A. Zhou Q. Cushmann M.A. Tossberg J. Nickle T. Levin J.Z. Law M. Meinke D. Patton D. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1751-1763PubMed Google Scholar). Of 110 EMB genes recently characterized, 42% encode proteins of unknown function, whereas the remainder are involved in a diverse range of processes including metabolism, cell growth, transcription, and translation (5.McElver J. Tzafrir I. Aux G. Rogers R. Ashby C. Smith K. Thomas C. Schetter A. Zhou Q. Cushmann M.A. Tossberg J. Nickle T. Levin J.Z. Law M. Meinke D. Patton D. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1751-1763PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these genes are likely to be expressed throughout the plant life cycle. For example, the ttn5 and gnom/emb30 mutants show defects very early in embryo development, but the wild-type genes encode proteins involved in vesicular trafficking at all stages of development (6.McElver J. Patton D. Rumbaugh M. Liu C.-M. Yang L.J. Meinke D. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1379-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7.Shevell D.E. Leu W.M. Gillmor C.S. Xia G. Feldmann K.A. Chua N.-H.

Research programs, such as SeedGenes, are oriented toward coordinating identification of all genes that produce embryo-lethal phenotypes when disrupted in order to better understand not only embryo development but also the minimal set of genes necessary for cellular processes (see Ref. 9.Tzafrir I. Dickerman A. Brazhnik O. Nguyen Q. McElver J. Frye C. Patton D. Meinke D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar and www.seedgenes.org/). There are postulated to be 500-750 genes encoding non-redundant functions in this minimal set in Arabidopsis (5.McElver J. Tzafrir I. Aux G. Rogers R. Ashby C. Smith K. Thomas C. Schetter A. Zhou Q.

Patton D. Meinke D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A subclass of embryo-defective mutants shows abnormal development of suspensor cells. In a wild-type Arabidopsis embryo, the suspensor, which is derived from the basal cell of the first zygotic division, forms a single file of seven to nine cells (reviewed in Ref. 10.Yeung E.C. Meinke D.W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1371-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The suspensor provides a supportive role for the embryo proper and normally degenerates during later embryo development. Although part of the basal cell lineage persists in the embryo proper in the form of the root cortex initials and central part of the root cap, the remainder of the embryo proper is derived from the apical cell of the two-cell embryo (reviewed in Ref. 11.West M.A.L. Harada J.J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1361-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The suspensor (sus) and raspberry mutants show defects in morphogenesis of the embryo proper, with the most common arrest occurring at the globular stage of development. In these mutants, once defects become apparent in the embryo proper, cells in the suspensor began to divide abnormally (12.Schwartz B.W. Yeung E.C. Meinke D.W. Development. 1994; 120: 3235-3245PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Yadegari R. De Paiva G.R. Laux T. Koltunow A.M. Apuya N. Zimmerman J.L. Fischer R.L. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1713-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Abnormal development of the suspensor ranges from a few extra divisions, which may be accompanied by expression of programs normally limited to the embryo proper (12.Schwartz B.W. Yeung E.C. Meinke D.W. Development. 1994; 120: 3235-3245PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Yadegari R. De Paiva G.R. Laux T. Koltunow A.M. Apuya N. Zimmerman J.L. Fischer R.L. Harada J.J. Goldberg R.B. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1713-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), to entire viable embryos in the case of the twin (twn) mutants (14.Vernon D.M. Meinke D.W. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 15.Zhang J.Z. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7349-7355Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that some yet unidentified signal from the embryo proper may repress the developmental potential of the suspensor. In the sus, raspberry, and twn mutants, this signal is not produced, and cells in the suspensor acquire different degrees of embryo identity (12.Schwartz B.W. Yeung E.C. Meinke D.W. Development. 1994; 120: 3235-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the isolation of an embryo-lethal mutant and identification of the genetic lesion. Embryos homozygous for this recessive allele arrest at a variety of stages and show a range of associated suspensor defects. The lesion is within a gene that encodes a putative lariat debranching-like enzyme. Lariat debranching enzymes (DBRs) 1The abbreviations used are: DBR, debranching; snoRNAs, small nucleolar RNAs; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TAIL, thermal asymmetric interlaced; DIC, differential interference contrast; msDNA, multicopy single-stranded DNA; RT, reverse transcription; T-DNA, transferred DNA. are involved in cleavage of a 2′-5′-phosphodiester bond that is generated during excision of introns (16.Keller W.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 233-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This cleavage converts the forked or branched lariat intron to linear form that can be subsequently degraded (18.Nam K. Lee G. Trambley J. Devine S.E. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 19.Clark T.A. Sugnet C.W. Ares Jr, M. Science. 2002; 296: 907-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In some cases, the excised intron encodes one or several small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) that are necessary for processing of ribosomal RNAs and small nuclear RNAs (reviewed in Refs. 20.Kiss T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 21.Kiss T. Cell. 2002; 109: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 22.Brown J.W.S. Echeverria M. Qu L.-H. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 42-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Generation of at least some functional snoRNAs relies on debranching of the intron (23.Petfalski E. Dandekar T. Henry Y. Tollervey D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that some aspect of debranching is essential for normal embryo development. Plant Materials and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Wassilewskija (Ws) seeds and seeds from dbr1 heterozygous mutant plants with or without complementation constructs were sown on germination media (supplemented with 10 g/liter sucrose, 0.5 g/liter MES, and 7 g/liter agar, pH 5.6-5.7, with 50 μg/ml kanamycin for transgenic seeds, and for complementation an additional 20 μg/ml hygromycin was added) (see Ref. 24.Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (53958) Google Scholar), chilled for 2 days at 4 °C, and transferred to a growth room at 23-24 °C for a 23-h light/1-h dark regime. After 7-10 days, seedlings were transplanted to potting mix (ProMix BX, Premier Brands, Inc., Canada). Plants were grown at 20/18 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark regime in a growth chamber. Isolation of the dbr1 Mutant and Characterization of the Phenotype—dbr1 was isolated during generation of plants carrying a β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene that was expressed by the 5′-regulatory region of DTA1 (25.Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). One line carrying the DTA1:GUS construct was noted to produce ∼25% aborted seed. After verifying the presence of a single transferred DNA (T-DNA) insert, by backcrossing to wild-type and by kanamycin resistance segregation, further analysis, TAIL-PCR, and complementation studies were performed as described below. To examine the defect in the dbr1 mutant, developing seeds were made transparent by incubation in Hoyer's solution overnight (12.Schwartz B.W. Yeung E.C. Meinke D.W. Development. 1994; 120: 3235-3245PubMed Google Scholar), followed by examination on a Zeiss Axioplan2 equipped with a 35-mm camera and using DIC optics (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). Slides were scanned using a Nikon LS-2000 scanner (Nikon Corp., Japan) and assembled using Photoshop 5.0 and Illustrator 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Thermal Asymmetric Interlaced (TAIL)-PCR—TAIL-PCR was performed as described previously by Liu et al. (26.Liu Y.-G. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Whittier R.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Genomic DNA was isolated from plants heterozygous for the T-DNA insertion causing the embryo lethality according to a protocol obtained from the Wisconsin Arabidopsis Knockout facility (www.biotech.wisc.edu/Arabidopsis/). Three T-DNA-specific primers (TR1, TAATGGTTTCTGACGTATGTGCTT; TR2, TGTGCTTAGCTCATTAAACTCCAG; and TR3, TTCTGTCAGTTCCAAACGTAAAAC) and an arbitrary degenerate primer (AD2) (26.Liu Y.-G. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Whittier R.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar) were used for the primary, secondary, and tertiary reactions using KlenTaq1™ (Ab Peptides, St. Louis, MO) and a PTC-100™ thermocycler (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, MA), as in Liu et al. (26.Liu Y.-G. Mitsukawa N. Oosumi T. Whittier R.F. Plant J. 1995; 8: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), except slightly more stringent annealing temperatures were used in some reactions. A single band from the tertiary PCR was gel-purified and sequenced using TR3 as a primer. Molecular Complementation—For complementation of the dbr1 mutation, an ∼3.95-kb DNA fragment corresponding to the AtDBR1 coding region, including introns (∼2.13-kb) ∼1.25 kb-5′ of the translational start codon and ∼0.57-kb 3′ of the stop codon, was amplified from Arabidopsis Ws genomic DNA using oligonucleotide primers 5′-AAGCTTACCAACTTATAATGAATAGAGA-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTTATTGTCTCTGTGTTTTGACTCG-3′ and cloned into the HindIII and BamHI site of pCAMBIA1300 to generate pCAMBIA-gAtDBR1. For dexamethasone-inducible complementation, the cDNA was cloned into pTA7001 (27.Aoyama T. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar), and the resulting plasmid was named pTA-cAtDBR1. AtDBR1 cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR using silique RNA as described previously (25.Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers were 5′-CTCGAGAATTCAGCAGAGAGATGAAGA-3′ and 5′-ACTAGTGACCACTGGAATGGAGATATTCA-3′. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. pCAMBIA-gAtDBR1 and pTA-cAtDBR1 were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101, and DBR1/dbr1 Arabidopsis plants were transformed by the floral dip method as described by Wang et al. (25.Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). T1 and T2 generations of pCAMBIA-gAtDBR1 were scored for complementation. After bolting, individual lines corresponding to the T2 generation of DBR1/dbr1 plants carrying the dexamethasone-inducible complementation construct pTA-cAtDBR1 were sprayed daily with 30 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) containing 0.02% Silwet L-77 (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX) for 10 consecutive days. After 10 days, dexamethasone treatment was ceased on one set of plants but continued on another set of plants. Staged siliques were opened 3-4 days later and cleared in Hoyer's solution as described above to assess embryo development. Siliques were also examined 9 days later, and the number of aborted seeds was counted. Expression Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from a variety of tissues using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen). The hot borate method was used to extract total RNA from siliques (28.Wilkins T.A. Smart L.B. Krieg P.A. A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis, and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 21-41Google Scholar). Reverse transcription and semi-quantitative PCR were performed as described previously (25.Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) by using hot start at 94 °C and 40 cycles for AtDBR1 and 24 cycles for TUB2 under the following conditions: 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The primers were as follows: for AtDBR1, 5′ primer and 3′ primer were 5′-GCAAAAACCATACTTTCGTC-3′ and 5′-ATCGATTCATGCATCGTCTCTTGTATGA-3′. For TUB2, primers were 5′-CTCAAGAGGTTCTCAGCAGTA-3′ and 5′-TCACCTTCTTCATCCGCAGTT-3′. The PCR products were visualized on 1.2% agarose gels and captured using a ChemiImager (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). AtDBR1 Enzymatic Activity—To test whether AtDBR1 was able to cleave 2′-5′-phosphodiester bonds, the protein was produced in Escherichia coli and used in in vitro debranching assays (17.Ooi S.L.

Briefly, the sequences encoding amino acid residues 1-418 were placed under control of an inducible promoter in pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI) and introduced into the expression host BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.4, and expression of the construct was induced by addition of 0.1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubation at 18 °C for 10 h, followed by an additional 3 h at 4 °C. Cells carrying the pET28a empty vector were also grown and induced as controls. S30 cell extracts were prepared as described by Kim et al. (30.Kim J.W. Kim H.C. Kim G.M. Yang J.M. Boeke J.D. Nam K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3666-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼0.15 g of cell pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma) and lysed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking. The lysate was centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 1 h, and the presence of the induced protein in the supernatant was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and protein gel blot analysis using monoclonal antibody specific for a T7 tag (Novagen, Madison, WI) at the amino-terminal end of AtDBR1. The substrate for the debranching assay was produced from E. coli harboring plasmid pDB808 (generous gift of Dr. J. Boeke, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD). pDB808 causes accumulation of msDNA Ec86 that was isolated and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP and gel-purified as described previously (17.Ooi S.L.

The debranching assay was performed as described in Ref. 17.Ooi S.L. Dann III, C. Nam K. Leahy D.J. Damha M.J. Boeke J.D.

The reactions were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 50 μl of formamide containing 0.05% xylene cyanol and 0.05% bromphenol blue, and an aliquot (15 μl) was analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. dbr1 Embryos Arrest at a Variety of Stages and Exhibit Suspensor Defects—In the course of generation of transgenic plants expressing a reporter construct DTA1:GUS (25.Wang H. Tang W. Zhu C. Perry S. Plant J. 2002; 32: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), one line was obtained that produced approximately one-quarter aborted seeds. Initially, aborted seeds appeared white or transparent in color at a stage when wild-type appearing siblings were green (data not shown). Later in development, the aborted seeds were dark brown and withered in appearance (Fig. 1A). The lethality was not due to expression of the transgene because this individual line was the only one out of 72 analyzed that exhibited a seed-lethal phenotype. 2H. Wang, personal observations. It was more likely that the T-DNA inserted into a gene essential for seed development. Seeds were cleared in Hoyer's solution at different stages of development to examine the progression of embryogenesis in defective seeds and in wild-type appearing siblings from the same silique. When wild-type appearing (i.e. greening) seeds were at the torpedo stage of development (Fig. 1B), aborted seeds from the same silique (i.e. white in color) remained at the globular stage (Fig. 1F) or successfully transited to bilateral development, but had a stunted appearance (Fig. 1J). Occasionally, the aborted seeds appeared to contain an embryo arrested as early as a two-cell embryo (data not shown). The suspensor, which normally develops into a single file of cells, often exhibited abnormal divisions (Fig. 1F, arrowhead). When wild-type embryos were at an early bent cotyledon stage of development (Fig. 1C), embryo development in defective seeds ranged from globular (Fig. 1G) to a somewhat abnormal early torpedo (Fig. 1K). When wild-type siblings were at later stages of development (Fig. 1, D and E), the mutant siblings were delayed and showed a variety of abnormalities. In some seeds, the cotyledons did not develop normally, and the embryo had a triangular shape (Fig. 1H). In other cases one cotyledon was somewhat developed, whereas the other was more severely stunted (Fig. 1I). In other instances, both cotyledons developed but were stunted in appearance, as was the hypocotyl (Fig. 1, L and M). Abnormal suspensor development could be observed in some aborted seeds (Fig. 1, F-I, arrowheads). In other cases, the suspensor appeared to develop (Fig. 1, J and K) and subsequently degenerate (Fig. 1, L and M) normally. In yet other seeds, the suspensor showed dramatic development and appeared to form a secondary, albeit abnormal, embryo (data not shown). Identification of the Disrupted Gene—Genetic tests were performed to assess whether a T-DNA insertion was likely to be associated with the disrupted gene responsible for the embryo lethality. The transgene included the NPTII gene that confers kanamycin resistance, allowing the ratio of kanamycin resistant to sensitive plants to be assessed to determine the likely number of T-DNA inserts. Heterozygous DBR1/dbr1 plants produced viable seeds that showed a kanamycin resistant to sensitive ratio of 2.0 to 1 (679 seedlings screened) indicative of a single T-DNA insert. In addition, seeds obtained from self-pollination of individual kanamycin-resistant plants always showed ∼25% aborted seeds, further indicating that the lesion causing the embryo lethality was likely due to the T-DNA insertion. Plants producing all kanamycin-resistant seeds were never obtained, indicating that the mutant allele could not be transmitted in the homozygous state and therefore that the penetrance of the embryo lethal phenotype was 100%. To identify the gene potentially disrupted by the T-DNA, TAIL-PCR was performed. After tertiary TAIL-PCR using T-DNA-specific and degenerate primers, an ∼500-bp product was obtained, sequenced, and used to search the Arabidopsis database. The sequence matched a region of chromosome 4 containing a gene (At4g31770) encoding a protein predicted to contain a carboxyl-terminal lariat debranching enzyme domain (amino acid residues 234-352; Pfam profile PF05011). In other organisms, this domain is always found in association with a calcineurin-like phosphoesterase domain. At4g31770 contains such a domain at the amino-terminal end (amino acid residues 1 to 229; Pfam profile PF00149). Therefore, the product encoded by At4g31770 is predicted to function in cleavage of the 2′-5′-phosphodiester branch point linkage generated during excision of introns. The gene was named AtDBR1 (for Arabidopsis thaliana Debranching enzyme 1) in accordance with the nomenclature used for other organisms (30.Kim J.W. Kim H.C. Kim G.M. Yang J.M. Boeke J.D. Nam K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3666-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 31.Chapman K.B. Boeke J.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The predicted protein is relatively conserved among eukaryotes with the Arabidopsis protein having 37-47% identity and 57-65% similarity to DBR proteins from mouse (32.Kim H.C. Kim G.M. Yang J.M. Ki J.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 11: 198-203Google Scholar), human (30.Kim J.W. Kim H.C. Kim G.M. Yang J.M. Boeke J.D. Nam K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). AtDBR1 appears to be unique within the Arabidopsis genome with no other highly homologous protein product encoded by any other gene. The gene structure of AtDBR1 consists of nine exons encoding a protein of 418 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 48.2 kDa. The T-DNA insertion in dbr1 was within the first intron. Complementation of dbr1—To confirm further that the embryo lethality was due to T-DNA insertion into At4g31770, plants heterozygous for dbr1 (T0, DBR1/dbr1) were transformed with a construct consisting of the ∼1.25-kb 5′ region encompassing the native promoter, the coding region including introns, and ∼0.57-kb 3′ region of the stop codon. This complementation construct, pCAMBIA-gAtDBR1, included a hygromycin resistance gene. T1 plants carrying both the insertion into AtDBR1 and the complementation construct were selected on germination media containing kanamycin and hygromycin. Resistant seedlings were transferred to potting mix, and subsequent generations were screened for embryo lethality. A transgenic line with a single complementation insert showed reduced embryo lethality, with an average of 6.6% aborted seeds. This was very close to that expected by Mendelian segregation for one insert at an unlinked position (i.e. 1:16). In addition, very little lethality was observed in an independent complementation line that contained multiple complementation inserts as shown in Fig. 2A (bottom). Twenty five independent transgenic lines showed reduced seed abortion, indicating partial to complete rescue of the embryo-lethal phenotype by pCAMBIA-gAtDBR1. Plants heterozygous for dbr1 were also transformed with a dexamethasone-inducible complementation construct (27.Aoyama T. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). After flowering, plants heterozygous for dbr1 and carrying the inducible complementation construct were sprayed with dexamethasone. Whereas untreated plants of the same genotype showed the expected ∼25% seed abortion (Fig. 2B), siliques from dexamethasone-treated plants contained few to no aborted seeds (Fig. 2C). Continuous treatment with dexamethasone was necessary for continued growth and development. As shown in Fig. 2D, when dexamethasone treatment was ceased on pTA-cAtDBR1 and DBR1/dbr1 plants, aborted seeds were observed at later time points. Embryo defects were observed as early as 3-4 days after cessation of dexamethasone treatment. Whereas wild-type appearing siblings were at a late torpedo to early bent cotyledon stage of development, other seeds from the same silique exhibited a variety of defects including abnormal suspensor development (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). The embryos were at an approximately globular stage upon cessation of dexamethasone treatment (data not shown). Defects were also observed when dexamethasone treatment was stopped somewhat later in development (treatment stopped when embryos were at approximately late-heart to early-torpedo stage of development). Wild-type appearing siblings were at late-bent cotyledon to maturation stage of development (Fig. 3D and data not shown), whereas aborted seeds most often appeared to have a somewhat stunted torpedo shape or triangular shape (Fig. 3E and data not shown). When dexamethasone treatment was ceased later in development, no obvious morphological defects were observed 3 days later (data not shown). Embryos from staged siliques of plants with continued dexamethasone treatment appeared normal and did not show any suspensor defects (Fig. 3, C and F). Expression Pattern of AtDBR1—To determine the expression pattern of AtDBR1 during normal growth and development, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis was performed using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers, and RNA extracted from a variety of tissues. As shown in Fig. 4, mRNA from AtDBR1 was detected in all tissue types tested, including siliques containing developing seeds. A high number of PCR cycles was necessary to detect AtDBR1 mRNA (40 cycles for AtDBR1 compared with 24 for TUB2) indicating that the level of AtDBR1 mRNA accumulation was relatively low. RNA gel blot analysis confirmed ubiquitous low level accumulation of AtDBR1 mRNA (data not shown). Functional Analysis of AtDBR1—To determine whether the gene product encoded by AtDBR1 was able to cleave 2′-5′-phosphodiester bonds, an in vitro assay was performed by using E. coli-produced AtDBR1 and a reagent derived from a multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA). msDNAs are found in some prokaryotes and consist of a DNA molecule linked to an RNA molecule via a 2′-5′-phosphodiester bond (33.Lim D.

The mechanism(s) by which NGF elicits its effects on neuronal differentiation and survival are only beginning to be understood.A majority of the neurotrophic effects of NGF are believed to be initiated by binding of NGF to the membrane receptor tyrosine kinase TrkA. NGF binding activates TrkA, which phosphorylates itself on multiple tyrosines (10.Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Binding of different signaling proteins to these phosphorylated tyrosines initiates multiple signaling pathways. Several of these TrkA-binding proteins and/or their downstream effector proteins have been implicated in the regulation of neuronal differentiation and/or survival. One of the first pathways shown to be required for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells is the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. The TrkA-binding protein Shc, as well as Ras, Raf, MEK, and ERK have been implicated in neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (11.Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A.

Proteins in this subfamily have sequence similarity to the nematode homologue Daf-16, which is a downstream target of two Akt homologues in an insulin-related signaling pathway, and have been implicated in apoptosis of neuronal cells (50.Lin K.

In this paradigm, FKHR in the nucleus induces the expression of genes critical for cell death, such as the Fas ligand gene. When activated, Akt phosphorylates FKHR proteins in the nucleus, resulting in binding of FKHR proteins to 14-3-3 and subsequent export from the nucleus. This relocation of FKHR proteins to the cytoplasm functionally represses their transcriptional activity (53.Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

NGF stimulates the association of SH2-Bβ with TrkA via the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ and the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ. Mutating the critical Arg to Glu (R555E) within the SH2 domain of SH2-Bβ abolishes both the NGF-induced association of SH2-Bβ with TrkA and the tyrosyl phosphorylation of SH2-Bβ (57.Rui L. Herrington J.B. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Stable overexpression of SH2-Bβ enhances NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, whereas stable expression of SH2-Bβ(R555E) blocks NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells (57.Rui L. Herrington J.B. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10590-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cells stably expressing SH2-Bβ(R555E) do not show impaired NGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of TrkA, Shc, phospholipase C-γ, ERK1, or ERK2 (63.Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that impaired activation of these signaling proteins is not responsible for the dramatic overall impairment of neuronal differentiation. SH2-B has also been implicated in neuronal survival. Neuronal sympathetic neurons titrated with anti-SH2-B antibodies exhibit a reduced rate of survival when grown in NGF-containing medium. Similarly, transient expression of an N-terminally truncated form of SH2-B promotes degeneration of axons of sympathetic neurons in explants of superior cervical ganglia grown in the presence of NGF (58.Qian X. Riccio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the current work, we extend these earlier studies designed to determine the role of SH2-Bβ in neuronal differentiation and survival by examining the hypothesis that SH2-Bβ positively regulates NGF-induced activation of the protein kinase Akt and its downstream targets.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Parental PC12 cells were obtained from Dr. Ben Margolis (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) or ATCC.

Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a prominent mediator in silicosis. Silica induction of apoptosis in macrophages might be mediated by TNFα. However, TNFα also activates signal transduction pathways (NF-κB and AP-1) that rescue cells from apoptosis. Therefore, we studied the TNFα-mediated mechanisms that confer macrophage protection against the pro-apoptotic effects of silica. We will show that exposure to silica induced TNFα production by RAW 264.7 cells, but not by IC-21. Silica-induced activation of NF-κB and AP-1 was only observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages. ERK activation in response to silica exposure was only observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages, whereas activation of p38 phosphorylation was predominantly observed in IC-21 macrophages. No changes in JNK activity were observed in either cell line in response to silica exposure. Silica induced apoptosis in both macrophage cell lines, but the induction of apoptosis was significantly larger in IC-21 cells. Protection against apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells in response to silica was mediated by enhanced NF-κB activation and ERK-mediated phosphorylation of the p55 TNFα receptor. Inhibition of these two protective mechanisms by specific pharmacological inhibitors or transfection of dominant negative mutants that inhibit IκBα or ERK phosphorylation significantly increased silica-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 macrophages.

In addition, the number of apoptotic cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from silica-treated rats is significantly higher than in control-treated animals (16.Lim Y. Kim J.H. Kim K.A. Chang H.S.

The importance of TNFα-mediated signal transduction and in particular the role of NF-κB and AP-1 activation in silica-induced apoptosis in macrophages is not completely understood. TNFα induces AP-1 activation via phosphorylation and activation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Stimulation of mouse macrophages with TNFα rapidly promotes activation of specific members of the ERK, JNK, and p38 subfamilies of MAPKs (17.Winston B.W. Lange-Carter C.A. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L.

Endotracheal instillation of silica in C57BL/6, but not in TNF receptor-deficient mice, is followed by AP-1 activation in the lung (10.Ortiz L.A. Lasky J. Gozal E. Ruiz V. Lungarella G. Cavarra E. Brody A.R. Friedman M. Pardo A. Selman M. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 244-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that TNF receptors play an important role in regulating AP-1 activation in response to silica. However, the role that specific members of the MAPK family play during silica-induced AP-1 activity is not completely understood. Engagement of the p55 receptor by the TNFα ligand is followed by ERK activation in murine macrophages (21.Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activated ERK2 (p42) is then recruited to the membrane proximal region of the p55 receptor where it induces phosphorylation at ERK consensus sites (22.Van Linden A.A. Cottin V. Leu C. Riches D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6996-7003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p55 is accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum where it recruits Bcl-2 and protects against apoptosis (21.Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 17252-17260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whether or not ERK-mediated phosphorylation of p55 receptor occurs in macrophages in response to silica is unknown. TNFα production by mouse macrophage cell lines in response to silica exposure is not universal (24.Claudio E. Segade F. Wrobel K. Ramos S. Lazo P.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 cells constitute a macrophage cell line derived from BALB/c mice that react to silica exposure with enhanced TNFα production (24.Claudio E. Segade F. Wrobel K. Ramos S. Lazo P.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, macrophages from the IC-21 mouse cell line (derived from C57BL/6 mice) do not stimulate TNFα production upon exposure to silica (24.Claudio E. Segade F. Wrobel K. Ramos S. Lazo P.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These differences are important as the expression of TNFα correlates with the mouse strain sensitivity to silica, and we reported that mice from both C57BL/6 and BALB/c strains enhance TNFα production and undergo silica-induced lung injury (9.Ortiz L.A. Lasky J. Lungarella G. Cavarra E. Martorana P. Banks W.A. Peschon J.J. Schmidts H.L. Brody A.R. Friedman M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore, we took advantage of the difference in TNFα production by these macrophage cell lines to study the role that TNFα-mediated activation of NF-κB and MAPKs plays on the protection of macrophages against silica-induced apoptosis. In particular, we investigated the importance of ERK-mediated phosphorylation of p55 TNF receptor in protecting macrophages from silica-induced apoptosis. Materials—Crystalline silica (α-quartz, average size, 1.7 μm) was obtained from U.S. Silica Co. (Berkeley Springs, WV). These particles were sterilized at 200 °C for 16 h to inactivate endotoxin contamination. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO). Goat polyclonal anti-TNFR1 (p55) (sc-1069), anti-TNFR2 (p75) (sc-1074), anti-TRADD (sc-1164), anti-p-Bcl-2 (sc-16323), rabbit polyclonal anti-ERK1 (sc-94), anti-TRAF1 (sc-874), anti-TRAF2 (sc-876), anti-Bcl-2 (sc-783), goat polyclonal anti-hamster IgG peroxidase-conjugated, anti-p65 (sc-372x) NFκB subunits, and anti c-jun/AP1 (sc-44x) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PhosphoPlus SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and PhosphoPlus p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody kits for detection of total and phosphorylated SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPKs, and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Hamster monoclonal anti-mouse TNFR1 (p55) antibody (clone 55R-286), propidium iodide staining and Annexin V-FITC were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). The hamster monoclonal anti-mouse TNFR2 (p75) antibody (clone TR75–32) was purchased from Genzyme Diagnostic (Cambridge, MA). The rabbit polyclonal anti-goat IgG peroxidase-conjugated was obtained from DAKO (Carpenteria, CA). The compounds BAY 11-7085, SB 203580, PD 98059, and 5-iodotubercidin were purchased from BIOMOL Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and stored in aliquots at –70 °C. Cell Lines and Cultures—RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB 71) and IC-21 (ATCC TIB 186) murine macrophage cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). RAW 264.7 and IC-21 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Rockville, MD), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. In all experiments cells were grown to 80% confluence in the media described above. Assay of TNFα Production by Macrophages—Cells were plated in 6-well plates and grown for 3 days. Cells (∼2 × 106cells/well) were exposed to crystalline silica (10 μg/cm2) for 6 h in triplicate. Untreated cells and cells stimulated with LPS (4 μg/ml) were used as negative and positive control, respectively. Following silica exposure, TNFα was assayed in cell-free supernatants with the use of an ELISA kit (Mouse ELISA TNF, Endogen, Woburn, MA) following manufacturer's recommendations. 10 pg/ml was identified as the lower concentration of TNFα detectable with the use of this kit. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from silica (10, 20, or 50 μg/cm2 for 6 h) or control-treated macrophages using the Ultraspec RNA Isolation System (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cell RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel. RNA was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ImmobilonNy+, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and hybridized overnight at 62 °C to the following [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes: 1.101-kb murine TNFα (pMuTNF, ATCC) (25.Pennica D. Hayflick J.S. Bringman T.S. Palladino M.A. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6060-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and murine 36B4 cDNA were provided by Dr. J. A. Lasky (Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, LA). Membranes were probed first for TNFα, then stripped and reprobed for 36B4, as a loading control. Blots were developed after 72 h using Biomax films and intensifying screens (Kodak). To quantitate mRNA abundance, membranes were exposed to a Fuji phosphorimaging device (Fujix BAS 1000, Fuji USA, Standford, CT) plate overnight and scanned. Quantitative analysis was determined with the use of McBAS 2.5 software (Fuji USA). For each mRNA band the results were normalized to the internal control (36B4) and expressed as a -fold increase between the bands for the control and the bands for the silica-treated cells. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Cells were cultured in 6-well plates as described above. Following exposure to silica (10, 20, or 50 μg/cm2) for 6 h, cells were scraped in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 125 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm magnesium chloride, 0.2 mm EDTA, 12% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet-P40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were aliquoted and stored at –70 °C until use. For retardation assays, NF-κB consensus oligonucleotides 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ and 5′-GGCCAGGGAATTTCCCGGAGTA-3′; and AP-1 consensus oligonucleotide 5′-CGCTTGATGACTCAGCCGGAA-3′ were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) and purified using Sephadex G-25 columns (Mini Quick Spin Columns, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). 5 μg of protein from whole cell lysate was mixed with the labeled probe and buffer (10 mm Hepes, 7.2% (v/v) glycerol, 3 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.06% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a 20-μl total volume and incubated 50 min at room temperature to allow the binding of nuclear transcription factor to the probe. DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The gels were vacuum-dried, and labeled complexes were detected by autoradiography. Competition assays were performed using 100-fold excess of unlabeled probe. For supershift experiments, samples were preincubated with antibody to p65, p55 NFκB subunits, or anti-c-Jun before adding the labeled probe to the mixture. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and stimulated with silica or LPS (positive control) at the doses indicated for 6 h. In experiments where MAPK inhibitors were used cells were pretreated with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (1 μm), ERK inhibitor 5-iodotubercidin (5 μm), or PD 098059 (50 μm) for 1 h and 30 min before silica exposure. At the end of the treatment, cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm Na3VO4, incubated on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration of the cell lysates was determined by the Lowry method using the Bio-Rad DC Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). An equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample buffer was added, and the samples were boiled for 5 min. 50 μg of protein was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc.). Membranes were blocked in blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST)) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the relevant antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBST, blots were incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Macrophage Apoptosis by Flow Cytometry—Apoptosis was analyzed by evaluating the fluorescein-labeled annexin V binding and the exclusion of propidium iodide by macrophages, as previously described (26.Ortiz L.A. Moroz K. Liu J.Y. Hoyle G.W. Hammond T. Hamilton R.F. Holian A. Banks W. Brody A.R. Friedman M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L1208-L1218PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 12-well plates and exposed to silica (20 and 50 μg/cm2), or medium as negative control for 6 h. In some experiments cells were pre-treated with MAPK inhibitors or NFκB inhibitor BAY 11-7085 at the concentrations indicated, for 1 h and 30 min. After treatment cells were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the presence of FITC-labeled annexin V, propidium iodide, or both at the same time. Cells were then washed twice with binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2), scraped, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Vantage, BD Biosciences) with argon ion laser tuned to 488 nm. Fluorescence emission was measured through 530/30-nm band-pass (FITC) and 575/26-nm band-pass (propidium iodide) filters. Data were collected as 5000 list mode event files and analyzed using Cell-Quest software (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation of TNF Receptors—Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and grown to 80% confluence. Following exposure to silica (50 μg/cm2) for 6 h, 2 × 107 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. 1 mg of protein from total cell lysate was pre-cleared by 1-h incubation with 20 μl of protein G-agarose (for p55) or protein A-Sepharose beads (for p75) and then incubated with rotation overnight at 4 °C with 3 μg of goat polyclonal anti-TNFR1 (p55) or 10 μg of hamster monoclonal anti-TNFR2 (p75). 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (p75) or protein G-agarose (p55) beads were added to each sample and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Beads were resuspended in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Blots were incubated with hamster monoclonal anti-mouse TNFR1 (p55) or goat polyclonal anti-TNFR2 (p75) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with goat polyclonal anti-hamster IgG-peroxidase or rabbit polyclonal anti-goat IgG-peroxidase conjugated, respectively. Metabolic Labeling of Macrophages with [32P]Orthophosphate—Following pre-treatment with MEK1 (PD 098059 (30 μm)), p38 (SB 203580 (1 μm)), or ERK (5-iodotubercidin (5 μm)) inhibitor for 1 h and 30 min, RAW 264.7 and IC-21 cells were exposed to silica (20, or 50 μg/cm2) or control in the presence of inhibitors and metabolically labeled as previously described (21.Cottin V. Van Linden A. Riches D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32975-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Gels were vacuum-dried, and radiolabeled receptors were detected by autoradiography. Transfection of RAW 264.7 Macrophages with Dominant Negative IκB and ERK Mutants—To determine the biological specificity of the results observed in RAW 264.7 macrophages with the use of the kinase inhibitors on the silica-induced apoptosis, we transfected these cells with constructs expressing dominant negative IκBα and ERK mutants. The adenoviral vector directing the expression of dnIκBα, in which serines 32 and 36 have been mutated to alanine and a triple influenza hemagglutinin tag added at its 5′-end, has been described previously (27.Iimuro Y.

Iimuro Y. Didonato J. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA insert of plasmid pRc/CMV-IκBαS32A/S36A, which contains a hemagglutinin-tagged human super-repressor of NF-κB, was subcloned into the Xbal site of the pACCMV.PLPASR(+) plasmid to construct the plasmid pACCMV/IκB, in which IκBα is driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer. The adenovirus encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein gene under a CMV promoter (AdEGFP) was used as a control (29.Takahashi Y. Ganster R.W. Gambotto A. Shao L. Kaizu T. Wu T. Yagnik G.P. Nakao A. Tsoulfas G. Ishikawa T. Okuda T. Geller D.A. Murase N. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G1175-G1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Dominant negative ERK1 (Lys71 → Arg) and ERK2 (Lys52 → Arg) mutants each cloned in pCEP4 vector were obtained from Dr. Melanie Cobb and have been previously described (30.Robbins D.J. Zhen E. Owaki H. Vanderbilt C.A. Ebert D. Geppert T.D. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5097-5106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) 1 and 2 and the respective mutants were expressed in bacteria with a hexahistidine tag and purified using nickel-chelate chromatography. Basal activity of wild type ERK2 was ∼2 nmol/min/mg. Self-catalyzed phosphorylation occurred in vitro on the major physiological site of tyrosine phosphorylation in an intramolecular reaction. Rabbit muscle ERK activator activated ERK2 500- to 1000-fold up to a specific activity (∼2 μmol/min/mg) approximating that of ERK1 purified from stimulated cells (31.Boulton T.G. Gregory J.S. Cobb M.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The ERK activator to the same extent could also activate ERK1. These ERK mutants lack the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation, are autophosphorylated at a greatly reduced rate, and are no longer activated by the ERK kinase. 1.5 × 105 cells/well were plated in 12-well plates and grown for 24 h as described above. Cells were infected with adenoviral vectors (4 × 109 viral particles/well) or transfected with 1 μg of DNA using GeneJuice transfection reagent following manufacturer's recommendations (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Novagen brand, Madison, WI). 48 h later, cells were exposed to silica or medium alone for 6 h as described above. After 6 h, cells were harvested for Western blot or flow cytometry studies as described above. Statistical Analysis—Experiments were performed in triplicates. Results are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance (Statview 4; Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA) of variance followed by a Student-Neuman-Keuls test for post-hoc pairwise comparisons. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Silica Induces TNFα Production in RAW 264.7, but Not in IC-21, Macrophages—Previous studies have established that the phagocytosis of silica particles by macrophages induces TNFα production (32.Oberdorster G. Ann. Occup. Hyg. 1994; 38 (601–615): 421-422Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the ability of macrophages to secrete TNFα in response to silica is not universally observed and Claudio and associates (24.Claudio E. Segade F. Wrobel K. Ramos S. Lazo P.S. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1995; 13: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that different macrophage cell lines respond to silica with variable TNFα production. Therefore, we studied the differences in TNFα production in two macrophage cell lines in response to in vitro silica exposure. TNFα mRNA expression was studied by Northern analysis in RAW 264.7 and IC-21 macrophages after 6 h exposure to silica (10 μg/cm2), LPS (4 μg/ml), or control media. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, exposure of RAW 264.7 cells to LPS or silica resulted in significant (p < 0.001) increases in TNFα mRNA expression compared with unstimulated controls. In contrast, IC-21 macrophages did not significantly increase (p > 0.2) TNFα mRNA expression in response to silica, although they demonstrated significant (p < 0.02) TNFα mRNA expression in response to LPS stimulation. The secretion of TNFα (measured by ELISA in picograms/ml) by the RAW 264.7 and IC-21 macrophage cell lines paralleled the results of the TNFα mRNA levels following silica, LPS, or control media exposure (Fig. 1B). RAW 264.7 cells secreted significant (p < 0.001) amounts of TNFα in response to LPS (6660 ± 206 pg/ml) or silica (528 ± 77 pg/ml) when compared with unstimulated cells (44 ± 12"
https://openalex.org/W2021842690,"The genome of Clostridium acetobutylicum 824 contains two genes encoding NAD+, Mn2+, and dithiothreitol-dependent phospho-α-glucosidases that can be assigned to family 4 of the glycosylhydrolase superfamily. The two genes, designated malh (maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase) and pagl (phospho-α-glucosidase), respectively, reside in separate operons that also encode proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent:sugar phosphotransferase system. C. acetobutylicum grows on a variety of α-linked glucosides, including maltose, methyl-α-d-glucoside, and the five isomers of sucrose. In the presence of the requisite cofactors, extracts of these cells readily hydrolyzed the chromogenic substrate p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate, but whether hydrolysis reflected expression of enzymes encoded by the malh or pagl genes was not discernible by spectrophotometric analysis or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Resolution of this question required the cloning of the malh and pagl genes, and subsequent high expression, purification, and characterization of maltose-6′-phosphate hydrolase (MalH) and phospho-α-glucosidase (PagL), respectively. MalH and PagL exhibit 50% residue identity, and in solution are tetramers comprising similar sized (∼50 kDa) subunits. The two proteins cross-react with polyclonal rabbit antibody against phospho-α-glucosidase from Fusobacterium mortiferum. Purified MalH and PagL cleaved p-nitrophenyl-α-d-glucopyranoside 6-phosphate with comparable efficiency, but only MalH catalyzed the hydrolysis of disaccharide 6′-phosphates formed via the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent:sugar phosphotransferase system. Importantly, analysis of the proteome of C. acetobutylicum 824 by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry confirmed expression of MalH during growth on many α-glucosides tested. Site-directed changes C169S and D170N yielded full-length, but catalytically inactive MalH. Of the two putative operons, our findings suggest that only proteins encoded by the mal operon participate in the dissimilation of maltose and related O-α-linked glucosides by C. acetobutylicum 824.

For almost a century, and to varying extent, Clostridium acetobutylicum has been used for the industrial production of the organic solvents acetone and butanol (for historical reviews and current developments, see Refs. 1.Jones D.T.

C. acetobutylicum has the capacity to metabolize a variety of carbohydrates, but starch, being inexpensive and readily available, is an industrially attractive source for microbial fermentation (3.Mitchell W.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 31-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Mitchell W.J. Albasheri K.A. Yazdanian M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 317-329Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Prior to its metabolism by C. acetobutylicum, starch is first hydrolyzed by amylolytic enzymes (3.Mitchell W.J. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 31-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to yield primarily maltose (4-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucopyranose). However, as emphasized by Tangney et al. (6.Tangney M. Winters G.T. Mitchell W.J. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 27: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), surprisingly little is known of the mechanism(s) by which this O-α-linked disaccharide is transported into, and subsequently hydrolyzed within, the cell. Hydrolysis of the glycosidic bond is catalyzed by a vast array of O-glycosyl hydrolases (EC 3.2.1.-), and substrate cleavage may be accompanied by either retention or inversion of configuration at the anomeric (C1) center (7.Davies G.

Biol. 2000; 4: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). An extremely helpful classification of these diverse and widespread enzymes has been developed during the past decade by Henrissat and associates (9.Henrissat B. Biochem.

This classification scheme is based on amino acid sequence similarity, and presently includes 91 distinct families that comprise the glycosylhydrolase superfamily of enzymes. 1P. M. Coutinho and B.

The GHF4 enzymes have received considerable attention, in part, because members of this unique family are distinguished from all others by their requirements for reducing agent, divalent metal ion (Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, or Fe2+) and dinucleotide (NAD+) for activity. Whether these cofactors function in a catalytic or structural capacity in GHF4 enzymes has yet to be established (14.Thompson J. Pikis A. Ruvinov S.B. Henrissat B. Yamamoto H. Sekiguchi J. J. Biol.

Our interest in maltose dissimilation by C. acetobutylicum 824 began in 1999 (see Fig. 2 of Ref. 16.Thompson J. Ruvinov S.B. Freedberg D.I. Hall B.G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7339-7345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), by the finding that the (then partially sequenced) genome of this organism contained two genes for which the deduced open reading frames exhibited extensive homology with an NAD+ and metal-dependent GHF4 phospho-α-glucosidase that we had found in several bacterial species, including Bacillus subtilis (14.Thompson J.

Hall B.G. Pikis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37415-37425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For purposes of distinction, we refer to the two putative phospho-α-glucosidases in C. acetobutylicum 824 as MalH (maltose 6-phosphate hydrolase) and PagL (phospho-α-glucosidase), respectively. Completion of the C. acetobutylicum genome sequence in 2001 (4.Nölling J. Breton G. Omelchenko M.V. Makarova K.S. Zeng Q. Gibson R. Lee H.M. Dubois J. Qui D. Hitti J. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4823-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar) revealed that the malh and pagl genes were located in separate operons (see Fig. 1) that also encoded components of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar:phosphotransferase system (PEP-PTS, Refs. 25.Reizer J.

Biotechnol. 2001; 27: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) established the PEP-PTS-catalyzed phosphorylation of maltose (4-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucopyranose) by cells of C. acetobutylicum grown previously on this disaccharide. Experiments in our laboratory also confirmed phospho-α-glucosidase activity, not only in maltose-grown cells of C. acetobutylicum, but also in organisms grown previously on a variety of α-d-glucosides, including maltitol, methyl-α-d-glucoside, and the five α-d-glucosyl-d-fructose isomers of sucrose (28.Lichtenthaler F.W. Rönninger S. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1990; 2: 1489-1497Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29.Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr.

Two approaches were adopted in an attempt to resolve these questions. First, malh and pagl genes were cloned in high expression vectors, the enzymes were purified, and their substrate specificities were determined. As we show in this report, the similarity of the physical properties of MalH and PagL (e.g. molecular size, oligomeric structure, pI, and antibody cross-reactivity) precluded the separation and independent assay of the two enzymes in cell extracts, by either spectrophotometric or electrophoretic methods. Consequently, in a second approach, we used ESI/MS analysis of the microbial proteome to unequivocally identify the phospho-α-glucosidase species induced by growth of C. acetobutylicum on different α-glucosides. The five isomers of sucrose were obtained from the following sources: maltulose was from TCI America, leucrose was from Fluka; palatinose was from Wako Chemicals; trehalulose syrup and crystalline forms were generously provided by Südzucker (Mannheim/Ochsenfurt, Germany), and Mitsui Sugar Co. (Kanagawa, Japan), respectively. Turanose and other high purity sugars, including glucose, sucrose (1-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-β-d-fructofuranoside), and maltose were purchased from Pfanstiehl Laboratories. NADP+, NAD+ and its analogs, DEAE-TrisAcryl M anion-exchanger, Ultrogels AcA 54 (exclusion limit 90 kDa) and AcA 44 (exclusion limit 200 kDa), p-nitrophenyl-α-d- and -β-d-glucopyranosides (pNPα/βGlc), 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-d-glucopyranoside (4MUαGlc), and other reagents were obtained from Sigma. 5′-AMP Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH; EC 1.1.1.49) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The phosphorylated chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates (pNPαGlc6P and 4MUαGlc6P, respectively) were prepared by selective phosphorylation of the parent compounds (at C6-OH) with phosphorus oxychloride in trimethyl phosphate containing small proportions of water (13.Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated α-linked disaccharides, including sucrose 6-phosphate (sucrose-6P) and its five isomeric -6′P derivatives were prepared as described previously (29.Thompson J. Robrish S.A. Pikis A. Brust A. Lichtenthaler F.W. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 331: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated β-linked disaccharides, including 4-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucopyranose 6′-phosphate (cellobiose-6′P) and 6-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-d-glucopyranose 6′-phosphate (gentiobiose-6′P), were prepared by phosphorylation of the parent compounds with purified ATP-dependent β-glucoside kinase (EC 2.7.1.85) from K. pneumoniae (30.Thompson J. Lichtenthaler F.W. Peters S. Pikis A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34310-34321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Polyclonal rabbit antibody raised against purified phospho-α-glucosidase (MalH) from F. mortiferum was prepared by Covance Research Products. C. acetobutylicum 824 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA), and the organism was maintained anaerobically (GasPaK, BBL) at 37 °C by serial transfer in reinforced clostridial medium (RCM, Oxoid, Ltd.). For growth of the organism in batch culture (1 liter volume), we used the synthetic medium of Monot et al. (31.Monot F. Martin J.-R. Petitdemange H. Gay R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1982; 44: 1318-1324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with 1% (w/v) desired carbohydrate. The medium (pH 6.8) was filter-sterilized and transferred immediately to an anaerobic chamber for 24 h prior to inoculation with 0.05% (v/v) freshly grown RCM culture. After growth to stationary phase, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C) and washed twice by resuspension, and centrifugation, from 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm NAD+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (designated TMND buffer). The average yield was ∼2 g wet weight of cells/liter of culture. Washed cells were resuspended in 2.5 volumes of TMND buffer to yield a homogeneous thick suspension of cells. Lysozyme (0.6 mg) was added to 3-ml volumes of each cell suspension, and the preparations were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The organisms were disrupted (six 15-s periods of sonic oscillation, at 0 °C) in a Branson model 185 fine probe sonifier, and the samples were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 rpm for 30 min at 5 °C) in an Eppendorf bench top centrifuge model 5417R). The supernatant fluids, containing 25-30 mg of protein ml-1, were removed for enzyme assays and for the SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and activity stain experiments presented in Fig. 6. Based on the complete genome sequence of C. acetobutylicum 824 (4.Nölling J. Breton G. Omelchenko M.V. Makarova K.S. Zeng Q. Gibson R. Lee H.M. Dubois J. Qui D. Hitti J. Wolf Y.I. Tatusov R.L. Sabathe F. Doucette-Stamm L. Soucaille P. Daly M.J. Bennett G.N. Koonin E.V. Smith D.R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4823-4838Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), the following pairs of primers were designed to amplify the genes malh and pagl, respectively. For amplification of malh, the forward primer was 5′-GGGCCCCATGGGCATGAAAAAATTTTCAGTTGTAATAGCAGG-3′ (the malh sequence is in boldface, and the NcoI site is underlined) and reverse primer was 5′-CCCGGGCTGCAGTTATTAA TTTAATTCTGGCCAGTAATC-3′ (the sequence complimentary to the downstream region of malh is in bold face, and the PstI site is underlined). For amplification of pagl, the forward primer was 5′-GGGCCCCATGGGCATGAAAAAGTATTCAATTTGTATTGTTGG-3′ (the pagl sequence is in boldface, and the NcoI site is underlined) and reverse primer was 5′-CCCGGGGAATTCTTATTAATGAAGTTCATTCCAATAACC-3′ (the sequence complimentary to the downstream region of pagl is in boldface, and the EcoRI site is underlined). The malh and pagl genes were amplified by the high fidelity Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The components of the amplification mixtures (100 μl) were as follows: 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase, 1× reaction buffer provided by the manufacturer, 20 mm each of the four DNTPs, 250 ng of each primer, and 100 ng of DNA. Amplifications were carried out in a thermal cycler (GeneAmp PCR System 9700, PE Applied Biosystems). After an initial 2-min incubation at 95 °C, the mixtures were subjected to 30 cycles of amplification under the following conditions: denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min; annealing at 50 °C, 1 min; and extension at 72 °C for 2 min/kilobase of insert. These procedures were followed by a 10-min run-off at 72 °C. The amplicons were digested with restriction endonucleases (malh was digested with NcoI and PstI; pagl with NcoI and EcoRI), electrophoresed in 1% agarose, and purified (QIAquick gel extraction kit). The purified ∼1.3-kb DNA fragments were ligated to the similarly digested (and purified) high expression vector pTrcHis2B to form the two recombinant plasmids pTrcHis2Bmalh and pTrcHis2Bpagl, respectively. In these constructs, malh and pagl are under control of the trc promoter, which is also regulated by the lacO operator and the product of the laclq gene. Expression of the products of malh and pgll are induced in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Recombinant plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli PEP 43 by electroporation, and transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin. (Note that the mutant strain E. coli PEP 43 lacks all phospho-β-glucosidase activities normally resident in this organism, and this strain was generously provided by Dr. B. G. Hall, Biology Department, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY.). The role of individual amino acid residues in the CDMP motif of MalH was assessed by site-directed mutagenesis of the malh gene. This method requires the use of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase and a temperature cycler, and the appropriate reagents were obtained as the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmids of pTrcHis2Bmalh containing the desired mutations (C169S, D170N, M171V, and P172A) were introduced into cells of E. coli PEP 43 by electroporation. Verification of the relevant base changes was provided by DNA sequence analysis. Sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using modified T7 DNA polymerase and [α-35S]dATP labeling. The sequencing reagents were obtained as a kit (Sequenase version 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). The MacVector sequence analysis package (version 7.0, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) was used to assemble, edit, and analyze the results. Cells of E. coli PEP 43 containing plasmids encoding either malh or pagl genes were grown on a rotary shaker at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (150 μg/ml). At A600 nm = 0.5 units, a solution of IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued for ∼4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 10 min at 5 °C), and the organisms (∼3.1 g/liter) were washed by resuspension and centrifugation from TMND buffer. Because of their similarity in physical properties, the procedure described here for MalH was also used for the purification of PagL. Washed cells (20 g wet weight) of E. coli PEP 43, containing highly expressed MalH, were homogenized with 50 ml of TMND buffer. The organisms were disrupted (at 0 °C) by two 1.5-min periods of sonic oscillation in a Branson model 350 sonifier operating at ∼75% of maximum power, and the cell extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (180,000 × g for 2 h at 5 °C). The high speed supernatant fluid was dialyzed against 4 liters of TMND buffer in a cold room overnight. MalH was purified by chromatography in three stages by low pressure chromatography. Column flow rates were maintained by use of a P-1 peristaltic pump interfaced with a Frac-100 collector. Elution of proteins was monitored at A280 nm by a UV-1 optical control unit connected to a single-channel chart recorder. Step 1: DEAE-TrisAcryl M (Anion Exchange) Chromatography—The dialyzed solution (∼ 56 ml) was transferred at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min to a column (2.6 × 14 cm) previously equilibrated with TMND buffer. Nonadsorbed materials were removed by washing with buffer, and MalH was eluted with 500 ml of a linear, increasing concentration gradient of NaCl (0-0.2 m) in TMND buffer. Fractions of 5 ml were collected, and MalH activity was detected by the intense yellow color formed upon addition of fraction samples (5 μl) to microtiter wells containing 100 μl of pNPαGlc6P assay solution. Fractions with highest activity (fractions 37-44) were pooled and concentrated to 5.7 ml by filtration in an Amicon pressure unit (PM-10 membrane; 45 p.s.i.). Step 2: Ultrogel AcA-54 (Molecular Sieve) Chromatography—5.4 ml of concentrate from step 1 was applied at 0.3 ml/min to a column of Ultrogel AcA-54 (2.6 × 94 cm), previously equilibrated with TMND buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl. Fractions of 3 ml were collected, and those fractions with greatest activity (fractions 56-62) were pooled and concentrated to 2 ml in a 10-ml Amicon filtration cell. Analysis of this preparation by SDS-PAGE revealed one major polypeptide (mass ∼ 50 kDa) and trace amounts of three other polypeptides (mass ∼ 70-100 kDa). Step 3: Ultrogel AcA-44 (Molecular Sieve) Chromatography—The 2-ml concentrate from step 2 was applied (flow rate, 0.15 ml/min) to a column of Ultrogel AcA-44 (1.6 × 94 cm) equilibrated with the buffer solution used in step 2. Fractions of 2 ml were collected, and a single peak of enzyme activity was eluted at approximately the void volume of the column. These fractions (fractions 55-59) were concentrated to a volume of 3.8 ml containing 5.9 mg of protein/ml (specific activity 4.9 μmol of pNPαGlc6P hydrolyzed min-1 mg of protein-1). SDS-PAGE analysis of this preparation revealed a single polypeptide (MalH, mass ∼ 50 kDa). The same procedures were used for the purification of PagL. Native (nondenaturing) electrophoresis and SDS-PAGE were performed in the Novex X-Cell mini system, using reagents and conditions according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Invitrogen). In SDS-PAGE experiments, denatured samples, and Mark12™ wide range protein standards were electophoresed in precast NuPage (4-12%) BisTris gels with MES-SDS (pH 7.3) as the running buffer. Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For Western (immuno) blots, the separated proteins and SeeBlue™ molecular weight markers were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using NuPage transfer buffer (pH 7.2). Immunodetection of phospho-α-glucosidase (MalH or PagL) was achieved by sequential incubation of the membrane with polyclonal antibody to MalH from F. mortiferum and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody, as described previously (13.Thompson J. Gentry-Weeks C.R. Nguyen N.Y. Folk J.E. Robrish S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2505-2512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of cell extracts for in situ detection of enzyme activity was carried out under native (nonreducing) conditions (at ∼ 10 °C) in precast Tris-glycine (4-20%) gels. Tris-glycine (pH 8.3) supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm NAD+, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was used as the running buffer. For detection of MalH and PagL activities, the gel was immediately immersed in 30 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm fluorogenic substrate 4MUαGlc6P. After 2-5 min of incubation, the gel was photographed under long wave UV light (Ektopan (Eastman Kodak Co.) film, green filter, 2-min exposure). The activities of MalH and PagL in cell extracts, and in column fractions during enzyme purification, were measured (at 37 °C) in a discontinuous assay that contained (in 2 ml): 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm NAD+, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm pNPαGlc6P. After enzyme addition, samples of 0.25 ml were withdrawn (20-s intervals over a 2-min period) and added immediately to 0.75 ml of a solution containing 0.5 m Na2CO3 and 0.1 m EDTA to stop the reaction. The A400 nm of the solution was measured, and the rates of substrate hydrolysis (pNP formation) were calculated from the progress plots, assuming a molar extinction coefficient for the (yellow) p-nitrophenoxide anion ϵ = 18,300 m-1 cm-1. One unit of enzyme activity is the amount of MalH or PagL that catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of pNP min-1 at 37 °C. A continuous spectrophotometric assay was used in kinetic analyses, and for determination of substrate specificity of MalH and PagL with respect to hydrolysis of the 6-phospho-α- and 6-phospho-β-disaccharides. This G6PDH/NADP+-coupled assay monitors the formation of Glc6P produced upon hydrolysis of the glucoside-6P substrate(s). The standard assa"
https://openalex.org/W2037598310,"We attached peptides corresponding to the seventh transmembrane domain (TMD7) of the α-mating factor receptor (Ste2p) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a hydrophilic, 40-residue fragment of the carboxyl terminus of this G protein-coupled receptor. Peptides corresponding to (a) the 40-residue portion of the carboxyl tail (T-40), (b) the tail plus a part of TMD7 (M7-12-T40), and (c) to the tail plus the full TMD7 (M7-24-T40) were chemically synthesized and purified. The molecular mass and primary sequence of these peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry procedures. Circular dichroism (CD) revealed that T-40 was disordered in phosphate buffer and in the presence of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-racemic-(1-glycerol)] bilayers. In contrast, M7-12-T40 and M7-24-T40 peptides were partially helical in the presence of vesicles, and difference CD spectroscopy showed that the transmembrane regions of these peptides were 42 and 94% helical, respectively. CD analysis also demonstrated that M7-24-T40 retained its secondary structure in the presence of 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-racemic-(1-glycerol)] micelles at 0.5 mm concentration. Thus, the tail and the transmembrane domain of the multidomain 64-amino acid residue peptide manifest individual conformational preferences. Measurement of tryptophan fluorescence indicated that the transmembrane domain integrated into bilayers in a manner similar to that expected for this region in the native state of the receptor. This study demonstrated that the tail of Ste2p can be used as a hydrophilic template to study transmembrane domain structure using techniques such as CD and NMR spectroscopy. We attached peptides corresponding to the seventh transmembrane domain (TMD7) of the α-mating factor receptor (Ste2p) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a hydrophilic, 40-residue fragment of the carboxyl terminus of this G protein-coupled receptor. Peptides corresponding to (a) the 40-residue portion of the carboxyl tail (T-40), (b) the tail plus a part of TMD7 (M7-12-T40), and (c) to the tail plus the full TMD7 (M7-24-T40) were chemically synthesized and purified. The molecular mass and primary sequence of these peptides were confirmed by mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry procedures. Circular dichroism (CD) revealed that T-40 was disordered in phosphate buffer and in the presence of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-racemic-(1-glycerol)] bilayers. In contrast, M7-12-T40 and M7-24-T40 peptides were partially helical in the presence of vesicles, and difference CD spectroscopy showed that the transmembrane regions of these peptides were 42 and 94% helical, respectively. CD analysis also demonstrated that M7-24-T40 retained its secondary structure in the presence of 1-palmitoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-racemic-(1-glycerol)] micelles at 0.5 mm concentration. Thus, the tail and the transmembrane domain of the multidomain 64-amino acid residue peptide manifest individual conformational preferences. Measurement of tryptophan fluorescence indicated that the transmembrane domain integrated into bilayers in a manner similar to that expected for this region in the native state of the receptor. This study demonstrated that the tail of Ste2p can be used as a hydrophilic template to study transmembrane domain structure using techniques such as CD and NMR spectroscopy. The determination of the structure of G protein-coupled receptors remains an unfulfilled goal of structural biologists with the notable exception of the solution of a high resolution structure of rhodopsin by x-ray crystallography (1Palczewski K.

These membrane-bound, information-transducing proteins are acknowledged as a major family of proteins with thousands of representatives encoded by human genes (2Venter, J. C. et al.

Drug Discov. Today. 2001; 6: 884-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Because of the difficulty in obtaining refraction grade crystals of most membrane proteins and their large size, neither x-ray diffraction nor NMR approaches are readily applied to intact receptors. As a route to gain information relevant to these and other membrane proteins such as transporters, many laboratories have taken a reductionist approach and are examining relatively short peptides corresponding to loops and single transmembrane domains (TMDs; Refs. 5Albert A.D. Yeagle P.L. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 107-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Deber C.M. Liu L P. Wang C. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Naider F. Arshava B. Ding F.X. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Biopolymers. 2002; 60: 334-350Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A problem encountered in these studies is the poor solubility exhibited by TMDs that leads to difficulty in purifying and conducting biophysical investigations on these molecules. Moreover, although important insights into the conformational preferences of small regions of the receptor can be gleaned from studying discrete loops or single TMDs, such investigations do not provide information on the folding of longer regions of the protein or on domain-domain interactions. Therefore, analyses on surrogates containing more than one domain are needed.

The α-factor receptor (Ste2p) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a GPCR that, upon binding the tridecapeptide-α-factor mating pheromone, transduces a signal that results in growth arrest and gene regulation in preparation for sexual conjugation (8Dohlman H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 129-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Like other GPCRs, this 431-residue polypeptide receptor contains seven hydrophobic TMDs, with its carboxyl terminus located intracellularly (9Burkholder A.C. Hartwell L.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 8463-8475Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). TMDs play a key role in α-factor receptor activation (10Konopka J.B. Margarit M. Dube P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6764-6769Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl terminus is involved in Ste2p down-regulation by endocytosis (11Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and desensitization by phosphorylation (12Chen Q. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies on individual synthetic TMDs of Ste2p revealed that the solubility of the third and fourth TMDs was very low, and they could not be effectively purified on HPLC without solubilization by the addition of several lysine residues at both termini of the peptides (13Xie H. Ding F.X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sixth TMD of Ste2p had a high aggregation tendency in SDS-PAGE and exhibited β-structures in phospholipid bilayers as judged using CD or IR spectroscopy (13Xie H. Ding F.X. Schreiber D. Eng G. Liu S.F. Arshava B. Arevalo E. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15462-15474Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Ding F.X. Xie H. Arshava B. Becker J.M. Naider F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8945-8954Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To improve water solubility, a number of laboratories have placed solubilizing sequences at the termini of peptides predicted to represent the transmembrane domain of the membrane protein. An often used strategy is to place oligomers of lysine at these positions, and significant improvements in solubility and sample preparation have been achieved (13Xie H. Ding F.X. Schreiber D. Eng G.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5000-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in the native state Lys residues are rarely found at both ends of a transmembrane domain, and the inside-positive rule suggests a high preference for Lys and/or Arg residues on the cytoplasmic side of transmembrane domains (18von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the use of Lys residues eliminates native residues that are adjacent to the TMDs, and studies on such model peptides provide no insights into the conformational preferences of the native loop or tail residues in the context of one contiguous molecule. Recently we showed that the residues at the termini of the second transmembrane domain of Ste2p (a GPCR involved in mating) can affect the integration of this domain into the membrane and can influence the tilt angle of the peptide (19Ding F.X. Schreiber D. VerBerkmoes N.C. Becker J.M. Naider F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14483-14492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Specifically, we found that a 30-residue peptide corresponding to transmembrane domain two (TMD-2; 25 residues) plus 5 residues extending into the cytosolic compartment integrated into bilayers was highly helical and tilted at an angle of 34° to the bilayer normal. In contrast, a 30-residue peptide corresponding to the same transmembrane two plus 5 residues extending into the extracellular space did not integrate into bilayers and formed β structures. A 35-residue peptide containing the same transmembrane core and both of the above cytosolic and extracellular residues was helical with a tilt angle of 36°. It is clear that residues at the termini of transmembrane peptides influence the structure assumed by the transmembrane region, and this influence may have biological relevance. To extend our previous investigations on single TMDs we decided to explore peptides corresponding to these regions of the receptor attached to residues that contain appreciable hydrophilic tendencies. In the case of GPCRs it struck us that nature has provided two hydrophilic domains surrounding the seven-transmembrane core of these polytopic membrane proteins. We reasoned that these termini might aid in the overall folding of the receptor and, most importantly, might act as hydrophilic end groups that have evolved to allow the intact receptor to achieve its biologically active conformation. We anticipated that the combination of these hydrophilic tail residues and a hydrophobic TMD would result in a multidomain peptide with sufficient solubility to conduct conformational analyses in aqueous-organic and membrane mimetic solvents. This communication reports the synthesis and characterization of a 64-residue peptide containing 40 residues of the cytosolic carboxyl terminus and 24 residues comprising the seventh transmembrane domain of Ste2p. Our results clearly demonstrate that this multidomain peptide exhibits distinct conformational preferences for the TMD and tail residues. The use of such hydrophilic appendages may enable the study of multiple transmembrane domains of GPCRs under membrane mimetic conditions. Such high resolution analyses should provide important information on the three-dimensional structure of a large region of Ste2p. Peptides T40 (NNASKTNTITSDFTTSTDRFYPGTLSSFQTDSINNDAKSS), M7-12-T40, and M7-24-T40 (for sequences and position in Ste2p see Table I and Fig. 1) were synthesized on a Wang resin using N-α-Fmoc protection and a standard HBTU/HOBt activation strategy. These three peptides were obtained from one continuous synthesis of the 64-residue M7-24-T40 by withdrawing a portion of the resin at the appropriate point of synthesis for T40 and M7-12-T40. The carboxylterminal Fmoc-Ser(butyl)-OH was loaded manually on a hydroxymethyl resin (Wang resin, 0.4 mmol/g substitution) using the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide/4-N,N′-dimethylaminopyridine strategy in dichloromethane to obtain a resin with only 0.15 mmol/g of Fmoc amino acid substitution. The unreacted OH groups on the resin were capped using a 100-fold excess of acetic anhydride in the presence of 4-N,N′-dimethylaminopyridine. The subsequent three amino acids were coupled manually using HBTU/HOBt/diisopropylethylamine for activation to obtain Fmoc-Ala-Lys(t-butoxycarbonyl)-Ser(butyl)-Ser(butyl) resin. The elongation of the peptide chain was then carried out on a solid phase peptide synthesizer (Model 433A, Applied Biosystems). The coupling strategy utilized FastMoc chemistry with extended coupling times. Double coupling was carried out for each residue using HBTU/HOBt activation, and capping was accomplished with acetic anhydride in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. For comparison purposes the peptide M7–24 (VLTTVATLLAVLSLPLSSMWATAA) was synthesized on a preloaded Fmoc-Ala-Wang resin with 0.7 mmol/g substitution. Single coupling with HBTU/HOBt activation was used for the first 12 amino acid additions, and double coupling was carried to the completion of the synthesis. Capping was accomplished as above. Resin weight gain was 60–70% relative to theoretical.Table INomenclature, sequences, and estimation of helical contents for peptides corresponding to the seventh transmembrane domain of Ste2p in the presence of DMPC/DMPG (4:1) bilayersPeptidesSequencesHelicities%M7-12-T40SLPLSSMWATAANNASKTNTITSDFTTSTDRFYPGTLSSFQTDSINNDAKSS11M7-24-T40VLTTVATLLAVLSLPLSSMWATAANNASKTNTITSDFTTSTDRFYPGTLSSFQTDSINNDAKSS36M7–12aThe percent helicity of this region of Ste2p was calculated using CD data from Fig. 4B and the methods described in Wu et al.

The yields of the crude peptides were 60–70% based on the resin weight gain, and overall, the yields of the syntheses were 40–50% based on the loading of the resin. Crude peptides were purified on a semi-preparative μBondapak C18 (Waters) HPLC column (19 × 300 mm) at room temperature with elution solvents of water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at gradients from 10 to 80% acetonitrile over 90–120 min (T40, M7-12-T40, and M7-24-T40) or a gradient from 40 to 70% acetonitrile over 90 min (M7–24). In general 20 mg of crude peptide was dissolved in 2 ml of a solvent consisting of TFE/H2O and injected directly onto the column. Fractions were collected, and homogeneity was judged by analytical reverse phase HPLC on a μBondapak C18 column (3.9 × 300 mm) with linear gradients of water (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid)-acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The purity and amino acid sequence of peptides were evaluated using electrospray mass spectrometry (Thermo Finnigan LCQ DECA). All peptides were dissolved from a lyophilized powder directly into electrospray solvent (H2O/acetonitrile/acetic acid 50:50:1) and directly infused into an electrospray source (Thermo Finnigan) at 3 μl/min. The electrospray source was held at 4.5 kV, and the heated capillary was set at 125 °C. A total of 200 microscans were acquired and averaged for each peptide. Intact molecular masses for all peptides were obtained by deconvolution with the Bioworks software package (Thermo Finnigan). To confirm the correct primary sequence, tryptic digestion and cyanogen bromide digestion were performed on the largest peptide (M7-24-T40) followed by MS/MS on the resultant peptide fragments. M7-24-T40 peptide was first digested with trypsin (Promega), sequencing grade, 1:50 enzyme to peptide ratio following the manufacture's protocol for 12 h at 37 °C, desalted with a C18 ZipTip (Millipore), and directly infused into the electrospray source at 3 μl/min. The resultant peptides were analyzed by normal MS followed by zoom scans (scan width 10 m/z, 200 microscans acquired and averaged). To determine the correct monoisotopic molecular masses MS/MS was performed on all peaks above s/n to obtain sequence information (isolation width 3 m/z, normalized collision energy 35%, 200 microscans acquired and averaged). Fragment ions from a large portion of the amino terminus were not verified from the tryptic digestion experiment. To address this, a CNBr digest was performed on a separate aliquot of the M7-24-T40 peptide. The M7-24-T40 lyophilized peptide was directly dissolved in 70% formic acid and digested with 1 m CNBr (Sigma) for 12 h in the dark at room temperature. The sample was repeatedly dried in a Spin Vac (Savant Instruments) and resuspended in HPLC grade H2O to remove excess CNBr. The sample was then resuspended in electrospray solvent, and the resultant amino-terminal peptide fragment (residues 1–19) was analyzed for intact monoisotopic mass. MS/MS was performed to verify sequence information. CD Samples in TFE/H2O—T40 (1.4 mg) and M7-24-T40 (0.83 mg) were dissolved in 0.29 ml of H2O and 0.2 ml of TFE/H2O (4:1) to obtain a stock solution of T40 and M7-24-T40, respectively. In all cases the peptides were first dissolved in 100% TFE and water was added to give the final ratio of solvents. All solvent ratios in this manuscript are volume to volume. The concentrations of stock solution were determined to be 0.82 and 0.42 mm, respectively, by measuring the UV absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1340 m-1 cm-1 for the single tyrosine in T40 and 6890 m-1 cm-1 for a tyrosine and a tryptophan residue in M7-24-T40. Five aliquots of 20 μl of each stock solution were diluted to 0.4 ml with the appropriate amount of TFE and H2O to obtain 41 μm T40 and 21 μm M7-24-T40 solutions in 95, 75, 50, 25, and 5% TFE/H2O. Solutions of M7–24 (41 μm) used for CD analysis in TFE/H2O were prepared in an identical manner. Peptide concentrations determined using UV spectroscopy were about 37 μm, which was about 90% of the concentration calculated based on sample weight. CD Samples in DMPC/DMPG (4:1) Vesicles—Peptides (0.58 mg of T40, 0.72 mg of T40-M7–12, and 0.86 mg of M7-24-T40 in 0.15 ml TFE/H2O) were added to 8 mg of DMPC/DMPG (4:1) in 1 ml of CHCl3. The resulting solutions were dried under N2 flow. Residual traces of organic solvent were removed by placing the dried film under vacuum overnight, and the lipid was then suspended in 2 ml of 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. The suspension was sonicated at ∼50 °C for 60 min in a Misonix Inc. W-385 sonicator equipped with a cup horn (40% output power). The vesicle solution was exhaustively dialyzed against 600 ml of 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, three times. The resulting vesicles were then passed through a 0.45-μm polycarbonate centrifugal filter. The concentrations of T40, M7-12-T40, and M7-24-T40 in the final preparations were determined by UV to be 50, 41, and 30 μm, respectively. CD Samples in Micelles—M7-24-T40 (0.93 mg) and T40 (0.65 mg) were dissolved in 1 ml TFE/water (1:1). The concentrations of M7-24-T40 and T40 were determined to be 97 and 109 μm, respectively, by UV spectroscopy. Aliquots (51.5 μl) of M7-24-T40 were added to three vials, and the solutions in these vials along with the remaining stock solution were lyophilized overnight. Then 100 μl of MPG, PPG, and SPG (4 mg/ml) in 0.1 mm phosphate solution were added to the former three vials, respectively, to provide 50 μm peptide concentration, and 164 μlof the same PPG solution was added to the last vial to obtain a peptide concentration of 500 μm. Similarly, 50 μm solutions of T40 in MPG, PPG, and SPG (4 mg/ml), a 500 μm solution of T40 in PPG (4 mg/ml), and 50 μm and 500 μm solutions of M7–24 in PPG were also prepared. Fluorescence Samples—M7-24-T40 (1.4 ml of 30 μm), M7-12-T40 (1.1 ml of 41 μm), and T40 (0.92 ml of 50 μm) in DMPC/DMPG (4:1) vesicles (4 mg/ml) were diluted to 20 ml with 0.1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3, DMPC/DMPG (4:1) vesicle solution to obtain 2.3 μm peptides and 0.3 mg/ml DMPC/DMPG (4:1) solutions for fluorescence emission measurements. Appropriate blank solutions were prepared similarly starting with 4 mg/ml of DMPC/DMPG (4:1) vesicles. For fluorescence quenching measurements, 2.5 ml of the solutions used for the fluorescence measurements were further diluted to 10 ml to obtain 0.58 μm peptides in 0.075 mg/ml DMPC/DMPG (4:1) vesicles. The CD spectra of the peptides were recorded on an AVIV model 62-DS CD instrument (AVIV Associates, Lakewood, NJ). Two cuvettes with light path lengths of 0.2 and 0.1 mm were used for peptides in lipids (4 mg/ml) with concentrations of 30–50 and 500 μm, respectively. A cuvette of 1-mm light path length was used for peptides in TFE solution. All spectra were the average of five scans between 260 and 190 nm at an interval of 1 nm with a 1-s integration time at each wavelength. The bandwidth for each measurement was 1 nm. Before calculation of the final ellipticity, all spectra were corrected by subtracting the reference spectra of 4 mg/ml lipids of DMPC/DMPG (4:1), MPG, PPG, and SPG without peptides or 4–95% TFE/H2O, respectively. CD intensities are expressed as mean residue ellipticities (degrees cm2/dmol). Assuming that the transmembrane and tail portions of M7-24-T40 behaved independently, we estimated the mean residue ellipticity of the 24 transmembrane residues of this peptide using the following equation.[θ]M7-24={([θ]M7-24-T40×64)-([θ]T40×40)}/24(Eq. 1) Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a photo-counting Fluoromax-3 (Jobin Yvon Horiba, Spex Fluorescence Division) equipped with a 1 × 1 × 3.4-cm quartz cuvette with a 2.6-ml sample volume. The emission spectra were scanned between 300 to 420 nm with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm at intervals of 1 nm with a 1-s integration time at each wavelength. Both the excitation and emission bandwidths were set to 3 nm. The fluorescence due to the transmembrane parts of M7–24 and M7–12 were obtained by subtracting the spectra of T40 in vesicles from those of M7-24-T40 and M7-12-T40 in vesicles. Collisional Quenching Experiments—Fluorescence collisional quenching experiments with iodide were performed by adding an increasing amount of a 4 m KI solution in phosphate buffer (0.1 mm, pH 6.3) to a solution of the peptide under investigation to bring the final concentration of KI to 60.6 mm. Changes in fluorescence of the transmembrane region due to the addition of quencher were corrected by subtracting the fluorescence measured in parallel on T40 in a DMPC/DMPG (4:1) vesicle control. The quenching of the fluorescence intensities at maximum emission were calculated with the Stern-Volmer equation,F0/F=1+Ksv[I-](Eq. 2) where F0/F is the ratio of fluorescence intensities in the presence of KCl and KI. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant Ksv was determined from the slope of F0/F as a function of the iodide concentration [I-]. Peptides corresponding to the 40-residue portion of the carboxyl tail (T40), a 52-residue peptide (M7-12-T40) containing the tail portion plus half of the seventh transmembrane domain (12 residues), and a 64-residue peptide (M7-24-T40) corresponding to the 40-residue carboxyl portion of the tail plus the entire seventh transmembrane domain (24 residues) were synthesized using solid phase peptide chemistry. The sequences of these peptides are listed in Table I and represented in Fig. 1 with T40 denoting the 40-residue carboxyl terminus portion corresponding to the sequence from 300 to 339 of Ste2p. M7 represents the seventh transmembrane domain, and the number after M7 represents the chain length of the transmembrane peptide fragment attached to T40. For comparison purposes transmembrane fragment M7–24 was also synthesized. Solid-phase peptide synthesis results in the accumulation of impurities along with the final product. In the case of peptides containing 30 or fewer residues, the resolving power of HPLC is usually sufficient to result in a distinct and highly pure final product. However, in the case of a 64-residue peptide containing a highly hydrophobic domain, such as M7-24-T40, it is critical to obtain independent proof of both homogeneity and sequence. To gain such information we decided to employ a combination of reversed phase HPLC and mass spectrometric characterization. HPLC profiles of crude T40, M7-12-T40, and M7-24-T40 were characterized by increasing heterogeneity (Fig. 2, panels A1, B1, and C1). Whereas the HPLC profile of T40 exhibited one major product (Fig. 2, panel A1), the profile of M7-24-T40 exhibited several significant peaks. Nevertheless, the peak at 17.72 min (Fig. 2, panel C1) was the first choice for the presumptive product because of its being the major peak in the crude peptide. It is worth noting that the crude products from previous syntheses of single transmembrane domains containing 30–40 residues were often significantly more complex than that observed for the 64-residue peptide M7-24-T40 (13Xie H.

Ding, unpublished results. Thus, even as judged by the HPLC of the synthetic peptide, the advantages of the solubilizing tail peptide were evident. Purification of the three peptides using semipreparative HPLC resulted in isolation of products that exhibited a single peak on an analytical column with a homogeneity of >98% (Fig. 2, panels A2, B2, and C2). A highly homogeneous sample of M7–24 (>95%) was obtained in a similar manner (data not"

Here, we show that Rbp1p in cells is associated with structures that sediment at 10,000 as well as 100,000 × g. It appears microscopically as punctate signals partially localized to the perinuclear region. Over-expression of Rbp1p in yeast resulted in growth defects on nonfermentable carbon sources, suggesting a function for Rbp1p in mitochondrial biogenesis. Absence of Rbp1p increased the level of mitochondrial porin, whereas over-expression of Rbp1p, but not an N-terminally truncated form, decreased porin levels. Over-expression of Rbp1p also decreased the level of mitochondrial porin mRNA by enhancing its degradation, an effect that was dependent on all three of the Rbp1p RNA recognition motifs. In cells, the porin mRNA is associated with Rbp1p·RNP (ribonucleoprotein) complexes. In vitro binding assays showed that Rbp1p most likely interacts with a (C/G)U-rich element in the porin mRNA 3′-UTR. Based on these observations, we infer that Rbp1p has a role in negatively regulating mitochondrial porin expression post-transcriptionally.

Eukaryotic messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are produced in the nucleus and undergo sequential processing reactions that typically include capping, pre-mRNA splicing, and polyadenylation. Cellular mRNA is associated with protein from the time of its synthesis to its degradation. With growing recognition of the complexity of gene regulation, interest in the mechanism of mRNA degradation has increased rapidly during the past decade. The mRNA turnover is a means to permit timely adjustments to changes in growth conditions or to genetically controlled programs of expression (reviewed in Refs. 1.Carpousis A.J. Vanzo N.F. Raynal L.C. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar and 2.Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, production of a particular gene product can be temporally and spatially regulated, allowing different cell types or different developmental stages of cells to fine-tune their patterns of protein expression. In fact, a number of developmental events, such as pattern formation and terminal differentiation, can be regulated post-transcriptionally by controlling mRNA stability, localization, and translation (reviewed in Refs. 3.Shyu A.-B. Wilkinson M.F. Cell. 2000; 102: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar and 4.Maquat L.E. Carmichael G.G. Cell. 2001; 104: 173-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins play key roles in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression; many of them contain an RNA recognition motif (RRM 1The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; ARE, adenosine uridine-rich element; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase; REMSA, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; CYT1, cytochrome c1; PABP, polyadenylate-binding protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TAP, tandem affinity purification; HA, hemagglutinin. 1The abbreviations used are: RRM, RNA recognition motif; ARE, adenosine uridine-rich element; UTR, untranslated region; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase; REMSA, RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; CYT1, cytochrome c1; PABP, polyadenylate-binding protein; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TAP, tandem affinity purification; HA, hemagglutinin.; also called RBD (RNA-binding domain)) (reviewed in Refs. 5.Burd C.G.

RRM-containing proteins include small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP), polyadenylate-binding proteins (PABPs), nucleolin, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) protein. Although the ubiquity of these RNA-binding proteins suggests a general housekeeping role, some of them may have specific functions. For example, the Drosophila ELAV protein plays a role in neuron-specific RNA splicing (7.Koushika S.P. Lisbin M.J. White K. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1634-1641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8.Toba G. Qiu J. Koushika S.P. White K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2413-2421PubMed Google Scholar) and vertebrate ELAV-like ribonucleoproteins (elr A, B, C, and D) have been implicated in early development and neuronal differentiation (9.Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). RNA-binding proteins also play a role in mRNA stability. The human Hu protein inhibits AU-rich element (ARE)-mediated RNA decay in vivo and stabilizes deadenylated RNA intermediates in vitro (10.Jain R.G. Andrews L.G. Mcgowan K.M. Pekala P.H. Keene J.D.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The AU-rich binding protein (AUF1) stabilized the parathyroid hormone mRNA in an in vitro degradation assay and is also involved in regulation of cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA stability (16.Sela-Brown A.

In Xenopus, estrogen induces the stabilization of the transcripts of the yolk precursor protein vitellogenin, which is a result of the different affinities of the 155-kDa RNA-binding protein, vigilin, for cis-acting stability determinants (18.Cunningham K.S. Dodson R.E. Nagel M.A. Shapiro D.J. Schoenberg D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12498-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNA-binding proteins may have functions in translational processes. For example, PABP is essential to stabilize the 3′-end of mRNA; however, PABP interacts with the cap-associated eukaryotic initiation factors eIF4G (in yeast and plants) and eIF4B (in plants). In mammals PABP interacts with a novel PABP-interacting protein that also binds eIF4A (19.Kessler S.H. Sachs A.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20.Gallie D.R. Gene. 1998; 216: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The Fragile X mental retardation syndrome protein, FMR1, and its homologous FXR proteins are associated with ribosomes, predominantly with 60 S large ribosomal subunits (21.Siomi M.C. Zhang Y. Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3825-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These observations demonstrate that RNA-binding proteins serve as regulatory molecules. A putative RNA-binding protein gene (RBP1, also called NGR1) was identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (22.Lee F.-J.S. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15080-15087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rbp1p contains three RRMs, two glutamine-rich sequences, and a C-terminal asparagine-methionine-proline-rich region. Although RBP1 is not an essential gene, over-expression of Rbp1p in yeast yields a slow-growth phenotype, suggesting that Rbp1p is functionally critical in certain biochemical processes. We undertook an analysis of the yeast Rbp1p with the aim of elucidating its cellular role. We report here that the level of mitochondrial outer membrane porin was lower in the Rbp1p yeast strains than it was in an rbp1 mutant. We further demonstrate that Rbp1p can accelerate porin mRNA turnover, possibly through binding to the 3′-UTR of porin mRNA. These data provide the first evidence that Rbp1p might be involved in post-transcriptional regulation of porin expression in intact cells. Yeast Strains, Media, and Plasmid Construction—The S. cerevisiae strain YPH499 (MATa ura3-52 lys2-801 ade2-101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1) was the parental strain used for manipulation and gene disruption. The S. cerevisiae strain YTC345 (= YRP582, MATa rpb1-1 ura3 leu2) was a kind gift from Dr. Tien-Hsien Chang (Ohio State University) and was used for mRNA turnover studies. Rich medium contained 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose or 2% galactose. Synthetic minimal medium contained 0.7% yeast nitrogen base (without amino acids) and 2% glucose or 2% galactose and was supplemented with the appropriate nutrients for auxotrophs (23.Kaiser C.A. Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli vectors pT7Blue and pET-15b (Novagen) were used for gene cloning and manipulation of protein expression. Yeasts were transformed by the lithium acetate method (24.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were constructed by standard protocols (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For creating the yeast expression vector encoding N-terminal HA-tagged Rbp1p, the sequence encoding yeast RBP1 was amplified by PCR and inserted into the XhoI-XbaI site of the yeast expression vector pVT101U (26.Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene. 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). RBP1 truncated at the N terminus (RBP-1dN, amino acids 1-108 deleted) and RBP1 mutated in each RRM (Rbp1-rrm1, Rbp1-rrm2, and Rbp1-rrm3) were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. The sequences of the resulting constructs were verified. A GeneAmp RNA PCR Core Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for RT-PCR analyses. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Rbp1p—For construction of a His-tagged Rbp1p fusion protein, a DNA fragment containing the full-length yeast RBP1 coding region was generated by PCR amplification of yeast genomic DNA with sequence-specific primers that incorporated unique NdeI and BamHI sites at the initiating methionine and 6 bp downstream of the stop codon, respectively. The PCR product was ligated to the pT7Blue vector and subcloned into the E. coli expression vector pET15b, yielding pET15b-RBP1. For construction of GST fusion proteins of Rbp1p and its mutants, DNA fragments containing the RBP1 or its mutants (GST-RBP1, GST-RBP1-rrm1, GST-RBP1-rrm2, GST-RBP1-rrm3) were generated by PCR amplification with sequence-specific primers and subcloned into the pGEX6p-1 vector. Procedures for large-scale production and purification of recombinant proteins have been published (27.Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.-F. Yu W.-L. Buu L.-M. Lin C.-Y. Huang M.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30998-31005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Antibody Preparation and Purification—To prepare antibodies against Rbp1p, purified recombinant Rbp1p was isolated by SDS-PAGE. The gel containing Rbp1p was smashed, thoroughly mixed with Freund's adjuvant, and used to immunize rabbits. The anti-Rbp1p anti-serum was diluted 1:5000 for Western blot analysis. The polyclonal anti-Rbp1p antibodies were affinity-purified for immunofluorescence staining (28.Adam S.A. Nakagawa T. Swanson M.S. Woodruff T.K. Dreyfuss G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1986; 6: 2932-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Yeast total proteins were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis as described (27.Lee F.-J.S. Huang C.-F. Yu W.-L. Buu L.-M. Lin C.-Y. Huang M.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30998-31005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence staining as described by Huang et al. (29.Huang C.-F. Buu L.-M. Yu W.-L. Lee F.-J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3819-3827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alexa 594- or Alexa 488-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. H33258 was diluted in mounting solution for nucleic acid staining. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon Microphot SA microscope. Monoclonal anti-yeast mitochondria porin, anti-yeast cytochrome oxidase subunit III, and subunit IV antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The monoclonal anti-HA antibody was from Berkeley Antibody Co. (BabCO, Richmond, CA). Monoclonal anti-yeast ribosomal protein Rpl3p antibody (also called anti-TCM1 antibody) was a gift from Dr. J. Warner (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York), and the polyclonal anti-Kar2p antibody was a gift from Dr. M. Rose (Princeton University, NJ). Polyclonal anti-porin antibody was diluted 1:20000 for Western blot analysis and 1:5000 for immunofluorescence staining. Sedimentation Centrifugation Analysis—Yeast strains were cultured in 50 ml of synthetic medium containing 2% galactose or 2% glucose with shaking at 30 °C overnight. Cells were pelleted and brought into spheroplasts by lyticase treatment. Spheroplasts were disrupted on ice with a Dounce homogenizer as described (29.Huang C.-F. Buu L.-M. Yu W.-L. Lee F.-J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3819-3827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As a second method, cells were suspended in lysis buffer as described above and broken by vortexing with glass beads (30.Frey S. Pool M. Seedorf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15905-15912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Homogenates were incubated at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 20 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,600 × g (P4). The supernatants were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm to yield mitochondria-rich pellets (P10). The supernatants were further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to produce microsome-rich pellets (P100) and supernatants (S100) containing soluble proteins. Growth Phenotype Analysis—Yeast over-expressing Rbp1p or its truncated forms was streaked on synthetic medium containing 2% glucose. After incubation at 30 °C for 3 days, cells were harvested and suspended in sterile double distilled H2O. After adjustment of the cell suspensions to A600 = 1, they were diluted serially 10-fold to 1 × 10-4. Samples (5 μl) of each cell suspension were spotted on synthetic medium containing 2% glucose or 2% glycerol as the carbon source, incubated at 30 °C for 3 days, and photographed. Ribosome-Polysome Profile Analysis—Yeast strains were grown with shaking at 30 °C in 50 ml of SC medium containing 2% glucose or 2% galactose to early or middle logarithmic phase. Cycloheximide was added to cultures to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml followed by incubation at 30 °C for 10 min and cooling on ice. Cells were harvested, washed once with TNM buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm, NaCl, 100 mm, MgCl2, 30 mm, heparin, 200 μg/ml, and cycloheximide, 100 μg/ml, dissolved in diethyl pyrocarbonate-ddH2O), suspended in 0.4 ml of TNM buffer, and broken by vortex mixing with an equal volume of glass beads for 3 min. After the addition of 0.6 ml of TNM buffer, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation (5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant representing about 8 OD260 units were applied to a continuous 4.5 ml of 7-47% sucrose gradient (containing, 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 50 mm NH4Cl, and 12 mm MgCl2) and fractionated by centrifugation in a Hitachi P55ST2-403 rotor at 29,000 rpm for 3.5 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the gradients were analyzed by measurement of absorbance at 254 nm in an ISCO UA-6 absorbent monitor. RNA Blot Analysis and RNA Turnover Analysis—Yeast total RNA was isolated by the hot acid phenol method (31.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 13.12.1-13.12.5Google Scholar). RNA blot analysis was carried out as described previously (22.Lee F.-J.S. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15080-15087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) We used yeast strain YTC345 carrying a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase II allele (rpb1-1) (32.Muhlrad D. Decker C.J. Parker R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2145-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) to study the RNA turnover rate. The RBP1 gene of YTC345 was disrupted by hisG-URA3-hisG construction as described previously (22.Lee F.-J.S. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15080-15087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). YTC345 and YTC345 rbp1::URA3 were grown in synthetic medium containing 2% galactose and 0.1% glucose with shaking overnight at 25 °C. An equal volume of 50 °C sterile double distilled H2O was then added, and the culture was placed in a 37 °C water bath. Samples of cells were withdrawn at the indicated times for RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis. The mRNA decay was determined by densitometry of Northern blots, using an AlphaImager™ 1220 documentation and analysis system (AlphaImager 1220, version 5.5). The data were processed with SigmaPlot 2000 software for the slope plot. Gene Construction for RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay— The full-length porin ORF and porin ORF additions 200 bp upstream of the start codon and 200 bp downstream of the stop codon were obtained by PCR and cloned into pT7blue plasmid to generate pT7por1. A 192-bp fragment of the porin 3′-end ORF (por3′), a 345-bp fragment (por3′U) containing the 192-bp por3′ plus 153 bp of the porin mRNA 3′-UTR, and a 177-bp fragment (por3′-1) containing 24-bp por3′ and 153 bp of the porin mRNA 3′-UTR were obtained by PCR and ligated to pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid to generate pBKSpor3′, pBKSpor3′U, and pBKSpor3′-1. The dissected fragments of the porin mRNA 3′-UTR were performed by PCR and subcloned into the pBluescript II KS(+) plasmid. In Vitro Transcription—Labeled and unlabeled RNA probes were generated by in vitro transcription. Samples (3 μg) of plasmids were linearized by restriction enzyme digestion and extracted with phenol/chloroform. After precipitation by salt and isopropanol, the linearized plasmids were suspended in 20 μl of TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer. For in vitro transcription, the 50-μl reaction mixture contained 1× reaction buffer, 7.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm rATP, 0.2 mm rGTP, 0.2 mm rCTP, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 0.3 μg of template DNA, 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase, (Stratagene), and 75 μCi of [32P]UTP. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the template DNA was digested with DNase I. The uncoupled [32P]UTP was removed on a Microspin G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). The specific activity of RNA products was 1.5∼2.0 × 106 cpm/μg. For in vitro transcription, without [32P]UTP, 0.2 mm rUTP was added to the reaction mixture. Unlabeled RNA fragments were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated by salt and ethanol, suspended in 50 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-ddH2O, and stored at -20 °C. RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (REMSA)—For RNA mobility shift assays, recombinant GST-tagged RBP1 (GST-RBP1, GST-RBP1-rrm1, GST-RBP1-rrm2, GST-RBP1-rrm3), and GST proteins were synthesized in E. coli(BL21) cells and purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads with elution by reduced glutathione. The 10-μl reaction mixture contained of 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 ng of recombinant GST-RBP1 or recombinant GST, 1 × 104 cpm of RNA probe (∼ 10 ng), 2 μg of poly(I-C), and 50 μg of heparin. After 30 min at room temperature, 1 unit of RNase T1 was added to the mixture, and incubation was continued for 15 min. Loading dye was added, and the reaction components were resolved in 5% acrylamide-bis-acrylamide (39:1) mini-gel at 90 V for about 2 h in Tris-glycine buffer. After drying, the gel was used to expose the gel on an x-ray film. For the competition assays, an excess of the indicated unlabeled competitor RNAs was added to the labeled probe before the reaction. In Vivo Pull-down Assay and RNA Detection by RT-PCR—For pull-down of the Rbp1p·RNA complex cross-linked in intact cells, we employed the tandem affinity purification (TAP) tag method (33.Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2283) Google Scholar). A DNA cassette encoding the TAP tag was integrated into the genome of a haploid cell in-frame with the C-terminal region of the Rbp1p without altering its natural level of expression. Yeast cells expressing Rbp1p-TAP tag were grown overnight in synthetic medium containing 0.2% glucose and 2% galactose, harvested, and washed twice with double distilled H2O. For intracellular in vivo cross-linking of the protein-RNA complex (34.Niranjanakumari S. Lasda E. Brazas R. Garcia-Blanco MA. Methods. 2002; 26: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), cells were suspended in fixing solution (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and 100 mm NaCl) with 0.3% (v/v) formaldehyde and incubated at room temperature for 20 min with gentle rocking. Cross-linking reaction was quenched by the addition of glycine (pH 7.0) to a final concentration of 0.25 m followed by incubation at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with fixing solution, and dispersed in TST buffer (50 mm, Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm, NaCl, 0.05%, Tween 20) containing protease inhibitors. Cells were broken by vortex mixing with glass beads, debris was removed by centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 10 min), and the supernatant was incubated with IgG beads (rocking, 4 °C for 2 h). The IgG beads were pelleted, washed five times with TST buffer, and suspended in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl containing 2 units of DNase I. After rocking at room temperature for 20 min, the IgG beads were pelleted, washed twice with TST solution, and incubated at 70 °C for 45 min in TEDS solution (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% SDS) for reversal of cross-linking. The IgG beads were removed, the supernatant was extracted with phenol/chloroform, and RNAs were precipitated with salt and ethanol at -20 °C. Porin and control mRNAs were identified by RT-PCR using specific primers. Rbp1p Is Associated with Heavily Sedimented Structures and Is Localized in Part to the Perinuclear Region—To investigate the function of Rbp1p, we raised polyclonal antibodies against recombinant His-tagged Rbp1p (see “Experimental Procedures”). Among total cellular proteins from wild-type yeast and a strain over-expressing Rbp1p, anti-Rbp1p antibodies mainly reacted with an ∼ 90-kDa protein, the size expected for Rbp1p (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). This protein was not detected in an rbp1 mutant (Fig. 1A, lane 3) or by reaction with preimmune serum (data not shown). Two nonspecific signals were eliminated after affinity purification of anti-Rbp1p antibodies (Fig. 1A, lane 4). Affinity-purified antibodies of Rbp1p were used in all of the later experiments. To determine the subcellular distribution of endogenous Rbp1p, we fractionated spheroplast-homogenized lysates into three fractions, mitochondria-rich (P10), microsome-rich (P100), and soluble fractions (S100), by sedimentation centrifugation. Rbp1p was equally represented in both the P10 and P100 fractions but was barely detectable in the soluble fraction (Fig. 1B), indicating that Rbp1p was co-fractionated with heavily sedimented materials. The subcellular localization of Rbp1p was also assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. The signals were too weak to allow localization of Rbp1p in wild-type strains, which may be because of the low affinity of the Rbp1p antibody for native Rbp1p. For this reason, cells over-expressing epitope-tagged Rbp1p, HA-Rbp1p, were used for subsequent immunofluorescence experiments. As shown in Fig. 1C, most of the Rbp1p immunoreactivity was, like that of Kar2p, concentrated in the perinuclear region. In addition, some punctate signals were distributed in the cytoplasm. In other experiments, HA-Rbp1p appeared to be colocalized with mitochondrial porin in some cells (data not shown). Our efforts to demonstrate Rbp1p in the vicinity of the mitochondria in most cells were, however, unsuccessful. Overexpression of Rbp1p Affects Mitochondrial Porin Expression and Impairs Mitochondrial Function—While performing the immunostaining studies with an anti-porin antibody to identify mitochondria, we observed that porin staining was significantly less noticeable in cells over-expressing Rbp1p than in those of rbp1 mutants (Fig. 2A, arrows). To determine whether Rbp1p suppressed porin expression, we quantified porin protein levels. Cells were grown overnight in synthetic medium containing 2% galactose and 0.2% glucose. The cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2B, the amount of porin was lower in cells expressing Rbp1p (wild-type, low copy-expressing or high copy-over-expressing Rbp1p) than in the rbp1 mutant. However, over-expression of the mutant Rbp1-dN apparently did not affect the porin level. The amount of ribosomal 60 S protein Rpl3p and cytoplasmic protein Pgk1p was similar in all strains examined. It appeared that over-expression of Rbp1p, but not Rbp1-dN, reduced the steady-state levels of porin. Next, we investigated whether over-expression of Rbp1p had an effect on mitochondrial function. Yeast cells, when grown in glycerol medium, require mature active mitochondria for oxidative metabolism and growth. Yeast grown in glucose initially does not need active, mature mitochondria, and the mitochondria are not well developed until cells switch from anaerobic glucose fermentation to aerobic ethanol oxidation. Wild type, rbp1 mutant, and rbp1 strains over-expressing Rbp1p or Rbp1-dN were grown overnight in synthetic medium containing glucose. Cells were harvested, suspended in double distilled H2O, serially diluted, and plated on glucose or glycerol medium. As shown in Fig. 2C, all strains grew on glucose plates; however, cells over-expressing Rbp1p grew much more slowly. Moreover, with the exception of those cells, all strains grew on glycerol plates (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that over-expressing Rbp1p interferes with events in mitochondrial biogenesis that are required to enable cells to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources. Rbp1p Does Not Affect General Polysome Profiles—To test whether Rbp1p suppresses the expression of porin at the level of translation, we analyzed the ribosome-polysome profiles in rbp1 mutant or HA-Rbp1p-over-expressing strains. Sucrose gradient sedimentation showed no significant ribosome-polysome defects in the rbp1 mutant and HA-Rbp1p over-expressing strains, although the A254 of 40 S ribosomal subunits was increased slightly from 0.14 and 0.16 to 0.24 and 0.2, respectively, when Rbp1p was over-expressed in rbp1 and wild type strains (Fig. 3, upper panel). Western blot analysis of 12 gradient fractions (from top to bottom fractions) (Fig. 3, lower panel) showed that most of the Rbp1 was in the top fractions (fractions 1-3) with a small portion in the 40 S subunit-rich fraction (fraction 4). Rbp1p may not be directly associated with 40 S ribosomal subunits but most likely interacts with mRNPs that co-fractionates with free 40 S ribosomal subunits. Rbp1p Affects Steady-state Levels of Mitochondrial Porin mRNA—To determine whether Rbp1p altered the steady-state levels of porin mRNA, we compared different yeast strains expressing Rbp1p. Fig. 4 shows that the levels of porin mRNA in rbp1 and RBP1-dN-overexpressing cells were considerably higher than in the wild-type and Rbp1p-overexpressing strains, regardless of the carbon source. Amounts of the actin mRNA, however, were similar in all cells grown in galactose-containing medium. These results indicate t"

MLCK-A was phosphorylated at Thr166 by constitutively active Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase, resulting in an ∼140-fold increase in catalytic activity, using intact Dictyostelium myosin II. Recombinant Dictyostelium myosin II regulatory light chain and Kemptamide were also readily phosphorylated by activated MLCK-A. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that MLCK-A expressed by Escherichia coli was autophosphorylated at Thr289 and that, subsequent to Thr166 phosphorylation, MLCK-A also underwent a slow rate of autophosphorylation at multiple Ser residues. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we show that autophosphorylation at Thr289 is required for efficient phosphorylation and activation by an upstream kinase. By performing enzyme kinetics analysis on a series of MLCK-A truncation mutants, we found that residues 283–288 function as an autoinhibitory domain and that autoinhibition is fully relieved by Thr166 phosphorylation. Simple removal of this region resulted in a significant increase in the kcat of MLCK-A; however, it did not generate maximum enzymatic activity. Together with the results of our kinetic analysis of the enzymes, these findings demonstrate that Thr166 phosphorylation of MLCK-A by an upstream kinase subsequent to autophosphorylation at Thr289 results in generation of maximum MLCK-A activity through both release of an autoinhibitory domain from its catalytic core and a further increase (15–19-fold) in the kcat of the enzyme.

A recent study indicated that filamentous assembly is required for efficient regulation of Dictyostelium myosin II by MRLC phosphorylation (12.Liu X. Ito K. Morimoto S. Hikkoshi-Iwane A. Yanagida T. Uyeda T.Q.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14124-14129Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast to vertebrate MLCK, an unconventional MLCK (MLCK-A) has been identified and characterized in Dictyostelium and shown not to require Ca2+/CaM for its activity (13.Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13818-13824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16044-16049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of a genetic study using cells lacking MLCK-A indicate that MLCK-A plays a role in efficient cytokinesis (15.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It has been shown that MLCK-A undergoes autophosphorylation at Thr289, resulting in increased activity of the enzyme (13.Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13818-13824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); but autophosphorylation is not required for MLCK-A activity in vivo (16.Silveira L.A. Smith J.L. Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13000-13005Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of autophosphorylation at Thr289 remains unclear. With regard to the activation mechanism of this enzyme, MLCK-A has been shown to be activated and phosphorylated by concanavalin A treatment of cells (15.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12321-12326Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This activation is likely due to phosphorylation at Thr166 in the activation loop because the activity of the T166E mutant is 12-fold higher than that of wild-type MLCK-A (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cGMP activates endogenous MLCK-A in cell lysates, suggesting that MLCK-A kinase can be either directly or indirectly up-regulated by cGMP signals and thereby induce phosphorylation and activation of MLCK-A (16.Silveira L.A. Smith J.L. Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13000-13005Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Such activation would be analogous to the activation mechanism of protein kinase cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (18.Nakielny S. Cohen P. Wu J. Sturgill T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2123-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and the CaM kinase cascade. For example, the multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaM-Ks), CaM-KI and CaM-KIV, are activated through phosphorylation at the Thr residue in the activation loop by an upstream kinase, Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM-KK) (19.Soderling T.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 232-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 20.Corcoran E.E. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2975-2978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Because neither the MLCK-A kinase nor MLCK-A phosphorylated at Thr166 has been investigated, the regulatory mechanism of MLCK-A remains unclear. Here, we found that mammalian CaM-KK, an activating kinase for CaM-KI and CaM-KIV, was capable of phosphorylating Thr166 of MLCK-A, resulting in a large increase in the catalytic efficiency of MLCK-A. This allowed us to examine several aspects of MLCK-A activation, including the role of autophosphorylation at Thr289, the specific location of the autoinhibitory region, and the relationship between Thr166 phosphorylation and the autoinhibitory mechanism of MLCK-A. Materials—CaM-KKα cDNA (GenBank™/EBI accession number L42810) (21.Tokumitsu H. Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol.

Constitutively active CaM-KKα (CaM-KKc; GST-CaM-KK-(84–434)) was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography (22.Tokumitsu H. Muramatsu M. Ikura M. Kobayashi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20090-20095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium myosin II was prepared according to Ruppel et al. (11.Ruppel K.M. Uyeda T.Q.P. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18773-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged Dictyostelium MRLC was prepared as described previously (9.Ostrow B.D. Chen P. Chisholm R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were from standard commercial sources. Construction and Expression of Dictyostelium MLCK-A—GST-fused wild-type MLCK-A and mutants were constructed by amplification of cDNA fragments using pET-MLCK-A (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as a template, a sense primer (5′-GGTCTAGACATGACAGAAGTAGAAAAAATA-3′), and the following antisense primers: wild-type, 5′-GGTCTAGATTAGTTAACCAATTTTGTTTGA-3′; T289A, 5′-GGTCTAGATTAGTTAACCAATTTTGTTTGAGCTTTTTG-3′; T289E, 5′-GGTCTAGATTAGTTAACCAATTTTGTTTGTTCTTTTTG-3′; MLCK-A-(1–288), 5′-GGTCTAGATTATTTTTGTCTTTCAACAATG-3′; MLCK-A-(1–282), 5′-GGTCTAGATTAGTATTCTTTCATTTTAACA-3′; MLCK-A-(1–277), 5′-GGTCTAGATTAAACAGTATCAATGGTGTTA-3′; and MLCK-A-(1–270), 5′-GGTCTAGATTATGAGTTATTGGACTTTAAC-3′ The PCR products were then ligated into the XbaI site of the pGEX-KG-PreS vector (23.Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The T166A, T166E, and T166A/T289A mutants were constructed by amplification of the PCR 5′-fragment using the sense primer described above and an antisense primer (5′-TTTGGCCAATAATTTTACTAAGACCAAAAT-3′) or by amplification of the PCR 3′-fragment using a sense primer (T166A, 5′-CTCTTGTAATGCAAGCTGCATGTGGTACAC-3′; or T166E, 5′-CTCTTGTAATGCAAGAAGCATGTGGTACAC-3′) and the antisense primer described above, followed by double ligation into the XbaI site of the pGEX-KG-PreS vector. The nucleotide sequences of MLCK-A mutants and the wild-type enzyme were confirmed using an ABI 377 automated sequencer. cDNAs carrying GST-MLCK-A were introduced into E. coli JM109, and the expression of recombinant MLCK-A was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, followed by purification by glutathione-Sepharose column chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Purified enzymes were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then stored at –80 °C. Activation of Dictyostelium MLCK-A by CaM-KKc—Purified recombinant MLCK-As (0.16 mg/ml) were incubated at 30 °C for the indicated times in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, and 200 μm ATP in either the presence or absence of 6.6 μg/ml CaM-KKc. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP and terminated by 21-fold dilution with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% ethylene glycol, and 1 mm EDTA. Five μl of the diluted sample (37.5 ng of MLCK-A) was then subjected to the protein kinase assay. MLCK-A Activity Assay—MLCK-A activity was measured at 30 °C for 5–10 min (or for 2 min for His-tagged MRLC) in a solution (25 μl) containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm smooth muscle MRLC peptide (Kemptamide, Lys-Lys-Arg-Pro-Gln-Arg-Ala-Thr-Ser-Asn-Val-Phe-Ser-NH2) (24.Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3355-3359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or various concentrations of recombinant Dictyostelium MRLC, and 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1000 cpm/pmol) in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated either by spotting aliquots (15 μl) onto phosphocellulose paper (Whatman P-81), followed by several washes with 75 mm phosphoric acid (25.Roskowski R. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 99: 3-6Crossref Scopus (691) Google Scholar) for peptide phosphorylation, or by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were then subjected to SDS-15% PAGE, followed by quantifying 32P incorporation into MRLC by Cerenkov counting of the excised gels. Phosphate incorporation into Kemptamide was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the filters. To determine the kinetic parameters of MLCK-A, we used 467 μm Kemptamide and 50–400 μm [γ-32P]ATP for titration of ATP. For titration of Kemptamide or MRLC, 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 29–467 μm Kemptamide or 6–24 μm MRLC were used. The enzyme concentrations used for measurement of the kinetic parameters were 64 μg/ml wild-type MLCK-A, 20 μg/ml MLCK-A-(1–277), and 1.5 μg/ml activated wild-type MLCK-A and MLCK-A-(1–277) for Kemptamide phosphorylation or 20 μg/ml wild-type MLCK-A, 2.2 μg/ml MLCK-A-(1–277), and 0.15 μg/ml activated wild-type MLCK-A and MLCK-A-(1–277) for MRLC phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Dictyostelium MLCK-A by CaM-KKc—Purified recombinant MLCK-As (0.16 mg/ml) were assayed at 30 °C for the indicated times in a solution containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, and 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (500–1000 cpm/pmol) in either the presence or absence of 6.6 μg/ml CaM-KKc. The reaction was initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP and terminated either by spotting 15 μl of the sample onto P-81 paper, followed by measurement of 32P incorporation into MLCK-A as described above, or by the addition of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-10% PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Dictyostelium Myosin II Phosphorylation—Purified Dictyostelium myosin II (0.2–1 mg/ml) was incubated with either activated or unactivated MLCK-A (1.5 μg/ml) at 30 °C for the indicated times in a solution containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm Mg(Ac)2,1mm DTT, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were then subjected to SDS-15% PAGE, followed by either autoradiography or quantifying 32P incorporation into MRLC by Cerenkov counting of the excised gels. Identification of Phosphorylation Sites in Dictyostelium MLCK-A by Mass Spectrometry—Either purified recombinant MLCK-A (∼10 μg) or MLCK-A (∼10 μg) phosphorylated by incubation with CaM-KKc for 120 min as described above was separated by SDS-10% PAGE, followed by in-gel digestion with 17 μg/ml chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) overnight at 37 °C. The digested peptides were eluted by 0.1% formic acid and subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis. Liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis was performed using a Micromass Q-Tof2 quadruple/time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer interfaced with a Micromass CapLC™ capillary reverse-phase liquid chromatography system. A 90-min linear gradient from 5 to 45% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid was produced and split at a 1:20 ratio, and the gradient solution was injected into a PepMap C18 Nano LC column (75 μm × 150 mm; LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at ∼25 nl/min. The eluted peptides were sprayed directly into the mass spectrometer. MS/MS data were acquired using Micromass MassLynx software and converted to a single text file (containing the observed m/z of the precursor peptide and fragment ion m/z and intensity values) using Micromass ProteinLynx software. The file was was analyzed with the Mascot MS/MS Ions search (Matrix Science) 2Available at www.matrixscience.com. to assign non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides to Dictyostelium MLCK-A amino acid sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number M64176). We set search parameters as follows: data base, NCBInr; taxonomy, Dictyostelium discoideum; enzyme, none; fixed modifications, carbamidomethyl; variable modifications, phospho (Ser/Thr); peptide tolerance, ±0.2 Da; MS/MS tolerance, ±0.2 Da; and peptide charge, 1+, 2+, and 3+. Protein Phosphatase 2A Treatment of Dictyostelium MLCK-A—Either wild-type MLCK-A (3.5 μg) or the T289A mutant (1.2 μg) was incubated with or without 0.025 unit of protein phosphatase 2A (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) at 30 °C for 60 min in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were then subjected to SDS-7.5% PAGE, followed by protein staining. Miscellaneous—Protein concentration was estimated by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin or rabbit skeletal myosin (for Dictyostelium myosin II) as a standard (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217370) Google Scholar). Unlike vertebrate MLCKs, Dictyostelium MLCK-A is not activated by Ca2+/CaM (13.Tan J.L. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13818-13824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of Thr166 to Glu in MLCK-A results in a 12-fold increase in its catalytic activity compared with the wild-type enzyme, suggesting that MLCK-A is likely to be activated through phosphorylation at Thr166 by an upstream protein kinase in Dictyostelium (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This is also consistent with the finding of a previous study that T166A and T289A mutations abolish the increase in 32P incorporation into MLCK-A in metabolically labeled cells after stimulation with concanavalin A, which activates MLCK-A (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence of MLCK-A activation by Thr166 phosphorylation because a MLCK-A kinase capable of phosphorylating Thr166 has not been identified in Dictyostelium. Therefore, the activation mechanism of MLCK-A remains unclear. A search for metazoan homologs of Dictyostelium MLCK-A in the cDNA data base revealed that the catalytic domain of MLCK-A is most similar (∼50% identical) to mammalian and Caenorhabditis elegans CaM-KI (Fig. 1) (27.Haribabu B.

It has been demonstrated that both CaM-KI enzymes are phosphorylated by an upstream protein kinase (CaM-KK) at a Thr residue in their activation loop (Thr177 in human CaM-KI and Thr179 in C. elegans CaM-KI) that is equivalent to Thr166 in MLCK-A, resulting in a large increase in their catalytic efficiencies (21.Tokumitsu H.

We therefore investigated whether MLCK-A can be phosphorylated at Thr166 by CaM-KK, resulting in activation. If this is the case, the precise activation mechanism of MLCK-A could be determined using the surrogate MLCK-A kinase. Phosphorylation and Activation of Dictyostelium MLCK-A by CaM-KKc—To assay for phosphorylation and activation of MLCK-A by CaM-KK, we used a minimum catalytic domain mutant of rat CaM-KKα (GST-CaM-KK-(84–434); CaM-KKc) lacking the N-terminal 83 amino acid residues and lacking a C-terminal regulatory region (residues 435–505) that includes an autoinhibitory domain and Ca2+/CaM-binding segments because the mutant has been shown to be constitutively active (29.Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30.Matsushita M. Nairn A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21473-21481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, when we incubated recombinant GST-fused MLCK-A with CaM-KKc in the presence of MgATP and EGTA, robust phosphorylation was observed, whereas autophosphorylation of MLCK-A itself was very weak. Approximately 3.2 mol of phosphate was incorporated into MLCK-A within 120 min upon incubation with CaM-KKc. We measured MLCK-A activity under the same conditions using a peptide substrate corresponding to chicken gizzard MRLC (Kemptamide) (Fig. 2B). The activity of recombinant MLCK-A was very low or undetectable under these conditions (1.5 μg/ml MLCK-A) and was not altered by incubation with MgATP in the absence of CaM-KKc. However, when we used a high concentration of the enzyme (20 μg/ml MLCK-A), we could detect wild-type MLCK-A activity (4.0 nmol/min/mg), as shown in Fig. 5B. In contrast, when MLCK-A was incubated with CaM-KKc in the presence of MgATP under the same conditions, MLCK-A was fully activated (1.3 μmol/min/mg) within 30 min (Fig. 2B) in association with incorporation of ∼1 mol of phosphate into MLCK-A (Fig. 2A). These results indicate that CaM-KKc is capable of phosphorylating and activating MLCK-A, resulting in a large increase in its catalytic efficiency for the peptide substrate as well as autophosphorylation activity. We also confirmed CaM-KK-mediated induction of MLCK-A activity using purified Dictyostelium myosin II as a substrate (Fig. 2, C and D). The protein kinase activity of MLCK-A for 18-kDa Dictyostelium MRLC was very low (1.5 nmol/min/mg) and was dramatically enhanced by phosphorylation with CaM-KKc (0.23 μmol/min/mg), resulting in efficient and stoichiometric phosphorylation of MRLC (∼0.8 mol of phosphate/1 mol of MRLC). We also determined the specificity constant (kcat/Km) by measuring the phosphorylation rate at several subsaturating myosin concentrations (0.2–1 mg/ml) as described previously (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The protein kinase activity of unactivated MLCK-A for 18-kDa Dictyostelium MRLC was very low (kcat/Km = 350 m–1 s–1). This is slightly lower that the value measured previously (670 m–1 s–1) (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), most likely because of the GST tag present at the N terminus of the enzymes used in this study. For CaM-KKc-treated MLCK-A, the activity was ∼140-fold higher (kcat/Km = 49,500 m–1 s–1).Fig. 5Identification of an autoinhibitory domain in Dictyostelium MLCK-A.A, shown is a schematic representation of MLCK-A truncation mutants. AID, the autoinhibitory domain identified in this study. B, the activities of various MLCK-A truncation mutants and the wild-type (WT) enzyme (20 μg/ml) were measured in the presence of 400 μm [γ-32P]ATP using 40 μm Kemptamide as a substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results represent means ± S.E. of three experiments. C, the activities of MLCK-A truncation mutants and the wild-type enzyme activated by incubation with 6.6 μg/ml CaM-KKc for 30 min in the presence of 200 μm ATP were measured using 1.5 μg/ml enzyme as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results represent means ± S.E. of three experiments. Phosphorylation of MLCK-A truncation mutants and the wild-type enzyme in the presence (+) or absence (–) of 6.6 μg/ml CaM-KKc for 30 min was analyzed by SDS-10% PAGE (upper inset, protein staining), followed by autoradiography (lower inset).

Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16044-16049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we did not detect stoichiometric autophosphorylation of MLCK-A in this present study (Fig. 2A). We therefore attempted to identify the phosphorylation sites in both unactivated and activated MLCK-As by mass spectrometry. When we analyzed our recombinant unactivated MLCK-A by chymotrypsin digestion, followed by mass spectrometry analysis, we obtained peptide sequences that covered 84% of the total amino acid sequence of MLCK-A (data not shown). Among them, we detected a single phosphopeptide corresponding to residues 283–295 in MLCK-A (peptide A-1 in Table I). MS/MS analysis revealed a single phosphorylation site at Thr289 in the peptide (Fig. 3A), indicating that MLCK-A was already autophosphorylated at Thr289 in E. coli, which is consistent with a previous report (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, we could not detect stoichiometric autophosphorylation at Thr289 in MLCK-A. In addition, we found that wild-type MLCK-A migrated on SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel slower than the protein phosphatase 2A-treated enzyme, whereas the mobility of the T289A mutant on SDS-polyacrylamide gel was not altered by the phosphatase treatment (Fig. 4C), indicating that Thr289 in wild-type MLCK-A was apparently fully autophosphorylated. We also thought that activation of MLCK-A by CaM-KKc was due to phosphorylation at Thr166 by CaM-KKc. Indeed, mass spectrometry analysis of MLCK-A incubated with CaM-KKc in the presence of MgATP for 120 min revealed that Thr166 was phosphorylated in MLCK-A (peptide B-4 in Fig. 3B and Table I). This was also confirmed by the finding that CaM-KKc-induced Pi incorporation into MLCK-A and activation of MLCK-A were completely abolished by the T166A mutation (Fig. 4, A and B). Although we observed residual autophosphorylation of the T166A mutant in either the presence or absence of CaM-KKc (Fig. 4A), this was likely autophosphorylation at Thr289 because Pi incorporation was not observed with the T166A/T289A double mutant. Based on the mass spectrometry analysis, we also observed that MLCK-A-(1–277), lacking Thr289, possessed a single phosphorylation site at Thr166 after 30 min of incubation with CaM-KKc (data not shown). In addition to autophosphorylation sites at Thr289 and phospho-Thr166, we detected four other phosphorylation sites (Ser42, Ser155, Ser251, and Ser270) in activated MLCK-A (Table I). Because CaM-KKc could phosphorylate only Thr166 in MLCK-A (Fig. 4A), these Ser residues are likely autophosphorylation sites. Autophosphorylation at multiple Ser residues of MLCK-A subsequent to activation is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2A. When we analyzed the phosphorylation sites in the T166E mutant, which has been shown to be a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6075-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we detected two phosphorylation sites at Ser251 and Ser270 in addition to phospho-Thr289 by mass spectrometry, but we could not observe phosphorylation at Ser42 and Ser155 in the mutant (data not shown). This may indicate that autophosphorylation at Ser42 and Ser155 occurs only in vitro or that the activity of the T166E mutant is not enough to autophosphorylate these Ser residues (Ser42 and Ser155) compared with the enzyme phosphorylated at Thr166 (Table I). However, this autophosphorylation subsequent to phosphorylation at Thr166 was slow and did not appear to be involved in the enzymatic regulation in MLCK-A (Fig. 2B), suggesting that it may not be physiological. In addition, only Thr phosphorylation of MLCK-A has been observed in vivo (17.Smith J.L. Silveira L.A. Spudich J.A.

This enzyme is synthesized primarily in adipose and muscle, is transferred to the luminal surface of endothelial cells, and associates with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This association with heparan sulfate proteoglycan is thought to localize LpL and direct liberated free fatty acids to the tissues where LpL is expressed (1.Merkel M. Eckel R.H. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1997-2006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). By creating transgenic mice expressing a heparin-binding mutant of human LpL (hLpLHBM), we showed that mice expressing this protein have an alteration in tissue delivery of fatty acids derived from lipoprotein TG (2.Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Kako Y. Melford K. Radner H. Breslow J.L. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The association of a protein with heparin is thought to have several biochemical implications. In the case of LpL, heparan sulfate proteoglycan association fixes LpL to the endothelial surface (3.Shimada K. Gill P.J. Silbert J.E. Douglas W.H. Fanburg B.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 995-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, heparin stabilizes LpL activity (4.Lookene A. Chevreuil O. Ostergaard P. Olivecrona G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12155-12163Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A similar process occurs for other heparin-binding proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor. Like basic fibroblast growth factor, LpL is a homodimeric or oligomeric molecule, and its dissociation into monomers is thought to be part of its regulation (5.Vlodavsky I. Miao H.Q. Medalion B. Danagher P. Ron D. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 6.Bergo M. Olivecrona G. Olivecrona T. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). High affinity heparin binding could stabilize LpL by maintaining LpL secondary and tertiary structure, thereby modulating the dissociation of LpL into monomeric units. In vitro studies have shown that active LpL can be produced when a short hinge is used to create a head to tail dimer of two monomeric subunits (7.Wong H. Yang D. Hill J.S. Davis R.C. Nikazy J. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Using this technique, we created a tandem repeat of hLpLHBM and expressed this protein in transgenic mice. This allowed us to study the role of heparin affinity in LpL stability and the importance of monomer to dimer assembly in the secretion of LpL from muscles. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Based on human heparin-binding site mutated LpL, hLpLHBM (2.Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Kako Y. Melford K. Radner H. Breslow J.L. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), a minigene was created that encodes for muscle-specific expression of two covalently linked hLpLHBM monomers in a head to tail configuration. First a PCR over the hLpLHBM-minigene Bluescript vector (pBhLpLHBM) was performed utilizing VENT polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), sense primer 1 (ctc cca cga gcg ctc cat tca), and antisense primer 2 (ttg ggg cga gcg ctc tcg agg cct gac ttc tta ttc aga gac tt). The PCR product contained the LpLHBM cDNA downstream from the unique Eco47/III restriction enzyme site. Furthermore, the stop codon was replaced by an XhoI site followed by an Eco47/III site. After Eco47/III digestion this fragment was inserted in the Eco47/III-digested pBhLpLHBM leading to the intermediate plasmid pBi1. A second PCR was performed utilizing the plasmid Xa-LpL-pcDNA3 (7.Wong H. Yang D. Hill J.S. Davis R.C. Nikazy J. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as a template. By using the primers aac tat cgg cgg ccg cac tcg agg tcg aag gtc gtc tcg aag ccg acc aa (primer 3) and atg aat gga gcg ctc gtg gga (primer 4), a fragment was produced that contained a linker region (amino acids Val, Glu, Gly, Arg, Leu, and Glu), 3′-flanked by NotI and XhoI restriction enzymes sites and 5′ followed by the human LpL cDNA starting with the coding region for the mature LpL protein (gcc at position 256 in the hLpL cDNA open reading frame). By using the NotI and Eco47/III sites, this PCR product was inserted in pBhLpLHBM to produce the intermediate plasmid pBi2. This generated a fragment containing the linker and the mature hLpL sequence coupled to the hLpLHBM minigene downstream from the Eco47/III site including the heparin binding mutations and the 3′-untranslated region. Finally, the linker LpL fragment of pBi2 was inserted in pBi1 by using the XhoI and EcoRV restriction enzyme sites. The resulting hLpLHBM-Dimer minigene (Fig. 1) was sequenced, purified, and used for production of transgenic mice. Founder animals were crossed with heterozygote LpL knockout mice that had been backcrossed seven times to C57BL/6. Pups heterozygote for both hLpLHBM-Dimer and the LpL knockout allele were crossed again with heterozygous LpL knockout mice mice. 12.5% of the subsequent pups were homozygous for the LpL knockout allele (LpL0) and heterozygote for the hLpLHBM-Dimer transgene. Mice expressing only hLpLHBM (2.Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Kako Y. Melford K. Radner H. Breslow J.L. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and nonmutated hLpL (8.Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H.

The genotype at the mouse LpL locus was analyzed by the 3′ PCR as described. The hLpLHBM-Dimer transgene was detected by oligonucleotides priming in the muscle creatine kinase promoter and the linker region. The hLpLHBM and hLpL transgenes were detected by utilizing the hLpL PCR (9.Levak-Frank S. Weinstock P.H. Hayek T. Verdery R. Hofmann W. Ramakrishnan R. Sattler W. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17182-17190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Plasma Lipid and Lipoprotein Analysis—The mice were fed a chow diet (4.5% fat, w/w). The plasma samples were collected after 6 h of daytime fasting. Plasma TG and cholesterol were determined with kits (Sigma-Aldrich) in duplicate. For lipoprotein analysis fast performance liquid chromatography analyses of pooled plasma, the samples were performed as described (10.Kako Y. Huang L.S. Yang J. Katopodis T. Ramakrishnan R. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2185-2194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, individual plasma samples (60 μl) were ultracentrifuged twice in a Beckman TLA-100 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) as described previously (11.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). LpL Mass and Activity Measurements—To obtain postheparin plasma (PHP), fasted mice were bled 5 min after a tail vein injection of 100 units of heparin/kg body weight (Elkins-Sinns, Cherry Hill, NJ). Human and murine LpL protein was measured by ELISA as described previously by Peterson et al. (12.Peterson J. Fujimoto W.Y. Brunzell J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1165-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LpL activity was measured by the method described by Hocquette et al. (13.Hocquette J.F. Graulet B. Olivecrona T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To distinguish lipolysis mediated by human LpL from activity caused by mouse LpL and hepatic lipase, the mouse plasma samples were assayed in the presence of a monoclonal antibody against human LpL (14.Goldberg I.J. Paterniti Jr., J.R. France D.S. Martinelli G. Cornicelli J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 878: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and under high salt conditions (final concentration, 1 m NaCl). LpL Stability—LpL stability was assessed using muscle homogenates of quadriceps muscles from transgenic mice. 100 mg of wet weight muscle was homogenized in 900 μl of homogenization buffer (25 mm NH4-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.8% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.01% (w/v) SDS, 5 units/ml heparin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.017 TIU/ml aprotinin, pH 8.2) as described (13.Hocquette J.F. Graulet B. Olivecrona T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 201-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After a 30-min centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatants were frozen in aliquots (–70 °C) and then defrosted just prior to stability experiments. To assay LpL stability, the LpL containing muscle homogenates were incubated in a water bath at 37 °C. At the indicated time points the aliquots were taken and immediately assayed for LpL activity. Northern and Western Blot Analysis of LpL from Quadriceps Muscles—For Northern blots, total RNA was prepared from quadriceps muscles and hearts of 12 week-old hLpLHBM/LpL0 and hLpLHBM-Dimer/LpL0 male mice using a kit (TRIzol™ reagent; Invitrogen). 15 μg of total RNA were applied to a 1% agarose gel and blotted to a Hybond-N Nylon Membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using standard techniques. The blot was hybridized with a probe spanning the ∼500-bp RsrII/HindIII fragment from the hLpL minigene and then autoradiographed. To confirm that equal amounts of RNA were loaded to each lane, the blot was probed for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. For Western blot analyses muscle homogenates of 20 week-old hLpL/LpL0 and hLpLHBM-Dimer/LpL0 male mice were obtained exactly as described above. To increase sensitivity, the homogenates were partially purified by heparin-Sepharose essentially as described (15.Zechner R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16.Ben-Avram C.M. Ben-Zeev O. Lee T.D. Haaga K. Shively J.E. Goers J. Pedersen M.E. Reeve Jr., J.R. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4185-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of resuspended heparin-Sepharose was added to 1 ml of muscle homogenate and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. The Sepharose was washed with a Tris-buffer containing 0.75 m NaCl. LpL then was eluted with 50 μl of a Tris buffer containing 1.5 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with 5 μl of eluates and blotting to nitrocellulose membranes were performed using standard techniques. The membrane was incubated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-bovine LpL antibody (SA1357; 1:2500 dilution) and an anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:5000 dilution). For SA1357 production, bovine LpL was kindly provided by Dr. G. Olivecrona (Umea, Sweden). The antibody was produced by Eurogentec (Herstal, Belgium). The bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Dimeric LpL in Cell Culture—A full-length cDNA for a tandem repeat dimeric LpL, LpLTR, has been reported (7.Wong H. Yang D. Hill J.S. Davis R.C. Nikazy J. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cDNA was purified, digested, and inserted into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). COS-7 and Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Co-precipitates of plasmid DNA and CaPO4 were prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions to mediate cell transfections. The calcium phosphate-DNA mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to addition to 50–60% confluent cells. For transient transfection of COS cells, the calcium phosphate-DNA mixture was left overnight on the cells and then removed by a rinse with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then treated with 3 ml of 10% (v/v) Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline for 2.5 min. After removal of the Me2SO solution, fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with serum substitute (Nutridoma; Roche Applied Science) and 20 units/ml heparin was added to each dish. The medium was harvested daily for a 3-day period and stored at –80 °C. Stably transfected CHL cells were selected by growth in the presence of Geneticin (G418, 500 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich). The surviving colonies were expanded and assayed for lipase activity. The cell clones with the highest levels of lipolytic activity were used for expression in T-225 flasks containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 1% Nutridoma and 10 units/ml heparin. The medium was harvested daily for up to 30 days and stored at –80 °C. Heparin-Sepharose Chromatography—Affinity chromatography was performed by using a fast performance liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) with a 1-ml Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C essentially as described (17.Sendak R.A. Bensadoun A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cell culture supernatants of hLpLHBM-Dimer or native hLpL expressing cells were loaded to the column. The LpL mass concentrations in the fractions were determined by ELISA as described (17.Sendak R.A. Bensadoun A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1310-1315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western Blots of PHP and Cell Culture LpL—PHP samples were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation and immunoprecipitation exactly as described (18.Ben-Zeev O. Doolittle M.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 257-266PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blot, the samples were mixed with a half-volume of buffer containing 2% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 50% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue. The mixtures were placed in boiling water for 5 min prior to loading onto a 7% acrylamide gel. The gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and subsequently blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin. After blocking, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody that detects human, but not mouse, LpL (5D2, kindly provided by J. Brunzell). The 5D2 epitope is in the C-terminal portion of native LpL (19.Chang S.F. Reich B. Brunzell J.D. Will H. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2350-2359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed with anti-mouse IgG conjugated to biotin. After washing, the blot was incubated with streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with chemiluminescent reagents (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film. Histological Analysis—Quadriceps muscles were dissected from 6-month-old male hLpLHBM-Dimer/wild type mouse LpL and wild type littermates and fixed in formaldehyde. Histological analyses were performed as described (20.Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In Vitro Expression of hLpLHBM-Dimer and Heparin Binding—Medium obtained from cells expressing native hLpL or hLpLHBM-Dimer was chromatographed. Elution of native LpL from heparin-Sepharose leads to two peaks: one peak eluting at >1 m NaCl that contains active dimeric enzyme (Fig. 2) and, commonly, a second peak that elutes with ∼0.75 m NaCl and is not associated with activity. Presumably this second peak is inactive monomeric or misfolded protein. LpLHBM primarily is found in the latter peak, as has been previously reported (2.Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Kako Y. Melford K. Radner H. Breslow J.L. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). LpLHBM-Dimer protein eluted with a single peak at ∼0.9 m NaCl. Thus, the construct produced an enzyme whose heparin affinity was lower than that of nonmutated LpL but greater than that of monomeric LpL. Dimer Expression in Muscle—Our studies of the transgenic mice focused on the actions of the hLpLHMB Dimer transgene on the LpL-deficient background because this allowed measurements of LpL without interference from the native enzyme. Northern blots were performed to verify that the hLpLHBM-Dimer construct was expressed in muscles from mice. As shown in Fig. 3A, the mRNA of the hLpLHMB Dimer/LpL0 mice expressing the dimeric construct led to a larger transcript than that found in hLpLHBM/LpL0 or hLpL/LpL0 mice. The line of mice that was bred also had much greater expression of the transgene. Moreover, these mice produced a larger LpL protein of ∼110 kDa in muscle tissue (Fig. 3B). This is the expected size of the dimeric protein. Enzyme Activity and Protein in Muscles—Homogenates of left quadriceps and hearts from mice expressing hLpL, hLpL-HBM, and hLpLHBM-Dimer constructs on the LpL0 background (n = 3 each line) were assayed for LpL activity and mass. The average activity found in the hLpLHBM-Dimer/LpL0 muscles (Fig. 4A) was similar to that in the hLpLHMB transgenics and greater that that found in mice expressing nonmutated human LpL (8.Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Walsh A. Stollberger R. Knipping G. Hoefler G. Sattler W. Weinstock P.H. Breslow J.L. Zechner R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). LpL protein was assayed in muscle homogenates from these three lines of mice. In concert with the RNA and activity data, hLpLHBM-Dimer muscles contained ∼1.5 times the LpL protein of hLpLHBM and more than 10 times as much protein as the line of hLpL-expressing mice (Fig. 4B). The specific activities in muscle tissues were 0.7 for hLpLHBM-Dimer versus 1.1 for hLpLHBM and 2.8 μmol of free fatty acid/μg/h for hLpL-expressing mice on LpL0 background (Fig. 4C). Muscle Histology—Histological analysis of quadriceps muscles from hLpLHBM-Dimer transgenic mice revealed no major pathological changes. A slight increase in lipocytes in the endomysium and subsarcolemmal enhancement of periodic acid Schiff-positive material, minor histopathologic changes, were noted in hLpLHBM-Dimer mice. Most significantly, no lipolysis-induced myopathy like that in mice overexpressing hLpL in muscles (21.Wallinder L. Peterson J. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) was seen in these animals. Stability of LpL Activity from Muscles of hLpLHBM-Dimer Mice—To determine whether the dimeric configuration altered the stability of the mutated LpL, muscle homogenates from each line of mice were incubated at 37 °C, and the activity was assessed over time (n = 3 each line). A slow decay of activity was found in muscles expressing both hLpL and hLpLHBM-Dimer (Fig. 4D). In contrast, hLpLHBM was less stable. Therefore, the instability associated with the mutation in heparin binding was corrected by creating the tethered dimer. Lipids and Lipoproteins in hLpLHBM-Dimer Transgenic Mice—Plasma lipids and lipoproteins were assessed in the hLpLHMB Dimer mice and were compared with the other transgenic lines. Although the hLpLHMB Dimer transgene rescued the LpL knockout mice, plasma TG in these mice was more than twice that found in animals expressing either the native hLpL or the hLpLHBM transgene (Table I). This was due to an increase in very low density lipoprotein TG as noted both by ultracentrifugation (Table I) and by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 5). Plasma cholesterol was not different between these mice. Thus, despite the robust expression of the hLpLHBM-Dimer transgene, these mice have higher TG. This suggested that either the dimer construct was less active in the plasma or that the amount of this LpL in the PHP did not parallel the muscle expression (Fig. 4).Table IPlasma lipidsTGCholesterolBackgroundhLpLHBM-DimerhLpLHBMhLpLhLpLHBM-DimerhLpLHBMhLpLnValuenValuenValuenValuenValuenValueLpL1eHeterozygous LpL deficiency.Plasma5114.6 ± 19.1ap < 0.05 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpLHBM.,bp < 0.01 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpL.583.3 ± 11.6570.0 ± 3.45107.5 ± 10.85109 ± 205107 ± 19LpL0Plasma6383.7 ± 162.9ap < 0.05 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpLHBM.,cp < 0.01 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpLHBM.7111.8 ± 16.3760.2 ± 16.1669.9 ± 14.9771.0 ± 8.5783.1 ± 18.8VLDL4405.3 ± 131.5ap < 0.05 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpLHBM.,dp < 0.05 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpL.459.3 ± 10.9419.5 ± 10.048.0 ± 9.748.8 ± 8.345.3 ± 1.7LDL433.7 ± 15.9415.3 ± 2.546.0 ± 5.24ND49.5 ± 1.3410.8 ± 2.2HDL420.3 ± 13.9411.0 ± 0.843.0 ± 2.4422.5 ± 6.2441.5 ± 1.9439.8 ± 2.1a p < 0.05 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpLHBM.b p < 0.01 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpL.c p < 0.01 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpLHBM.d p < 0.05 hLpLHBM-Dimervs. hLpL.e Heterozygous LpL deficiency. Open table in a new tab LpL Activity and Mass in PHP—The PHP LpL activities and masses of the three lines of mice are shown in Fig. 6. Surprisingly, hLpLHBM-Dimer/LpL0 mice had less LpL activity than mice expressing either hLpLHBM or hLpL despite the greater expression of this protein in the muscle. The specific activities in PHP were 0.7 for hLpLHBM-Dimerversus 1.5 for hLpLHBM and 4.5 μmol of free fatty acid/μg/h for hLpL expressing mice on LpL0 background. Thus, activity of the dimeric protein was unexpectedly low, which is consistent with the increased TG in these mice. PHP LpL Western Blots—Because muscle, but not PHP, from hLpLHBM-Dimer mice contained more LpL activity, we questioned whether the dimeric protein was altered either prior to or after its secretion. To test this the protein was first isolated using sucrose gradients; active LpL sedimented as a dimeric protein in all three samples (data not shown). Surprisingly, Western blots of PHP LpL from the hLpLHBM-Dimer transgenic mice produced a band the same size as bovine LpL and wild type human LpL, i.e. PHP did not contain covalently linked LpL dimers (Fig. 7). Thus, either the muscle did not secrete the covalent dimer LpL or the protein was degraded after its secretion. Expression of Dimeric LpL in Vitro—To test the possibility that the LpL dimer construct is “clipped” by cells, we expressed dimeric LpL protein in two different cell lines. To rule out the possibility that clipping of the dimeric construct was due to the C-terminal heparin-binding mutations, we utilized nonmutated covalent dimeric LpL for cell culture expression (LpLTR) (7.Wong H. Yang D. Hill J.S. Davis R.C. Nikazy J. Schotz M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5594-5598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). LpLTR was expressed in CHL cells and in COS cells. Western blots of medium from COS cells showed a dimeric-sized LpL protein (Fig. 8A). However, when the same construct was expressed in CHL cells, the medium contained only monomeric LpL. Thus, some cells and presumably tissues like muscle are unable to secrete dimeric forms of LpL. Western blot of cell fractions of CHL and COS cells expressing LpLTR showed that CHL cells contained intracellular products of the dimer of ∼ 85, 66, and 63 kDa (Fig. 8B). To further investigate where clipping of the covalent dimeric protein occurs, we looked for protease activity of cell culture supernatants of CHL cells. We mixed media of nontransfected CHL cells with supernatants of COS cells expressing LpLTR and incubated the samples for 1 h at room temperature. Then we assayed for lipase activity and analyzed the mixes by LpL Western blot. Nontransfected CHL medium did not affect lipase activity of transfected COS cell media, and no additional monomeric sized LpL band was detected by immunoblot, i.e. no proteolysis occurred. Also when medium from CHL cells that were stably transfected with LPLTR was mixed with the LpLTR-COS medium, the activity and size in Western blot analysis of the covalent dimeric protein remained unaffected. These results are in concert with additional experiments in which protease inhibitors like benzamidine or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not inhibit the clipping of LpLTR expressed by CHL cells. In conclusion there is no evidence for the involvement of an extracellular protease in this process, at least in the in vitro setting. Several processes are thought to be central to the regulation of LpL activity in vivo: 1) LpL is expressed as a monomeric protein and then assembled into a dimer to allow its physiological action; this appears to be a complex process (20.Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 2) LpL actions are limited by LpL dissociation from heparan sulfate proteoglycan on capillaries and its clearance in the liver (21.Wallinder L. Peterson J. Olivecrona T. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 795: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 3) The dissociation of the dimeric protein into subunits in the bloodstream then prevents further lipolysis from occurring. In a previous study we showed that a mutation in a heparin-binding region of LpL led to instability of the dimeric LpL complex. Large amounts of this mutated LpL were found in the pre-heparin plasma; however, we were unable to determine whether defective heparin binding per se or conversion of active LpL to monomers was the primary defect leading to enzyme instability (2.Lutz E.P. Merkel M. Kako Y. Melford K. Radner H. Breslow J.L. Bensadoun A. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). By creating a hinged dimer of heparin-binding defective LpL, we hoped to better understand the roles of heparin association and dimer to monomer interconversion in LpL biology. Our studies showed the following: 1) hLpLHBM-Dimer associated with heparin-Sepharose; however, it was dissociated with ∼0.9 m NaCl. Thus, its affinity for heparin was reduced compared with native LpL. 2) hLpLHBM-Dimer was expressed in high levels in muscles of transgenic mice, and the dimeric mRNA and protein were demonstrated. 3) Tissues from these mice had LpL activity with greater stability than that found with hLpLHBM. 4) Although the hLpLHBM-Dimer transgene rescued LpL knockout mice, the mice were hyperlipidemic. This suggested that the LpL was less active. 5) Despite the robust expression of this transgene in muscle, plasma LpL activity was less than in transgenic mice expressing hLpL and hLpLHBM, and the specific activity of the LpL was the lowest of the three lines of mice. Moreover, no covalently linked dimeric protein was found in the PHP of the hLpLHBM-Dimer transgenic mice. Thus, muscle inefficiently produces dimeric LpL, and conversion of dimer to monomers must occur either prior to or after secretion. 6) Similar clipping of the dimer occurred in CHL cells but not COS cells. Therefore the ability to secrete dimeric LpL is limited to only some types of cells. 7) Monomeric sized LpL fragments were found within these cells. Thus, it is likely that the clipping occurs intracellularly. In our previous studies of mutated LpL, alteration of C-terminal basic amino acids led to two effects: 1) reduced association of the protein with heparin and 2) reduced stability of the protein. By introducing this mutation into an obligate dimer, we hoped to dissect the roles of each of the processes in LpL biology. We first showed that hLpLHBM-Dimer was defective in heparin binding. Like the active forms of hLpLHBM, this protein eluted from a heparin affinity column at 0.8–0.9 m NaCl rather than >1.2 m NaCl, the elution of native LpL. When LpLHBM-Dimer was expressed within muscle, unlike hLpLHBM, dimeric protein had normal stability. Thus, tethering restored stability and suggested that defective heparin-association alone likely led to more rapid monomerization, which in turn reduced LpL activity. Several observations suggested that the dimeric LpL was processed aberrantly in vivo. Despite the robust expression of the transgene and large amounts of activity in the muscle homogenates, hLpLHBM-Dimer mice had higher TG than mice expressing hLpL and even hLpLHBM. Moreover, the specific activity of PHP hLpLHBM-Dimer was lowest in these mice. This led us to question whether hLpLHBM-Dimer was altered in some manner. Western blot analysis of PHP demonstrated only monomeric LpL-sized enzyme. Thus, the protein was inefficiently secreted because the PHP did not have more protein despite more robust muscle expression, and the dimer was clipped into monomeric units either prior to or after secretion from the muscle. Because culture of the myocytes from the transgenic mice was not a viable option, we studied other cells to determine whether they also degraded dimeric LpL into monomers. Moreover, we elected to study this effect using LpL that was not mutated so we could assess whether the clipping was due to the dimeric construct and not another mutation in the LpL. LpLTR was efficiently produced and secreted from COS but not from CHL cells. This surprising observation allowed us to understand the observations that we had in the hLpLHBM-Dimer mice. Skeletal muscles, like CHL cells, appear to be unable to secrete active dimeric LpL and clip the protein, which leads to only monomeric forms within the PHP. Several experiments were performed to determine the site of dimer proteolysis. Most interesting, we found that CHL but not COS cells secreted clipped dimer. Thus, the ability to produce dimeric forms of LpL was cell-specific and conceivably might be tissue-specific in vivo. We attempted to define where the proteolysis occurred. Medium from CHL cells did not appear to have a protease, and lysosomes inhibitors did not prevent cleavage of the dimer. However, intracellular cleavage of dimer occurred in the CHO cells. Thus, we postulate that dimeric protein is clipped within cells prior to its secretion. LpL is not unique in its requirement for dimeric association to optimize its biologic activity. Moreover, a number of dimeric molecules associate with heparin. Our data suggest that heparin maintenance of the dimer, rather than heparin association itself, stabilizes LpL because activity in muscles expressing mutated dimers was as stable as nonmutated LpL. Because the requirements for dimerization do not appear to be the most efficient method to produce an important metabolic enzyme, there have been a number of hypothesizes to explain this mode of synthesis. One obvious reason might be to allow for inactivation of the enzyme, thus preventing excessive local lipolysis and accumulation of toxic levels of reactive lipid products. Our data suggest an entirely new paradigm for monomeric protein production. As we found, in vivo, myocytes are incapable of efficient production of tethered dimeric LpL. In contrast, it is well established that LpL monomers assemble as dimers prior to their secretion from several cells types (20.Ben-Zeev O. Mao H.Z. Doolittle M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10727-10738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Either myocytes are different, or the requirements for secretion of the tethered dimer differ from that of the assembled homodimer. Although our studies are limited to LpL and its production in muscle, we hypothesize that the secretion pathways of other dimeric heparin-binding proteins are cell-specific. Maybe an intracellular or less likely an extracellular protease, in some cells, specifically prevents production of tethered dimeric proteins."
