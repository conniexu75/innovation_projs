https://openalex.org/W4312097907,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer (BC) that currently lacks specific therapy options. Thus, chemotherapy continues to be the primary treatment, and developing novel targets is a top clinical focus. The androgen receptor (AR) has emerged as a therapeutic target in a subtype of TNBC, with substantial clinical benefits shown in various clinical studies. Numerous studies have shown that cancer is associated with changes in components of the cell cycle machinery. Although cell cycle cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors are successful in the treatment of ER-positive BC, they are not helpful in the treatment of patients with TNBC. We investigated the possibility of combining CDK4/6 inhibitor(ribociclib) with AR inhibitor(enzalutamide) in the AR-positive TNBC cell line. Ribociclib showed an inhibitory effect in TNBC cells. Additionally, we found that enzalutamide reduced cell migration/invasion, clonogenic capacity, cell cycle progression, and cell growth in AR-positive cells. Enzalutamide therapy could increase the cytostatic impact of ribociclib in AR + TNBC cells. Furthermore, dual inhibition of AR and CDK4/6 demonstrated synergy in an AR + TNBC model compared to each treatment alone."

A variety of models are evaluated at the county level for goodness-of-fit and an assessment of confounding predictors is also made. It is found that models with three deprivation predictors and neighborhood effects are important. In addition, the work index from Google mobility was also found to provide an increased explanation of the transmission dynamics."

Participants in the SAEP group underwent an exercise protocol including 8 sessions over 11 days progressing in duration and intensity stepwise based on participants' age-predicted maximal heart rate. Symptom follow-ups were on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. The primary outcome measures of the study were days to asymptomatic status and days to medical clearance, while the secondary outcome measure was symptom severity on days 7, 14, 21, and 28.38 participants (SAEP, n = 20; UCEP, n = 19) were recruited and completed all follow-up appointments. Compared to the UCEP group, the SAEP had a faster time to asymptomatic status with 96% posterior probability. In addition, the SAEP group displayed an earlier time to medical clearance with 93% posterior probability. While symptom severity scores did not differ between groups at enrolment (SAEP symptom severity, 30; UCEP, 29), they were subsequently lower in the SAEP group at all assessments throughout the trial with 100% posterior probability.An aerobic exercise protocol based on percentages of age-predicted maximum heart rate is a safe and effective treatment for reducing symptoms and can be initiated during the first week following SRC.ClinicalTrials.gov, no.

https://openalex.org/W4312090125,"Immunization by vaccination is one of the most important tools for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet in many countries, immunization campaigns have been hampered by vaccine hesitancy within the population. Building on the idea that vaccination decisions are embedded in the broader societal context, we study the role of generalized trust—the belief that most people can generally be trusted—in vaccine acceptance. Immunization campaigns face an inherent collective action problem: As all individuals benefit collectively from high immunization rates regardless of individual contribution, especially those with a low risk of severe COVID infection have an incentive to decide against the (perceived) costs and risks of vaccination. We argue that generalized trust may help to overcome this problem by encouraging the belief that cooperation for the common good is achievable and that those who cooperate are unlikely to be exploited by others. We further argue that the positive effect of generalized trust on vaccination decisions is weaker among individuals who are at higher risk of severe outcomes from the disease, as the collective action problem is less pronounced in this group. To test our predictions, we used data from the SOEP-CoV survey, which queried a representative probability sample of Germany’s population between January and February 2021 on topics connected to the pandemic. Using multiple logistic regression models, and in line with expectations, we found a positive and robust link between generalized trust and the willingness to accept vaccination as soon as offered. However, overall, our examination of heterogeneous effects does not unequivocally support the idea that the role of generalized trust varies according to individual COVID risk."
https://openalex.org/W4312091461,"Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is the process where cancer cells adopt endothelial characteristics by forming tube-like structures and perfusing channels. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in several types of solid tumors and associated with the growth and survival of tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the presence of VM formation in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the VM process. In human PDAC tissues, CD31-negative, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive channels were predominantly found in desmoplastic areas, which are generally also hypovascularized. We found a positive correlation of VM capacity to tumor size and NOTCH1 expression and nuclear localization with statistical significance, implicating that Notch activity is involved with VM formation. Additionally, our data showed that the presence of growth or angiogenic factors significantly increased Notch activity in PDAC cell lines and upregulated several mesenchymal marker genes, such as TWIST1 and SNAI1 , which can be inhibited by a gamma-secretase inhibitor. Our data showed that Notch signaling plays an important role in inducing VM formation in PDAC by promoting the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition process."
https://openalex.org/W4312091471,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a rising public health problem that may progress to kidney failure, requiring kidney replacement therapy. It is also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of its asymptomatic nature, CKD is often detected in a late stage. Population screening for albuminuria could allow early detection of people with CKD who may benefit from preventive treatment. In case such screening is performed in a general practitioner (GP) setting, this will result in relatively high costs. Home-based screening might be an effective and cost-effective alternative.The THOMAS study (Towards HOMe-based Albuminuria Screening) is designed to prospectively investigate two methods for home-based population screening for increased albuminuria to detect yet undiagnosed CKD and risk factors for progression and CVD.This investigator initiated, randomized population-based study will include 15.000 individuals aged 45-80 years, who will be randomly assigned to be invited for a home-based screening test for albuminuria with a more conventional urine collection device or an innovative smartphone application. If the test result is positive upon confirmation (i.e., elevated albuminuria), participants are invited to a central screening facility for an elaborate screening for CKD and CVD risk factors. Participants are referred to their GP for appropriate treatment, if abnormalities are found. Primary endpoints are the participation rate, yield, and cost-effectiveness of the home-based screening and elaborate screening.The THOMAS study will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of home-based albuminuria screening in the general population for the early detection of CKD and CVD risk factors. It will provide insight into the willingness to participate in population screening for CKD and into the compliance of the general population to a corresponding screening protocol and compliance to participate. Thus, it may help to develop an attractive novel screening strategy for the early detection of CKD.ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number NCT04295889, registered 05 March 2020. https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=NCT04295889."
https://openalex.org/W3186916054,"COVID-19, as a global health crisis, has triggered the fear emotion with unprecedented intensity. Besides the fear of getting infected, the outbreak of COVID-19 also created significant disruptions in people's daily life and thus evoked intensive psychological responses indirect to COVID-19 infections. In this study, we construct a panel expressed fear database tracking the universe of social media posts (16 million) generated by 536 thousand individuals between January 1st, 2019 and August 31st, 2020 in China. We employ deep learning techniques to detect expressions of fear emotion within each post, and then apply topic model to extract the major topics of fear expressions in our sample during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our unique database includes a comprehensive list of topics, not being limited to post centering around COVID-19. Based on this database, we find that sleep disorders (""nightmare"" and ""insomnia"") take up the largest share of fear-labeled posts in the pre-pandemic period (January 2019-December 2019), and significantly increase during the COVID-19. We identify health and work-related concerns are the two major sources of non-COVID fear during the pandemic period. We also detect gender differences, with females having higher fear towards health topics and males towards monetary concerns. Our research shows how applying fear detection and topic modeling techniques on posts unrelated to COVID-19 can provide additional policy value in discerning broader societal concerns during this COVID-19 crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4312090211,"Due to the severity and speed of spread of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, fast but accurate diagnosis of Covid-19 patients has become a crucial task. Achievements in this respect might enlighten future efforts for the containment of other possible pandemics. Researchers from various fields have been trying to provide novel ideas for models or systems to identify Covid-19 patients from different medical and non-medical data. AI-based researchers have also been trying to contribute to this area by mostly providing novel approaches of automated systems using convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep neural network (DNN) for Covid-19 detection and diagnosis. Due to the efficiency of deep learning (DL) and transfer learning (TL) models in classification and segmentation tasks, most of the recent AI-based researches proposed various DL and TL models for Covid-19 detection and infected region segmentation from chest medical images like X-rays or CT images. This paper describes a web-based application framework for Covid-19 lung infection detection and segmentation. The proposed framework is characterized by a feedback mechanism for self learning and tuning. It uses variations of three popular DL models, namely Mask R-CNN, U-Net, and U-Net++. The models were trained, evaluated and tested using CT images of Covid patients which were collected from two different sources. The web application provide a simple user friendly interface to process the CT images from various resources using the chosen models, thresholds and other parameters to generate the decisions on detection and segmentation. The models achieve high performance scores for Dice similarity, Jaccard similarity, accuracy, loss, and precision values. The U-Net model outperformed the other models with more than 98% accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W4312090237,"Nitrate (NO3-1) leaching from soils results in the lower soil fertility, reduced crop productivity and increased water pollution. The effects of bentonite clay mixed with various nitrogen (N) fertilizers on NO3-1 leaching from sandy soils haven't been extensively studied. Therefore, the present lysimetric study determined NO3-1 leaching from bentonite [0, 2 and 4% (m/m)] treated sandy soil under three N sources (calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)2], ammonium chloride [NH4Cl], and urea [CO(NH2)2] at the rate of 300 kg N ha-1). Results showed that bentonite markedly reduced NO3-1 release in the leachate, while 4% bentonite retained higher NO3 in the soil. The NO3-1 leaching from sandy soil varied with N sources as Ca(NO3)2 > NH4Cl > (CO(NH2)2. At early stages of leaching, higher concentrations of NO3-1 were detected in leachate with both NH4Cl and Ca(NO3)2, but leaching of NO3-1 increased with urea at later leaching stages. The amount of total NO3-1 retained in soil was conversely related to the amount of NO3-1 in the leachate. This study indicated that soil amendment with bentonite could efficiently mitigate NO3-1 leaching from sandy soil and hence prevent N fertilizer losses and groundwater pollution."
https://openalex.org/W4312090263,"Gait pattern classification in individuals with lower-limb amputation could help in developing personalized prosthetic prescriptions and tailored gait rehabilitation. However, systematic classifications of gait patterns in this population have been scarcely explored. This study aimed to determine whether the gait patterns in individuals with unilateral transfemoral amputation (UTFA) can be clustered into homogeneous subgroups using spatiotemporal parameters across a range of walking speeds. We examined spatiotemporal gait parameters, including step length and cadence, in 25 individuals with UTFA (functional level K3 or K4, all non-vascular amputations) while they walked on a split-belt instrumented treadmill at eight speeds. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to identify clusters with homogeneous gait patterns based on the relationships between step length and cadence. Furthermore, after cluster formation, post-hoc analyses were performed to compare the spatiotemporal parameters and demographic data among the clusters. HCA identified three homogeneous gait pattern clusters, suggesting that individuals with UTFA have several gait patterns. Further, we found significant differences in the participants' body height, sex ratio, and their prosthetic knee component among the clusters. Therefore, gait rehabilitation should be individualized based on body size and prosthetic prescription."
https://openalex.org/W4312091467,"Traditional uvulectomy is widely practiced in Africa especially in sub-Saharan countries including Ethiopia. Studies conducted in different times and areas of the world have shown that the level of practice of uvulectomy and its associated factors were varied from country to country. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess the practice and associated factors of traditional uvulectomy among caregivers having children less than 5 years old in the South Gondar Zone.This study aimed to assess practice and associated factors of traditional uvulectomy among caregivers having children less than 5 years old in South Gondar Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia, 2020.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 634 participants who were selected using a multistage with a simple random sampling method. Data were collected using a structured interviewer-administered Amharic version questionnaire; it was entered into Epi Data and analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics were calculated and logistic regressions were fitted to declare statistical significance at p-value < 0.05 and 95% CI.The prevalence of traditional uvulectomy in this study was 52.5% (95% CI, 48.6-56.3%). Moreover, lack of information [AOR = 2.975 (1.677-5.277)], perceived as uvula causes illness [AOR = 4.888 (2.954-8.086)], future intention or will perform [AOR = 4.188 (2.584-6.788)], perceived as traditional uvulectomy should not be eradicated [AOR = 1.893 (1.172-3.057)]), saw the previous good result [AOR = 9.396 (5.512-16.016)], health personnel hospitality problem [AOR = 5.922 (2.392-14.664)] and did not get cured by pharmacologic treatment [AOR = 3.918 (2.073, 7.405)] were significantly associated with traditional uvulectomy.The prevalence of traditional uvulectomy was high. Lack of information, perceived as uvula causes illness, future intention to uvulectomy, perceived as traditional uvulectomy should not be eradicated, saw the previous good result, health personnel hospitality problem and did not get cured by pharmacologic treatment were the factors significantly associated with traditional uvula cutting.

https://openalex.org/W4312091475,"Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like social distancing, face masks, and handwashing will continue to be a frontline defense against Covid-19 for some time. But their effectiveness depends critically on compliance by young adults, who are most likely both to become infected and to infect others. We conducted a randomized controlled trial in Bogotá, Colombia, to assess the effectiveness of informational nudges emphasizing the private and public benefits of compliance on university students' concern about Covid-19, recent compliance with NPI recommendations, and intended future compliance. Although nudges boosted concern, they had limited effects on either recent or intended future compliance. We attribute these null results to high baseline levels of information about and compliance with NPIs, an informational diminishing returns scenario that is likely to be increasingly common globally."
https://openalex.org/W4312091479,"This study examined the reliability and validity of a Shame and Stigma Scale (SSS) and assessed shame and stigma among patients with facial disfigurement from nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).Data were collected from 218 patients with NPC through a cross-sectional survey between January 14, 2020, and December 1, 2020. The original SSS is a 20-item scale with four dimensions (i.e., shame with appearance, sense of stigma, regret, and social/speech concern). We used Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega to assess reliability and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess the factor structure. We also used Pearson correlation analysis to examine the relationship between each item and total score of scale items and convergent validity.The final 18-item SSS had a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .89. The EFA revealed that the SSS has a four-factor structure: sense of stigma, social/speech concern, shame with appearance, and regret. These factors showed satisfactory reliability, with McDonald's omega coefficients of .87, .77, .86, and .79, respectively. The scale showed significant relationship between each item and total score of scale items with respect to item-total correlations, item-subscale correlations, and item-other-subscale correlations. Convergent validity was supported by the significant positively correlated with the total scores for depression and anxiety.The SSS is valid and reliable in assessing shame and stigma and monitoring treatment compliance among patients with NPC."
https://openalex.org/W4312091489,"In the estimation of demand functions for energy resources, parametric econometric models of energy demand are commonly used to predict future energy needs. The functional forms commonly assumed in parametric energy demand models include linear functional forms, log-linear forms, trans-log models, and an almost ideal demand system. It is frequently debated which is the ""best"" functional form to employ in order to accurately represent the underlying relationships between the demand for various energy resources and explanatory variables such as energy prices, income, and other demographic factors. The study has focused on developing proper non-nested tests to compare the two demand systems, the double log model and the LA-AIDS model. C-test is used to test the validity of using the two parametric functional forms in models of residential energy demand. Cross-sectional household-level data of the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) 2013-14 and Asian Development Bank (ADB) Asia and Pacific 2018 are used. Results indicate that the LA-AIDS model is better than the double log model. The estimated elasticity of own prices, cross-prices, and income in terms of spending, family size, and equipment are particularly important to producers and policymakers in making investment and incentive choices. A significant part of the budget for families is for electricity, natural gas, firewood, and other fuels; smaller budget shares are set down to other items such as kerosene oil, cylinder gas, and diesel. Household per capita demand for energy resources will rise over the next decade; therefore, the government needs to make progress on developing energy-saving strategies. If not addressed the issue properly, we may face energy shortages and high energy import bills."
https://openalex.org/W4312097916,"Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a gastrointestinal disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of vomiting. Previous studies have provided reliable data on the prevalence of CVS among children in Japan; however, neither prevalence data nor incidence of CVS is available for adults. Hence, we obtained detailed prevalence and incidence data for CVS and estimated the total number of CVS cases in Japan. This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using the JMDC (JMDC, Inc.; formerly known as Japan Medical Data Center Co., Ltd.,) database, which is a de-identified Japanese claims database. Individuals enrolled between January 2017 and December 2017 were included in this study. Longitudinal data for eligible populations were used to identify patients who displayed CVS symptoms throughout the follow-up period. Due to the lack of a specific diagnosis code for CVS in 2017, the Rome IV criteria were applied to identify CVS cases in the pediatric and adult populations. The prevalence was standardized to the 2017 Japanese census and extrapolated to estimate the number of CVS cases. A total of 2,093 patients with CVS were identified from 3,506,144 individuals. The overall age-and-sex-standardized prevalence was 0.32 per 1,000 population (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.30–0.34), projected to approximately 49,000 patients with CVS across Japan. The pediatric age-and-sex-standardized prevalence was 2.10 per 1,000 population (95% CI: 2.01–2.19), and the adult prevalence was 0.05 per 1,000 population (95% CI: 0.04–0.06). Marked sex differences were observed before and after 12 years of age. Thus our study provides the first large-population-based estimates of CVS prevalence and incidence in Japan, and currently, the only estimates for adult CVS in Japan."

A task represents a service, which must be performed by one or multiple ground crew of a shift with required qualification/proficiency within a prescribed time period. For every assigned task, define “task priority” times “task duration” as the “benefit” generated. The objective is to maximize the summation of “benefit” for all the assigned tasks. The problem is modeled as an integer linear programming problem with mathematical formulation. A branch-and-price algorithm is proposed for solving the problem instances to optimality. To expedite the column generation process, an acceleration strategy is proposed. The computational results show that our proposed branch-and-price algorithm is capable of solving large-sized instances and the acceleration strategy is quite effective in reducing the computational time. Moreover, the impact of changing various characteristics of tasks and shifts on the performance of the algorithm is studied in detail with supporting computational experiments. In particular, the impact of reducing the qualifications is significant with 20.82% improvement in the objective value."
https://openalex.org/W4312097994,"This study aimed to describe the relationship between the different levels of intraoperative mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal laparoscopic surgery.This prospective controlled clinical trial enrolled 116 patients aged 65 to 85 years who underwent gastrointestinal laparoscopic surgery. These patients were randomized 1:1 to a MAP goal of 65 to 85 mmHg (L group) or an 86 to 100 mmHg (H group). The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative delirium, assessed twice daily with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) during the first five postoperative days. Delirium severity was evaluated with the Delirium-O-Meter (D-O-M).108 patients (L group n = 55, H group n = 53) were eventually included in intention-to-treat analyses. Postoperative delirium occurred in 18 (32.7%) of 55 cases of L group and in 15 (28.3%) of 53 cases of H group. The incidence of delirium subtypes between the two groups: hypoactive delirium 14.5% (8/55) vs 11.3% (6/53); hyperactive delirium 7.3% (4/55) vs 3.8% (2/53); mixed delirium 10.9% (6/55) vs 13.2% (7/53). However, the L group showed higher D-O-M scores of the first episode of delirium: 14.5 (Q1 = 12, Q3 = 18.5) vs 12 (Q1 = 10, Q3 = 14), which means the delirium is more severe.Compared with 65 to 85 mmHg, maintaining intraoperative MAP at 86-100 mmHg did not reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal laparoscopic surgery. However, the severity of delirium could be reduced and blood loss is a risk factor for postoperative delirium."

The calculation of direct costs for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) was made from the accounting sum of costs with hospitalizations and outpatient care found in the National Health System (Hospital Information System and Outpatient Information System), from 2017 to 2019, including the costs of treatment, such as medical consultations, medical procedures, and drugs. Regarding the indirect costs, they were measured by the loss of human capital, given the premature death, resulting in loss of productivity. To define the attributable costs, they were multiplied by the PAF.Higher burden of CVD attributable to the consumption of salt, saturated fat and trans fat were observed in younger individuals, which progressively decreased with advancing age, but still generated economic costs in the order of US$ 7.18 billion, in addition to 1.53 million productive years of life lost (YLL) to premature death, if considering salt as an inducer. Although attributable burden of CVD is higher among younger individuals, the highest costs are associated with males aged 45 to 74 years old for direct costs and 45 to 64 years old for indirect costs.The attributable fractions to consumption of salt are the ones that cause the most effects on CVD, followed by saturated fat and trans fat, with direct and indirect costs being higher for males."
https://openalex.org/W4312098322,"Background Prior research has found a high prevalence of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) among sexual minority men (SMM) in the US, and has indicated that CSA is associated with higher rates of alcohol and drug use disorders. However, most of these studies have focused almost exclusively on White SMM. We assessed associations of CSA, alcohol use, and drug use problems among adult Black SMM. Methods Participants were 1,016 Black SMM recruited from six US cities (Atlanta, Boston, Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, and Washington, DC) between July 2009 and December 2011. We used hierarchical logistic regression to evaluate the associations between CSA, alcohol use problems (≥ 8 AUDIT), and drug use problems (excluding marijuana). Results Mean (SD) age was 37.8 (11.7) years, and 28.6% and 49.2% reported alcohol and drug use disorders in the past six months, respectively. Most of the study participants reported history of CSA (70.3%). Adjusting for sociodemographic and confounding variables, CSA was associated with higher odds of alcohol use problems (odds ratio (OR) = 1.52, 95% CI 1.09, 2.12) and drug use problems (OR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.19, 2.10) than non-CSA group. Conclusion Prevalence of CSA is high among BSMM in the US and is positively associated with alcohol and drug use problems. Substance use interventions should address the psychological health needs of BSMM with a history of CSA."
https://openalex.org/W4312098330,"In general, the ultimate parameter selection method of the failure approach index theory among the three-dimensional problems in geotechnical engineering is unclear in theory, and the symbol convention of the failure approach index in engineering calculation is contrary to the stipulation of the numerical simulation software. Hence, the values of the ultimate plastic shear strain are difficult to determine. To solve this problem, the criterion of positive tension and negative compression and the sequence of the principal stress σ 1 ≤ σ 2 ≤ σ 3 are defined in this paper, and the expression of Mohr–Coulomb yield approach index id deduced. Under the condition of the principal strain sequence ε 1 ≤ ε 2 ≤ ε 3 , the formula of the ultimate shear strain is derived using the method of the ultimate strain analysis so as to obtain the simple expression and calculation method of the ultimate plastic shear strain, which has provided the calculation parameters for the three-dimensional ultimate plastic shear strain in the Mohr–Coulomb strain softening model and improved the failure approach index theory. In the light of the aforementioned theory, the ultimate strains of cubic concrete specimens are analyzed, and the obtained ultimate strain values are found consistent with previous research findings, which verifies the correctness and reliability of the ultimate strain analysis method. In addition, it is applied to the quantitative elastic–plastic failure analysis of the section coal pillar in Hengjin coal industry for determining its reasonable retainment width. Consequently, the research results can be embraced as the theoretical basis for the stability analysis of geotechnical materials and exhibits engineering application potential."
https://openalex.org/W4312090054,"Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine the ocular and systemic risk profile of the fundus phenotype ≥ 20 small hard (macular) drusen (&lt; 63 μm in diameter). Methods This single-center, cross-sectional study of 176 same-sex twin pairs aged 30 to 80 (median 60) years was a component of a framework study of the transition from not having age-related macular degeneration to having early AMD. Drusen categories assessed using fundus photography and optical coherence tomography included small hard drusen (diameter &lt; 63 μm), intermediate soft drusen (63–125 μm), and large soft drusen (&gt; 125 μm), of which the soft drusen are compatible with a diagnosis of AMD. Results Having ≥ 20 small hard drusen within or outside the macula was associated with increasing age, lower body mass index, shorter axial length, hyperopia, female sex, increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), high alcohol consumption, and with the presence of soft drusen. Conclusions Having ≥ 20 small hard drusen was associated with some AMD-related risk factors, but not with smoking, increasing body mass index, and higher blood pressure. Having ≥ 20 small hard drusen was also associated with soft drusen, in agreement with previous studies. These findings suggest that small hard drusen are not an early manifestation of AMD but the product of a distinct process of tissue alteration that promotes the development of AMD or some subtype thereof."
https://openalex.org/W4312090145,"Background Problem anger is common after experiencing a traumatic event. Current evidence-driven treatment options are limited, and problem anger negatively affects an individual’s capacity to engage with traditional psychological treatments. Smartphone interventions hold significant potential in mental health because of their ability to deliver low-intensity, precision support for individuals at the time and place they need it most. While wearable technology has the capacity to augment smartphone-delivered interventions, there is a dearth of evidence relating to several key areas, including feasibility of compliance in mental health populations; validity of in vivo anger assessment; ability to predict future mood states; and delivery of timely and appropriate interventions. Methods This protocol describes a cohort study that leverages 10 days of ambulatory assessment in the form of ecological momentary assessment and a wearable. Approximately 100 adults with problem anger will complete four-hourly in vivo mobile application-delivered micro-surveys on anger intensity, frequency, and verbal and physical aggression, as well as other self-reported mental health and wellbeing measures. Concurrently, a commercial wearable device will continuously record indicators of physiological arousal. The aims are to test the feasibility and acceptability of ambulatory assessment in a trauma-affected population, and determine whether a continuously measured physiological indicator of stress predicts self-reported anger intensity. Discussion This study will contribute new data around the ability of physiological indicators to predict mood state in individuals with psychopathology. This will have important implications for the design of smartphone-delivered interventions for trauma-affected individuals, as well as for the digital mental health field more broadly."

Given that psychopathy includes a proficiency for manipulating others, one might expect an elevated ability to identify and use information about others’ emotions. On the other hand, empathic deficits in psychopathy could arise from reduced emotional awareness. Further, heterogeneity in psychopathy may also play a role, wherein ‘secondary’ psychopathy is associated with early adversity and high negative affect, while ‘primary’ psychopathy is not. In this paper, we tested the relationship between EA and psychopathic tendencies in 177 undergraduate students (40 males) who completed the levels of emotional awareness scale (LEAS), the triarchic psychopathy measure (TPM), the affective (empathy-related) subscales of the interpersonal reactivity index (IRI), and two measures of early adversity: the childhood experiences of care and abuse questionnaire (CECA) and the childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ). We found that lower LEAS scores were associated with higher TPM and lower IRI empathy scores, but these relationships were primarily present in those with early adversity and high negative affect. This suggests that lower EA may be selectively associated with higher levels of secondary psychopathy, while those with higher levels of primary psychopathy remain capable of higher EA."
https://openalex.org/W4312090246,"Among populations globally, many healthcare workers have been disproportionally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic because of their above average exposure to people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals is particularly challenging, if those individuals continue to work, not knowing that they are potentially infectious. This study aimed to measure the level of asymptomatic infection in a cohort of workers in a healthcare setting in Turkey during the second major wave of infection in late 2020. Blood samples were collected and tested by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. Nasal and throat swabs were performed in a subset of this cohort and RT-qPCR was used to search for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The results showed that approximately 23% of the cohort were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies and approximately 22% were positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies despite no reported history of COVID-19 symptoms. Just less than 30% of a subset of the group were positive for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA indicating the likelihood of a current or recent infection, again despite a lack of typical COVID-19 associated symptoms. This study indicates a high rate of asymptomatic infection and highlights the need for regular testing of groups such as healthcare workers when community prevalence of disease is high and there is a desire to limit entry of virus into settings where vulnerable people may be present, because symptoms cannot be relied on as indicators of infection or infectiousness."
https://openalex.org/W4312091459,"Evolutionary history leads to genome changes over time, especially for species that have experienced intense selective pressures over a short period. Here, we investigated the genomic evolution of Bos species by searching for potential selection signatures, focusing on Nelore, an economically relevant cattle breed in Brazil. We assessed the genomic processes determining the molecular evolution across Nelore and thirteen other related taxa by evaluating (i) amino acid sequence conservation, (ii) the dN/dS ratio, and (iii) gene families' turnover rate (λ). Low conserved regions potentially associated with fatty acid metabolism seem to reflect differences in meat fat content in taxa with different evolutionary histories. All Bos species presented genes under positive selection, especially B. indicus and Nelore, which include transport protein cobalamin, glycolipid metabolism, and hormone signaling. These findings could be explained by constant selective pressures to obtain higher immune resistance and efficient metabolism. The gene contraction rate across the Nelore + B. indicus branch was almost nine times higher than that in other lineages (λ = 0.01043 vs. 0.00121), indicating gene losses during the domestication process. Amino acid biosynthesis, reproductive and innate immune system-related pathways were associated with genes recognized within the most frequent rapidly evolving gene families and in genes under positive selection, supporting the substantial relevance of such traits from a domestication perspective. Our data provide new insights into how the genome may respond to intense artificial selection in distinct taxa, and reinforces the presence of selective pressures on traits potentially relevant for future animal breeding investments."
https://openalex.org/W4312091483,"Common marmosets have been widely used in biomedical research for years. Nutritional control is an important factor in managing their health, and insect intake would be beneficial for that purpose because common marmosets frequently feed on insects in natural habitats. Here, we examined the effect of enhanced insect feeding on the gut by analysing the faecal microbiota and transcripts of captive marmosets. A family consisting of six marmosets was divided into two groups. During the seven-day intervention period, one group (the insect feeding group, or Group IF) was fed one cricket and one giant mealworm per marmoset per day, while the other (the control group, or Group C) was not fed these insects. RNA was extracted from faecal samples to evaluate the ecology and transcripts of the microbiota, which were then compared among time points before (Pre), immediately after (Post), and two weeks after the intervention (Follow_up) using total RNA sequencing. The gut microbiota of marmosets showed Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria as dominant phyla. Linear discriminant analysis showed differential characteristics of microbiota with and without insect feeding treatment. Further analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed increases and decreases in Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, respectively, corresponding to the availability of insects under both Post and Follow_up conditions. Significant changes specific to insect feeding were also detected within the transcriptome, some of which were synchronized with the fluctuations in the microbiota, suggesting a functional correlation or interaction between the two. The rapid changes in the microbiota and transcripts may be achieved by the microbiota community originally developed in the wild through marmosets' feeding ecology. The results were informative for identifying the physiological impact of insect feeding to produce a better food regimen and for detecting transcripts that are currently unidentifiable."
https://openalex.org/W4312091485,"Preterm delivery is greatly associated with perinatal mortality and morbidity, while there is no objective way to identify high-risk newborns currently. This study aimed at discovering the risk factor for Apgar score less than 7 at 1 minute of preterm neonates born with vaginal delivery. A retrospective study was performed in single pregnancy women with a vaginal delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. All the preterm infants were categorized into three types: very preterm birth (28 to 32 weeks), moderate preterm birth (32 to 34 weeks) and late preterm birth (34 to 37 weeks). Risk factors were identified through logistic regression analysis in every category of newborns mentioned above. And the receiver operating characteristic analysis was used in continuous variables to determine the best threshold of the outcome. On the basis of the selected factors, the predicting models are created and its prognosticating ability is compared by the area under the curve. A nomogram was established for the proved best model. A total of 981 cases were investigated, of whom 55 were found with 1 min Apgar scores less than 7. The nomogram was set for the predicting model with larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, of which is 0.742(95% confidence interval = 0.670–0.805) in very preterm birth, with the variables of first and second labor stage(&gt; = 1.6 hours), birthweight and MgSO4(magnesium sulfate), and is 0.807(95% confidence interval = 0.776–0.837) in late preterm birth, with the variables of second labor stage(&gt; = 1.23 hours), birthweight, a history of previous cesarean delivery, fetal distress and placental abruption. The combination of first and second labor stage, newborn weight and MgSO4 use can predict 74.2% of 1 minute Apgar score &lt; 7 in very preterm neonates. And 80.7% high-risk infants can be identified when second labor stage, newborn weight, VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) and the occur of placental abruption and fetal distress were combined in the predicting model for late preterm birth. These predicting models would bring out great assistance towards obstetricians and reduce unnecessary adverse fetal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4312091521,"Monogenic, high penetrance syndromes, conferring an increased risk of malignancies in multiple organs, are important contributors to the hereditary burden of cancer. Early detection and risk reduction strategies in patients with a cancer predisposition syndrome can save their lives. However, despite evidence supporting the benefits of early detection and risk reduction strategies, most Canadian jurisdictions have not implemented programmatic follow up of these patients. In our study site in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada, there is no centralized, provincial registry of high-risk individuals. There is no continuity or coordination of care providing cancer genetics expertise and no process to ensure that patients are referred to the appropriate specialists or risk management interventions. This paper describes a study protocol to test the feasibility of obtaining and analyzing patient risk management data, specifically patients affected by hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC; BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes) and Lynch syndrome (LS; MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6 , and PMS2 genes). Through a retrospective cohort study, we will describe these patients’ adherence to risk management guidelines and test its relationship to health outcomes, including cancer incidence and stage. Through a qualitative interviews, we will determine the priorities and preferences of patients with any inherited cancer mutation for a follow up navigation model of risk management. Study data will inform a subsequent funding application focused on creating and evaluating a research registry and follow up nurse navigation model. It is not currently known what proportion of cancer mutation carriers are receiving care according to guidelines. Data collected in this study will provide clinical uptake and health outcome information so gaps in care can be identified. Data will also provide patient preference information to inform ongoing and planned research with cancer mutation carriers."
https://openalex.org/W4312091530,"In macroeconomics, an emerging discussion of alternative monetary systems addresses the dimensions of systemic risk in advanced financial systems. Monetary regime changes with the aim of achieving a more sustainable financial system have already been discussed in several European parliaments and were the subject of a referendum in Switzerland. However, their effectiveness and efficacy concerning macro-financial stability are not well-known. This paper defines the economic requirements for modeling the current monetary system and introduces the corresponding macroeconomic agent-based model (MABM) in a continuous-time stochastic agent-based simulation environment with a provenance model. This MABM aims to present a starting point for exploring and analyzing monetary reforms. In this context, the monetary system affects the lending potential of banks and might impact the dynamics of financial crises. MABMs are predestined to replicate emergent financial crisis dynamics, analyze institutional changes within a financial system, and thus measure macro-financial stability. The used simulation environment makes the model more accessible and facilitates exploring the impact of different hypotheses and mechanisms in a less complex way. Moreover, the model replicates a wide range of stylized economic facts, which validates it as an analysis tool to implement and compare monetary regime shifts."
https://openalex.org/W4312091560,"Despite increasing research and programs to eradicate poverty, poverty still exists and is a far greater concern for children than adults, leading child poverty to become a political, economic, and social issue worldwide and in India. The current study aims to find variations in the prevalence of child poverty and associated factors in India during 2015-21. In the current study, we used two consecutive rounds of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4, 2015-16 & NFHS-5, 2019-21) to estimate child poverty (aged 0-59 months) using the Alkire-Foster method. The multilevel logistic regression analyses were performed to find the important cofounder and cluster level variation in child poverty. The results show that about 38 percent of children were multidimensionally poor in 2015-16, which reduced to 27 percent in 2019-21. The decomposition analysis suggests that contribution of nutrition domain to child poverty increases over time, whereas the standard of living substantially declines from NFHS-4 to NFHS-5. The multilevel analysis results show that the age and sex of the child, age and years of schooling of the mother, children ever born, religion, caste, wealth quintile and central, northeast, north and west regions are significantly associated with child poverty over time. Further, the variance participation coefficient statistics show that about 12 percent of the variation in the prevalence of child poverty could be attributed to differences at the community level. The prevalence of child poverty significantly declines over time, and the community-level variation is higher than the district-level in both surveys. However, the community-level variation shows increases over time. The finding suggests a need to improve the nutritional status and standard of living of most deprived households by promoting a child-centric and dimension-specific approach with more focus on PSU-level intervension should adopt in order to lessen child poverty in India."
https://openalex.org/W4312091572,"This study assessed the acute effect of adding blood flow restriction (BFR) to quad sets on muscle-cross sectional area (mCSA), muscle thickness (MT), echo intensity (EI), and subcutaneous fat-normalized EI (EINORM) of the superficial quadriceps muscles. Twelve males and 12 females (mean±SD; age (yrs): 21.4±2.9; stature (m): 1.76±0.1; body mass (kg): 77.7±2.9) performed 70 repetitions (one set of 30, three sets of 15 repetitions) of bodyweight quad sets separately on each leg, with or without BFR (CON) applied. Rating of perceived exertion was recorded following each set. Panoramic ultrasound images of the vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), and rectus femoris (RF) were captured prior to (PRE), immediately after (IMM-POST), 30- (30-POST), and 60-minutes after (60-POST) after exercise. Sex x condition x time repeated measures ANOVAs assessed differences at p<0.05 for each muscle and dependent variable separately. Although males had larger VM and VL mCSA and VL MT (p<0.05), there were no acute changes from PRE to IMM-POST (p>0.05). There was a 3-way interaction in VL mCSA (p = 0.025) which indicated BFR was greater than CON at IMM-POST by 7.6% (p = 0.019) for males only. Females had greater EI in the VM and VL than males (p<0.05), yet males had greater EINORM for each muscle (p>0.05) and EINORM did not change over time or treatment (p>0.05). The lack of changes in MT, EI, and EINORM indicate that unloaded quad sets do not provide a stimulus to promote fluid shifts or acute changes in muscle size with the exception of IMM-POST in the VL for males. Future research should attempt to elucidate the acute muscular responses of BFR application for lightly loaded rehabilitation exercises in the clinical populations for which they are prescribed."
https://openalex.org/W4312097861,"Physical activity and exercise are effective approaches in prevention and therapy of multiple diseases. Although the specific characteristics of lengthening contractions have the potential to be beneficial in many clinical conditions, eccentric training is not commonly used in clinical populations with metabolic, orthopaedic, or neurologic conditions. The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate the feasibility, functional benefits, and systemic responses of an eccentric exercise program focused on the trunk and lower extremities in people with low back pain (LBP) and multiple sclerosis (MS). A six-week eccentric training program with three weekly sessions is performed by people with LBP and MS. The program consists of ten exercises addressing strength of the trunk and lower extremities. The study follows a four-group design (N = 12 per group) in two study centers (Israel and Germany): three groups perform the eccentric training program: A) control group (healthy, asymptomatic); B) people with LBP; C) people with MS; group D (people with MS) receives standard care physiotherapy. Baseline measurements are conducted before first training, post-measurement takes place after the last session both comprise blood sampling, self-reported questionnaires, mobility, balance, and strength testing. The feasibility of the eccentric training program will be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative measures related to the study process, compliance and adherence, safety, and overall program assessment. For preliminary assessment of potential intervention effects, surrogate parameters related to mobility, postural control, muscle strength and systemic effects are assessed. The presented study will add knowledge regarding safety, feasibility, and initial effects of eccentric training in people with orthopaedic and neurological conditions. The simple exercises, that are easily modifiable in complexity and intensity, are likely beneficial to other populations. Thus, multiple applications and implementation pathways for the herein presented training program are conceivable.

We examined the effects of a brief mindfulness intervention on problematic smartphone use and investigated if this effect is mediated by self-control. Methods Participants were recruited randomly from a university in Beijing of China. Forty-four college students were assigned to a mindfulness group or a control group. The mindfulness group took part in a brief (30 min) single-session mindfulness intervention. The control group was instructed to listen to a neutral news audio recording for the same duration (30 min). The Freiburg Mindfulness Inventory, Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale, and Self-control Scale were used to measure state mindfulness, problematic smartphone use, and self-control of college students at pre-intervention and post-intervention, respectively. Results Two-way repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that the mindfulness group had significant improvements in state mindfulness ( p = .049) and self-control ( p = .012), and had significant alleviation in problematic smartphone use ( p &lt; .001) at post-intervention. In the regression model, self-control had a mediating effect between mindfulness intervention and problematic smartphone use (95% CI [0.490, 7.216]). Conclusions A brief single-session mindfulness intervention can alleviate the level of problematic smartphone use and increase the level of state mindfulness and self-control compared to the control group. Self-control can completely mediate the efficacy of the mindfulness intervention in reducing problematic smartphone use."
https://openalex.org/W4312097902,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are prone to osteoporosis, and high glucose (HG) can affect bone metabolism. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of traditional Chinese herbal formulation Xianling Gubao (XLGB) on HG-treated MG63 osteoblast-like cells. MG63 cells were incubated with control (mannitol), HG (20 mM glucose) or HG + XLGB (20 mM glucose+200 mg/L XLGB) mediums. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were examined using CCK8, colony-formation, flow cytometry, Hoechst/PI staining, wound-healing and transwell assays, respectively. ELISA, RT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to detect the levels of osteogenesis differentiation-associated markers such as ALP, OCN, OPN, RUNX2, OPG, and OPGL in MG63 cells. The levels of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway related proteins, cell cycle-related proteins, and mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins were detected using western blot analysis. In HG-treated MG63 cells, XLGB significantly attenuated the suppression on the proliferation, migration and invasion of MG63 cells caused by HG. HG downregulated the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and the expressions of cell cycle-related proteins, while XLGB reversed the inhibition of HG on MG63 cells. Moreover, XLGB significantly reduced the promotion on the apoptosis of MG63 cells induced by HG, the expressions of mitochondrial apoptosis-related proteins were suppressed by XLGB treatment. In addition, the expressions of osteogenesis differentiation-associated proteins were also rescued by XLGB in HG-treated MG63 cells. Our data suggest that XLGB rescues the MG63 osteoblasts against the effect of HG. The potential therapeutic mechanism of XLGB partially attributes to inhibiting the osteoblast apoptosis and promoting the bone formation of osteoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W4312097937,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health problem. Early detection is the key to reducing morbidity and mortality, but it is difficult because it occurs without symptoms. Diagnosis of CKD is also important to avoid nephrotoxic drugs and to adjust the doses of other medications that may be affected. Pharmacies, due to their proximity to the population, frequency of patient visits, and knowledge of medication use are an ideal location for point-of-care diagnosis or CKD.To detect and refer to the primary care physician patients with low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) who use nephrotoxic drugs or who may require a dose adjustment.Pharmacy users over 60 years of age who agreed to participate were given a creatinine/eGFR test with a point-of-care meter. The eGFR was calculated and if it was less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, their medications were evaluated to identify nephrotoxic drugs or drugs that potentially required adjustment. If either were found, they were referred to their doctor for further management.198 patients were recruited in 4 pharmacies, of which 87 (43.9%) had an eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. They were taking a total of 635 medications. Of these 635 medications, 50 (7.9%) were affected by kidney function. Dose adjustment was recommended in 31 and discontinuation in 19. The primary care doctor accepted the recommendations for 14 medications: dose adjustment for 6 and withdrawal in 8. This represents 2.3% of medications taken by patients with an eGFR less than 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The 50 medications identified were taken by 29 patients (33.3% of the 87 with a low eGFR) and a change in treatment was generated in 9 patients, representing 4.6% of the total number of patients in the sample, and 10% of the patients with a low eGFR.Point-of-care testing for kidney function in a pharmacy setting is feasible and identifies a significant number of patients with eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. It also allows for appropriate medication management recommendations in this patient group."
https://openalex.org/W4312097966,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) includes assaults that risk a woman's bodily integrity. Intimate partners commit IPV, people with whom the victim shares (or shared) a close personal or sexual relationship. This phenomenon has a great global and national impact. Thus, it is necessary to establish trends of the risk of physical violence to women by their current or former partner in each department of Colombia and its relationship with sociodemographic and health characteristics. This study uses an ecological approach at the departmental level, with victims of intimate partner violence treated at the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Sciences (INMLyCF). Potential factors were identified through Bayesian factor analysis and were included in the model to estimate risk. The findings show that the Casanare department had the highest risk of producing victims (SMR: 2.545). In departments where the educational level of women is at or below primary school, there is a high-risk β = 0.343 (0.285, 0.397) of them being assaulted. For the departments in which the employment of women is in sales and services or office workers, the associated factor presents a higher risk β = 0.361 (0.201, 0.485), as in the risk related to affiliation with the social security system β = 0.338 (0.246, 0.498), as well as sexual and reproductive life β = 0.143 (0.003, 0.322). The following categories were associated with physical gender violence: no education and low participation in making purchases at home β = 0.106 (0.049, 0.199), low participation in decisions about their health, and visits to family and friends β = 0.240 (0.170, 0.299).

As our panel is constructed of 51 states/territories over a 52-week time frame, our final dataset is composed of 2,652 observations. Results showed that states' passing of anti-transgender rights bills were linked with suicide- and depression-related Internet searches. Second, introducing or debating the bills did not have an association with Internet searches. Third, the defeat of anti-transgender bills was linked with fewer depression-related searches. Finally, the LGBT context in the state affected the results: anti-transgender legislation had a particularly strong association with suicide-related Internet searches when the state had a high LGBT population density."
https://openalex.org/W4312098087,"Objective This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and extent of dental developmental complications in patients who have undergone pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) and identify the risk factors. Materials and methods We retrospectively investigated the clinical data warehouse of the Catholic Medical Center information system for identifying patients who: 1) visited the Department of Pediatrics between 2009 and 2019, 2) underwent SCT under the age of 10, and 3) had panoramic radiographs. Thus 153 patients were included in this study. The prevalence and extent of tooth agenesis, microdontia, and root malformation were assessed using panoramic radiographs obtained after SCT, and the risk factors were analyzed using regression analysis. Results All 153 patients had at least one dental anomaly. When grouped according to the age at initial chemotherapy (≤ 2.5; 2.6–5.0; 5.1–7.5; &gt; 7.5 years), the prevalence of agenesis showed statistically significant differences among the different age groups (P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of agenesis was highest in the youngest age group. As the initial age at chemotherapy increased, the number of affected teeth per patient decreased for all three anomalies. The location of the affected tooth was also influenced by the age at initial chemotherapy. Regression analysis demonstrated that young age at initial chemotherapy was a risk-increasing factor for tooth agenesis and microdontia. Conclusions The age at initial chemotherapy may be a critical factor in determining the type, extent, and location of dental complications after SCT. These results suggest that careful dental follow-up and timely treatment are recommended for pediatric patients undergoing SCT."
https://openalex.org/W4312098088,"In financial crises, assets see a deep loss of value, and the financial markets experience liquidity shortages. Although they are not uncommon, they may cause by multiple contributing factors which makes them hard to study. To discover features of the financial network, the pairwise interaction of stocks has been considered in many pieces of research, but the existence of the strong correlation between stocks and their collective behavior in crisis made us address higher-order interactions. Hence, in this study, we investigate financial networks by triplet interaction in the framework of balance theory. Due to detecting the contribution of higher-order interactions in understanding the complex behavior of stocks we take the advantage of the order parameter of the higher-order interactions. Looking at real data of the financial market obtained from S&P500 index(SPX) through the lens of balance theory for the quest of network structure in different periods (on and off-crisis) faces us with the existence of a structural difference of networks corresponding to the periods. Addressing two well-known crises the Great regression (2008) and the Covid-19 recession (2020), our results show an ordered structure forms in the on-crisis period in the financial network while stocks behave independently far from a crisis. The formation of the ordered structure of stocks in crisis makes the network more resilient to disorder (thermal fluctuations). The resistance of the ordered structure against applying the disorder measure the crisis strength and determine the temperature at which the network transits. There is a critical temperature, Tc, in the language of statistical mechanics and mean-field approach which above, the ordered structure destroys abruptly and a first-order phase transition occurs. The stronger the crisis, the higher the critical temperature."
https://openalex.org/W4312098092,"Animals and their microbiomes exert reciprocal influence; the host's environment, physiology, and phylogeny can impact the composition of the microbiome, while the microbes present can affect host behavior, health, and fitness. While some microbiomes are highly malleable, specialized microbiomes that provide important functions can be more robust to environmental perturbations. Recent evidence suggests Sceloporus virgatus has one such specialized microbiome, which functions to protect eggs from fungal pathogens during incubation. Here, we examine the cloacal microbiome of three different Sceloporus species (spiny lizards; Family Phrynosomatidae)-Sceloporus virgatus, Sceloporus jarrovii, and Sceloporus occidentalis. We compare two species with different reproductive modes (oviparous vs. viviparous) living in sympatry: S. virgatus and S. jarrovii. We compare sister species living in similar habitats (riparian oak-pine woodlands) but different latitudes: S. virgatus and S. occidentalis. And, we compare three populations of one species (S. occidentalis) living in different habitat types: beach, low elevation forest, and the riparian woodland. We found differences in beta diversity metrics between all three comparisons, although those differences were more extreme between animals in different environments, even though those populations were more closely related. Similarly, alpha diversity varied among the S. occidentalis populations and between S. occidentalis and S. virgatus, but not between sympatric S. virgatus and S. jarrovii. Despite these differences, all three species and all three populations of S. occcidentalis had the same dominant taxon, Enterobacteriaceae. The majority of the variation between groups was in low abundance taxa and at the ASV level; these taxa are responsive to habitat differences, geographic distance, and host relatedness. Uncovering what factors influence the composition of wild microbiomes is important to understanding the ecology and evolution of the host animals, and can lead to more detailed exploration of the function of particular microbes and the community as a whole."
https://openalex.org/W4312098260,"Two previous studies showed kinematic differences between novice and experienced performers during unchoreographed movements executed in standing position. However, no study explores if these kinematic differences holds during unchoreographed movements executed in quadrupedal position. The aim of this study is to compare the movement behaviour of experienced and novice performers during an exercise wherein they are challenged to use dynamic and largely unchoreographed movement patterns executed in quadrupedal position. The exercise studied was the Cat exercise, in which participants were asked to behave like a feline for 10 minutes. An inventory of the chosen movements and the assessment of their average and coefficient of variation of the ground contact temporal parameters, computed by analysing the tri-dimensional whole-body kinematics of 25 performers (n = 13 novices and n = 12 experienced), was compared according to their experience level. No significant difference was found between the groups for the number of chosen movements, and median or coefficient of variation of ground contact temporal parameters, except for a greater foot/ knee swing coefficient of variation in experienced performers. This suggests that biomechanical constraints induced by quadrupedal position ""prevent"" a different selection of motor strategies by experienced performers, although the latter can be more variable in their movements."

Previous studies suggested that the diagnosis is often made when advanced renal failure occurs. The aims of this study were to describe the prevalence of unregistered CKD stages 3-5 in a Belgian General Practitioner population, to determine risk factors for under-registration and to investigate the diagnostic delay.The analyses were carried out in the INTEGO database, a Flanders general practice-based morbidity registration network. The study used INTEGO data from the year 2018 for all patients ≥18 years old. CKD was defined as two consecutive eGFR laboratory measurements (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73m2) at least three months apart during the baseline period. Registered CKD was characterised by a documented diagnosis of CKD (ICPC2 U99) during the ≥12-month lookback period before the first eGFR measurement and up to six months after the second eGFR in the EHR. The prevalence of unregistered CKD and the median time of diagnostic delay were estimated. Baseline characteristics were described. A multivariate cross-sectional logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify determinants of unregistered CKD. We estimated the odds ratios and their 95% confidence interval.Among included patients, there were 10 551 patients (5.5%) meeting the criteria of CKD. The prevalence of unregistered CKD was 68%. The mean diagnostic delay was 1.94 years (Standard deviation 0.93). Being a male, a concurrent diagnosis of diabetes, stroke, heart failure and hypertension, and more severe CKD (stages 3b, 4 and 5) independently increased the chance on registered CKD.The proportion of patients who had no registered CKD code in the EHR was substantial. The differences between registered and unregistered patients make thinking about solutions to facilitate registration in the EHR imperative."

To detect the existence of a substantial clustering effect, the Intra-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR), and Likelihood Ratio (LR)-test were used. Furthermore, because the models were nested, deviance (-2LLR) was used for model comparison. In the multilevel logistic model, significant factors related to pregnancy termination were declared using Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) with a 95%Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value of 0.05. Result The pooled prevalence of pregnancy termination in East African countries was 7.79% (95% CI: 7.54, 8.04) with the highest prevalence in Uganda 12.51% (95% CI: 11.56, 13.41) and lowest was observed in Zambia 5.64% ((95% CI: 4.86, 6.41). In multilevel multivariable logistic regression result, age 20–24 [AOR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.71, 2.16], media exposure [AOR = 1.22; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.34], married [AOR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.43], had working [AOR = 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.23],no education[AOR = 3.98, 95% CI: 2.32, 6.81], primary education [AOR = 4.05, 95% CI: 2.38, 6.88], secondary education [AOR = 2.96, 95% CI: 1.74, 5.03], multiparous [AOR = 0.85; 95%CI: 0.79, 0.93], sexual initiation greater or equal to 15 [AOR = 0.82; 95%CI: 0.74, 0.99] were significantly associated with pregnancy termination. Conclusion The pooled prevalence of pregnancy termination in East Africa was high in this study. Maternal age, marital status, education status, parity, age at first sex, media exposure, working status and living countries were significantly associated with pregnancy termination. The finding provides critical information for developing health interventions to decrease unplanned pregnancies and illegal pregnancy termination."
https://openalex.org/W4312098304,"Successful leadership requires leaders to make their followers aware of expectations regarding the goals to achieve, norms to follow, and task responsibilities to take over. This awareness is often achieved through leader-follower communication. In times of economic globalization and digitalization, however, leader-follower communication has become both more digitalized (virtual, rather than face-to-face) and less frequent, making successful leader-follower-communication more challenging. The current research tested in four studies (three preregistered) whether digitalization and frequency of interaction predict task-related leadership success. In one cross-sectional (Study 1, N = 200), one longitudinal (Study 2, N = 305), and one quasi-experimental study (Study 3, N = 178), as predicted, a higher frequency (but not a lower level of digitalization) of leader-follower interactions predicted better task-related leadership outcomes (i.e., stronger goal clarity, norm clarity, and task responsibility among followers). Via mediation and a causal chain approach, Study 3 and Study 4 ( N = 261) further targeted the mechanism; results showed that the relationship between (higher) interaction frequency and these outcomes is due to followers perceiving more opportunities to share work-related information with the leaders. These results improve our understanding of contextual factors contributing to leadership success in collaborations across hierarchies. They highlight that it is not the digitalization but rather the frequency of interacting with their leader that predicts whether followers gain clarity about the relevant goals and norms to follow and the task responsibilities to assume."

Previous studies demonstrated that performing the position task requires more proprioceptive information. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there would be a difference in cutaneous information processing between the position and force tasks by assessing the gating effect, which is reduction of amplitude of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and cutaneomuscular reflex (CMR). Eighteen healthy adults participated in this study. They contracted their right first dorsal interosseous muscle by abducting their index finger to produce a constant force against a rigid restraint that was 20% maximum voluntary contraction (force task), or to maintain a target position corresponding to 10° abduction of the metacarpophalangeal joint while supporting a load equivalent to 20% maximum voluntary contraction (position task). During each task, electrical stimulation was applied to the digital nerves of the right index finger, and SEPs and CMR were recorded from C3' of the International 10-20 system and the right first dorsal interosseous muscle, respectively. Reduction of the amplitude of N33 component of SEPs was significantly larger during the force than position task. In addition, the E2 amplitude of CMR was significantly greater for the force than position task. These findings suggest that cutaneous information processing differs with load type during static muscle contraction."
https://openalex.org/W4312098314,"Empirical studies undertaken in developed countries have shown that urban expansion may exert both positive and negative impacts on residents' health, depending on the planning strategy; however, the impact of rapid urban expansion on public health in developing countries is understudied. This paper takes Jiawang, China, as an example of rapid urban expansion and carries out a health impact assessment (HIA) on its regulatory detailed plan to better understand the interaction of the built environment and public health. We establish an HIA framework and select a series of indicators as health determinants. On this basis, we examine what impact the urban expansion will exert on the health equity of the residents by conducting a bivariate spatial autocorrelation. The finding shows that:1) Urban expansion produces positive health impact through the health determinants of public facilities, road transportation and land use. 2) Urban expansion will reduce health disparities between the old and new town and between the urban and suburban areas, especially between the old and new town. 3) The impact of expansion exerts on health equity will be generally positive. Low-income neighborhoods in the old town will significantly benefit from urban expansion in terms of road traffic and land use, but will not fully benefit in terms of public facilities. Low-income neighborhoods will no longer benefit from the accessibility to commercial facilities and will suffer from health inequities in terms of accessibility to healthcare facilities. 4) The government's development strategy of emphasizing on an even distribution of public resources will unintentionally contribute to improving health equity. The significant promotion of health equity will mitigate the negative impacts of the previous urban development."

We compared the impact of the degree of SMR on survival between atrial and ventricular dysfunction.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent echocardiography in a healthcare network between 2013-2018. We compared the survival of patients with atrial and ventricular dysfunction, using propensity scores developed from differences in patient demographics and comorbidities within SMR severity strata (none, mild, moderate or severe). We fitted Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the risk-adjusted hazards of death across different severities of SMR between patients with atrial and ventricular dysfunction.Of 11,987 patients included (median age 69 years [IQR 58-80]; 46% women), 6,254 (52%) had isolated atrial dysfunction, and 5,733 (48%) had ventricular dysfunction. 3,522 patients were matched from each arm using coarsened exact matching. Hazard of death in atrial dysfunction without SMR was comparable to ventricular dysfunction without SMR (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.9-1.3). Using ventricular dysfunction without SMR as reference, hazards of death remained higher in ventricular dysfunction than in atrial dysfunction across increasing severities of SMR: mild SMR (HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.8-2.4 in ventricular dysfunction versus HR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5-2.0 in atrial dysfunction) and moderate/severe SMR (HR 2.8, 95%CI 2.4-3.4 versus HR 2.4, 95%CI 2.0-2.9).SMR across all severities were associated with better survival in atrial dysfunction than in ventricular dysfunction, though the magnitude of the diminishing survival were similar between atrial and ventricular dysfunction in increasing severity of SMRs."
https://openalex.org/W4312098328,"Until recently, no uniform requirements for parental leave (PL) existed in graduate medical education. We implemented a national survey, with the objective of ascertaining fellows' perceptions of PL policies and their impact. This is the first study to focus exclusively on pediatric subspecialty fellows.An online survey instrument was created targeting pediatric fellows.The survey was accessed by 1003 (25%) of the estimated 4078 pediatric subspecialty fellows and 853 (21%) submitted surveys. Respondent demographic data paralleled the data reported by the American Board of Pediatrics. Half of respondents did not know whether their program had a written PL policy. Over 40% reported ≥ 5 weeks of paid PL. Most indicated that fellows use vacation, sick leave, and unpaid time for PL. Almost half of respondents (45%) indicated that their program's PL policy increases the stress of having a child. Fellows chose establishing/extending paid leave and intentionally fostering a more supportive program culture as the most crucial candidate improvements. The importance of equitable PL polices between parent fellows and co-fellows was an important theme of our qualitative data. Fellows feel there is a moral misalignment between the field of pediatrics' dedication to maternal and child health and current PL policies governing pediatric trainees.PL policies vary widely among pediatric fellowship programs and are often not known by fellows. Fellows are not satisfied with PL policies, which often exacerbate stress for new parents and burden their co-fellows. Targeted modification of several aspects of PL policies may improve their acceptance."
https://openalex.org/W4312098331,"Attentional biases for threatening stimuli of various kinds have been repeatedly demonstrated. More recently, sex differences in the strength of visual biases for weapons have been observed, with men exhibiting stronger biases than do women. In the current study we further explored this sex difference, by examining how immediate vicarious experience with weapons (via playing a violent video game compared to playing a non-violent video game) affected the visual attention for weapons. We found that the basic visual bias for weapons compared to non-weapons was replicated, as was the sex difference in the strength of this bias. We also observed that the context produced by playing a violent video game prior to the visual search task, produced some sex differences in responding that were not present after playing the nonviolent video game, providing modest evidence that men may be more prone to cognitive behavioural effects of violent video game play. Interestingly, there was some evidence that both sexes de-prioritised non-weapons during search after playing the violent, relative to the non-violent, video game. We recommend that future studies investigate the task dynamics that may have led to this effect."
