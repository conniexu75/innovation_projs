We report experimental demonstration of the optical hyperlens for sub-diffraction-limited imaging in the far field. The device magnifies subwavelength objects by transforming the scattered evanescent waves into propagating waves in an anisotropic medium and projects the high-resolution image at far field. The optical hyperlens opens up possibilities in applications such as real-time biomolecular imaging and nanolithography."

We found that a cardiac-specific microRNA (miR-208) encoded by an intron of the α MHC gene is required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and expression of β MHC in response to stress and hypothyroidism. Thus, the α MHC gene, in addition to encoding a major cardiac contractile protein, regulates cardiac growth and gene expression in response to stress and hormonal signaling through miR-208."
https://openalex.org/W2140241886,"Is moral reasoning a predominantly rational process, or does emotion play its part? Tests performed by six patients with lesions in an area of the brain involved in the normal generation of emotions (the ventromedial prefrontal cortex) point to a specific and causal role for the emotions in moral judgements. These patients produced an abnormally 'utilitarian' pattern of judgements on certain types of moral dilemmas, those that we might classify as “gut wrenching”, such as having to decide whether to sacrifice one's child in order to save a number of other people. Their judgements were normal on other classes of moral dilemmas. As well as illuminating the normal role of emotions in moral judgement, this work has a bearing on the mechanisms behind the pathological moral behaviour found in people like psychopaths. Moral reasoning is thought of as being a mostly rational process. But it is shown that patients with lesions in an area of the brain necessary for the normal general emotions produce an abnormally 'utilitarian' pattern of judgments on certain types of moral dilemmas. The findings support an essential role for emotion in the generation of certain types of judgments. The psychological and neurobiological processes underlying moral judgement have been the focus of many recent empirical studies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. Of central interest is whether emotions play a causal role in moral judgement, and, in parallel, how emotion-related areas of the brain contribute to moral judgement. Here we show that six patients with focal bilateral damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), a brain region necessary for the normal generation of emotions and, in particular, social emotions12,13,14, produce an abnormally ‘utilitarian’ pattern of judgements on moral dilemmas that pit compelling considerations of aggregate welfare against highly emotionally aversive behaviours (for example, having to sacrifice one person’s life to save a number of other lives)7,8. In contrast, the VMPC patients’ judgements were normal in other classes of moral dilemmas. These findings indicate that, for a selective set of moral dilemmas, the VMPC is critical for normal judgements of right and wrong. The findings support a necessary role for emotion in the generation of those judgements."

We performed multiple high-throughput measurements to study the response of Escherichia coli cells to genetic and environmental perturbations. Analysis of metabolic enzyme gene disruptants revealed unexpectedly small changes in messenger RNA and proteins for most disruptants. Overall, metabolite levels were also stable, reflecting the rerouting of fluxes in the metabolic network. In contrast, E. coli actively regulated enzyme levels to maintain a stable metabolic state in response to changes in growth rate. E. coli thus seems to use complementary strategies that result in a metabolic network robust against perturbations."

We demonstrate an experimental realization of a two-dimensional negative-index material in the blue-green region of the visible spectrum, substantiated by direct geometric visualization of negative refraction. Negative indices were achieved with the use of an ultrathin Au-Si3N4-Ag waveguide sustaining a surface plasmon polariton mode with antiparallel group and phase velocities. All-angle negative refraction was observed at the interface between this bimetal waveguide and a conventional Ag-Si3N4-Ag slot waveguide. The results may enable the development of practical negative-index optical designs in the visible regime."
https://openalex.org/W2134359750,"The APC gene encodes the adenomatous polyposis coli tumour suppressor protein, germline mutation of which characterizes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), an autosomal intestinal cancer syndrome. Inactivation of APC is also recognized as the key early event in the development of sporadic colorectal cancers, and its loss results in constitutive activity of the beta-catenin-Tcf4 transcription complex. The proto-oncogene c-MYC has been identified as a target of the Wnt pathway in colorectal cancer cells in vitro, in normal crypts in vivo and in intestinal epithelial cells acutely transformed on in vivo deletion of the APC gene; however, the significance of this is unclear. Therefore, to elucidate the role Myc has in the intestine after Apc loss, we have simultaneously deleted both Apc and Myc in the adult murine small intestine. Here we show that loss of Myc rescued the phenotypes of perturbed differentiation, migration, proliferation and apoptosis, which occur on deletion of Apc. Remarkably, this rescue occurred in the presence of high levels of nuclear beta-catenin. Array analysis revealed that Myc is required for the majority of Wnt target gene activation following Apc loss. These data establish Myc as the critical mediator of the early stages of neoplasia following Apc loss."
https://openalex.org/W2035548551,"We studied the nucleation of gold clusters on TiO 2 (110) surfaces in three different oxidation states by high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy. The three TiO 2 (110) supports chosen were (i) reduced (having bridging oxygen vacancies), (ii) hydrated (having bridging hydroxyl groups), and (iii) oxidized (having oxygen adatoms). At room temperature, gold nanoclusters nucleate homogeneously on the terraces of the reduced and oxidized supports, whereas on the hydrated TiO 2 (110) surface, clusters form preferentially at the step edges. From interplay with density functional theory calculations, we identified two different gold-TiO 2 (110) adhesion mechanisms for the reduced and oxidized supports. The adhesion of gold clusters is strongest on the oxidized support, and the implications of this finding for catalytic applications are discussed."

Tropical African temperatures gradually increased from ∼21° to 25°C over the last deglaciation, which is a larger warming than estimated for the tropical Atlantic Ocean. A direct comparison with sea-surface temperature estimates from the same core revealed that the land-sea temperature difference was, through the thermal pressure gradient, an important control on central African precipitation patterns."

This relation suggests that the radio modulation has its origins in the inner region of the plasma disk, most likely from a centrifugally driven convective instability and an associated plasma outflow that slowly slips in phase relative to Saturn's internal rotation. The slippage rate is determined by the electrodynamic coupling of the plasma disk to Saturn and by the drag force exerted by its interaction with the Enceladus neutral gas torus."

https://openalex.org/W2076649422,"Protein S-nitrosylation has emerged as a principal mechanism by which nitric oxide exerts biological effects. Among methods for studying protein S-nitrosylation, the biotin switch technique (BST) has rapidly gained popularity because of the ease with which it can detect individual S-nitrosylated (SNO) proteins in biological samples. The identification of SNO sites by the BST relies on the ability of ascorbate to generate a thiol from an S-nitrosothiol, but not from alternatively S-oxidized thiols (e.g. disulfides, sulfenic acids). However, the specificity of this reaction has recently been challenged, prompting several claims that the BST may produce false-positive results and raising concerns about the application of the BST under oxidizing conditions. Here we perform a comparative analysis of the BST using differentially S-oxidized and S-nitrosylated forms of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, as well as intact and lysed human embryonic kidney 293 cells treated with S-oxidizing and S-nitrosylating agents, and verify that the assay is highly specific for SNO. Strikingly, exposure of samples to indirect sunlight from a laboratory window resulted in artifactual ascorbate-dependent signals that are likely promoted by the semidehydroascorbate radical; protection from sunlight eliminated the artifact. In contrast, exposure of SNO proteins to a strong ultraviolet light source (SNO photolysis) prior to the BST provided independent verification of assay specificity. By combining BST with photolysis, we have shown that anti-cancer drug-induced oxidative stress facilitates the S-nitrosylation of the major apoptotic effector glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

This post-translational modification, known as S-nitrosylation, has emerged as a highly conserved and spatiotemporally specific signaling mechanism (1Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). A major contribution to this field was the introduction of the biotin switch technique (BST) by Jaffrey et al. in 2001 (2Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Importantly, the BST allows relatively facile identification and quantification of endogenous protein SNOs and thus has greatly contributed to our understanding of protein S-nitrosylation. As evidence, the BST has been employed in over 70 publications, unveiling new roles for S-nitrosylation in events such as apoptosis (3Hara M.R. Agrawal N. Kim S.F. Cascio M.B. Fujimuro M. Ozeki Y.

S. A. 2006; 103: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The BST consists of three principal steps (supplemental Fig. S1): “blocking” of free Cys thiols by S-methylthiolation with S-methyl methanethiosulfonate (a reactive thiosulfonate), formal reduction of SNOs to thiols with ascorbate (Asc), and in situ “labeling” by S-biotinylation of the nascent thiols with biotin-HPDP, a reactive mixed disulfide. The degree of biotinylation (and hence S-nitrosylation) is determined by either anti-biotin immunoblotting or streptavidin pull down followed by immunoblotting for the protein(s) of interest. Complete blocking of free thiols is requisite for minimizing background biotinylation (i.e. improving signal-to-noise or sensitivity), while the specificity of the BST is predicated on the ability of Asc to reduce SNOs to free thiol, without reducing other Cys-based redox modifications such as S-glutathionylation or S-oxidations (sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids). Importantly, transition metal-catalyzed reactions, particularly those that might limit the specificity of Asc, are mitigated through use of metal chelators (e.g. EDTA, DTPA, neocuproine). Despite the unequivocal ability of the BST to detect SNOs, the specificity of Asc for SNO reduction has not been extensively investigated. Landino et al. (9Landino L.M. Koumas M.T. Mason C.E. Alston J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggested that Asc reduces tubulin disulfides, a claim the authors use to challenge the validity of the BST. Furthermore, two other groups have reported that S-glutathionylated proteins yield positive signals in this assay (10Dahm C.C. Moore K. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10056-10065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Kuncewicz T. Sheta E.A. Goldknopf I.L. Kone B.C. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 156-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A more recent report by Huang et al. (12Huang B. Chen C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) argued that the BST yields “artifactual” Asc-dependent biotinylation of native reduced bovine serum albumin. They extrapolate this finding to argue that the BST may result in false-positive (i.e. SNO-independent) biotinylation, which could cast doubt upon the myriad of studies that have relied heavily on this assay. Shared between these claims of artifactual signals is the idea that Asc must be reducing disulfides (S-glutathionylated or intramolecular disulfides). However, this notion is difficult to reconcile experimentally with the use of S-methyl methanethiosulfonate as a blocking agent (i.e. protein thiols are S-methylthiolated to form mixed disulfides). The assay would never work if ascorbate removed the blocking agent, and in fact, the two e– reduction of Cys disulfides to thiol (Cys thiol/disulfide Ered –170 to –320 mV) by Asc is highly thermodynamically unfavorable (Asc/DHAsc Ered +70 mV) (13Njus D. Kelley P.M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, one would not expect Asc to directly reduce any biological Cys oxidation products. Instead, the electrochemical measurements favor the reverse reaction (i.e. thiol-dependent reduction of dehydroascorbate (DHAsc0 to Asc), a scenario supported by extensive observations (14May J.M. Huang J. Qu Z.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1449-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 15Winkler B.S. Orselli S.M. Rex T.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 333-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Despite the thermodynamic and empiric evidence against Asc-dependent disulfide reduction (and alternative interpretations for some of the prior results that have formed the basis of challenge to the BST), we felt it was important to evaluate the specificity of the BST and the sources of potential artifacts. Further, we sought to employ the BST to differentiate S-nitrosylated from S-oxidized proteins under conditions of diverse oxidative and nitrosative stresses, as such analyses have not been previously possible. Materials—All materials were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Anti-biotin, anti-pentaHis, anti-glutathione (anti-GSH), anti-PTP1B, and anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (anti-GAPDH) monoclonal antibodies were from Vector Laboratories, Qiagen, Virogen, BD Biosciences, and Chemicon, respectively. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was from Qiagen. The cDNA sequence encoding the N-terminal 321 residues of PTP1B in pET14b was a kind gift from S. G. Rhee (National Institutes of Health). CysNO was freshly synthesized by mixing equimolar volumes of l-Cys in 0.5 m HCl and NaNO2. BCNU was freshly prepared as a 50-mm stock in EtOH and used immediately. Cell Culture and Treatments—Wild-type or stably expressing neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) HEK-293 cells (16Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and treated with indicated agents at ∼90% confluency. Cells were washed and collected with cold phosphate-buffered saline followed by lysis in HEK lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Purification and Characterization of PTP1B—A 1-liter culture of BL21 Escherichia coli harboring pET14b-PTP1B at A600 = 1.0 was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C followed by purification of PTP1B with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin as described by Qiagen. The purified protein (4.5 mg/ml) was treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 30 min followed by buffer exchange with Bio-Gel P-6DG (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in HEN buffer (250 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm neocuproine, pH 7.7). For measurement of phosphatase activity, PTP1B was diluted to 2.5 μg/ml with phosphatase assay buffer (100 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, pH 8.0) and optical absorbance was measured continuously at 405 nm. PTP1B S-glutathionylation was assessed by immunoblotting with anti-GSH antibody (1:1000). PTP1B S-nitrosylation was confirmed using the Saville assay. Samples were mixed with one volume of 1% sulfanilamide with 2 mm HgCl2 in 1 m HCl for 5 min followed by addition of one volume of 0.05% N-(1-napthyl)ethylenediamine in 0.5 m HCl, and absorbance was read at 540 nm. Protein Modifications and Biotin Switch Technique—Proteins/lysates were treated with the indicated concentrations of H2O2, diamide, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), or CysNO followed by desalting with Bio-Gel P-6DG. The BST was performed on purified PTP1B as described (17Foster M.W. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25891-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and with several modifications as follows. Samples were mixed with 2 volumes of HEN buffer followed by addition of freshly prepared S-methyl methanethiosulfonate (10% v/v in N,N-dimethylformamide) and SDS (25% v/v) to final concentrations of 0.1 and 2.5%, respectively. Following frequent vortexing at 50 °C for 20 min, proteins were precipitated with 3 volumes of acetone at –20 °C for 15 min. The proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min, followed by gentle rinsing of the pellet with 4 × 1 m l70% acetone/H2O. The pellets were then resuspended in 240 μl of HEN buffer containing 1% SDS. For labeling, the blocked samples were mixed with 0.1 volume of biotin-HPDP (2.5 mg/ml in Me2SO) and 0.1 volume of HEN (control) or freshly prepared sodium Asc in HEN buffer. Labeling reactions were performed in the dark at room temperature for 1 h unless otherwise indicated. Indirect sunlight was introduced by incubating the labeling reactions near a laboratory window without direct exposure to sunlight or change in temperature. For direct detection of protein biotinylation, 20–40 μg of each labeling reaction was resolved by non-reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-biotin antibody (1:500). To detect an individual SNO protein from cells or lysates, the labeling reaction was acetone-precipitated as previously described. The washed pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of HEN/10 (HEN diluted 10-fold into H2O) containing 1% SDS, followed by addition of 750 μl of neutralization buffer (25 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ETDA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.5). This material was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 40 μl of a streptavidin-agarose slurry. The beads were washed with 4 × 1 ml of wash buffer (neutralization buffer + 500 mm NaCl), followed by 2 × 1 ml of neutralization buffer. The dried beads were eluted with 50 μl of HEN/10 + 1% β-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 20 min. The eluted mixture was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with anti-PTP1B (1:1000) or anti-GAPDH (1:1000) antibodies. Thiol Measurements and GSSG Reductase Activity Assays—Thiols were assayed by addition of one volume of 0.1 mg/ml 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in HEN. Absorbances of samples and GSH standards were immediately read at 405 nm. Activity of GSSG reductase was measured as described (18Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by following GSSG-dependent consumption of NADPH at 340 nm. SNO Photolysis—Lysates or purified proteins were incubated in a Pyrex borosilicate NMR tube ∼2 cm from a 200-watt mercury vapor lamp (Hanovia) for 3 min, which provides ∼4 watts of radiation from ∼280–500 nm. During this time, the sample temperature was unchanged. Immediately following this incubation, the samples were subjected to the BST as described. Specificity of the Biotin Switch Technique for the Detection of Protein S-Nitrosothiols—To evaluate the specificity of the BST, we first sought to perform the assay with an exemplary protein on which we could introduce alternative Cys modifications, including free sulfhydryl (-SH), S-glutathionyl mixed disulfide (-SSG), sulfenic/sulfinic/sulfonic acids (-SOH, -SO2H, -SO3H), and S-nitrosothiol (-SNO). Human protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), with its well characterized redox-regulated active site Cys residue (19Tonks N.K. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), satisfied these criteria. Treatment of reduced PTP1B with H2O2 resulted in the partially DTT-reversible inhibition of enzyme activity suggestive of a mixture of -SOH/sulfenyl amide (reversible) and -SO2H/-SO3H (irreversible) modifications (Fig. 1A). Incubation of PTP1B with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) or S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO) resulted in S-glutathionylation (Fig. 1B) or S-nitrosylation (Fig. 1C), respectively. Reduced and redox-modified PTP1Bs were then subjected to the BST with various concentrations of Asc. Under these conditions, only the S-nitrosylated PTP1B was biotinylated (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that even with 100 mm Asc, the assay specificity was not compromised. The use of 100 mm Asc did not, however, improve sensitivity (i.e. result in increased biotinylation of SNO-PTP1B) relative to 10 mm Asc, suggesting that under these conditions the reaction with Asc is not a limiting factor. To investigate the specificity of the assay in situ, and in particular to determine whether any cellular components might limit the specificity of the assay, we subjected H2O2-, GSSG-, and CysNO-treated lysates from HEK-293 cells to the BST and assayed for the biotinylation of endogenous PTP1B by streptavidin pull down and immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). As with purified PTP1B, biotinylation was observed only in the CysNO-treated samples, but in this case the labeling of PTP1B was higher at 100 mm than 10 mm Asc. This can be well rationalized: because the reaction rates for transnitrosylation between SNOs and ascorbate vary over three orders of magnitude and are first order for each reactant (20Holmes A.J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 2000; 2: 1639-1644Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar), low abundance protein SNOs may require larger Asc concentrations to facilitate this reaction. Another possibility is that Asc is consumed by oxidants present in the cellular extracts. Thus, whereas 1 mm Asc is sufficient for detection of some S-nitrosylated proteins as originally described (2Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), the general sensitivity of the assay may be enhanced by the use of higher Asc concentrations. To more generally assess assay specificity, we examined biotinylation by the BST of multiple S-nitrosylated, S-oxidized, or S-glutathionylated cellular proteins. HEK-293 cell lysates or intact cells were treated with CysNO, H2O2, and either GSSG (lysates) or diamide, a thiol-oxidizing agent (intact cells), and then analyzed by the BST. Under these conditions, protein biotinylation was strictly dependent upon treatment with CysNO and the inclusion of Asc during the labeling step (Fig. 2, A and B). To complement these results, we also showed that S-glutathionylated proteins were not reduced in the BST (Fig. 2C). Conditions That Promote S-Nitrosothiol-independent Protein Biotinylation—Although the BST appeared to be highly specific for protein SNOs under our assay conditions, we nonetheless sought to investigate the recent claim of artifactual Asc-dependent biotinylation of reduced bovine serum albumin (12Huang B. Chen C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We reasoned that this SNO-independent, Asc-dependent protein biotinylation must involve reduction of protein disulfides (including S-methythiolated cysteines) or biotin-HPDP. Ultraviolet radiation is known to facilitate the indirect reduction of protein disulfides (21Miles A.M. Brew S.A. Ingham K.C. Smith R.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 22Permyakov E.A. Permyakov S.E. Deikus G.Y. Morozova-Roche L.A. Grishchenko V.M. Kalinichenko L.P. Uversky V.N. Proteins. 2003; 51: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well as the one e– oxidation of Asc to the reactive semi-DHAsc radical, which can reduce non-biological (reactive) aryl disulfides such as 4,4′-dithiopyridine (23Fleming J.E. Bensch K.G. Schreiber J. Lohmann W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C J. Biosci. 1983; 38C: 859-861Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We further reasoned that Asc would rapidly reduce protein thiyl radicals (24D'Aquino M. Dunster C. Willson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 1199-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) generated by UV radiation, providing thiol substrate for biotinylation. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether light could promote artifactual biotinylation during the labeling step of the BST (the assay as originally described was performed in the dark). Interestingly, pre-reduced bovine serum albumin, lactoglobulin, and GAPDH were biotinylated when the labeling reactions were exposed to indirect sunlight, but not when kept in the dark, even after a 16-h incubation (standard incubations are 1–2 h) (Fig. 3A). Similar results were seen without DTT pre-reduction (data not shown). Further, artifactual biotinylation was fully reversed by excess DTT (Fig. 3C), confirming that the biotin was attached to the protein via a disulfide bond. In addition, the samples exposed to sunlight exhibited a marked yellowing indicative of Asc oxidation to DHAsc, whereas those kept in the dark remained essentially colorless. To determine the effects of this artifact under typical laboratory conditions, we performed the BST on reduced and S-nitrosylated GAPDH and exposed the labeling reactions to either fluorescent lighting (in a windowless room) or indirect sunlight (a laboratory bench ∼2 meters from a window) (Fig. 3B). Under fluorescent lighting, only SNO-GAPDH underwent Asc-dependent biotinylation (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4); this specific SNO signal was comparable with that obtained in the dark (not shown). In contrast, indirect sunlight led to increases in Asc-dependent biotinylation of both reduced and S-nitrosylated GAPDH (lanes 5–8). Even in the absence of Asc, indirect sunlight potentiated the biotinylation of SNO-GAPDH (lane 3 versus lane 7), consistent with known UV sensitivity of the SNO. Furthermore, the combination of indirect sunlight and Asc dramatically increased the biotinylation of SNO-GAPDH (lane 4 versus lane 8), notwithstanding loss of SNO specificity under these conditions. To understand the mechanism of this artifact, we examined the ability of Asc to reduce biotin-HPDP to biotin-SH under the conditions of the BST. Interestingly, nearly quantitative reduction of biotin-HPDP occurred in the presence of Asc and indirect sunlight, but not Asc alone (Fig. 3D). The production of high micromolar biotin-SH during the BST would lead to artifactual protein biotinylation via thiol/disulfide exchange with blocked (i.e. S-methylthiolated) proteins. UV Photolysis as a Control for the Detection of Protein S-Nitrosothiols—Under some experimental conditions, Asc dependence for biotinylation may be the primary control for confirming an endogenous protein SNO by the BST. For example, numerous experiments have demonstrated endogenous constitutively S-nitrosylated proteins that are largely insensitive to NOS inhibitors (25Chvanov M. Gerasimenko O.V. Petersen O.H. Tepikin A.V. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3024-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Davisson R.L. Bates J.N. Johnson A.K. Lewis S.J.

Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). To complement the Asc control in instances such as these, we sought to introduce a separate method to independently confirm the existence of an SNO moiety. Because UV light will efficiently cleave (photolyze) an SNO (29Stamler J.S. Jaraki O. Osborne J. Simon D.I. Keaney J. Vita J. Singel D. Valeri C.R. Loscalzo J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7674-7677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar), we reasoned that it should eliminate SNOs. We thus exposed SNO-GAPDH to UV radiation prior to the BST. This treatment resulted in a significant decrease in Asc-dependent biotinylation of SNO-GAPDH (Fig. 4A). The generality and biological utility of this approach were confirmed using CysNO-treated HEK-293 cells (Fig. 4B), which also demonstrated a strong attenuation of biotinylation when the lysates were first subjected to photolysis. Effects of Oxidative Stresses on Protein S-Nitrosylation—Despite reports that GSH depletion (30Beltran B. Orsi A. Clementi E. Moncada S. Br. J.

Furthermore, such studies require methodologies that can differentiate SNOs from other cotemporaneous Cys-based redox modifications. The BST coupled with SNO photolysis would seem to be ideal for such analyses. To this end, we examined the effects of BCNU (carmustine), a clinically employed alkylating/carbamoylating agent often used to treat astrocytomas, on general Cys redox status and S-nitrosylation. Consistent with previous reports (34Arrick B.A. Nathan C.F. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 4224-4232PubMed Google Scholar, 35Frischer H. Ahmad T. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1977; 89: 1080-1091PubMed Google Scholar), BCNU efficiently inhibited GSSG reductase in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 5A), which has been shown to increase the cellular GSSG/GSH ratio and thereby induce oxidative stress (36Frischer H. Kennedy E.J. Chigurupati R. Sivarajan M. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these conditions resulted in a loss of cellular protein thiols (Fig. 5B), demonstrating the effects of BCNU on Cys redox status of both low molecular weight thiols and proteins. Next, HEK-293 cells stably expressing nNOS were treated with BCNU and subjected to the BST. A dose-dependent increase in SNO-GAPDH was observed (Fig. 5C) that correlated with both GSSG reductase inhibition (Fig. 5A) and protein thiol oxidation (Fig. 5B). To confirm that modification of GAPDH by S-nitrosylation was consequent upon BCNU-induced oxidative stress (and hence to differentiate SNO from other Cys redox modifications), we employed SNO photolysis prior to the BST. As expected, UV pretreatment of samples resulted in a marked decrease in biotinylated GAPDH (Fig. 5D). Jaffrey and Snyder (2Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat.

Science. 2005; 310: 1966-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar) have provided unequivocal demonstrations of the utility of the BST for identifying SNOs. Given the widespread use of the assay, it remains important to show that assay specificity, which has to date been examined for a limited number of proteins (2Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 39Kim S.F. Huri D.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 2005; 310: 1966-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), in fact captures the general behavior of SNO proteins in complex biological systems. Here, we confirm that the BST is in fact highly selective for S-nitrosylated versus S-oxidized (sulfenic acid and disulfide) groups in proteins and that assay specificity, which is a unique feature of the chemistry between Asc and SNO, can be generalized to many classes of proteins. Interestingly, the one e– reduction potential of GSH/GSNO is ∼–180 mV (40Hou Y. Wang J. Arias F. Echegoyen L. Wang P.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 3065-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), indicating that Asc cannot directly reduce the S-NO bond (the Asc/semi-DHAsc radical Ered is +280 mV) (41Williams N.H. Yandell J.K. Aust. J. Chem. 1982; 35: 1133-1144Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Yet the BST requires that Asc liberate NO from SNO, which constitutes a formal one e– reduction. The solution to this paradox is to understand that Asc does not directly donate an electron to SNO but rather undergoes transnitrosation by SNO (a bimolecular reaction involving NO+ transfer) to generate O-nitrosoascorbate, which rapidly homolyzes to yield the semi-DHA radical and NO (20Holmes A.J. Williams D.L.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin. Trans. 2000; 2: 1639-1644Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Because this reaction with Asc is unique to SNO among Cys oxidation products, it confers specificity to the BST. Our experimental evidence strongly supports this conclusion. Our efforts to investigate the reports of false-positive biotinylation (9Landino L.M. Koumas M.T. Mason C.E. Alston J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 340: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 10Dahm C.C. Moore K. Murphy M.P. J. Biol.

Med. 2006; 41: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), which we had not previously observed even at high Asc concentrations (8Wang G. Moniri N.H. Ozawa K. Stamler J.S. Daaka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 1295-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 17Foster M.W. Stamler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25891-25897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), revealed that indirect sunlight is the likely cause. The semi-DHAsc radical, an intermediate in the oxidation of Asc to DHAsc by sunlight, probably plays a role. Though semi-DHAsc cannot drive the single e– reduction of biological Cys disulfides (Cys disulfide radical/disulfide Ered is ∼–1500 mV) (42Koppenol W.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1993; 14: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it has been shown to reduce reactive synthetic disulfides such as 4,4′-dithiopyridine (23Fleming J.E. Bensch K.G. Schreiber J. Lohmann W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C J. Biosci. 1983; 38C: 859-861Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), that are similar to biotin-HPDP. Indeed, we show that Asc in the presence of indirect sunlight reduces biotin-HPDP to biotin-SH, which would inevitably incorporate into protein disulfides to generate artifactual (i.e. SNO-independent) S-biotinylation, consistent with our findings and those of Huang et al. (12Huang B. Chen C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 562-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the data might be explained by UV light-induced tryptophan photoexcitation, enabling the transfer of one e– to an adjacent disulfide to generate a disulfide radical (21Miles A.M. Brew S.A. Ingham K.C. Smith R.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 22Permyakov E.A. Permyakov S.E. Deikus G.Y. Morozova-Roche L.A. Grishchenko V.M. Kalinichenko L.P. Uversky V.N. Proteins. 2003; 51: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which transiently dissociates into free thiol plus thiyl radical. Thermodynamically, Asc should drive this reaction by further reducing Cys thiyl radical to thiol (Cys thiol/thiyl radical Ered +920 mV) (43Buettner G.R. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 535-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar), which would then undergo biotinylation. Of relevance, Walmsley et al. (44Walmsley T.A. Abernethy M.H. Fitzgerald H.P. Clin. Chem. 1987; 33: 1928-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) applied this rationale to explain their discovery that ambient daylight reduced 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in the presence of Asc. Whatever the exact sequence of electron transfer that creates the artifact, we can recapitulate the result with indirect sunlight and Asc. Interestingly, our experiments demonstrate that, even in the absence of Asc, indirect sunlight promotes the biotinylation of an SNO during the labeling step of the BST. Indirect sunlight likely contains sufficient UV light for SNO homolysis (λmax 334 nm). Although it is generally thought that thiyl radicals proportionate to disulfides or are further oxidized, our experiments and those of others (21Miles A.M. Brew S.A. Ingham K.C. Smith R.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6941-6946Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 22Permyakov E.A. Permyakov S.E. Deikus G.Y. Morozova-Roche L.A. Grishchenko V.M. Kalinichenko L.P. Uversky V.N. Proteins. 2003; 51: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) suggest that protein Cys thiyl radicals are, at least in small part, reduced to thiols that can subsequently react with biotin-HPDP. That Asc potentiates the effects of indirect sunlight on SNO biotinylation would be consistent with Asc-mediated reduction of thiyl radical (as described previously). Alternatively, the semi-DHAsc radical (semi-DHAsc/DHAsc Ered –174 mV) (41Williams N.H. Yandell J.K. Aust. J. Chem. 1982; 35: 1133-1144Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar) may directly reduce an SNO to thiol (they have similar reduction potentials; see above). Increased sensitivity of the BST as a result of sunlight, however, comes at the expense of specificity; the labeling step should therefore be performed under fluorescent light or in the dark. A number of anti-cancer agents employed in clinical practice create an oxidative stress. Assessment of protein oxidation versus S-nitrosylation under these conditions has been a challenge. The introduction of the BST coupled to SNO photolysis has allowed us to rigorously demonstrate that pharmacologically induced oxidative stress in fact promotes GAPDH S-nitrosylation. Mechanisms for this increase in SNO-GAPDH may include a loss of reduced cellular GSH or oxidation of proteins necessary for the break down of S-nitrosothiols. Given the well established role of SNO-GAPDH in mediating cellular death (3Hara M.R. Agrawal N. Kim S.F. Cascio M.B. Fujimuro M. Ozeki Y. Takahashi M. Cheah J.H. Tankou S.K. Hester L.D. Ferris C.D.

Acta. 2006; 1762: 502-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), our data raise the idea that clinically employed cancer chemotherapies (e.g. BCNU) may execute their functions via S-nitrosylation of specific cytotoxic effectors (e.g. SNO-GAPDH). Unlike previous studies that have induced oxidative stresses by inhibition of GSH synthesis, we demonstrate that GSSG reductase-dependent recycling of GSSG to GSH plays a role in protein S-nitrosylation. GSH will accept NO from protein SNOs to generate GSNO, which can then be metabolized by GSNO reductase (46Liu L. Hausladen A. Zeng M. Que L. Heitman J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, 47Liu L. Yan Y. Zeng M. Zhang J. Hanes M.A. Ahearn G. McMahon T.J. Dickfeld T. Marshall H.E. Que L.G. Stamler J.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 617-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which BCNU increases SNO-GAPDH most likely involves a relative depletion of reduced GSH (via GSSG reductase inhibition), thus abrogating the transnitrosylative pathways that generate GSNO. In identifying GSSG reductase as a regulatory component in SNO homeostasis, we established that oxidative stimuli may elicit their effects through S-nitrosylation rather than exclusively by Cys oxidation. Notwithstanding the reproducibility and specificity of the BST for the detection of SNO proteins, we show here that SNO photolysis prior to the assay may be useful as a separate control. Whereas Asc generates an SNO-dependent signal, photolysis eliminates it. Photolysis may thus find wide application in instances where the BST does not respond to NOS agonists or inhibitors (which increase or eliminate endogenous SNO signals) or under conditions of diverse redox stresses (e.g. BCNU). The BST (when performed protected from sunlight) combined with SNO photolysis should provide a highly specific method for future investigations of S-nitrosylation, particularly under conditions that require differentiation of SNOs from other Cys-based modifications.

https://openalex.org/W2044106520,"Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is among the largest known non-polymeric natural products, and the only vitamin synthesized exclusively by microorganisms. The biosynthesis of the lower ligand of vitamin B(12), 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), is poorly understood. Recently, we discovered that a Sinorhizobium meliloti gene, bluB, is necessary for DMB biosynthesis. Here we show that BluB triggers the unprecedented fragmentation and contraction of the bound flavin mononucleotide cofactor and cleavage of the ribityl tail to form DMB and D-erythrose 4-phosphate. Our structural analysis shows that BluB resembles an NAD(P)H-flavin oxidoreductase, except that its unusually tight binding pocket accommodates flavin mononucleotide but not NAD(P)H. We characterize crystallographically an early intermediate along the reaction coordinate, revealing molecular oxygen poised over reduced flavin. Thus, BluB isolates and directs reduced flavin to activate molecular oxygen for its own cannibalization. This investigation of the biosynthesis of DMB provides clarification of an aspect of vitamin B12 that was otherwise incomplete, and may contribute to a better understanding of vitamin B12-related disease."

S1P exerts dual actions in cells; it acts as an intracellular second messenger and functions extracellularly as a ligand for a family of five G-protein-coupled receptors formerly known as endothelial differentiation gene (Edg) receptors. To date, five G-protein-coupled receptors, S1P-1 (Edg-1), S1P-2 (Edg-5), S1P-3 (Edg-3), S1P-4 (Edg-6), and S1P-5 (Edg-8), have been identified. All these receptors bind to and are activated by extracellular S1P and dihydro-S1P (1Pyne S. Pyne N.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 385-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 5Kluk M.J. Hla T.

Although TNF-α stimulates endothelial SphK by ∼2-fold, it is unclear if intracellular S1P levels are increased in ECs (31Xia P. Wang L. Gamble J.R. Vadas M.A. J. Biol.

During studies on intracellular S1P formation, we observed that exogenously added S1P was rapidly converted to intracellular S1P in human lung ECs. This suggested the existence of a novel but yet to be defined pathway whereby S1P could be taken by ECs from the circulation and used for intracellular signaling. Recently, several LPPs have been described in mammalian cells, and they are partly expressed as ectoenzymes on the cell surface (32Jasinska R. Zhang Q.X. Pilquil C. Singh I. Xu J. Dewald J.

In this study we demonstrate that in lung ECs exogenous S1P is a preferred source for the intracellular production of S1P compared with several agonists that stimulate sphingomyelinase activity. Our results also show that the exogenous S1P is hydrolyzed by ecto-LPP-1 present on human lung ECs to Sph, which is subsequently converted by SphK1 to intracellular S1P.

Bittman R. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 7694-7699Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Endothelial Cell Culture—For HPAECs, passages between 5 and 8 were grown to contact-inhibited monolayers with typical cobblestone morphology in EGM-2 complete media with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin in a 37 °C incubator under 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere (39Usatyuk P.V.

Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1779-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells from T-75 flasks were detached with 0.05% trypsin and resuspended in fresh complete medium and cultured in 35- or 60-mm dishes or on glass coverslips for immunofluorescence studies. All cells were starved overnight in EGM-2 medium containing 1% FBS before exposure to vehicle or agonists. Generation of Adenoviral Vectors—The SphK1 complete cDNA (GI: 21361087) with FLAG-tag DNA at the C terminus, the SphK1 dominant negative G82D with FLAG-tag DNA at C terminus, the SphK2 complete cDNA (GI: 21361698) with c-Myc-tag DNA at C terminus, and mouse LPP-1 (GI: 45592927) with c-Myc-tag DNA at the N terminus were inserted into an adenoviral expression vector with cytomegalovirus promoter. The recombinant plasmids were linearized and propagated in HEK 293 cells, and the high titer-purified preparations (∼1010 plaque-forming units/ml) were generated by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core. Infection of HPAECs with Adenoviral Vectors—Infection of HPAECs (∼60% confluence) with purified adenoviral empty vectors, adenoviral vectors containing cDNA for SphK1 wild type (wt) or SphK2 wt or SphK1 mutant, and wild type LPP-1 were carried out in 6-well plates as described previously (40Berdyshev E.V.

After infection with different m.o.i. in 1 ml of EGM for 24 h, the virus containing medium was replaced with EBM, and the experiments were carried out. Transfection of HPAECs with siRNA—HPAEC grown to ∼50% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with Gene Silencer® (Gene Therapy System, San Diego, CA) transfecting agent with target specific siRNA (50 nm) and scrambled siRNA (50 nm) in serum-free EBM-2 medium according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. After 3 h post-transfection, 1 ml of fresh complete EGM-2 medium containing 10% FBS was added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 72 h for analysis of SphK1, SphK2, SPP1, SPL, LPP-1, LPP-2, and LPP-3 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR. RNA Isolation—Total RNA was isolated from cultured HPAECs using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically, and samples with an absorbance of ≥1.8 measured at 260/280 nm were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Quantitative RT-PCR and Real-time RT-PCR—RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and real-time PCR and quantitative PCR were performed to assess expression of the SphK1, SphK2, SPP1, SPL, LPP-1, LPP-2, and LPP-3 using primers designed for the human mRNA sequences. Amplicon expression in each sample was normalized to its 18 S RNA content. The relative abundance of target mRNA in each sample was calculated as 2 raised to the negative of its threshold cycle value times 106 after being normalized to the abundance of its corresponding 18 S (e.g. 2–(sphingosine kinase 1 threshold cycle)/2–(18 S threshold cycle) × 106). Measurement of Intracellular [32P]S1P Generation—Control or HPAECs (35-mm dishes) infected with adenoviral vectors containing cDNA for wild type SphK1, SphK2 wild type, or LPP-1 (10 m.o.i. for 48 h) were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (20 μCi/ml) in phosphate-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) media for 3 h. The media was then aspirated, and cells were challenged with 1 ml of minimum Eagle’s medium alone or media containing S1P or Sph (1 μm) in the presence of 0.1% BSA for 15–60 min. Lipid labeling was terminated by the addition of 100 μlof12 m HCl followed by 2 ml of methanol. Cells were harvested with a cell scraper, the total extract was transferred to 15-ml glass tubes, and lipids were partitioned after vortexing into the chloroform phase by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform and 700 μlof1 m HCl (to give a final ratio of 1:1:0.9 of chloroform:methanol:acidic aqueous phase). After vortexing, the lower (chloroform) phase was dried under nitrogen, and the lipid extracts were subjected thin layer chromatography (TLC). Lipid extracts were applied at 10 cm from the bottom of 20-cm plastic baked silica gel 60 plates. The plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/NH4OH (65:35: 7.5, v/v/v), air-dried for 20 min, and then cut 2.0 cm above the origin. This removed neutral lipids and most of the zwitterionic phospholipids, whereas several acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidic acid, S1P, lysophosphatidate and ceramide 1-phosphate remained near the origin. The top part of the cut plate was discarded, and the bottom of the plate was then developed in the reverse direction with chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/acetone/water (10:2:3:4:1, v/v/v/v). Dried plates were subjected to autoradiography, the area corresponding to labeled S1P was excised, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The data were normalized to total radioactivity in the lipid extract or total cells on the monolayer (42Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N.

Lipid Extraction and Sample Preparation for LC-MS/MS Analysis of S1P, Dihydro-S1P, and Sph—Cellular lipids were extracted by a modified Bligh and Dyer procedure under acidic conditions using 0.1 m HCl and C17-S1P (40 pmol) and C17-Sph (30 pmol), which were added as internal standards during the lipid extraction step. The lipid extracts were dissolved in ethanol (200 μl), and aliquots were analyzed for total lipid phosphate (40Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I.A. Usatyuk P. Zhao Y. Saatian B. Hubbard W. Natarajan V.

S1P Hydrolysis to Sph by Ecto LPP Activity in HPAECs—HPAECs were grown on 35-mm dishes to ∼90% confluence. S1P (1 μm) (unlabeled plus [3H]S1P, 100,000 dpm per dish; specific activity 2.2 × 103 dpm/pmol) complexed to 0.1% BSA in 1 ml of EGM medium was added to HPAECs, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times (0–60 min). After the media (1 ml) were transferred to glass tubes, 2 ml of methanol, 1 m HCl (100:1 v/v) was added, and lipids were extracted by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform and 0.8 ml of H2O and centrifuged to separate the chloroform and methanol/aqueous phases. The lower (chloroform) phase was transferred to vials and evaporated under N2, and the hydrolysis of [3H]S1P to [3H]Sph was determined after separation by TLC in the presence of unlabeled sphingosine, added as carriers to the total lipid extracts (42Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gomez-Munoz A. O'Brien L. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/NH4OH (65:35:7.5, v/v/v) and exposed to iodine vapors to identify Sph band, and radioactivity associated with Sph was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The hydrolysis of [3H]S1P to [3H]Sph was expressed as dpm/dish or pmol/dish. Surface Labeling of ECs with Biotin—HPAECs (passage 6) grown on T-75-cm2 flasks were infected for 24 h with adenoviral empty vector or adenoviral mLPP-1 on the C terminus with Myc (10 m.o.i.). Media were removed, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Surface labeling of cells with biotin was performed with the Cell Surface Protein Isolation kit (Pierce) as per the manufacturer’s recommendation. Briefly, HPAECs were incubated with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (0.25 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C with constant rocking, and cells were collected, and lysed by sonication on ice for 5 s using lysis buffer (Pierce). The cell lysates were incubated with Immobilized NeutrAvidin™ gel for 60 min at room temperature with end-over mixing, and surface proteins were boiled in 400 μlof SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc(10E9) or anti-LPP-1 antibodies. Measurement of [3H]Ceramide Formation—HPAECs grown to ∼90% confluence in 35-mm dishes were labeled with l-[3H]serine (100 μCi/ml) in serine-free medium for 24 h to label sphingomyelin. l-[3H]Serine was removed by washing, and cells were challenged with medium alone or medium containing TNF-α (20 ng/ml), S1P (1 μm), H2O2 (100 μm), or bacterial sphingomyelinase (1 units/ml) for 30 min. The medium was aspirated, cells were scraped into 2 ml of methanol, 1 m HCl (100:1 v/v), and lipids were extracted by the addition of 2 ml of chloroform and 1.8 ml of 1 m HCl. Tubes were then centrifuged to separate the chloroform and methanol/aqueous phases. The lower (chloroform) phase was removed and dried under nitrogen, and the formation of [3H]ceramide was determined after separation by TLC with chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid/acetone/water (10:2:3:4:1 v/v/v/v). [3H]Ceramide was identified with an authentic standard visualized under I2 vapors, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Western Blotting—Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 200 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. Cell lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 10 min, sonicated on ice for 10 s, and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using BSA as standard. Equal amounts of protein (20 μg) or concentrated media (20 μl) were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA in TBST (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, and incubated with primary antibodies in 5% (w/v) BSA in TBST for 1–2 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed at least 3 times with TBST at 15-min intervals and then incubated with mouse, rabbit, or goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:3000) for 1 h at room temp. The membranes were developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Statistical Analyses—The results were analyzed by a Student-Newman-Keuls test. Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. of triplicate samples from two or more experimental groups, and statistical significance was taken to be p < 0.05. Agonist-induced Generation of S1P in ECs—Although activated platelets generate and secrete micromolar levels of S1P, several other circulating and non-circulating cells have the ability to produce intracellular S1P. S1P is a key angiogenic factor in the endothelium; however, the ability of ECs to generate intracellular S1P and its signaling effects has not been well defined. Therefore, several agonists that activate EC signal transduction and their effects on intracellular S1P formation were tested. As shown in Fig. 1A, among numerous agonists such as thrombin, vascular endothelial growth factor, phorbol ester, the calcium ionophore A23187, and TNF-α, only TNF-α increased [32P]S1P production (∼1.4-fold increase over control) in HPAECs. Interestingly, incubation of 32P-labeled HPAECs with human PPP or lipids derived from PPP showed a statistically significant increase in intracellular S1P production (Fig. 1B). By contrast, charcoal-treated PPP, as compared with lipids from charcoal treated PPP, failed to show any significant change in intracellular S1P (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the lipid extracts derived from the PPP fraction by LC-MS/MS revealed the presence of substantial amounts of S1P (1973 ± 97 pmol/ml of PPP), whereas charcoal treatment of PPP reduced the S1P levels by ∼75% (597 ± 38 pmol/ml) (Fig. 1C). Sph levels in the PPP fraction were very low (23 ± 6 pmol/ml of PPP), and charcoal treatment of PPP reduced the sphingosine levels by ∼50% (10 ± 2 pmol/ml of PPP). These results indicate that circulating Sph and/or S1P could serve as a source of intracellular S1P in ECs. Conversion of Exogenous Sph and S1P to Intracellular S1P—HPAECs were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 3 h and then exposed to either Sph or S1P, and the medium as well as the total cell lysates were analyzed to detect the relative [32P]S1P production. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, exposure of cells to either Sph or S1P resulted in the accumulation of [32P]S1P in a dose- and time-dependent manner. At all concentrations of the exogenously added substrate, formation of [32P]S1P from Sph was higher than that of S1P (Figs. 2, A and B). Furthermore, analysis of the medium and cells exposed to either exogenous S1P or Sph showed that >95% of the [32P]S1P generated was recovered in the total cell lysates with statistically insignificant levels present in the medium (Fig. 2C). In independent experiments, cells were incubated with Sph, and total cell lysates and medium were analyzed for S1P using LC-MS/MS (40Berdyshev E.V. Gorshkova I.A. Usatyuk P. Zhao Y. Saatian B.

This association greatly stimulates the CTD kinase activity of general transcription factor TFIIH, and subsequent CTD phosphorylation is involved in triggering promoter clearance. Here, highly purified proteins and a protein dissociation assay were used to investigate whether the RNAPII·Mediator complex (holo-RNAPII) can be disrupted by CTD phosphorylation, thereby severing one of the bonds that stabilize promoter-associated initiation complexes. We report that CTD phosphorylation by the serine 5-specific TFIIH complex, or its kinase module TFIIK, is indeed sufficient to dissociate holo-RNAPII. Surprisingly, phosphorylation by the CTD serine 2-specific kinase CTDK1 also results in dissociation. Moreover, the Mediator-induced stimulation of CTD phosphorylation previously reported for TFIIH is also observed with CTDK1 kinase. An unrelated CTD-binding protein, Rsp5, is capable of stimulating this CTD kinase activity as well. These data shed new light on mechanisms that drive the RNAPII transcription cycle and suggest a mechanism for the enhancement of CTD kinase activity by the Mediator complex.

These data shed new light on mechanisms that drive the RNAPII transcription cycle and suggest a mechanism for the enhancement of CTD kinase activity by the Mediator complex.

The Mediator complex transduces signals from sequence-specific transcriptional regulators to the general transcription machinery (16Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M.

The association of Mediator with RNAPII, and its function in transcription, depends on the RNAPII CTD (16Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Mediator is able to bind an unphosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-CTD fusion protein in vitro (16Myers L.C.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) and can be displaced from RNAPII using the monoclonal antibody 8WG16, which specifically recognizes the CTD repeat (17Kim Y.J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6075-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Apart from the CTD-interacting surfaces, Mediator also interacts with RNAPII domains outside of the CTD (20Asturias F.J. Jiang Y.W. Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Science. 1999; 283: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 21Davis J.A. Takagi Y. Kornberg R.D. Asturias F.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 409-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The observation that RNAPII enters the initiation complex in the unphosphorylated (RNAPIIA) form and leaves it in the hyperphosphorylated (RNAPIIO) form gave rise to the idea that the initiation to elongation transition is somehow facilitated by hyperphosphorylation of the CTD (3Payne J.M. Laybourn P.J. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19621-19629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The association with Mediator might be one of the mechanisms by which RNAPIIA is tied to promoters. In crude yeast extracts, Mediator is almost entirely absent from the fraction containing chromatin-bound RNAPIIO engaged in transcription, whereas it is present in the soluble fraction where only RNAPIIA is detected (19Svejstrup J.Q. Li Y. Fellows J. Gnatt A. Bjorklund S. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6075-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, purified Mediator in solution is able to dynamically exchange with Mediator in immobilized holo-RNAPII (19Svejstrup J.Q. Li Y. Fellows J. Gnatt A. Bjorklund S. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6075-6078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The idea that phosphorylation might somehow result in the dissociation of the Mediator·RNAPII complex was further supported by experiments using immobilized transcription templates in transcription-proficient yeast extracts (22Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In these extracts, the Mediator complex and other factors formed an activator-dependent “scaffold” for the binding of RNAPII, enabling efficient transcription initiation and re-initiation. Interestingly, TFIIH and ATP (but not AMP-PNP) were found to stimulate the dissociation of RNAPII from these scaffolds, indicating that phosphorylation, but not transcription, is important for dissociation (22Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Further investigation of the stability of pre-initiation complexes assembled in crude yeast extract indicated that phosphorylation of RNAPII (either by TFIIH or Srb10/Med12-Srb11/Med13) caused some ATP-dependent dissociation of the pre-initiation complex (22Yudkovsky N. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Nature. 2000; 408: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 23Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These experiments also showed that TFIIH has two protein targets in Mediator (Med4 and Med14). However, given that numerous protein-protein interactions exist in the pre-initiation complex, no clear conclusion on the precise functional effect of these multiple phosphorylation events could be made. The mechanism that results in the release of the Mediator complex from holo-RNAPII has so far not been studied in a defined system containing only RNAPII holoenzyme and CTD kinase. Here, we have investigated the stability of the holo-RNAPII complex in relation to CTD phosphorylation using such a system. We also investigated the mechanism underlying stimulation of CTD kinase activity by the Mediator complex. Strain Construction—C-terminal tagging of endogenous yeast genes was performed using a PCR-based procedure (24Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4130) Google Scholar). Details are available on request. The epitope tags caused no growth defects when compared with parental strains (not shown). The following yeast strains were used for protein purification: RPB2-HIS-HA (JSY556; W303–1A ura3 leu2–3,112 trp1–1 his3–11,15 ade2–1 can1–100 RPB2-HIS-HA::TRP1); MED14-TAP RPB8–3HA (JSY1065; CB010 MATa pep4::HIS3 prb1::LEU2 prc1::HISG can1 ade2 trp1 ura3, his3 leu2–3,112 RGR1::RGR1-TAP-TRP1 RPB8::RPB8–3HA-ADE2); CTK1-TAP (Open Biosystems); TFB3-TAP (25Borggrefe T.

Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) and TFIIK (26Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar) were purified as described. CTD kinase 1 (CTDK1) was purified using a modification of the tandem affinity purification (TAP) procedure described (26Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar, 27Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q.

Briefly, (DNA-associated) whole cell extract protein was precipitated by the addition of 0.0175% (v:v) polyethylenimine, pH 7.9, and centrifugation (14 krpm, 30 min, 4 °C). The pellet was resuspended by Dounce homogenization in TAP50 buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, (4 °C), 50 mm KOAc, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol), and centrifuged as before. Proteins were extracted from the pellet by resuspension in TAP400 (400 instead of 50 mm KOAc) and Dounce homogenization as before, followed by centrifugation as above. Proteins in the supernatant were precipitated by adding (NH4)2SO4 to 40% saturation. After centrifugation (14 krpm, 40 min, 4 °C), the pellet was resuspended in TAP0 to a conductivity of <0.5 m (NH4)2SO4, after which the procedure for TAP purification was followed (26Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Mediator was purified using a modification of the procedure for TAP purification (26Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast whole cell extract was loaded onto Heparin-Sepharose equilibrated in K100 buffer (K buffer: 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol. KCl was added to the mm concentration indicated). The resin was washed in 2 column volumes K200 before elution in K600. Eluted protein was precipitated by the addition of (NH4)2SO4 to 50% saturation followed by centrifugation (42 krpm Beckmann 45 Ti, 60 min, 4 °C). Protein was resuspended in TAP0 buffer to conductivity below that of 400 mm (NH4)2SO4. Hereafter, the procedure for TAP purification was followed (26Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). All buffers for purification contained protease inhibitor mixture (1.9 mm benzamidine-HCl, 0.97 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin A, 0.523 μm leupeptin). The purity of TFIIH, TFIIK, CTDK1, and Rsp5 used in this study has been reported previously (27Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation Assay—Purified holo-RNAPII (incorporating Med14-TAP and Rpb8–3HA affinity-tagged subunits) was immobilized on either anti-HA affinity resin or IgG resin, respectively. TFIIH, TFIIK, or CTDK1 was added, with or without ATP, to allow CTD phosphorylation. Beads and supernatants were separated by centrifugation, and dissociation was indicated by the ATP-dependent appearance in the supernatant of Mediator subunits, which was monitored by immunoblotting with antibodies to detect Mediator and RNAPII, respectively. The holo-RNAPII peak from hydroxyapatite (17Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) was used as source of holo-RNAPII. For the dissociation assay where holo-RNAPII was immobilized via Med14/Rgr1 (Fig. 5B), 300 μl of this fraction was added to IgG beads equilibrated in the same buffer and incubated on a roller table for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted (500 rpm, 1 min, room temperature) and the supernatant was removed, leaving the resin undisturbed. Unbound protein was removed from the beads by three washes with 2 ml of binding buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm KOAc, 15 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture) (see above), and the supernatant was removed as before. Holo-RNAPII carried a protein-A tag as part of the TAP tag on Med14. Because Protein-A binds firmly to the constant region of most antibodies, we removed it by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease treatment: after IgG immobilization, 300 μl of binding buffer containing 0.5–1 unit/μl TEV protease (TEV protease or AcTEV protease; Invitrogen) was added and incubated for 30 min at 16 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Eluted and highly purified holo-RNAPII in the supernatant was pooled with two further washes of 300 μl of binding buffer. For use in dissociation assays, this version of holo-RNAPII was then immobilized via the HA tag on Rpb8. For this purpose, the monoclonal antibody 12CA5 was immobilized on Affi-Gel-15 resin (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. 12CA5 beads were equilibrated by repeated (3×) pelleting (500 rpm, room temperature) and resuspension in 2 ml of binding buffer prior to incubation with the pool of holo-RNAPII elutions from IgG-Sepharose. Binding was at 4 °C for 2–4 h with gentle shaking. Unbound proteins were removed by two washes with 2 ml of binding buffer followed by two washes of 2 ml of phosphorylation buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.6 (at 25 °C), 75 mm KOAc, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.06% Tween 20, 0.003% Nonidet P-40, 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Finally, the resin was resuspended in an appropriate volume of phosphorylation buffer prior to addition of CTD kinases and, where appropriate, ATP. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min before being returned to ice. Supernatants and pellets were separated as above. Two washing steps of 500 μl of binding buffer each were pooled with the initial supernatant sample. Protein in the supernatants was then concentrated by extraction with 10 μl of Strataclean resin (Stratagene). Protein from supernatants and beads was analyzed by immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Proteins were detected by standard techniques using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the Mediator subunits Med1 (dilution 1:10,000) and Med4 (dilution 1:5,000) (Mediator antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. Stefan Bjoörklund, University of Umeaå, Sweden), the mouse monoclonal antibody H5 (Covance), which recognizes phosphorylated serine 2 in the CTD heptapeptide repeat, and with 12CA5 (anti-hemagglutinin epitope antibody). Dissociation Assay Using IgG Beads and [γ-32P]ATP—Holo-RNAPII (100 μg) from hydroxyapatite was bound to 100 μlof IgG-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °Cand washed as described above for binding of holo-RNAPII to 12CA5 beads. Kinases were added, and salt was adjusted to 100 mm KOAc in a volume of 10 μl/reaction. Dissociation assays were started by adding 10 μl2× reaction mix (80 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 200 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) to each reaction and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation was stopped by adding 10 μl of 30 mm EDTA. After separation of supernatant and beads as above, sample buffer was added and reactions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager plate (Storm 800; GE Healthcare). The results were processed and quantified by densitometry using the ImageJ program (rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). CTD Kinase Assays—Kinase assays were performed in 20 μl of final volume of reaction buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KOAc, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 62.5 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Each reaction contained 300 ng of RNAPII as well as kinases and kinase-stimulating proteins. Incubation was at 30 °C for 60 min. Reactions were terminated by addition of 5 μlof5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and incubation at 95 °C for 3–5 min. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was exposed to film or PhosphorImager plate. To investigate whether CTD phosphorylation per se is sufficient to disrupt the association between Mediator and RNAPII, we used highly purified proteins in a defined biochemical assay system. The experimental design used holo-RNAPII purified from a yeast strain expressing an epitope-tagged version of one of the RNAPII subunits. Holo-RNAPII was then immobilized on an affinity resin, and a dissociation assay was performed (Fig. 1). This assay entailed adding highly purified kinase (TFIIH, TFIIK, or CTDK1) to phosphorylate the CTD of Rpb1, with ATP-dependent appearance in the supernatant of Mediator subunits indicating that phosphorylation of the CTD caused holo-RNAPII dissociation. Immobilization of Holo-RNAPII via Rbp2 Inhibits CTD Hyperphosphorylation—Purification of core RNAPII, holo-RNAPII (Mediator·RNAPII complex), and holo-TFIIH was done according to published procedures (17Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 28Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, highly purified holo-TFIIH efficiently hyperphosphorylated both core RNAPII and holo-RNAPII (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3, respectively). Surprisingly, however, immobilization of (Rpb2)HA-tagged holo-RNAPII on 12CA5 antibody conjugated to protein A-Sepharose significantly inhibited phosphorylation (Fig. 2A, lane 4). The inhibition of hyperphosphorylation of the immobilized holo-polymerase might be due to steric hindrance, as the tag on the C-terminal of Rpb2 is close to the Rpb1 domain, which links the CTD to RNAPII (29Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). To try and overcome this problem, the Rpb8 subunit was tagged instead. This was done in a strain expressing a tagged Mediator subunit (Med14 (Rgr1), which had previously been used for Mediator purification) (30Hallberg M. Polozkov G.V. Hu G.Z. Beve J. Gustafsson C.M. Ronne H. Bjorklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3370-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), creating an RPB8–3HA MED14-TAP strain. Holo-RNAPII from this strain would thus enable us to investigate dissociation of Mediator from immobilized RNAPII or, alternatively, dissociation of RNAPII from immobilized Mediator. In contrast to what had been observed previously with Rpb2-tagged holo-RNAPII, immobilization of Rpb8-tagged holo-RNAPII complex via the triple HA tag on Rpb8 (or on IgG via Med14-TAP) allowed TFIIH to quantitatively shift Rpb1 to the position typical for hyperphosphorylated RNAPII (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 4 and 6; data not shown). Under some circumstances, the Srb10/Srb11 kinase is found associated with holo-RNAPII (31Liao S.M. Zhang J. Jeffery D.A. Koleske A.J. Thompson C.M. Chao D.M. Viljoen M. van Vuuren H.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation was dependent on ATP and TFIIH, suggesting that little, if any, kinase activity was associated with our holo-RNAPII preparation (Fig. 2C, lane 1, and data not shown). Together, these results indicated that the Rpb8–3HA Med14-TAP holoenzyme could be used to study phosphorylation-dependent Mediator·RNAPII dissociation. Phosphorylation by TFIIH Causes Dissociation of Mediator and RNAPII—Holo-RNAPII was immobilized on 12CA5 antibody beads via the tag on Rpb8. TFIIH kinase, with or without ATP, was then added to study dissociation. Successful phosphorylation in the presence of ATP was indicated by the quantitative mobility shift of Rpb1 on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel that was silver-stained (Fig. 3A). The result of the coincident dissociation experiment is shown in Fig. 3B. Substantial ATP-dependent dissociation of Med4 from immobilized RNAPII was seen by following the Med4 band: in the presence of ATP, Med4 dissociated from the resin (compare lanes 2 and 3) and appeared in the supernatant (compare lanes 5 and 6). Negligible dissociation was observed in the presence of ATP but absence of kinase (data not shown). Interestingly, when adding the slowly hydrolyzing ATP analogue ATP-γS, a small but detectable level of dissociation above background was observed (compares lane 4, 5, and 6). The basis and relevance of this observation are unknown. More importantly, no significant holo-RNAPII dissociation was observed in the presence of TFIIH but absence of ATP (compare lanes 5 and 6), strongly indicating that TFIIH-mediated phosphorylation of the CTD, not the presence of TFIIH per se, causes holo-RNAPII dissociation. The TFIIK Kinase Subcomplex Is Sufficient for Dissociation—The observed ATP-dependent dissociation of holo-RNAPII fits well with the change in phosphorylation status of the Rpb1 CTD during promoter clearance (1Svejstrup J.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Serine 5 is the primary target for phosphorylation at this stage, with serine 2 phosphorylation only becoming enriched later in the transcription cycle (1Svejstrup J.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Although CTD phosphorylation appeared to be sufficient for dissociation in the above experiments, a possible (active) role mediated by other subunits of TFIIH, such as the Rad3 (XPD in man) and Ssl2 (XPB) ATP-dependent helicases, could also be envisioned. TFIIK (Kin28/Ccl1/Tfb3) is the submodule of TFIIH that harbors the CTD kinase Kin28, and Kin28 interacts with Rpb1 and Rpb2 in vitro (33Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 79: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To establish whether phosphorylation by TFIIK is sufficient to elicit holo-RNAPII dissociation, the TFIIK complex was purified as previously described (27Somesh B.P. Reid J. Liu W.F. Sogaard T.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Cell. 2005; 121: 913-923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Moreover, having observed that TFIIH phosphorylation leads to holo-RNAPII dissociation, it was also interesting to investigate whether dissociation requires phosphorylation at the residue specifically targeted by this kinase, serine 5, or whether serine 2 phosphorylation might also dissociate holo-RNAPII. We therefore also purified the kinase that predominantly phosphorylates serine 2, CTDK1. Two preliminary experiments were carried out to verify the function of TFIIK and CTDK1 prior to their use in the dissociation assay. First, a titration was performed to establish how much of each kinase was needed to quantitatively shift the Rpb1 band from holo-RNAPIIA immobilized on 12CA5 beads (Fig. 4A). Second, because previous experiments have shown that the target specificity of TFIIK and CTDK1 differ, we tested the activity of CTDK1 on a CTD substrate that was first treated with a saturating amount of TFIIK to fully phosphorylate serine 5. As expected, CTDK1 caused a supershift of the polymerase, indicating that the two kinases indeed hit different targets in the CTD (Fig. 4B). The purified kinases were then used in the dissociation assay. The effect of holo-TFIIH and TFIIK is compared in Fig. 5A. Although a somewhat higher background level of ATP-independent Mediator release is evident in this experiment (lane 3), Mediator clearly accumulated in the supernatant upon ATP-dependent phosphorylation by holo-TFIIH (compare lanes 3 and 5; Med4 blot). More importantly, using highly purified TFIIK, a clear, ATP-dependent accumulation of Mediator subunits was observed in the supernatant (compare lanes 7 and 9). This indicates that the activity of the TFIIK kinase complex is sufficient to dissociate holo-RNAPII in an ATP-dependent manner and suggests that the other ATPases (helicases) in TFIIH do not play an important role in this event. Indeed, several independent dissociation assays failed to detect any significant difference in the ability of TFIIH and TFIIK to dissociate holo-RNAPII (data not shown). The dissociation experiment was repeated, this time by immobilizing holo-RNAPII via Mediator rather than RNAPII and using TFIIK, CTDK1, or both as the kinase source (Fig. 5B). For technical reasons, the dissociating RNAPII was in this experiment detected by performing the assay with labeled ATP and following the fate of the phosphorylated polymerase by autoradiography. As can be seen, increasing amounts of kinase indeed led to increasing dissociation of RNAPII (compare lanes 1–2 with lanes 3–4 and 5–6 for TFIIK and lanes 7–8 with lanes 9–10 for CTDK1), indicating that phosphorylation by both TFIIK and CTDK1 promotes holo-RNAPII dissociation. When the CTD kinases were combined (lanes 11–12 and 13–14), somewhat more phosphorylated RNAPII was recovered in the supernatant, indicating an additional effect on dissociation when both serine 2 and serine 5 are phosphorylated. Previous work by others showed that immobilized holo-RNAPII can be separated into RNAPII and Mediator by washing with buffer containing 1 m urea. In contrast, the Mediator complex itself sustains its integrity in up to 2 m urea (34Kang J.S. Kim S.H. Hwang M.S. Han S.J. Lee Y.C. Kim Y.J. J. Biol.

Both xyloglucan and the enzymes responsible for its modification and degradation are finding increasing prominence, reflecting both the drive for enzymatic biomass conversion, their role in detergent applications, and the utility of modified xyloglucans for cellulose fiber modification. Here we present the enzymatic characterization and three-dimensional structures in ligand-free and xyloglucan-oligosaccharide complexed forms of two distinct xyloglucanases from glycoside hydrolase families GH5 and GH12.

In the case of the (β/α)8 GH5 enzyme, kinetically productive interactions are made with both xylose and galactose substituents, as reflected in both a high specific activity on xyloglucan and the kinetics of a series of aryl glycosides. The differential strategies for the accommodation of the side chains of xyloglucan presumably facilitate the action of these microbial hydrolases in milieus where diverse and differently substituted substrates may be encountered.

The differential strategies for the accommodation of the side chains of xyloglucan presumably facilitate the action of these microbial hydrolases in milieus where diverse and differently substituted substrates may be encountered. Xyloglucans comprise a family of plant polysaccharides united by a common β(1→4) glucan backbone regularly decorated at C-6 with α-linked xylopyranosyl residues (1Fry S.C. J. Exp. Bot. 1989; 40: 1-11Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have indicated that most xyloglucans are based upon the Glc4 oligosaccharide repeats XXXG or XXGG, where G and X denote unsubstituted d-Glcp and α-d-Xylp(1→6)-d-Glcp units, respectively (2Vincken J.P. York W.S. Beldman G. Voragen A.G.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). More rarely, some species have been observed to produce xyloglucans with both Glc4 and Glc5 backbone repeats, such as XXXXG (3Buckeridge M.S. Crombie H.J. Mendes C.J.M. Reid J.S.G. Gidley M.J. Vieira C.C.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1997; 303: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and XXGGG (4Sims I.M. Munro S.L.A. Currie G. Craik D. Bacic A. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 293: 147-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The xylose branches may in turn be substituted with combinations of galactopyranose, fucopyranose, arabinofuranose, and O-acetyl residues, depending upon the plant species and tissue localization (reviewed in Refs. 2Vincken J.P.

A concise, linear notation based on single-letter abbreviations of commonly observed microstructures is widely used to simplify the description of xyloglucans and xylogluco-oligosaccharides (7Fry S.C. York W.S. Albersheim P. Darvill A. Hayashi T. Joseleau J.P. Kato Y. Lorences E.P. Maclachlan G.A. McNeil M. Mort A.J. Reid J.S.G. Seitz H.U. Selvendran R.R. Voragen A.G.J. White A.R. Physiol.

The general structure of xyloglucans based on XXXG repeat units, such as the widely studied xyloglucan from tamarind (Tamarindus indica) seed kernel, is shown in Fig. 1. In plants, xyloglucans function both as seed storage carbohydrates (8Buckeridge M.S. dos Santos H.P. Tine M.A.S. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 38: 141-156Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and as essential modulators of the mechanical properties of the primary cell wall (see Refs. 9Brummell D.A. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 10Cosgrove D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 850-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar, 11Thompson D.S. J.

Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 536-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar and references therein). In the latter context, xyloglucans are intimately associated with cellulose through surface adsorption and direct entrapment within the paracrystalline structure (15Pauly M. Albersheim P. Darvill A. York W.S. Plant J. 1999; 20: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Primary cell wall xyloglucans are widely distributed among land plants (16Carpita N. McCann M. Buchanan B. Gruissem W. Jones R. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Plants. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., Somerset, NJ2000: 52-108Google Scholar), thus suggesting that the specific cellulose-xyloglucan interaction may have conferred a particular structural advantage in the colonization of drier habitats (17Popper Z.A. Fry S.C. Ann. Bot. 2003; 91: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 18Popper Z.A. Fry S.C. New Phytol. 2004; 164: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). There is strong and evolving interest in xyloglucans and also in the enzymes responsible for their modification and degradation. Such interest stems not only from the role of these polysaccharides and their catalysts in plant cell wall morphogenesis (9Brummell D.A. Funct. Plant Biol. 2006; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 10Cosgrove D.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 850-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (2316) Google Scholar, 13Scheible W.R.

Chem. 2006; 71: 5151-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the goal of biofuel production from plant biomass, which strives to substantially reduce fossil fuel usage, has caused a great resurgence of interest in plant cell wall degrading enzymes (37Demain A.L. Newcomb M. Wu J.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 124-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). However, plant biomass remains extremely difficult to exploit, primarily because its components are extremely resistant to degradation; plant cell wall polysaccharides are often present as insoluble, cross-linked structures. Furthermore, the chemistry of the glycosidic bond itself makes its hydrolysis one of the most challenging reactions in nature, with Wolfenden showing that, in the absence of biological catalysts for its degradation, cellulose has a half-life in excess of 4 million years (38Wolfenden R. Lu X. Young G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6814-6815Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar. The biocatalysts responsible for the hydrolysis of the backbone of xyloglucan are xyloglucan endo-β-1,4-glucanases or “xyloglucanases” (EC 3.2.1.151). This enzyme commission number reflects many different enzyme sequences, structures, and hydrolytic mechanisms with either inversion or retention of the configuration of the anomeric carbon. In the sequence-based CAZy (carbohydrate active enzymes) classification (39Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2651) Google Scholar) (recently reviewed in Ref. 40Davies G.J. Gloster T.M. Henrissat B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), enzymes defined as xyloglucanases are found in retaining families GH5, GH12, and GH16 and inverting families GH44 and GH74. To date, xyloglucanase structures have only been reported for the GH74 family enzymes (41Martinez-Fleites C. Guerreiro C.I.P.D. Baumann M.J. Taylor E.J. Prates J.A.M. Ferreira L.M.A. Fontes C.M.G.A.

Kitago, N. Watanabe, S. Karita, K. Sakka, and I. Tanaka, unpublished data. The structure of the poplar xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (EC 2.4.1.207) from family GH16, which strongly favors transglycosylation of xyloglucan over hydrolysis, has also been determined (43Johansson P. Brumer H. Baumann M.J. Kallas A.M. Henriksson H. Denman S.E. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 874-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Here we report the characterization, both on polymeric substrates and defined aryl xyloglucan oligosaccharides (Fig. 1), of two structurally distinct xyloglucan hydrolases from families GH5 and GH12: P. pabuli XG5 (hereafter PpXG5) and B. licheniformis XG12 (hereafter BlXG12). The single crystal x-ray structures of both enzymes have been determined, at resolutions from 1.95 to 1.40 Å, in both an unliganded form and in complex with xyloglucan oligosaccharides based upon a cellotetraose backbone. These three-dimensional complexes interpreted in light of the kinetics of the two enzyme classes on xyloglucan-derived substrates provide an unique insight into the different ways xyloglucan side chains are accommodated and/or harnessed for catalysis. The 40-kDa xyloglucanase produced by the P. pabuli strain (DSM 13330) was cloned by standard methods. Briefly, purified genomic P. pabuli DNA was partially digested by Sau3A and cloned into an Escherichia coli-based lambdaZAPexpress vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Ligated DNA was packaged in phages using the GigaPackIII gold kit (Stratagene). Eventually, plaque-forming phages were screened on agar plates containing AZCL-xyloglucan (Megazyme International Ireland Ltd.), and positive clones were seen by the formation of blue halos. The gene encoding PpXG5 was DNA-sequenced, and PCR primers were designed for amplification of the gene from P. pabuli genomic DNA. The PpXG5 gene was cloned into a B. subtilis expression vector and expressed as a secreted form from the amyl promoter. PpXG5 was recovered from the broth through a combination of chemical and physical separation steps. The supernatant was applied to a pre-equilibrated S-Sepharose column at pH 5 in 20 mm sodium acetate buffer. PpXG5 was eluted with a gradient of 1 m NaCl in 20 mm sodium acetate, and the appropriate fractions were pooled. PpXG5 was further purified by gel filtration on an S200 column in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 6. The 26-kDa xyloglucanase produced by the B. licheniformis strain (ATCC14580) was cloned from B. licheniformis genomic DNA, and the gene was expressed in B. subtilis by essentially the same protocol as described above for PpXG5. Protein purification also followed a similar strategy. Enzymatic variants of BlXG12 were constructed using the megapriming method and purified as for the wild type enzyme. Substrate Specificity—Substrate specificity was determined using the Somogyi-Nelson reducing sugar assay (44Somogyi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1945; 160: 69-73Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 45Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1944; 153: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) (total assay volume 100 μl, 700 μl of reagents added) versus a standard curve for glucose (1.0-15 μg). The following polysaccharides were used: konjac glucomannan, carboxymethyl cellulose, Alcaligenes faecalis curdlan, wheat arabinoxylan, carob galactomannan (low viscosity), Icelandic moss lichenan, tamarind xyloglucan, and barley β-glucan (all from Megazyme); Avicel, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and apple pectin (70-75% esterification) (Fluka); and birchwood xylan and citrus pectic acid (Sigma). Soluble polysaccharides were tested in triplicate at 0.5 g/liter by incubation with each enzyme (0.23 mg/liter PpXG5 or 5.9 mg/liter BlXG12) at 55 °C in 50 mm NaOAc buffer, pH 5.5, for 15 min (initial rate conditions). Reducing sugars were quantified at 520 nm with a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). pH Rate Profiles—The pH rate profiles of PpXG5 and BlXG12 were determined in triplicate using the method described by Nelson and Somogyi with tamarind xyloglucan (1 g/liter) as the substrate. The following 50 mm buffer systems were used: sodium acetate, pH 4.0-5.5, and sodium phosphate, pH 5. Time-dependent Depolymerization of Xyloglucan—Samples (600-μl total volume) containing tamarind xyloglucan (1 g/liter) and PpXG5 (56 μg/liter) or BlXG12 (840 μg/liter) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, were aliquoted and removed after incubation for 7, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min at 55 °C or overnight incubation at 37 °C.

HPLC grade Me2SO was used as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and the column temperature was maintained at 60 °C (27Brumer H. Zhou Q. Baumann M.J. Carlsson K. Teeri T.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 5715-5721Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Limit Digest Analysis—Extended enzymatic hydrolysis of xyloglucan (0.5 g/liter) in 50 mm NaOAc buffer, pH 5.5, was performed at 37 °C overnight with PpXG5 (280 μg/liter) or BlXG12 (58,000 μg/liter). Samples were analyzed with a Dionex ICS-3000 high performance anion exchange chromatography system with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) and a Dionex PA-100 column using a gradient modified from that previously described (41Martinez-Fleites C.

M. Ibatullin, M. J. Baumann, and H. Brumer, manuscript in preparation. All XGO aryl glycosides were purified on C18-silica reversed-phase columns (RP18; Supelco) before use and exhibited satisfactory NMR and mass spectra. The enzymatic hydrolyses of GGGG-CNP, XXXG-CNP, and XLLG-CNP were followed by continuous assays measuring the release of 2-chloro-4-nitrophenolate at 405 nm (measured ϵ 9724 m-1 cm-1, 5 mm NaOAc buffer, pH 5.5) using a Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). A total assay volume of 100 μl was used in 1-cm path length quartz cells equilibrated and maintained at 30 ± 0.1 °C in a Peltier-controlled cell block. Initial rates were determined from the slope of the linear region of the reaction time course corresponding to <10% conversion. Assays of PpXG5 and BlXG12 employed total enzyme (protein) concentrations of 1.4 μg/ml (0.035 μm) and 46.8 μg/ml (1.79 μm), respectively. Kinetic constants were obtained from plots of vo/[E]t versus [S] by nonlinear curve fitting using Microcal™ Origin® version 6.0. In the absence of an active site titrant, [E]t was assumed to be equivalent to the total protein concentration (i.e. 100% active protein). The rates of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of XXXG-pMP were determined by incubation in 5.0 mm NaOAc buffer, pH 5.5, with the temperature maintained in a thermostated block at 30 ± 0.1 °C (100-μl total assay volume). The incubation time for PpXG5 was 60 min, and the concentration of the enzyme in the assay was 1.4 μg/ml (0.035 μm). For BlXG12, the incubation time was 60 min, and the enzyme concentration was 117 μg ml-1 (4.49 μm). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2 m sodium carbonate (100 μl). The concentration of released 4-methoxyphenolate was determined by measuring the absorbance at 305 nm (ϵ 2656 m-1 cm-1) using a Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian) and subtraction of background values from XXXG-pMP. PpXG5, at ∼15 mg/ml, was crystallized from 20-25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.2 m CaCl2 and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. Single crystals were cryoprotected with mother liquor with the addition of 25% (v/v) ethylene glycol.

Data were collected at the ESRF on beamline ID14-1 to 1.95 Å resolution from a single crystal cooled to 100 K. Data were integrated and processed with DENZO and scaled and merged with SCALEPACK in HKL2000 (46Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

Initial crystals of the native form of BlXG12 were obtained in a 50:50 merohedrally twinned crystal form (apparent space group P4n a = b = 124 Å, c = 50 Å; data to 2.2 Å, Rmerge = 10% at edge). Subsequently, a E155Q variant of BlXG12 was used to obtain a nontwinned crystal form. BlXG12(E155Q) was crystallized from 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.05 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m BisTris, pH 6.5. Native data were collected in the home laboratory (YSBL, York, UK) using CuKα radiation and a MARResearch Image Plate system. Data were processed with DENZO/SCALEPACK (46Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

https://openalex.org/W2050694319,"Mantle upwelling is essential to the generation of new oceanic crust at mid-ocean ridges, and it is generally assumed that such upwelling is symmetric beneath active ridges. Here, however, we use seismic imaging to show that the isotropic and anisotropic structure of the mantle is rotated beneath the East Pacific Rise. The isotropic structure defines the pattern of magma delivery from the mantle to the crust. We find that the segmentation of the rise crest between transform faults correlates well with the distribution of mantle melt. The azimuth of seismic anisotropy constrains the direction of mantle flow, which is rotated nearly 10 degrees anticlockwise from the plate-spreading direction. The mismatch between the locus of mantle melt delivery and the morphologic ridge axis results in systematic differences between areas of on-axis and off-axis melt supply. We conclude that the skew of asthenospheric upwelling and transport governs segmentation of the East Pacific Rise and variations in the intensity of ridge crest processes."

So far, endoglin is known as a negative regulator of TGF-β/ALK-5 signaling. Here we analyzed the effect of BMP-7 on TGF-β1 signaling and the role of endoglin for both pathways in endoglin-deficient L6E9 cells. In this myoblastic cell line, TGF-β1 and BMPs are opposing cytokines, interfering with myogenic differentiation. Both induce specific target genes of which Id1 (for BMPs) and collagen I (for TGF-β1) are two examples. TGF-β1 activated two distinct type I receptors, ALK-5 and ALK-1, in these cells. Although the ALK-5/Smad3 signaling pathway mediated collagen I expression, ALK-1/Smad1/Smad5 signaling mediated a transient Id1 up-regulation. In contrast, BMP-7 exclusively activated Smad1/Smad5 resulting in a more prolonged Id1 expression. Although BMP-7 had no impact on collagen I abundance, it antagonized TGF-β1-induced collagen I expression and (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc activity, effects that are mediated by the ALK-5/Smad3 pathway. Finally, we found that the transient overexpression of endoglin, previously shown to inhibit TGF-β1-induced ALK-5/Smad3 signaling, enhanced the BMP-7/Smad1/Smad5 pathway.

Based on their structures and functions, BMPs can be subdivided into several groups (3Miyazawa K. Shinozaki M. Hara T. Furuya T. Miyazono K. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). One group (BMP-2/4 group) contains BMP-2, BMP-4, and the Drosophila decapentaplegic (dpp) gene product. BMP-5, BMP-6, BMP-7 (also termed osteogenic protein-1, OP-1), BMP-8 (OP-2), and the Drosophila gbb-60A gene product form another subgroup (OP-1 group) (4Newfeld S.J. Wisotzkey R.G. Kumar S.

TGF-β1 inhibits myogenic differentiation that is morphologically characterized by cell fusion leading to multinucleated myotubes. In addition, biochemical differentiation measured by expression of muscle-specific genes (e.g. myogenin) is modulated when cells are cultured in the absence of mitogens or on collagen substrates (7Heino J.

In general, members of the TGF-β superfamily bind to heterotetrameric receptor complexes consisting of type I and type II receptors that contain serine/threonine kinase domains (19ten Dijke P. Hill C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Five type II receptors have been identified so far. They contain a constitutive active kinase domain, which in response to ligand binding trans-phosphorylate specific type I receptors at their glycine- and serine-rich domains (GS domain). Seven type I receptors, designated activin receptor-like kinases (ALK-1 to ALK-7), are presently known in mammals (20de Caestecker M.

Once activated by phosphorylation at their carboxyl-terminal SSXS motif, the R-Smads associate with the common mediator Smad4 (co-Smad), and this complex translocates into the nucleus regulating the expression of specific target genes. The I-Smads constitute negative feedback inhibitors that block TGF-β superfamily signaling in general (Smad7) or more specifically BMP signaling (Smad6) (22Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D.

In this study, we analyzed the interdependence of BMP-7 and TGF-β1 signaling and the function of endoglin in L6E9 cells. We show for the first time that TGF-β1 activates two different signaling pathways in this myogenic cell line. One activates matrix gene expression via Smad3, and the other inhibits myogenic differentiation by up-regulation of Id1 via the Smad1/Smad5 pathway. Additionally, we demonstrate that L6E9 cells are highly responsive to BMP-7. BMP-7 inhibited TGF-β1-mediated (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc reporter gene activation and collagen I expression. Transient expression of endoglin resulted in the inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad3 responses, whereas signaling via the BMP-7/Smad1/5 pathway was enhanced. Cell Culture—L6E9 myoblasts were maintained in the undifferentiated state in growth medium (GM) containing HEPES-buffered DMEM (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) (Perbio Science, Cramlington, UK), 4 mmol/liter l-glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all from Cambrex, Verviers, Belgium). To induce differentiation, cells were shifted to differentiation medium (DM) composed of HEPES-buffered DMEM supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FCS. When indicated, the cells were incubated with 5 μm ALK5 inhibitor SB431542 (Tocris Bioscience, Ellisville, MO). Primary hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were isolated as described before and passaged once to obtain myofibroblasts (39Schafer S. Zerbe O. Gressner A.M. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 680-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Parenchymal liver cells (PC, i.e. hepatocytes) were isolated following the collagenase method of Seglen (40Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar). All cultures were kept in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Plasmids—The following plasmids have been described previously: CA-ALK-1 and CA-ALK-5 encoding constitutive active forms of the human TGF-β receptors ALK-1 and ALK-5 (24Nakao A. Imamura T.

Expression plasmids for rat Smad1 (IRBPp993A072D2) and mouse Id1 (IRAVp968B0979D) were purchased from the RZPD Resource Center (Berlin, Germany). The vector pEGFP-C1 was purchased from Clontech. For cloning pCMV-rSmad2 and pCMV-rSmad3, the coding regions of the respective rat Smads were amplified by RT-PCR using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and the primers listed in supplemental Table I. The cycling conditions were as follows: Smad3, initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 54 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2.5 min, followed by a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min; Smad2, initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C and then 35 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR fragments were first cloned into the pGEM ®-T Easy vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), verified by sequence analysis, and subsequently cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Transient Transfections—For transfection, cells were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 2 μg of DNA per well of indicated expression plasmids using the FuGENE 6™ transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). After 24 h, the medium was renewed, and cells were extracted after 48 h. Stimulation Experiments—COS-7 and L6E9 cells were cultured in growth medium containing 10 or 20% (v/v) FCS, respectively. The serum was reduced to 0.5% FCS 16 h before stimulation. For short (1 h) and long term stimulation (0–10; 12 and 24 h), the FCS content was lowered to 0.2%, and the medium was supplemented with TGF-β1 (0.05–5 ng/ml) or BMP-7 (5–100 ng/ml). To detect Smad phosphorylation, the cells were extracted 1 h after addition of ligand in lysis buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 250 mmol/liter NaCl, 2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 2.5 mmol/liter EDTA) containing the Complete™ mixture of proteinase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and the phosphatase inhibitor mixture set 2 (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—L6E9 cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well and transfected with 1 μg of (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc and (BRE)2-Luc or 2 μg of CA-ALK-1, CA-ALK-5, and pcDNA-endoglin using the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Briefly, transfections were carried out in DMEM without supplements, and the medium was replaced by normal growth medium 6 h post-transfection. After a further 12-h incubation period, the medium was renewed, and 24 h later the cells were starved for 16 h in medium containing 0.5% FCS. Thereafter, stimulation with TGF-β1 and BMP-7 was carried out for indicated times in medium containing 0.2% FCS. Cell extracts were prepared in 350 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 μl were applied to luciferase measurements. All experiments were done in triplicate and normalized to the protein content, and the relative luciferase activities (±S.D.) are given. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, cells were washed in ice-cold Hanks’ buffered saline solution and extracted in lysis buffer containing proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein lysates were diluted with nonreducing NuPAGE lithium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis sample buffer (Invitrogen), heated at 75 °C for 10 min, and separated on 10 or 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) using MOPS-SDS running buffer (50 mmol/liter MOPS, 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 3.47 mmol/liter SDS, and 1.025 mmol/liter EDTA) or MES-SDS running buffer (50 mmol/liter MES, 50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 3.47 mmol/liter SDS, and 1.025 mmol/liter EDTA), respectively. The analysis of collagen I expression was done on 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen) in MOPS-SDS running buffer. Proteins were electroblotted using NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen) onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), and equal protein loading was monitored in Ponceau S stain. Unspecific binding sites were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (pH 7.6)) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder. Primary antibodies used are listed in supplemental Table 2. The antibody PPabE1 was raised by order against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide LALHPSTLSQEVY corresponding to amino acids 548–560 of rat endoglin (Davids Biotechnologie, Regensburg, Germany). Primary antibodies were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) using the SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration substrate (Perbio Science). In some cases the signals were enhanced with a biotinylated secondary antibody prior to incubation with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Signal quantification and normalization were done in a Lumi-Imager™ (Roche Applied Science) using the LumiAnalyst 3.0 software. Affinity Labeling of TGF-β Receptors and Immunoprecipitation—125I-TGF-β1 affinity labeling and cross-linking experiments were performed as described previously (43Meurer S.K. Tihaa L. Lahme B. Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3078-3087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers of L6E9 cells were washed and incubated in binding buffer (50 mmol/liter HEPES (pH 7.4), 128 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 5 mmol/liter MgSO4, 13 mmol/liter CaCl2, 0.5% (v/v) bovine serum albumin) at 37 °C for 0.5 h. Thereafter, the cells were washed in ice-cold binding buffer, and ligand binding was performed for 3 h at 4 °C using 2.8 ng of 125I-TGF-β1/ml with a activity of 1621 Ci/mmol (Amersham Biosciences Buckinghamshire, UK). After incubation with disuccinimidyl suberate (Perbio Science) for 15 min at 4 °C, proteins were extracted and subjected to immunoprecipitation with receptor-specific antibodies. The precipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). RT-PCR and Data Analysis—For RT-PCR experiments, purified samples of total RNA (1 μg each) were reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 60 min using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers. Aliquots of first strand cDNAs were subjected to PCR in 1× PCR buffer (10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mmol/liter KCl, 1.5 mmol/liter MgCl2) using 2 μm forward/reverse primers, 0.2 mm each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Cycle conditions were as follows: initial denaturation for 5 min at 95 °C; 35 cycles (40 cycles for BMP-RII, ALK-3, ALK-2, and BMP-7; 45 cycles for rS6, ALK-6, ActR-II, and ActR-IIb) at 95 °C for 60 s, 54 °C (55 °C for endoglin) for 60 s, 72 °C for 3 min; final elongation at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were gel-purified and sequenced using the ABI Prism BigDye termination reaction kit as described elsewhere (44Weiskirchen R. Gressner A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Sequence data analysis was performed at the NCBI using the BLAST algorithm (45Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59856) Google Scholar). Statistics—Results are presented as the mean of three independent experiments (±S.D.). Statistical analyses were performed with an unpaired Student’s t test. Differences found were considered as significant (*) or highly significant (**) at p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, respectively. L6E9 Cells Are Deficient for Endoglin and Mediate Smad1/Smad5 Phosphorylation in Response to BMP-7 and TGF-β1—To determine the function of endoglin in BMP-7 and TGF-β1 signaling in L6E9 cells, we first re-evaluated the reported endoglin deficiency at both the RNA and protein level. In rat hepatic stellate cells, we found two specific endoglin transcripts of 3 and 3.6 kb in size, whereas no endoglin signals were obtained in L6E9 cells (not shown). The deficiency for endoglin was further confirmed by RT-PCR (not shown) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). In addition, affinity labeling experiments with iodinated TGF-β1 followed by immunoprecipitation reconfirmed the absence of functional endoglin in L6E9 cells (see below). To focus on the Smad activation pattern in L6E9 cells, we next performed stimulation experiments with TGF-β1 and BMP-7 and analyzed the respective protein extracts with antibodies that exclusively detect carboxyl-terminal Smad phosphorylation (induced by the type I receptor kinase) and not those of the Smad linker regions (induced by mitogen-activated protein kinases). When cells were stimulated with BMP-2 or BMP-7, a strong phosphorylation of Smad1/Smad5 was provoked (Fig. 1B). When L6E9 cells were stimulated with TGF-β1, we observed phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad1/Smad5 indicating that TGF-β1 activates both Smad signaling pathways. TGF-β1 Dose-dependently Activates the ALK-5 and ALK-1 Pathways—The presence of ALK-1 in L6E9 cells was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A) and in cross-linking experiments (Fig. 2B). The cross-linking experiments further confirmed the already mentioned absence of functional endoglin in L6E9 cells. Stimulation of L6E9 cells with increasing amounts of TGF-β1 revealed that Smad1/Smad5 and Smad3 were dose-dependently phosphorylated (Fig. 2C). Both signals were abrogated in the presence of the synthetic ALK-5 inhibitor SB431542. Consistent with this finding, we observed a time-dependent accumulation of PAI-1 in supernatants of TGF-β1-stimulated L6E9 cells and a strong activation of the pSmad3 reporter (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc upon TGF-β1 stimulation (Fig. 2, D and E), which was prevented in the presence of SB431542 (data not shown). Similarly, a strong stimulation was induced by a constitutive active ALK-5 receptor (CA-ALK-5) (Fig. 2F) that induces Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation. In conclusion, this set of experiments revealed that TGF-β1 was sufficient to activate Smad3 and Smad1/Smad5. Interestingly, both phosphorylation of Smad3 and Smad1/5 was blocked in the presence of SB431542 (cf. Fig. 2C). Because ALK-1 is insensitive toward this inhibitor (46Laping N.J. Grygielko E. Mathur A. Butter S. Bomberger J. Tweed C. Martin W. Fornwald J. Lehr R. Harling J. Gaster L. Callahan J.F. Olson B.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar), this finding indicated that ALK-1 signaling itself is ALK-5-dependent in L6E9 cells. BMP-7 Signaling and Receptors in L6E9 Cells—To examine BMP-7 signaling in L6E9 cells, we first analyzed the expression of potential BMP-7 membrane receptors, i.e. ActR-I (ALK-2), BMPR-IA (ALK-3), or BMPR-IB (ALK-6) by RT-PCR. Under the experimental setting, we were able to amplify fragments specific for ALK-3 (677 bp) and to a much lower content ALK-6 (620 bp), but we failed to detect ALK-2 mRNA expression in L6E9 cells (Fig. 3A). In addition, the analysis revealed that the putative type II receptors BMPR-II (682 bp), ActR-IIB (678 bp), and ActR-II (700 bp) were expressed in L6E9 cells. In contrast, BMP-7 transcripts were not found. As positive controls for BMP-7 (507 bp) and ALK-2 (1560 bp), we analyzed cDNAs from rat hepatocytes (PC) or rat HSC that express high contents of corresponding genes. 4O. Scherner, S. K. Meurer, L. Tihaa, A. M. Gressner, and R. Weiskirchen, unpublished observations. Having shown that the necessary receptors for BMP-7 are expressed, we next examined the activation of the downstream effectors Smad1/Smad5 by BMP-7 in Western blot (Fig. 3B). In agreement with Smad1/Smad5 activation, the (BRE)2-Luc reporter harboring a Smad1/Smad5-dependent response element of the Id1 promoter was dose-dependently stimulated by BMP-7 (Fig. 3C), whereas the (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc reporter was left unaffected (data not shown). In contrast to the comparable activation potency of the (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc construct by CA-ALK-5 and TGF-β1 (cf. Fig. 2F), the (BRE)2-Luc reporter was only weakly stimulated by a constitutive active ALK-1 receptor (CA-ALK-1) (Fig. 3D) that potently induced the phosphorylation of Smads involved in BMP signaling. BMP-7 Blocks TGF-β1 Signaling in L6E9 Cells—To analyze the interdependence of BMP-7 and TGF-β1 signaling, we performed advanced reporter assays. TGF-β1 alone strongly activated the (CAGA)12-MLP-Luc-reporter, but when BMP-7 was simultaneously applied, the reporter activity was significantly reduced (Fig. 4A). Consistently, the amount of pSmad3 was lower in the presence of BMP-7 compared with samples that were only treated with TGF-β1 (Fig. 4B). Conversely, BMP-7 induced a strong activation of the (B"

However, the role of Plk1 at kinetochores has been poorly understood. Here we show that BubR1 mediates the action of Plk1 at kinetochores for proper chromosome alignment. Our results show that BubR1 colocalizes with Plk1 at kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes and physically interacts with Plk1 in prometaphase cells. Down-regulation of Plk1 by small interfering RNA abolished the mobility-shifted, hyperphosphorylated form of BubR1 in the prometaphase-arrested cells. In addition, BubR1 was phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro at two Plk1 consensus sites in the kinase domain of BubR1. The add-back of either wild-type BubR1 or BubR1 2E, in which the two Plk1 phosphorylation sites were replaced by glutamic acids, but not that of BubR1 2A, an unphosphorylatable mutant, rescued the chromosome alignment defects in BubR1-deficient cells. Moreover, when both Plk1 and BubR1 were down-regulated, the add-back of BubR1 2E, but not that of wild-type BubR1, rescued the chromosome alignment defects. These results taken together suggest that Plk1 facilitates chromosome alignment during prometaphase through BubR1.

The proper segregation of chromosomes in anaphase is essential to prevent aneuploidy (1Kops G.J. Weaver B.A. Cleveland D.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 773-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). All chromosomes are attached to the mitotic spindle and properly aligned to the metaphase plate so that a surveillance mechanism, the spindle checkpoint, is silenced. The chromosome alignment is, thus, critical for accurate chromosome segregation. Numerous protein-protein interactions and chemical reactions including phosphorylation on kinetochores have been implicated in proper microtubule-kinetochore interactions (2Kline Smith S.L.

Plk1 localizes to centrosomes and kinetochores during early stages of mitosis and then to midbody during later stages (7Barr F.A. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 9Arnaud L. Pines J. Nigg E.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1998; 107: 424-429Google Scholar). Such dynamic changes in subcellular localization of Plk1 are believed to be important for its function. When the kinetochores of a sister-chromatid pair are attached by microtubules from opposite spindle poles, tension develops across the sister kinetochores. Subsequently this tension is thought to stabilize the microtubule-kinetochore interactions, and the kinetochores are allowed to be fully occupied with microtubules (10King J.M. Nicklas R.B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3815-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Nicklas R.B. Ward S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1241-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Plk1 is involved in functional bipolar spindle formation and in the generation of proper tension at kinetochores (12van Vugt M.A. van de Weerdt B.C. Vader G. Janssen H.

However, how Plk1 regulates these events has remained unknown. BubR1 is an essential component of the spindle checkpoint (14Yu H. Curr. Opin.

Most recently, Lampson and Kapoor have demonstrated that BubR1 plays a role in attachment of spindle microtubules to kinetochores (15Lampson M.A. Kapoor T.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because both Plk1 and BubR1 are shown to localize to kinetochores of unaligned chromosomes and play a role in the formation of the stable microtubule-kinetochore interactions, we hypothesized that BubR1 might be a target of Plk1 at kinetochores. Here we show several lines of evidence that Plk1 regulates chromosome alignment through phosphorylation and activation of BubR1 at kinetochores. Cell Culture and Drug Treatment—HeLaS3 cells, HeLa cells expressing a GFP-histone H2B protein, and COS7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. Cells were synchronized in S phase by the double-thymidine block. Mitotically arrested cells were achieved by treatment with 250 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) or 10 μm paclitaxel (Sigma) at ∼8 h after release from the thymidine block. When transfection was performed before the first thymidine block, HeLa cells were transfected in Opti-MEM with the use of Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for 2 h and washed into fresh medium containing thymidine for the first block. For transfection with DNA vectors and RNA oligonucleotides during synchronization, cells were transfected in Opti-MEM with the use of Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for 2 h and washed into fresh medium containing thymidine for the first block. Then cells were transfected by the use of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) after the first thymidine block. 50 μm proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Calbiochem), was added 10 h after release from the thymidine block. Expression in COS7 cells was carried out by the use of Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for 4 h. siRNA Experiments—RNA oligonucleotides (21 nucleotides) homologous to human Plk1, human Aurora-B, or human BubR1 were designed as described previously (22Liu X.

Annealed siRNAs were transfected by the use of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Silent mutations in the siRNA targeting region of BubR1 were introduced by PCR-based mutagenesis using the following primers: forward, 5′-CAG CAG CAG AAGAGA GCG TTT GAA TAT GAA ATT CG-3′ (bold nucleotides indicate silent mutations); reverse, 5′-CGA ATT TCA TAT TCA AAC GCT CTC TTC TGC TGC TG-3′. Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—Cells were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Exogenously expressed Myc-tagged BubR1 and HA-tagged Plk1 were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz, 9E10) and anti-HA antibody coupled to the same protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A, then washed once with buffer B (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm 2-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and subjected to kinase assays. Immunoprecipitates were mixed with 50 μm ATP and 15 mm MgCl2 in a final volume of 15 μl and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and boiling. For the binding assay cells were lysed in a binding buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. Exogenously expressed HA-tagged Plk1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz, mouse) coupled to protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). Endogenous BubR1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-BubR1 antibody (mouse; Chemicon) coupled to protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). In each experiment the immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A with 10 mm NaCl. Immunofluorescence Analysis—HeLa cells, HeLa GFP-histone H2B cells, and HeLaS3 cells were grown onto coverslips, fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. For BubR1 staining, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 7 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. To destabilize nonkinetochore microtubules, mitotic cells were treated with a calcium-containing buffer for 40 s during permeabilization and then fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer as described by Mitchison (25Mitchison T.

To show the involvement of Plk1 in kinetochore-microtubule attachment, we analyzed the kinetics of recovery processes after release from prometaphase arrest by nocodazole treatment. The Plk1 siRNA treatment reduced the Plk1 protein level by about 90% in total in each experiment (see Fig. 4A). A bipolar spindle was formed in most of the cells at 2 h after release in both control and Plk1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1A). As to chromosome alignment, however, the recovery was significantly delayed in Plk1 siRNA-treated cells; more than 40% of the cells showed abnormalities in chromosome alignment even at 2 h after release (Fig. 1A, histograms). In contrast, less than 20% of mock-treated cells showed the abnormalities at 2 h after release (Fig. 1A, histograms). To characterize Plk1-deficient cells in more detail, kinetochores were visualized by transfection of YFP-CENP-A, and cells were treated with calcium-containing buffers during permeabilization. This treatment is known to preferentially destabilize nonkinetochore microtubules. In control cells, each kinetochore appeared to be stably re-captured by kinetochore microtubules (Fig. 1B, YFP-CENP-A, upper, control). In contrast, in Plk1-deficient cells two spots of a kinetochore pair were not alongside microtubules and were often unattached to kinetochore microtubules (Fig. 1B, YFP-CENP-A, upper, Plk1 siRNA), suggesting the defect in stable microtubule-kinetochore attachment. In addition, Mad2-positive kinetochores were frequently observed in Plk1-deficient cells, but not in control cells, at metaphase (Fig. 1B, lower). It should be noted that in Plk1-deficient cells a bipolar spindle was smaller than that in control cells and was more sensitive to calcium treatment that causes microtubule destabilization. These observations were consistent with previous reports that Plk1 is involved in functional spindle formation (12van Vugt M.A. van de Weerdt B.C. Vader G. Janssen H. Calafat J. Klompmaker R.

https://openalex.org/W2058283323,"Corepressors play a crucial role in negative gene regulation and are defective in several diseases. BCoR is a corepressor for the BCL6 repressor protein. Here we describe and functionally characterize BCoR-L1, a homolog of BCoR. When tethered to a heterologous promoter, BCoR-L1 is capable of strong repression. Like other corepressors, BCoR-L1 associates with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Specifically, BCoR-L1 coprecipitates with the Class II HDACs, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7, suggesting that they are involved in its role as a transcriptional repressor. BCoR-L1 also interacts with the CtBP corepressor through a CtBP-interacting motif in its amino terminus. Abrogation of the CtBP binding site within BCoR-L1 partially relieves BCoR-L1-mediated transcriptional repression. Furthermore, BCoR-L1 is located on the E-cadherin promoter, a known CtBP-regulated promoter, and represses the E-cadherin promoter activity in a reporter assay. The inhibition of BCoR-L1 expression by RNA-mediated interference results in derepression of E-cadherin in cells that do not normally express E-cadherin, indicating that BCoR-L1 contributes to the repression of an authentic endogenous CtBP target.

The overall transcriptional output of a cell depends on the coordinated silencing or activation of gene expression by the action of DNA-bound transcriptional repressors or activators (1Levine M. Tjian R. Nature. 2003; 424: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Coregulator proteins, including coactivators and corepressors, interact with DNA-bound transcription factors to mediate gene activation or repression, respectively, by recruiting multiprotein catalytic complexes that regulate chromatin structure and thus the transcription of target genes.Although the role of coactivator proteins in transcriptional regulation is well established, the equally important role of corepressor proteins in gene regulation has become apparent only relatively recently. There are many corepressor proteins, recruited to a wide range of transcriptional silencers. They regulate many processes, including differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and the cell cycle (2Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 689-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aberrant function of corepressors can lead to developmental defects and disease, since genes that should be turned off are instead aberrantly expressed, or “derepressed” (3Gabellini D. Tupler R. Green M.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Alternately, overactive repression leads to enhanced silencing and has been reported in several types of leukemia, involving gene fusions to transcriptional silencers (4Look A.T. Science. 1997; 278: 1059-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar). Increased corepressor binding to these fusion proteins leads to inappropriate repression of target genes important for normal cellular differentiation.Corepressors act within multiprotein complexes containing DNA-binding proteins, histone deacetylases, methyl-CpG-binding proteins, nucleosomal histones, and the basal transcriptional machinery. The same corepressor can be found in different corepression complexes, and multiple corepressors can be used by individual silencers. Corepressors are thought to bridge the interaction between DNA-bound transcriptional repressors and the chromatin-modifying enzymes that mediate repression. They typically act in multiple ways, including via the targeted modification of chromatin structure, nucleosomal remodeling, and sequestration of the basal transcription machinery as well as by inhibiting trans-activation (2Jepsen K. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 689-698Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Lysine acetylation of the histone tails is a major modification associated with transcriptional activation, and in contrast, deacetylation is associated with transcriptional repression. It is thought that the acetylation of the lysine residues of the core histone tails neutralizes the positive charge on the lysine residue, thereby resulting in a more open structure of chromatin because of the decreased affinity between the histone and the DNA (5Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar, 6Gorisch S.M. Wachsmuth M. Toth K.F. Lichter P. Rippe K. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5825-5834Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Chromatin is therefore more accessible to transcription factors and other proteins. Conversely, the deacetylation of histone substrates results in chromatin condensation and inhibits the accessibility of transcription factors and other proteins to the DNA.The acetylation reaction is a reversible process, catalyzed by the opposing activity of histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases (HDACs) 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; Luc, luciferase; TK, thymidine kinase; E-Cad, E-cadherin; WT, wild type; BCoR, BCL6 corepressor; BCoR-L1, BCoR-like 1. 3The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DBD, DNA-binding domain; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcription; Luc, luciferase; TK, thymidine kinase; E-Cad, E-cadherin; WT, wild type; BCoR, BCL6 corepressor; BCoR-L1, BCoR-like 1. in vivo. There are several classes of histone acetyltransferases, each employing different mechanisms of catalysis (7Marmorstein R. Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Likewise, there are three main classes of HDACs grouped according to homology to their counterparts in yeast, their subcellular localization, and enzymatic activities (8Bolden J.E. Peart M.J. Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2006; 5: 769-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2487) Google Scholar, 9Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Class I (HDAC1, -2, -3, and -8; homologous to yeast Rpd3) are ubiquitously expressed and are primarily localized in the nucleus. Class II (HDAC4, -5, -6, -7, -9, and -10; homologous to Hda1) are expressed in a tissue-specific manner and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (10Yang X.J. Gregoire S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2873-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Class III (Sirt1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, and -7; similar to Sir2) use a different mode of catalysis, relying on NAD+ (11Gao L. Cueto M.A. Asselbergs F. Atadja P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25748-25755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Most targets are histones, although other proteins are deacetylated as well, including α-tubulin (12Glozak M.A. Sengupta N. Zhang X. Seto E. Gene (Amst.). 2005; 363: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). All known repression complexes employ HDACs to mediate their repression.CtBP is also a critical component of many transcriptional repression complexes (reviewed in Ref. (13Chinnadurai G. Mol.

Microarray studies from CtBP knock-out mice implicate CtBP in the repression of genes involved in apoptosis and in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (18Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 19Grooteclaes M. Deveraux Q. Hildebrand J. Zhang Q. Goodman R.H. Frisch S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4568-4573Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To mediate its repression, it recruits enzymes involved in transcription repression, such as methylases and deacetylases, to the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins via a conserved PXDLS CtBP interaction motif in the CtBP-interacting proteins (14Chinnadurai G. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that many histone acetyltransferases contain the PXDLS motif and that CtBP inhibits histone acetylation by blocking access of nuclear histone acetyltransferases to their target (16Kim J.H. Cho E.J. Kim S.T. Youn H.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Zhao L.J. Subramanian T. Zhou Y. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4183-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).Interestingly, CtBP structure is similar to a subfamily of NAD+-dependent dehydrogenases, and biochemical and structural studies have recently demonstrated that CtBP possesses dehydrogenase activity (20Kumar V.

CtBP binds NADH with a higher affinity than NAD+ (22Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar), although this has been controversial (20Kumar V.

CtBP function is regulated by the relative levels of NAD+ and NADH within the nucleus, suggesting a role for CtBP in sensing the redox state of the cell and regulating transcription accordingly (22Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar, 23Fjeld C.C. Birdsong W.T. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Current models suggest that increases in NADH levels promote CtBP dimerization, which in turn increases the interaction between CtBP and proteins containing the PXDLS CtBP-recruitment motif.We have identified a novel PXDLS-containing protein designated as BCoR-L1 in the GenBank™ data base. BCoR-L1 is related to the BCoR, a transcriptional corepressor that potentiates BCL6 repression in reporter assays (24Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823PubMed Google Scholar). BCL6 is a transcription factor that is required for germinal center formation and is linked to lymphomagenesis (25Jardin F. Sahota S.S. Hematology. 2005; 10: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We find that, like BCoR, BCoR-L1 functions as a corepressor when tethered to DNA. BCoR-L1 interacts with Class II HDACs, HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7, suggesting that they are involved in its function as transcriptional corepressor. It mediates its repression through recruitment of the CtBP corepressor protein and affects the repression of at least one CtBP target, the tumor suppressor protein, E-cadherin.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning of Full-length BCoR-L1 and Other Plasmids—Full-length BCoR-L1 (BCoR-L1a) and ΔExon9 BCoR-L1 (BCoR-L1) cDNAs were produced in two stages. The C terminus of BCoR-L1 was PCR-cloned using Pfu polymerase from cDNA derived from the normal ovarian epithelial cell line (HOSE 17.1). Primers used for this PCR were designed from the in silico predictions of the mRNA and later from known sequence. The cDNA was amplified in several overlapping fragments, which were cloned into the pPCR-Script vector (Stratagene) and later assembled into a single sequence using appropriate restriction enzyme sites. The N terminus of BCoR-L1 was provided by a partial cDNA clone (bp 60-4449, FLJ00190), which was a generous gift of Kasuza Institute (Chiba, Japan). The first 60 bp of BCoR-L1 were incorporated into primers, which were used to amplify the N terminus of BCoR-L1 from the cDNA clone and then subcloned into the existing C terminus of BCoR-L1. The entire coding sequences for BCoR-L1 were then subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) and pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma) parent plasmids using SalI and BamHI sites.GST-BCoR-L1a-(1328-1785) vector for antibody production was constructed by cloning BCoR-L1 sequence (amino acids 1328-1785) in frame with pGEX-5X-1. The pSUPER vector system (26Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3946) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. Reuven Agami; Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam) was used to create the siRNA construct to knock-down BCoR-L1 levels “pSUPER-BcoR-L1.” The following sequence was cloned into the pSUPER vector to produce pSUPER-BCoR-L1: forward (FWD), 5′-GATCCCCCGTGGCAGAGGCTGAGGGCTTCAAGAGAGCCCTCAGCCTCTGCCACGTTTTTGGAAA-3′; reverse (RVS), 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAACGTGGCAGAGGCTGAGGGCTCTCTTGAAGCCCTCAGCCTCTGCCACGGGG-3′. This construct generated siRNAs targeting the following 21-nucleotide sequence: 5′-CGTGGCAGAGGCTGAGGGCT-3′ (complementary to nucleotides 312-331 within BCoR-L1 cDNA). The pSUPER-GFP plasmid has been described previously (27Fabbro M. Savage K. Hobson K. Deans A.J. Powell S.N. McArthur G.A. Khanna K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31251-31258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4-DBD) vectors were constructed by replacing GFP from pEGFP vectors (Clontech) with the Gal4-DBD from pGBT9 (Clontech). BCoR-L1 was cloned as a Gal4-DBD fusion protein using SalI and BamHI sites. BCoR-L1 fragments were cloned as Gal4-DBD fusion proteins using BamHI and EcoRI sites incorporated into primers designed to amplify the fragments from plasmid. The Gal4-DBD-BCoR-L1 ΔCtBP binding site mutant (PLDLS to PLASS) was created using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). FLAG-tagged expression vectors for HDAC4 to -7 (28Parra M. Kasler H. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Verdin E. J. Biol.

The GFP-BCoR plasmid was subcloned from Myc-BCoR (kindly provided by Vivian Bardwell, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN).Northern Analysis—The probe for Northern analysis was prepared from RT-PCR products derived from the amino terminus of BCoR-L1 amplified from the HOSE 17.1 ovarian cell line using the following primer sequences: forward, 5′-GTGCACAACTGGACCAGTTCTGACCG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGTCAGAGATGAGCGTGGGCACTG-3′. Probes were [α-32P]dCTP-labeled using the MegaPrime kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization to a Clontech human Multiple Tissue Northern blot II membrane was carried out for 2 h in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech) at 65 °C, followed by a standard washing procedure.Cell Culture and Transfections—Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator and grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% Serum Supreme, 1% l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Transfections of cells were carried out using either electroporation or lipofection. For electroporation, 293T cells in exponential growth were pelleted and resuspended at 106 cells/300 μlin complete media and then electroporated at room temperature with 7 μg of DNA in a 0.4-cm cuvette (Interpath). Electroporation was performed with a BTX™820 electroporator (Genetronics Inc.) at 260 V with a time constant of 10 ms. HeLa cells growing in dishes were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Luciferase Assays—293T cells were grown in 24-well dishes and were transfected using Lipofectamine™ 2000. The pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) was cotransfected as a control for transfection efficiency. The amount of DNA per well was kept constant using an empty expression vector (pCMV; Stratagene). Cells were grown for 48 h prior to harvesting using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Annandale, Australia). The lysate was assayed for luciferase activity using the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Readings were taken using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs). Results shown are from representative experiments. The error bars represent one S.D.Antibodies and BCoR-L1 Antibody Production—Polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits following standard injection protocols. Rabbits were immunized with GST-BCoR-L1a-(1328-1785) fusion protein. An α-BCoR-L1 peptide antibody was raised against the sequence EERRAPLSDEESTTGD by Open Biosystems. The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-GFP (Molecular Probes), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (Cell Signaling Technology), ImmunoPure Recomb Protein A/G HRP conjugate (Molecular Probes), and rabbit anti-Gal4-DBD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).ChIP Analysis and RT-PCR—ChIP analysis of the E-cadherin promoter was performed according to Shi et al. (15Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used to amplify the E-cadherin promoter were as follows: forward, 5′-TAGCCTGGCGTGGTGGTGTGCACCTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTGCGTGGCTGCAGCCAGGTGAGCC-3′. The following primers were used for quantitative PCR detection of BCoR-L1 levels: forward, 5′-GACCGACATCCTGAACATCC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATAGGACAGCAGGAGCCAGA-3′. The primers used to detect E-cadherin levels were as follows: forward, 5′-GAAAATCTGAAAGCGGCTGAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCCCATTCGTTCAAGT-3′.Lysate Preparation, Coimmunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, and Antibodies—Cell extracts were prepared by lysis in universal immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40), supplemented with 25 mm sodium fluoride, 25 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, protein samples were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants (2 mg) were incubated with 2 μg of antibody overnight. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads. Beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, eluted using Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting with specific antibodies.Immunofluorescence Staining—Cells grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformadehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were blocked with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by AlexaFluor-546-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). Cells were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides with Mowiol (Calbiochem) containing 0.6% diazobicyclo-octane (Sigma). Fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss Axioskop 20 microscope, Zeiss AxioCam MRc digital camera, and MRGrab 1.0 software. Dual confocal images were collected sequentially using a 635 objective on Leica TCS SP2 confocal fluorescent microscope system using a 488-nm argon laser for GFP and 543-nm helium-neon laser to excite the AlexaFluor-546. Confocal hardware was driven by a work station running Leica confocal imaging software. Figures were processed using Adobe Photoshop 6.0.RESULTSA Novel BCoR-related Protein—BCoR-L1 (BCoR-like 1) was isolated as a partial cDNA using full-length BRCA1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen with a testis cDNA library. The basis and significance of the interaction with BRCA1 is currently under investigation and is not discussed here. One set of positive clones encoded the partial cDNA of a hypothetical protein (GenBank™ number NM_019294, BCL6 corepressor-like 1; function unknown), expressed from the X chromosome (Xq25-26.1). The entire BCoR-L1 transcript contains 14 exons spliced from ∼75 kb of genomic DNA. The original yeast two-hybrid clone contained an additional exon (exon 9) not present in the composite sequence on GenBank™ and represents an alternatively spliced form of BCoR-L1 mRNA, which we call BCoR-L1a. The complete cDNA sequence of full-length BCoR-L1 (BCoR-L1a) and BCoR-L1 ΔExon 9 (BCoR-L1; NM_019294) was generated in mammalian expression vectors (see “Materials and Methods”).The open reading frame of BCoR-L1 cDNA encodes a protein of 1711 amino acids containing a putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and tandem ankyrin repeats (ANK) (Fig. 1). BCoR-L1a is 1785 amino acids long. Neither BCoR-L1 nor BCoR has identifiable DNA-binding domains. BCoR-L1 contains a PXDLS motif, involved in binding the CtBP corepressor (33Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Zhang Q. Yao H. Vo N. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14323-14328Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). BCoR-L1 also contains two LXXLL nuclear receptor recruitment motifs found in coregulator proteins (35Plevin M.J. Mills M.M. Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 66-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence shares homology with several proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, transcription, and repair of DNA damage. More specifically, BCoR-L1 is homologous to BCoR, a transcriptional corepressor for the BCL6 transcriptional repressor (24Huynh K.D. Fischle W. Verdin E. Bardwell V.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1810-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, part of the BCoR-L1 sequence shares homology with the predominant BRCA1-interacting protein, BARD1 (36Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). A region of BCoR-L1 is related to the Drosophila recombination repair protein (dRRP1), a repair endonuclease. Although BCoR-L1 lacks the RRP1 nuclease domain, it shares homology with the RRP1 domain that catalyzes strand transfer during homologous recombination (37Sander M. Lowenhaupt K. Lane W.S. Rich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 38Sander M. Lowenhaupt K. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6780-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A high degree of sequence conservation exists between human BCoR-L1 and mouse and rat orthologues (80 and 77% amino acid identity, respectively). We have not been able to identify any BCoR-L1 orthologues in lower eukaryotes.Tissue Expression of BCoR-L1—Northern blot analysis using the multiple-tissue Northern II filter (Clontech) demonstrated that BCoR-L1 is expressed at low levels in many tissues. The highest level of expression was observed in testis and prostate. Medium levels of expression were also seen in peripheral blood lymphocytes and spleen (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Tissue expression of BCoR-L1. A, Northern blot analysis of BCoR-L1 expression using a Clontech membrane. B, HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged BCoR-L1a or BCoR-L1. Lysates from the transfected and untransfected cells were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to immunoblotting using α-BCoR-L1 antibody (top panel) and anti-FLAG antibody (bottom panel). C, 293T cells were transfected with pSUPER-GFP or pSUPER-BCoR-L1 and left for 72 h before harvesting. Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting using the peptide α-BCoR-L1 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant GST-BCoR-L1a (aa 1328-1785). The specificity of the antibody for immunoblot analysis was tested against recombinant FLAG-tagged BCoR-L1a and BCoR-L1 in protein extracts prepared from HeLa cells. The antibody recognized a band migrating through SDS-polyacrylamide gels at a size of ∼200 kDa and comigrating with exogenously expressed FLAG-tagged BCoR-L1 (Fig. 2B). This result provides evidence that endogenous BCoR-L1 is predominantly encoded from the BCoR-L1 ΔExon 9 isoform, which was also the predominant isoform detected by RT-PCR analysis (results not shown). Furthermore, this band was significantly diminished in intensity when cells were depleted of BCoR-L1 by siRNA, further demonstrating the specificity of BCoR-L1 antibody (Fig. 2C).BCoR-L1 Is a Nuclear Protein—Since the amino acid sequence of BCoR-L1 contains a classical bipartite nuclear localization signal and its homolog BCoR is a nuclear protein, we expected BCoR-L1 to be nuclear. To confirm this, BCoR-L1 was cloned as a GFP fusion protein and transfected into HeLa cells, and its localization was examined by epifluorescence microscopy. GFP-BCoR-L1 localized exclusively in the nucleus and was distributed in a heterogeneous subnuclear pattern of dots (Fig. 3). Between 5 and 30 bright dots were scattered throughout the nucleus of each cell. Interestingly, its pattern of localization differed from that of GFP-BCoR. Although a substantial proportion of GFP-BCoR-L1 was present in the nucleosol, BCoR was exclusively found in many speckle-like dots of a consistent size. On the other hand, GFP-BCoR-L1 localization was highly heterogeneous, with cells displaying dots of various dimensions and number, suggesting that BCoR-L1 localization could be regulated through the cell cycle.FIGURE 3Localization of BCoR-L1 and BCoR. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-BCoR-L1 or GFP-BCoR. Cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde 24 h later and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to mark the cell nucleus.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)BCoR-L1 Is a Strong Transcriptional Repressor—We next examined whether BCoR-L1 is able to regulate transcription, given its high homology to the BCoR corepressor. We used a standard luciferase reporter system in transient transfection assays. We cloned BCoR-L1 as a Gal4-DBD fusion protein, which recognizes the Gal4 binding sites upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (Luc) driven by the herpes simplex virus (HSV) thymidine kinase (TK) promoter (TK-Luc). The activity exhibited in cells transfected by the Luc reporter with Gal4-DBD vector alone was considered to be the basal transcriptional activity. When expressed in fusion with the Gal4-DNA binding domain (Gal4-DBD), BCoR-L1 repressed expression of the Luc reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner. Comparable expression of FLAG-tagged BCoR-L1, which is not tethered to the Gal4 sites, did not repress luciferase activity, demonstrating that BCoR-L1 is able to repress basal transcription only when physically tethered to a heterologous promoter (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 4BCoR-L1 can repress basal and activated transcription. A, the TK-Luc reporter construct was cotransfected into 293T cells along with the indicated amounts of the Gal4-DBD-BCoR-L1 or FLAG-BCoR-L1 expression constructs. B, LexA-Gal4-Luc reporter and VP16-LexA expression constructs were transfected into cells with increasing doses of Gal4-DBD-BCoR-L1.C,BCoR-L1 was divided into five overlapping fragments and expressed as Gal4-DBD fusion proteins. Cells were cotransfected with TK-Luc reporter construct and 40 ng of each Gal4-DBD fusion fragment of BCoR-L1 or full-length GAL-DBD-BCoR-L1. The CtBP binding motif in Frag"

https://openalex.org/W2015198760,"Mature pancreatic cells develop during embryonic life from endodermal progenitors, and this developmental process depends on activation of a hierarchy of transcription factors. While information is available on mesodermal signals controlling pancreas development, little is known about environmental factors, such as the levels of nutrients including glucose, that may control this process. Here, we studied the effects of glucose on pancreatic cells development. We used an in vitro model where both endocrine and acinar cells develop from early pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX1)-positive embryonic pancreatic progenitors. We first showed that glucose does not have a major effect on global pancreatic cell proliferation, survival, and acinar cell development. On the other hand, glucose controlled both alpha and beta cell development. Specifically, the surface occupied by insulin-positive cells was 20-fold higher in pancreases cultured in presence than in absence of glucose, and this effect was dose-dependent over the range 0.5-10 mm. Glucose did not appear to control beta cell development by activating the proliferation of early progenitors or beta cells themselves but instead tightly regulated cell differentiation. Thus, glucose did not modify the pattern of expression of Neurogenin3, the earliest marker of endocrine progenitor cells, but was necessary for the expression of the transcription factor NeuroD, a direct target of Neurogenin3 known to be important for proper pancreatic endocrine cell development. We conclude that glucose interferes with the pancreatic endocrine cells development by regulating the transition between Ngn3 and upstream NeuroD."
https://openalex.org/W2037917129,"Protein phosphatase 5 (Ppp5), a tetratricopeptide repeat domain protein, has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, including cellular proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival, and cell cycle checkpoint regulation via the ataxia telangiectasia mutated/ATM and Rad3-related (ATM/ATR) signal pathway. However, the physiological functions of Ppp5 have not been reported. To confirm the role of Ppp5 in cell cycle checkpoint regulation, we generated Ppp5-deficient mice and isolated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from Ppp5-deficient and littermate control embryos. Although Ppp5-deficient mice can survive through embryonic development and postnatal life and MEF cells from the Ppp5-deficient mice maintain normal replication checkpoint induced by hydroxyurea, Ppp5-deficient MEF cells display a significant defect in G2/M DNA damage checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation (IR). To determine whether this defect in IR-induced G2/M checkpoint is due to altered ATM-mediated signaling, we measured ATM kinase activity and ATM-mediated downstream events. Our data demonstrated that IR-induced ATM kinase activity is attenuated in Ppp5-deficient MEFs. Phosphorylation levels of two known ATM substrates, Rad17 and Chk2, were significantly reduced in Ppp5-deficient MEFs in response to IR. Furthermore, DNA damage-induced Rad17 nuclear foci were dramatically reduced in Ppp5-deficient MEFs. These results demonstrate a direct regulatory linkage between Ppp5 and activation of the ATM-mediated G2/M DNA damage checkpoint pathway in vivo.

Rev. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref Scopus (660) Google Scholar), and ATR was responsible for the checkpoint activation in response to DNA damage induced by a variety of broader stressors, such as UV light, hydroxyurea (HU), and other types of genotoxic insults (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells or ATM-deficient cells often display ionizing radiation (IR)-resistant DNA synthesis in S-phase (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATM may also function in DNA replication checkpoint in S-phase. Protein phosphatase 5 (Ppp5, also known as PP5) is a serine/threonine phosphatase involved in several important cellular functions. Ppp5 is unique among phosphatases in that it contains a series of 34-amino acid tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that serve as a protein-protein interaction domain (5Cohen P.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Ppp5 is ubiquitously expressed and is able to form heterocomplexes with glucocorticoid receptors via heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) (6Dean D.A. Urban G. Aragon I.V. Swingle M. Miller B. Rusconi S. Bueno M. Dean N.M. Honkanen R.E. BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to steroid signaling, Ppp5 has been implicated in cellular growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival via several intracellular signaling complexes, including CDC16- and CDC27-(7Ollendorff V.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1011-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested a critical role for Ppp5 in both the ATM/ATR and the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) pathways controlling cell cycle checkpoints and DNA double-strand break repair (12Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Wechsler T. Chen B.P. Harper R. Morotomi-Yano K. Huang B.C.

Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Ppp5 via small interfering RNA or overexpression of a catalytically inactive Ppp5 mutant in cells inhibits ATM activation and ATM autophosphorylation on serine 1981, leading to a checkpoint defect in DNA-damaged cells (14Ali A. Zhang J. Bao S. Liu I. Otterness D. Dean N.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Another report suggests that Ppp5 is also required for ATR or ATM activation in response to HU-induced replication block (12Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Taken as a whole, these studies strongly hint at the important contribution of Ppp5 to various basic cellular functions. To confirm the above activities of Ppp5 in a physiological context, we undertook a loss-of-function study by generating Ppp5-deficient mice. Surprisingly, Ppp5 deficiency did not give rise to dramatic growth defects during embryonic development and postnatal life. To investigate the potential function of Ppp5 in ATM-mediated cell cycle checkpoint signaling induced by double-strand breaks, we examined the checkpoint response to IR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) isolated from wild-type and Ppp5-deficient embryos. We demonstrate that Ppp5 is essential for the activation of G2/M checkpoint induced by IR exposure but not the S-phase replication checkpoint that can be triggered by HU treatment. Our results support a regulatory linkage between Ppp5 and ATM kinase-mediated G2/M checkpoint activation in response to radiation-induced DNA damage. Together, these data strongly suggest that Ppp5 is a crucial regulator in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway. Generation of Ppp5-deficient Mice—A promoter-trapped embryonic stem cell line XG029 containing an insertional mutation in the mouse ppp5 gene was obtained from BayGenomics. The gene trap vector (pGT1Lxf) contains a splice acceptor sequence upstream of the reporter gene β-geo. Using the PCR mapping approach, Southern blot, and sequencing analyses, we confirmed and identified the location of a single genomic insertion in the first intron of the mouse ppp5 gene. The genotyping primer sequences and probes for Southern blot analysis were designed based on this insertion site at +3893 from the transcription initiation site (Fig. 1A). Chimeric male mice were then generated and were further bred to C57BL/6J females to generate F1 offspring. Primers for genotyping are: Ppp5 geno forward, 5′-TACAGAGCAGGGAAGTGGGGTCAG3′; Ppp5 geno reverse, 5′-AGGTTGGAGGACCATGTGCCAG-3′; Ppp5georeverse, 5′-TTCAGTCTTCCTTGGTGGCCTGTC-3′. Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from various tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized by the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using 1 μg of total RNA as a template according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Real-time PCR was performed using iCycle iQ (Bio-Rad). The relative expression was normalized to the reference gene ribosomal protein L7 (RPL7). Sequences of specific primers are as follows: q-Ppp5 forward, 5′-CACAGACGCTCTGTCGTGGACTCTC-3′; q-Ppp5 reverse, 5′-GCACTTCCGGTGCAGTTTCTTCTG-3′; RPL7 forward, 5′-AGTTGAAGGTGAAGCGCCTGAGG-3′; RPL 7 reverse, 5′-TGCCATCCTAGCCATCCGAATC-3′. Cell Culture, IR Treatments, and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—The Ppp5 wild-type, Ppp5 heterozygous (+/–) mutant, and Ppp5 homozygous (–/–) mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from an embryonic day 13.5 embryo and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were irradiated with 3 Gy of ionizing radiation in the AGFA X-RAD320 irradiation system. 24 h after IR (3 Gy), IR-treated or untreated MEF cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and incubated for 30 min with RNase A (100 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) at 37 C. Cell cycle distributions were analyzed by flow cytometry. Mitotic indexes in wild-type and Ppp5-deficient MEF cells before and after IR treatment were determined as described previously (15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis and in Vitro ATM Kinase Assay—Irradiated MEF cells were harvested at 1 h after IR or as indicated. Western blot analysis of phospho-Rad17 (pRad17), total Rad17, phospho-Chk2 (pChk2), total Chk2, and Ppp5 was performed as described previously (14Ali A. Zhang J. Bao S. Liu I. Otterness D. Dean N.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Phospho-specific antibody for Rad17 Ser-645 (α-pS645-Rad17) was obtained from GeneTex (San Antonio, TX), and the phospho-specific antibody for Rad17 Ser-635 (α-pS635-Rad17) has been previously characterized (12Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The phospho-specific antibody for Chk2 and Chk1 and the antibody for total Chk2 and Chk1 were from Cell Signaling Inc. Antibody for total Rad17 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibody for Ppp5 was a generous gift from Dr. Michael Chinker. The ATM complex was immunoprecipitated from untreated or irradiated wild-type and Ppp5-decifient MEF cells, and the in vitro ATM kinase assays were performed as described previously (15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). ATM kinase activities were assessed using 1 μg of GST-hRad17 fusion protein containing the C-terminal 185 amino acids of hRad17 as substrate. Immunofluorescent Staining—MEF cells isolated from wild-type or Ppp5-deficient mice were cultured on coverslips in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum followed by irradiation. Cells were fixed at 3 h after IR with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-100 in PBS. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin, cells were incubated with the α-pS645-Rad17 antibody (diluted according to the manufacturer’s instructions) at 4 °C overnight. Following three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody for 1 h. After washing with PBS, cell nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Pictures were taken under a fluorescent microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss). Ppp5 heterozygous mutant mice were viable and fertile and were intercrossed to obtain Ppp5 homozygous mutants. Genotyping analysis of 153 F2 offspring at 2 weeks of age demonstrated normal Mendelian 1:2:1 distribution of all three genotypes (+/+, 42; +/–, 74; –/–, 37), indicating that Ppp5-deficient mice are viable in utero through the course of embryonic development. Western blotting and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Ppp5 expression in wild-type, Ppp5 heterozygous, and Ppp5 homozygous mutant mice demonstrated a 50% reduction in Ppp5 heterozygous and a complete absence of Ppp5 protein and mRNA in Ppp5 homozygous mutant (Fig. 1, B and C). There was no leaky Ppp5 expression found in this Ppp5 mutant mouse strain. Therefore, this promoter-trapped allele is a Ppp5 null allele. Both Ppp5-deficient male and Ppp5-deficient female mice were fertile and showed a rate of growth equivalent to that of wild-type (Fig. 1D). Analysis of potentially compromised glucocorticoid receptor activity in Ppp5-deficient mice is on the way. Here, as our first report on the generation of Ppp5-deficient mice, we focus on our initial analysis of the role of Ppp5 in ATM-mediated cell cycle checkpoint pathway. ATM is important in cell cycle checkpoint activation triggered by ionizing radiation and radiomimetic agents (15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Recently, several reports using small interfering RNA have suggested a role for Ppp5 in ATM kinase activity and its subsequent checkpoint activation (12Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Ali A. Zhang J. Bao S. Liu I. Otterness D. Dean N.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ppp5 is essential to cell cycle checkpoints, we isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and Ppp5-deficient embryonic day 3.5 embryos. The MEF cells were exposed to ionizing radiation (3 Gy) and HU, respectively. In the case of IR, cell cycle profiles were analyzed 24 h after irradiation using flow cytometry (fluorescence-activated cell sorter). Our analysis revealed that wild-type MEF cells displayed a typical and distinct G2/M cell cycle arrest after IR exposure (43% arrest at G2/M-phase) (Fig. 2). In contrast, Ppp5-deficient MEF cells significantly failed to accumulate in G2/M-phase after IR exposure (23% arrest at G2/M). These data strongly indicate a defect in the IR-induced G2/M checkpoint in Ppp5-deficient cells. This conclusion was further confirmed by determining the mitotic indexes in wild-type and Ppp5 null MEF cells before and after IR treatment. As shown in Fig. 2C, at 24 h after IR, Ppp5 null MEF cells display a significant higher mitotic index than the wild-type cells, indicating that Ppp5 null cells have a defect in G2 arrest in response to IR, which further demonstrates that Ppp5 null cells are defective in the IR-induced G2 checkpoint. In the case of HU treatment, however, Ppp5-deficient MEF cell did not appear significantly different when compared with wild-type MEF cells (data not shown). In previous studies (12Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Ali A. Zhang J. Bao S. Liu I. Otterness D. Dean N.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), Ppp5 was found in a complex with ATM. Ppp5 expression was also increased after the cells were exposed to the radiomimetic agent neocarzinostatin. To determine whether ablation of Ppp5 affects ATM activation induced by IR exposure, in vitro kinase assays were performed using the ATM-specific substrate Rad17 (15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A GST fusion protein containing a 185-amino acid C-terminal peptide of human Rad17 was incubated with ATM immunoprecipitates derived from wild-type and mutant Ppp5 MEF cells. ATM kinase activity was assessed by Western blot using a specific antibody against phosphorylated Rad17 at serine 635 (12Zhang J. Bao S. Furumai R. Kucera K.S. Ali A. Dean N.M. Wang X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9910-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). As expected, ATM kinase activity was greatly increased after IR treatment in wild-type MEF cells (Fig. 3A, panel a). In contrast, ATM kinase activity was dramatically reduced in Ppp5-deficient cells after IR treatment, pointing to Ppp5 as a key regulator of ATM kinase activity. To further investigate the ATM pathway in Ppp5-deficient cells, we measured phosphorylation of two ATM targets, Rad17 and Chk2, in intact cells. Rad17 is a checkpoint protein required for cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. This protein binds to chromatin prior to DNA damage and is phosphorylated by ATM after damage (16Post S.M. Tomkinson A.E. Lee E.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5568-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rad17 is required for DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and is thought to be a critical early event during checkpoint signaling (15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The protein kinase Chk2 is also phosphorylated and activated in response to DNA damage by ionizing radiation, with both events dependent on ATM activity (17Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Chk2-deficient embryonic stem cells fail to maintain radiation-induced arrest in the G2-phase of the cell cycle (18Hirao A. Kong Y.Y. Matsuoka S. Wakeham A. Ruland J. Yoshida H. Liu D. Elledge S.J. Mak T.W. Science. 2000; 287: 1824-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation levels of Rad17 and Chk2 are key indicators of endogenous ATM activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, panel b, ionizing radiation induced phosphorylation of Rad17 at both Ser-645 and Ser-635 in wild-type MEF cells. Induction of phosphorylation was detected 1 h after IR exposure. Similarly, Chk2 phosphorylation was enhanced in wild-type MEF cells after irradiation. In contrast, IR-induced phosphorylation of both Rad17 and Chk2 was significantly reduced in Ppp5-deficient cells, although levels of each protein remained normal. A time course study further revealed that ATM activity remained dramatically reduced up to 4 h after IR (Fig. 3A, panel c). Furthermore, phosphorylated NBS1 was also significantly reduced in Ppp5-deficient cells when treating with a radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin (NCS) (Fig. 3B, panel a). Consistent with normal cellular response to replication blocker HU, wild-type and Ppp5-deficient MEF cells did not display a significant difference in the phosphorylation of Rad17 and Chk1 in response to HU treatment (Fig. 3B, panel b). In addition to biochemical alterations, we also found that the biological function of Rad17 was defective in Ppp5-deficient MEF cells. Rad17 shares strong similarity with DNA replication factor C (RFC) and can form a complex with RFCs (19Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Ott R. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12935-12942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The Rad17-RFC complex, along with another DNA repair complex (Rad9-Rad1-Hus1), have both been implicated in the early phase of cell cycle checkpoint control (20Kobayashi M. Hirano A. Kumano T. Xiang S.L. Mihara K. Haseda Y. Matsui O. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). They function as sensors for DNA damage and genome replication errors (21Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1633-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Rad17 is required to form this complex (15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and a critical feature required for activity appears to be formation of Rad17-containing nuclear foci after IR (15Bao S. Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Fang Y. Richardson D.A. Ali A. Chen S.M. Abraham R.T. Wang X.F. Nature. 2001; 411: 969-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 22Zou L. Cortez D. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ppp5 activity is required for complex formation, we examined nuclear foci formation in Ppp5-deficient MEF cells after IR exposure. Wild-type and Ppp5-deficient MEF cells were fixed and stained with a specific antibody against phospho-Rad17-Ser-645 at 3 h after IR. As shown in Fig. 3C, wild-type MEF cells displayed a typical punctuate pattern of nuclear staining after IR. In contrast, this nuclear staining pattern was almost completely missing in Ppp5-deficient MEF cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that reduced phosphorylation of Rad17 in Ppp5-deficient cells may decrease nuclear foci (checkpoint complex) formation. Taken as a whole, our data provide the first conclusive evidence that Ppp5 is an important regulator of ATM-mediated signaling. We have shown that Ppp5 is essential to the ability of ATM to phosphorylate key substrates, Rad17, Chk2, and NBS1, and that these phosphorylation events are critical to checkpoint control of cell cycle arrest following DNA damage. One enigma from our initial characterization of Ppp5-deficient mice is that, despite significant alteration of ATM-mediated signaling, Ppp5 is not critical to mouse survival and fertility. In contrast, ATM-deficient mice display growth retardation, male and female infertility due to meiotic failure and abnormal chromosomal synapsis, defects in lymphocyte maturation, and extreme sensitivity to radiation. Moreover, most ATM-deficient mice die before 4 months of age from thymic lymphomas (23Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Cell. 1996; 86: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Although we have not yet thoroughly investigated most of these parameters in the Ppp5-deficient mouse, it is clear that fertility appears to be unaffected and that lethality is much reduced when compared with the ATM-deficient mouse. This suggests that ATM is involved in a broader checkpoint function than Ppp5. Our data demonstrate that Ppp5 is likely involved in regulating ATM kinase activity only in response to a subset of genotoxic stresses, such as IR. When we examined the HU-induced replication checkpoint activation in Ppp5-deficient and wild-type MEF cells, we found that the Rad17 and Chk1 phosphorylations were not significantly different between wild-type and Ppp5-deficient MEF cells, suggesting that Ppp5 was not involved in the intra-S-phase replication checkpoint. On the other hand, it was demonstrated that AT cells or ATM-deficient cells displayed IR-resistant DNA synthesis in S-phase (2Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATM was also associated with S-phase DNA replication checkpoint. Alternatively, other protein phosphatases may partially compensate for the loss of Ppp5 in the Ppp5-deficient cells. Together, these findings may help to explain the phenotypic difference between ATM-deficient and Ppp5-deficient mice. Given the high incidence of lymphomas in ATM null mice, it will be interesting to see whether Ppp5-deficient mice require a longer period of time to develop lymphomas or other tumors. Also consistent with our hypothesis is the fact that Ppp5 appears to be a tightly regulated phosphatase. Several studies have shown extremely low basal phosphatase activity for Ppp5, most likely due to an auto-inhibitory function of the TPR domain of the protein (24Chinkers M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 28-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Chen M.X. Cohen P.T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22464-22471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the TPR domain cooperates with the final 13 residues of the C terminus to maintain the phosphatase in an inactive state. Removal of either the TPR domain or the C-terminal 13 residues by limited proteolysis or deletion mutagenesis greatly increases the Ppp5 enzymatic activity (25Chen M.X. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 27Sinclair C. Borchers C. Parker C. Tomer K. Charbonneau H. Rossie S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several reports now exist that both Hsp90 and fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, can stimulate Ppp5 phosphatase activity by a direct interaction with the TPR domain (29Yang J. Roe S.M. Cliff M.J. Williams M.A. Ladbury J.E. Cohen P.T. Barford D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 30Ramsey A.J. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5625-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although it is far from clear whether fatty acids are true physiological regulators of Ppp5, it is likely that other, as yet unknown, upstream factors will be found to regulate the phosphatase. Given the role uncovered here, it would not be surprising to find activation of Ppp5 either by radiation-induced signaling molecules or via byproducts of the DNA damage process itself. Clearly, the exact mechanisms that activate Ppp5 during DNA damage stress or the direct targets of Ppp5 in the ATM survival mechanism remain unknown and will be the subject of much investigation. The Ppp5-deficient mice and cells we have generated may not only help to identify these missing factors but may also contribute to the understanding of how genomic instability leads to tumorigenesis. We thank Dr. Shaolian Jing and William Carter of Indiana University Mouse Core for superb assistance. We also thank Dr. Michael Chinkers for Ppp5 antibody."
https://openalex.org/W2063042840,"The agonist sensitivity of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) can be altered by protein kinase C (PKC), with CaR residue Thr(888) contributing significantly to this effect. To determine whether CaR(T888) is a substrate for PKC and whether receptor activation modulates such phosphorylation, a phospho-specific antibody against this residue was raised (CaR(pT888)). In HEK-293 cells stably expressing CaR (CaR-HEK), but not in cells expressing the mutant receptor CaR(T888A), phorbol ester (PMA) treatment increased CaR(pT888) immunoreactivity as observed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Raising extracellular Ca(2+) concentration from 0.5 to 2.5 mM increased CaR(T888) phosphorylation, an effect that was potentiated stereoselectively by the calcimimetic NPS R-467. These responses were mimicked by 5 mM extracellular Ca(2+) and abolished by the calcilytic NPS-89636 and also by PKC inhibition or chronic PMA pretreatment. Whereas CaR(T888A) did exhibit increased apparent agonist sensitivity, by converting intracellular Ca(2+) (Ca(2+)(i)) oscillations to sustained plateau responses in some cells, we still observed Ca(2+)(i) oscillations in a significant number of cells. This suggests that CaR(T888) contributes significantly to CaR regulation but is not the exclusive determinant of CaR-induced Ca(2+)(i) oscillations. Finally, dephosphorylation of CaR(T888) was blocked by the protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitor calyculin, a treatment that also inhibited Ca(2+)(i) oscillations. In addition, calyculin/PMA cotreatment increased CaR(T888) phosphorylation in bovine parathyroid cells. Therefore, CaR(T888) is a substrate for receptor-induced, PKC-mediated feedback phosphorylation and can be dephosphorylated by a calyculin-sensitive phosphatase."

Hierarchical phosphorylation of Ser774 precedes phosphorylation of Ser778. In contrast, Thr780 phosphorylation by cdk5 has been reported as the sole site (Tomizawa, K., Sunada, S., Lu, Y. F., Oda, Y., Kinuta, M., Ohshima, T., Saito, T., Wei, F. Y., Matsushita, M., Li, S. T., Tsutsui, K., Hisanaga, S. I., Mikoshiba, K., Takei, K., and Matsui, H. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 163, 813–824). To resolve the discrepancy and to better understand the biological roles of dynI phosphorylation, we undertook a systematic identification of all phosphorylation sites in rat brain nerve terminal dynI. Using phosphoamino acid analysis, exclusively phospho-serine residues were found. Thr780 phosphorylation was not detectable. Mutation of Ser774, Ser778, and Thr780 confirmed that Thr780 phosphorylation is restricted to in vitro conditions. Mass spectrometry of 32P-labeled phosphopeptides separated by two-dimensional mapping revealed seven in vivo phosphorylation sites: Ser774, Ser778, Ser822, Ser851, Ser857, Ser512, and Ser347. Quantification of 32P radiation in each phosphopeptide showed that Ser774 and Ser778 were the major sites (up to 69% of the total), followed by Ser851 and Ser857 (12%), and Ser853 (2%). Phosphorylation of Ser851 and Ser857 was restricted to the long tail splice variant dynIxa and was not hierarchical. Co-purified, 32P-labeled dynIII was phosphorylated at Ser759, Ser763, and Ser853. Ser853 is homologous to Ser851 in dynIxa. The results identify all major and several minor phosphorylation sites in dynI and provide the first measure of their relative abundance and relative responses to depolarization. The multiple phospho-sites suggest subtle regulation of synaptic vesicle endocytosis by new protein kinases and new protein-protein interactions. The homologous dynI and dynIII phosphorylation indicates a high mechanistic similarity. The results suggest a unique role for the long splice variants of dynI and dynIII in nerve terminals.

Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 659-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The dephosphins are constitutively phosphorylated in nerve terminals, and their collective rephosphorylation after SVE is necessary for maintaining synaptic vesicle recycling and thus synaptic transmission. One such dephosphin is dynamin I (dynI), a large GTPase enzyme that is crucial for the fission stage of SVE (2Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). During SVE, dynI is dephosphorylated by the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (3Liu J.P. Sim A.T.R. Robinson P.J. Science. 1994; 265: 970-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and is subsequently rephosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) on Ser774 and Ser778 (4Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat.

Proteomics. 2004; 3: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These phosphorylation sites, located in the proline-rich domain (PRD), are thought to regulate the interaction with the src-3 homology (SH3) domain-containing proteins involved in SVE. A long list of SH3 domain-containing proteins has been shown to bind the dynI PRD in vitro. Recently, we have identified syndapin I (sdpnI) as the phosphorylation-regulated dynI partner in vivo and that its interaction with dynI is crucial to SVE (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Apart from phosphorylation of Ser774 and Ser778 by cdk5, there have been a number of reports on other dynI phosphorylation sites and their potential protein kinases, both in vivo and in vitro. DynI is phosphorylated on Ser857 by minibrain kinase/Dyrk1A in vitro, and the phosphorylation regulates binding of dynI to amphiphysin I (amphI) and Grb2 (7Huang Y. Chen-Hwang M.C. Dolios G. Murakami N. Padovan J.C. Wang R. Hwang Y.W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10173-10185Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was shown to occur in PC12 cells and was responsive to depolarizing stimuli, strongly suggesting a physiological relevance. It has also been reported that dynI is phosphorylated at Thr780 by cdk5, which apparently regulates its binding to amphI (8Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S.I. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This is in conflict with our previous in vivo phosphorylation site analysis of dynI, which did not detect phosphorylation at this site (5Larsen M.R. Graham M.E. Robinson P.J. Roepstorff P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Other studies have suggested that there may be other kinases capable of phosphorylating dynI in vitro, but the in vivo relevance of these events has not been established (9Hosoya H. Komatsu S. Shimizu T. Inagaki M. Ikegami M. Yazaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1127-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Robinson P.J. Sontag J-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C.

DynI and dynII are also substrates for the tyrosine kinase c-Src in non-neuronal cells on Tyr231 and Tyr597 (13Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C.L. Reedy M.C. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20392-20400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The two sites are highly conserved between all three dynamin genes. However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of dynI has only been reported in transfected non-neuronal cells where it is not known to be normally expressed (13Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C.L. Reedy M.C. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26642-26651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), whereas that of dynII occurs under endogenous conditions (13Ahn S. Kim J. Lucaveche C.L. Reedy M.C.

This suggests that in vivo phosphorylation of these tyrosine phospho-sites in dynI remains an open question. In this study, we sought to determine whether there were other in vivo dynI phosphorylation sites, in addition to Ser774, Ser778, and Ser857, that may prove to be functionally important for SVE. We established a method that ensures maximum purification of 32P-labeled dynI so that none of the relevant phosphorylation sites were missed. We show that dynI was exclusively phosphorylated on serine residues by 32P-phosphoamino acid analysis. We identified two new dynI phosphorylation sites at Ser347 and Ser512 and two new stimulation-dependent dynI phosphorylation sites at Ser822 and Ser851. We also showed that phosphorylation of Thr780 by cdk5 was restricted to in vitro conditions, did not occur in vivo (within detection limits), and did not regulate binding of amphI. DNA Constructs and Protein Expression—The dynI PRD (rat, amino acids 746–864) was amplified from the green fluorescent protein-tagged dynamin and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 as described previously (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). DynI point mutants were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST-amphI SH3 domain was from Pietro de Camilli (Yale, New Haven, CT). GST-sdpnI SH3 domain was from Markus Plomann (University of Cologne, Germany). GST-endophilin I (endoI) SH3 domain was from Peter McPherson (McGill, Canada). GST-cdk5 and GST-p25 were from Jerry Wang (Hong Kong University, Hong Kong) and Li-Huei Tsai (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA), respectively. All GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Synaptosomal DynI Purification—Crude (P2) synaptosomes were prepared from rat brain and labeled with 32P as described previously (10Robinson P.J. Sontag J-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Suödhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, synaptosomes were incubated with 0.75 mCi/ml [γ-32P]Pi for 1 h at 37°C. The synaptosomes were briefly depolarized with 41 mm KCl and immediately lysed as described previously (4Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). DynI was purified from synaptosome lysates using the GST-amphI SH3 domain bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (4Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). GST-endoI SH3 domain and GST-sdpnI SH3 domain were also used as bait to pull down dynI from synaptosome lysates, as described previously (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Beads were washed extensively, eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer, and resolved on 7.5–15% gradient SDS gels. Tryptic Digestion and Phosphopeptide Enrichment—DynI gel bands, each containing ∼2 μg of purified protein, were excised and diced from colloidal Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels. Four untreated and four KCl-treated 32P-labeled dynI bands were used in each two-dimensional map. Twenty unlabeled dynI bands were TiO2-enriched (see below) and added to the untreated sample for two-dimensional mapping. Two dynI bands were used in the nano-LC-MS/MS experiments (see below). The bands were destained in three 1-ml washes of 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate in a 50% acetonitrile solution with 1 h of vortexing between washes. The gel pieces were digested in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate aqueous solution containing 12.5 ng/μl trypsin at 37 °C overnight. The digest solution was made up to 50% acetonitrile, and the tryptic peptides were extracted after 15 min of vortexing. A second extraction was obtained with 50% acetonitrile solution after 15 min of vortexing. A final extraction was obtained with 80% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid solution after 15 min of vortexing. The combined extract was dried down to 2.5 μl. Phosphopeptides from a tryptic digest of non-radioactive dynI were enriched using TiO2 as described earlier (15Larsen M.R. Thingholm T.E. Jensen O.N. Roepstorff P. Jorgensen T.J. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 873-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tryptic digest was concentrated into 5 μl and added to 25 μl of loading solution (300 mg/μl dihydroxybenzoic acid in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid 80% acetonitrile or 5% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile in the absence of dihydroxybenzoic acid). The sample was loaded onto a GELoader tip (Eppendorf), converted to a microcolumn, packed with TiO2, and washed twice with loading solution and then twice with a wash solution of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/80% acetonitrile, without the presence of dihydroxybenzoic acid. The sample was eluted in 20% ammonium hydroxide/20% acetonitrile solution and immediately dried. Phosphoamino Acids Analysis and Two-dimensional Phosphopeptide Mapping—The 32P-labeled dynI tryptic digest was analyzed by phosphoamino acid analysis as described previously (4Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat.

Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was done on 20 × 20 cm cellulose plates (Merck) by electrophoresis at pH 4.7 (16Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Van der Geer P. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 1999; (pp. .9.27, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York): 139-142Google Scholar) followed by ascending chromatography in 35% 1-butanol, 20% pyridine, 7.5% acetic acid, 2.5% acetonitrile, and 35% water. The radioactive spots were detected by quantitative phosphorimaging (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences), scraped from the plate, and extracted from the cellulose as described (16Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Van der Geer P. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 1999; (pp. .9.27, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York): 139-142Google Scholar), except that the extraction was done in 5% formic acid solution. The phosphopeptides were concentrated using C18 or graphite microcolumns and detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS, Voyager DE-PRO, Applied Biosystems) as described previously (5Larsen M.R. Graham M.E. Robinson P.J. Roepstorff P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A theoretical two-dimensional phosphopeptide map was generated firstly by determining the theoretical electrophoretic mobility by predicting the charge at pH 4.7 and dividing by the mass of the phosphopeptide as described by Meisenhelder et al. (16Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Van der Geer P. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 1999; (pp. .9.27, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York): 139-142Google Scholar). The mobility in the second dimension, which is based on relative hydrophobicity, was estimated from the reversedphase HPLC index (17Sakamoto Y. Kawakami N. Sasagawa T. J. Chromatogr. 1988; 442: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as calculated using GPMAW version 7.01 (Lighthouse Data, Denmark). The theoretical HPLC index was decreased by two units for each additional phosphate group to account for the observed decreased mobility of multiply phosphorylated peptides (Fig. 2B and C). Nano-LC-MS—An 8-μl aliquot (estimated at 0.5–1.5 pmol) of TiO2-enriched dynI phosphopeptides was loaded onto the nano-HPLC system (LC Packings Ultimate HPLC system, Dionex, Netherlands) with a 75-μm inside diameter pre-column of C18 reversed-phase material (ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 3-μm beads, Dr. Maisch, Germany) in 5 min. It was then eluted through a 50-μm inside diameter C18 column of the same material at 100 nl/min. The gradient was from 100% phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) during loading, then increased to 10% phase B (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 9.9% water) in 3 min, then to 50% phase B in 28 min, then to 60% phase B in 3 min, and finally to 100% phase B in 1 min. The eluate was sprayed through a 10-μm inside diameter distal coated SilicaTip (New Objective) into a QSTAR XL quadrupole-TOF (QqTOF) MS (Applied Biosystems) or a QTOF Ultima MS (Micromass/Waters) using 1900 V on the tip. For the detection of phosphopeptides of a known molecular mass the precursor ion selection was fixed at the specific m/z of the phosphopeptide in its most abundant charge state with a wide m/z setting (2–3 units) using consecutive 2-s scans. Information-dependent data acquisition was done by using a 1-s survey scan from which the three most abundant doubly, triply, or quadruply charged peptides were selected for product ion scans (2 s). The data for the phospho-dynI343–364 was from experiments using stable isotope labeling, the full details of which will be published elsewhere. As a consequence, the N terminus of a phospho-dynI343–364 was labeled with iTRAQ reagent (Fig. 4C). In this instance, the TiO2-enriched digest was first treated with iTRAQ 116 reagent (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. All phosphopeptides reported in this study were detected in at least three independent experiments. In Vitro Phosphorylation—GST-dynI PRD (1 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads was phosphorylated by recombinant cdk5/p25 in a total volume of 40 μl containing 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 and 40 μm [γ-32P]ATP (6.9 × 106 cpm/nmol) at 37 °C. Phosphorylation proceeded for 10 min, and reactions were terminated by addition of 3× SDS sample buffer and boiling. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography. A single band each of in vitro phosphorylated GST-dynI PRD wild-type and double mutant Ser to Ala were digested as above and enriched for phosphopeptides using Fe3+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described previously (5Larsen M.R. Graham M.E. Robinson P.J. Roepstorff P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The phospho-box phosphopeptides were sequenced by nano-LC-MS/MS by fixing the precursor ion selection at a specific m/z as described above. Pulldown Experiments—A rat brain or synaptosomal extract was prepared as described previously (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Various GST-dynI PRD or GST-amphI SH3 recombinant proteins were then incubated with the same amounts of tissue lysate at 4 °C for 1 h. All pulldown experiments were done in the presence of 150 mm NaCl unless stated otherwise. Beads were washed extensively, eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Antibodies and Western Blots—The anti-amphiphysin I monoclonal antibody was from Pietro de Camilli. The anti-dynI antibodies and phosphospecific antibodies to phospho-Ser774 and phospho-Ser778 in dynI were reported previously (4Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations from rat brain synaptosomes were performed as described previously (10Robinson P.J. Sontag J-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Suödhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% or 12% acrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence method using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Quantitative Extraction of DynI by GST-amphI SH3 Domain—To catalogue all in vivo phosphorylation sites in dynI from rat brain synaptosomes, we used a method capable of extracting and purifying all dynI from synaptosome lysates, as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography. We have previously reported that the SH3 domain of amphI quantitatively extracts synaptosomal dynI independently of its phosphorylation status (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). However, another study has proposed that the interaction of GST-amphI SH3 with dynI is phospho-dependent (8Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S.I. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here, we compared the efficiency of GST fusion proteins of amphI, endoI, and sdpnI SH3 domains to quantitatively extract dynI by three sequential pulldown experiments. Initial pulldown experiments with GST-amphI SH3 and GST-sdpnI SH3 recovered a large amount of endogenous dynI protein (Fig. 1A) and 32P-labeled phospho-dynI (Fig. 1B), whereas GST-endoI SH3 bound less dynI. A second pulldown of the same extracts with GST-amphI SH3 was performed to capture residual dynI missed in the first pulldown assay. There was <2% residual dynI protein and phospho-dynI following amphI or sdpnI in the first pulldown experiment (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, there was significant dynI and phospho-dynI captured following endoI SH3 in the first pulldown experiment (Fig. 1, A and B, middle panels). This is in agreement with a previous report that endoI SH3 is partly sensitive to dynI phosphorylation in vitro (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and shows that amphI SH3 can indeed capture this small pool. A third sequential pulldown assay with sdpnI SH3 or endoI SH3 domains recovered no residual dynI protein or phospho-dynI after two previous extractions with amphI SH3, endoI SH3, or sdpnI SH3 (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore the SH3 domain of amphI and sdpnI quantitatively extracts synaptosomal dynI from synaptosomes. We independently performed the similar GST-amphI SH3 triple pulldown experiments using synaptosome extracts and blotted with anti-dynI antibodies. Two rounds of GST-amphI SH3 pulldown assay was enough to quantitatively extract all synaptosomal dynI, because no trace of unbound dynI was found in the second or third pulldown experiment (Fig. 1C). We thus used this system of double GST-amphI SH3 pulldown experiments in all subsequent experiments to purify all synaptosomal dynI, regardless of its in vivo phosphorylation status. DynI Is Phosphorylated Exclusively on Serine Residues—DynI phosphorylation on Thr780 has been controversial (18Nguyen C. Bibb J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 697-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was not detected in a previous in vivo study (5Larsen M.R. Graham M.E. Robinson P.J. Roepstorff P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) but was claimed to be found after in vitro phosphorylation with cdk5 (8Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S.I. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). A simple way to address whether a protein is phosphorylated on serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues is by phosphoamino acid analysis after 32P labeling. There may be some phosphorylation sites that are not labeled with 32P, however, in dynI these sites are unlikely to be relevant to SVE, because they do not turnover 32P in 1 h of labeling. The first published report of phosphoamino acid analysis on synaptosomal dynI showed that only serine was phosphorylated (19Robinson P.J. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The source of dynI in that experiment was the bands cut from an SDS gel of a synaptosome lysate, which may be contaminated by another underlying protein with similar size. The same result was reported when dynI was purified by a single pulldown experiment with the GST-amphI SH3. Phosphorylation at threonine or tyrosine was absent (4Tan T.C. Valova V.A. Malladi C.S. Graham M.E. Berven L.A. Jupp O.J. Hansra G. McClure S.J. Sarcevic B. Boadle R.A. Larsen M.R. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). In this study, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis using dynI purified by GST-amphI-SH3 pulldown experiments from 32P-labeled synaptosomes and again found only serine was phosphorylated (Fig. 2A). We conclude that synaptosomal dynI is exclusively phosphorylated on serine residues with no detectable 32P labeling on threonine or tyrosine residues. Separation and Detection of in Vivo 32P-Labeled DynI Phosphopeptides—A tryptic digest of dynI purified from 32P-labeled synaptosomes was subjected to two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping (Fig. 2B). Similarly, a tryptic digest of dynI from synaptosomes depolarized with 41 mm KCl for 10 s was also analyzed in parallel (Fig. 2C). The 32P-labeled phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography. We observed 15 clearly distinct spots on the two-dimensional map (A–O). The majority of the radiation was in spots A–D (Fig. 2B). These spots have previously been shown to contain overlapping tryptic phosphopeptides (including tryptic cleavages and missed cleavages) from the dynI phospho-box (772RRSPTSSPTPQRR784) (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Spots C and D were previously shown to contain almost exclusively phospho-Ser774, and spots A and B were shown to contain doubly phosphorylated peptides that are equal parts phosphorylated at Ser774 and Ser778 (5Larsen M.R. Graham M.E. Robinson P.J. Roepstorff P. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 456-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MS/MS Identification of Phosphorylation Sites in DynI Phosphopeptides—To account for all the 32P that is distributed among the various dynI phosphorylation sites, the phosphopeptides contained within each spot on the two-dimensional map were extracted from the cellulose and analyzed by MALDI-MS and tandem MS. Spots A–D contained the dynI phospho-box peptides (772RRSPTSSPTPQRR784, data not shown) that we identified previously (6Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Spots E–H had low relative radiation levels and were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS, but no phosphopeptides were detectable (Fig. 2B). Similarly, no phosphopeptides were detected in spots J, M, and N, which had even lower levels of total radiation (∼2"

The interaction with Bcl-2 and the enzyme activity of FKBP38 depend on prior binding of calmodulin-Ca2+ (CaM-Ca2+) at high Ca2+ concentrations. The FKBP38 protein structure contains three tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs corresponding to the Hsp90 interaction sites of other immunophilins. In this study we show that the TPR domain of FKBP38 interacts with the C-terminal domain of Hsp90, but only if the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex is preformed. Hence, FKBP38 is the first example of a TPR-containing immunophilin that interacts cofactor-dependently with Hsp90. In the ternary Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex the active site of FKBP38 is blocked, thus preventing interactions with Bcl-2. The dual control of the active site cleft of FKBP38 by CaM-Ca2+ and Hsp90 highlights the importance of the enzyme activity of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex in the regulation of programmed cell death.

The human FKBP38 (FK506-binding protein 38), the product of the FKBP8 gene, belongs to the enzyme class of peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases, 2The abbreviations used are: PPIase, peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase; FKBP, FK506-binding protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat; CaM, calmodulin; NOS, nitric-oxide synthase; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation. EC 5.2.1.8) that assist protein folding by catalyzing the slow interconversion of cis and trans isomers of the peptide bond preceding proline in polypeptide chains. This isomerization reaction is involved in both de novo protein folding and regulation of biological activity of native proteins. The accelerated isomerization catalyzed by PPIases is essential in signal transduction pathways (1Fischer G. Aumuller T. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

FKBP38 was found to play an important role in the apoptosis regulation of neuroblastoma cells by inhibiting interactions of Bcl-2 with its cellular targets, such as calcineurin and Bad (3Edlich F.

The negative regulation of Bcl-2 by FKBP38 depends on functional integrity of the FKBP domain, which is controlled by the cellular Ca2+ concentration and the interaction with the Ca2+ sensor CaM, characterizing FKBP38 as the first cofactor-regulated PPIase (3Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Potent neuroprotective and neuroregenerative effects of specific low molecular weight FKBP38 inhibitors and FKBP38 short interfering RNA constructs in neuroblastoma cells outline the importance of FKBP38 activity in the control of neuronal apoptosis. Furthermore, the administration of N-(N′,N′-dimethylcarboxamidomethyl)-cycloheximide, a low molecular weight FKBP38 inhibitor, to an endothelin-1-induced middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model in the rat brain demonstrated the potency of FKBP38 inhibition for neuroregeneration and neuroprotection in rat brain tissue (5Edlich F.

The crucial role of FKBP38 in the control of neuronal apoptosis is indicated as well by a pronounced FKBP38 expression in neuronal cells (5Edlich F. Weiwad M. Wildemann D. Jarczowski F. Kilka S.

Additionally, FKBP38 is also involved in the apoptosis control of other cell types, as recently shown by the anti-apoptotic effect resulting from the interaction of FKBP38 and the NS5A protein of the hepatitis C virus in hepatoma cells (7Wang J.D.

The FKBP38 ortholog in mice was described to be involved in the regulation of neuronal development by affecting sonic hedgehog signaling (9Bulgakov O.V. Eggenschwiler J.T. Hong D.H. Anderson K.V. Li T. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2149-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, it displayed specific antitumor effects by the regulation of anti-invasive syn-1 gene expression and suppression of the proinvasive MMP9 gene (10Fong S. Mounkes L. Liu Y. Maibaum M.

Human FKBP38 was also found to be involved in cell size regulation (11Rosner M. Hofer K. Kubista M. Hengstschlager M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4786-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). FKBP38 contains the second messenger-regulated PPIase domain in its N-terminal region and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain, harboring three TPR motifs, a putative CaM-binding site, and a membrane anchor. Human FKBPs with similar domain composition and significant sequence homology to FKBP38 were shown to play a role in homologous chromosome pairing during male meiosis (12Crackower M.A. Kolas N.K.

Interact. 2002; 141: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The XAP2 protein (X protein-associated protein2, FKBP37.7), for instance, which contains, analogous to FKBP38, an N-terminal FKBP domain and a C-terminal TPR domain with three TPR motifs, is a component of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor complex and thus is involved in cellular detection of dioxins and subsequent cellular response on xenobiotics. Within the receptor complex, XAP2 interacts not only with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor but also via its TPR domain with the 12-kDa C-terminal (C90) domain of Hsp90 (16Petrulis J.R. Perdew G.H. Chem.

Similar interactions between Hsp90 and the TPR-containing PPIases FKBP51 and FKBP52 were identified in steroid hormone receptor complexes (13Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C.

Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The TPR domain of FKBP38 shares significant sequence homology with the corresponding domains in FKBP51, FKBP52, and XAP2. The heat shock protein Hsp90, which exists in two isoforms (Hsp90α and Hsp90β) with about 86% identity in their amino acid sequences, occurs largely in homodimers, but heterodimers and monomers were reported as well (20Radanyi C.

Cell Res. 1993; 209: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The C90 domain mediates the anti-parallel dimerization of Hsp90 monomers with a dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range (23Maruya M. Sameshima M. Nemoto T. Yahara I. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 903-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 24Richter K. Muschler P. Hainzl O. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33689-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Like FKBP38, Hsp90 binds CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner (25Cambiazo V. Gonzalez M. Isamit C. Maccioni R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9604-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CaM-binding site in Hsp90 is a short peptide in the C-terminal part of the protein, which likely adopts an α-helix (26Minami Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9604-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore shares features common to CaM-binding sites (27Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). CaM binding is involved in the regulation of calcineurin, nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), CaM-dependent kinases, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, plasma membrane Ca2+ pumps, Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and rhodopsin protein phosphatase (28Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In case of the different forms of NOS, for instance, Hsp90 was reported to facilitate CaM binding to NOS and to activate NOS further by direct binding (29Fontana J. Fulton D. Chen Y. Fairchild T.A. McCabe T.J. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 30Song Y. Zweier J.L. Xia Y. Biochem.

Chem. 2001; 276: 32663-32669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Hence, Hsp90 is thought to play a role in the CaM-mediated control of a plethora of biological processes, such as muscle contraction, fertilization, cell proliferation, vesicular fusion, and apoptosis, where CaM transfers highly regulated changes in the cellular concentration of the second messenger Ca2+ to target proteins and subsequently regulates their activities. In this study, we demonstrate that the CaM-dependent PPIase FKBP38 interacts with Hsp90 via binding of the TPR domain to the C90 domain of Hsp90. This interaction, however, depends in contrast to other interactions of Hsp90 with TPR-containing proteins on the previous formation of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. The resulting ternary complex is enzymatically inactive, and the association of Bcl-2 and the PPIase site of FKBP38 is prevented. Sources of enzymes used in the experiments are as follows: recombinant human FKBP38, lacking the membrane anchor (FKBP38-(1–336)), recombinant human FKBP12, recombinant human Hsp90 C90 (Hsp90-(590–730)), recombinant human calmodulin, and human Bcl-2 were expressed by using a pET28a-vector in Escherichia coli Rosetta™ cells. Human Hsp90 protein was purchased from StressGen. MBP-Bcl-2 fusion protein was purchased from Sigma. The FKBP38 antibody was an affinity-purified section 4 polyclonal antibody from rabbit against the purified FKBP38 domain (amino acids 1–165). Additional antibodies used are as follows: polyclonal rabbit anti-actin (Sigma), monoclonal hamster anti-Bcl-2 (Pharmingen), and monoclonal rat anti-Hsp90 (StressGen). Peptide substrates used were obtained from Bachem (Heidelberg, Germany). FK506 was purchased from Calbiochem. Low molecular weight substances were synthesized according to standard procedures (33Christner C. Herdegen T. Fischer G. Mini Rev. Med. Chem. 2001; 1: 377-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and characterized by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. PPIase activity was determined using protease-coupled assays as described elsewhere (34Kofron J.L. Kuzmic P. Kishore V. Colon-Bonilla E. Rich D.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6127-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 35Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Typically, FKBP38 PPIase activity was measured in a reaction mixture containing 1 μm FKBP38, 5 μm CaM, and 1 mm CaCl2. FKBP38 was tested using the oligopeptide succinyl-AFPF-4-nitroanilide as substrate. In the case of Hsp90 and CaM insensitivity toward proteolytic digestion by α-chymotrypsin in the time range of the kinetic experiments was verified. The results are the means of three replicants. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown in flasks for 16 h and harvested. Cell lysis and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols of the immunoprecipitation starter kit (GE Healthcare). Prior to incubation, 0.5 μm EGTA was added to the samples. 1 μm CaCl2 was added to those samples incubated in the presence of Ca2+. CaM Binding Assay—CaM-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) was pre-equilibrated in 25 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5 (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol), either in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA. Subsequently, 20 μg of recombinant FKBP38 in the presence and absence of 50 μg of Hsp90 was incubated with CaM-Sepharose. Sepharose was washed, and bound proteins were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Bcl-2 Binding Assay—40 μl of 6 μm MBP-Bcl-2 fusion protein (MBP-Bcl-2) was subjected to 40 μl of amylose-resin (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and incubated for 30 min. Subsequently, beads were washed twice with buffer, 25 mm Tris/ HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and then incubated for 1 h with 40 μl of reaction mixture containing 10 μm FKBP38 and 40 μm CaM in the presence of different concentrations of Hsp90 C90 protein. CD Spectroscopy—Near-UV CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Jasco J-710 circular dichroism spectrometer in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 2 mm CaCl2 containing 1 μm FKBP38 and 5 μm CaM either separated or mixed in a 10-mm tandem cuvette. Interaction of 1 μm FKBP38 and 1 μm Hsp90 was measured in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 and 5 μm CaM in a tandem cuvette as well. Fluorescence Methods—1 μm FKBP38, 1 μm FKBP12, 1 μm FKBP52, 1 μm Hsp90, and 2 μm CaM were used in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm CaCl2 for fluorescence measurements and the fluorometric titration of FKBP38. The concentration of the protein was measured by UV-visible spectroscopy. The experiments were performed after equilibrating at 25 °C for 10 min. The samples were excited at 278 nm, and the fluorescence was scanned from 285 to 500 nm for fluorescence measurements. The fluorescence titration was performed with an excitation at 278 nm and monitored at 325 nm. Fluorescence measurements, using 1-ml quartz cuvettes with a 0.5-cm path length, were performed on a Jobin Yvon Instruments Fluoromax 2. The results are means of three replicants. The binding constant (EC50) was calculated from the fluorescence intensity by Sigma blot software using sigmoidal dose-response ligand binding fit with Equation 1,F=F0+Fmax-F01+10(lgEC50-CHsp90)d(Eq. 1) where F is fluorescence intensity; F0 = initial fluorescence intensity; Fmax is fluorescence intensity at saturation; d is Hill slope; cHsp90 = total Hsp90 concentration at each addition; and EC50 = dissociation constant. FKBP38 Interacts with Hsp90 in the Presence of CaM-Ca2+—TPR-containing FKBPs have been described previously to form complexes with Hsp90; hence, we were interested in the identification of possible interactions between FKBP38 and the heat shock protein. First, co-IP experiments were performed using the endogenous proteins of SH-SY5Y cells, showing, indeed, an interaction between FKBP38 and Hsp90 (Fig. 1A). However, the results point to a Ca2+ dependence of this interaction, because significant amounts of FKBP38 were only found to bind Hsp90 in the presence of Ca2+ in samples immunoprecipitated with either anti-Hsp90 or anti-FKBP38 antibodies. The requirement of calcium ions for the interaction of FKBP38 and Hsp90 in SH-SY5Y crude cell lysate indicates a possible involvement of the Ca2+ sensor CaM in this interaction, because free FKBP38 and the CaM-Ca2+-complexed form of the PPIase differ in their biological activity. To investigate whether both forms of FKBP38 also differ in their binding to Hsp90, co-IP experiments using recombinantly expressed FKBP38 and Hsp90 were performed (Fig. 1B). In fact, FKBP38 was found to interact with Hsp90 only in the presence of the CaM-Ca2+ complex, whereas calcium ions alone did not suffice to induce interactions between FKBP38 and Hsp90. These data demonstrate that only the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex interacted with Hsp90. Furthermore, it was analyzed whether FKBP38 is a client substrate for Hsp90 chaperone activity using ATP and geldanamycin in the co-IP experiments. However, neither the addition of 5 μm ATP nor the presence of 50 nm geldanamycin interfered with the interaction of FKBP38 and Hsp90, excluding the possibility that the interaction between FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ and Hsp90 involves the protein folding activity of the chaperone (Fig. 1B). An interaction between Hsp90 and the active site of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex was also tested using the low molecular weight inhibitor FK506. The presence of 5 μm FK506 did not interfere with the formation of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, demonstrating that Hsp90 does not interact with the active site of FKBP38 (Fig. 1B). Then native gel electrophoresis was performed to analyze the migration pattern of FKBP38 and Hsp90 in the presence and absence of each other and CaM using recombinant FKBP38 and purified human Hsp90. The protein migration was analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against Hsp90 and FKBP38, respectively (Fig. 1C). The experiment revealed only a shift in migration of FKBP38 protein in the presence of Hsp90 and CaM-Ca2+, whereas no shift in the FKBP38 migration occurred in the presence of Hsp90 and absence of CaM-Ca2+ (Fig. 1C, right panel). The same pattern was found for Hsp90 (Fig. 1C, left panel), where the two bands of Hsp90, likely representing monomeric and dimeric form, shifted to a band that contains FKBP38 protein as well. Interestingly, the data shows that the monomer/dimer ratio of Hsp90 is changed toward the dimer, suggesting an influence of FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ on the dimerization of Hsp90. The results point to Hsp90 interactions only with the enzymatically active FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. The TPR Domain of FKBP38 Interacts with the C90 Domain of Hsp90—Except for FKBP38, human TPR-containing FKBPs interact with Hsp90 by recruiting its C90 domain. A cofactor, such as CaM-Ca2+, is not required for this interaction. In contrast, our results show that the interaction of Hsp90 and FKBP38 occurs only in the presence of CaM-Ca2+, introducing the possibility that CaM links FKBP38 and Hsp90, because both proteins interact with CaM-Ca2+ individually. Therefore, we addressed the question whether FKBP38 and Hsp90 interact directly with one another in the ternary complex. Initially, we investigated whether Hsp90 and FKBP38 compete for CaM-Ca2+ binding by applying recombinant FKBP38 to CaM-Sepharose in the presence and absence of recombinant Hsp90 (Fig. 2A). The addition of Hsp90 did not interfere with the formation of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, indicating that these two proteins do not compete for the same interaction site of CaM-Ca2+. Next we performed fluorescence spectroscopy measurements, assaying the CaM-Ca2+ complexes of recombinant FKBP38 and Hsp90 to identify spectral changes caused by direct interaction between FKBP38 and Hsp90 upon complex formation (Fig. 2B). The fluorescence spectrum of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex showed a maximum at 330 nm. The spectrum of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, however, had its maximum at 321 nm in the absence of Hsp90, indicating that the four tryptophan residues in FKBP38 were not solvent-accessible, whereas the spectrum of Hsp90 pointed to positions for the tryptophan side chains on the protein surface as indicated by the maximum at 338 nm. The composite spectrum of the individual spectra of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex and Hsp90 showed a maximum at 324 nm. Therefore, the fluorescence of the three proteins is red-shifted by 6 nm upon formation of the ternary complex. In addition, the signal amplitude was reduced by 23%. It is noteworthy that the interactions of both proteins with CaM-Ca2+ induces change in the protein fluorescence of FKBP38 and Hsp90 itself, whereby the maxima in the spectra experienced a blue shift of 2 and 3 nm, respectively, and the fluorescence signal of both complexes was increased by about 10% compared with the composite spectra of the individual proteins (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). In contrast to FKBP38, no major differences between the fluorescence spectrum of FKBP12 in the presence of Hsp90-CaM-Ca2+ and the combination of spectra of the separated proteins were observed (supplemental Fig. 1). The maximum of the spectrum of FKBP52 in complex with Hsp90, however, is reduced by 30% and red-shifted by 9 nm to longer wavelengths (supplemental Fig. 2). The Hsp90 concentration-dependent change in the fluorescence signal of FKBP38 and Hsp90 indicating the formation of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex was monitored at 325 nm (Fig. 2C). The resulting curve indicates that the observed spectral shift depends on the applied amount of Hsp90 protein. The data indicate an EC50 value of about 140 nm for interaction between FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ and Hsp90. Previously we observed that the interaction of FKBP38 and the CaM-Ca2+ complex caused shifts in the near-UV CD spectrum, thus pointing to environmental changes of aromatic side chains in the FKBP38 protein, likely caused by alterations in the tertiary structure of FKBP38 (3Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we were interested in analyzing whether the formation of Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ alters the near-UV CD spectrum of the proteins and perhaps reverses the effect of CaM binding to FKBP38. When comparing the near-UV CD spectra of FKBP38 and CaM measured in tandem silica cells in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 either separated or mixed significant spectral changes occur in the range between 268 and 280 nm (supplemental Fig. 5). Thereby the spectral contributions of FKBP38 dominate the composite spectrum in the indicated range of wavelength, which makes it possible to correlate differences between both spectra with spatial re-positioning in the aromatic side chains of FKBP38. Fortunately, the near-UV CD spectrum of Hsp90 also exhibits amplitudes that are 10-fold smaller compared with the spectrum of FKBP38 at a molar ratio of 1:1, again making a correlation between spectral shifts and positional changes of side chains of aromatic FKBP38 residues possible (Fig. 2D). The comparison of the near-UV CD spectrum of Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ and the combined spectrum of the individual proteins in the presence of CaM-Ca2+, however, reveals no major differences between the spectra, indicating the absence of spatial re-positioning in the aromatic side chains of FKBP38 when the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex is formed (Fig. 2F). To determine whether the C90 domain of Hsp90 is sufficient to interact with FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+, a binding assay was performed using matrix-bound recombinant C90-GST fusion protein. FKBP38 interacted with the C90 domain of Hsp90 in a CaM-Ca2+-dependent fashion that was not affected by FK506 (Fig. 2E), but CaM-Ca2+ alone did not interact with the matrix-bound C90-GST protein (data not shown). These data exclude the possibility of FKBP38 and Hsp90 being linked by CaM-Ca2+ and imply direct interactions between FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ and the C90 domain of Hsp90 in the ternary complex. Furthermore, the addition of soluble C90 protein reduced the portion of matrix-bound FKBP38, likely competing with C90-GST at the glutathione-Sepharose. The FKBP38D variant containing the amino acids that assemble the FKBP domain of FKBP38 showed no interaction with C90-GST protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose, suggesting that the C-terminal TPR domain of FKBP38 is required for interactions with Hsp90. Taken together, the formation of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex is mediated by the C90 domain of Hsp90 and the TPR domain of FKBP38, including direct interactions between both proteins. Hsp90 Binding Controls the Active Site of FKBP38—To examine functional consequences associated with the formation of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, the PPIase activity of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex was assayed in the presence of Hsp90. Fig. 3A shows the decrease of the CaM-Ca2+-regulated PPIase activity of FKBP38 at increasing Hsp90 concentrations. As shown in co-IP experiments, the active site-blocking ligand FK506 did not interfere with the formation of the ternary complex. The results point to a role for Hsp90 as a negative regulator of the biological activity of FKBP38 because Hsp90 fully inhibits the PPIase activity of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. Interestingly, the C90 domain did not suffice to inhibit the catalytic activity of FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ (Fig. 3A). To analyze the effect of Hsp90-mediated FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ inhibition on the interaction of the active site of FKBP38 with Bcl-2, we performed native gel analysis with recombinant proteins analyzed by Western blot using anti-Bcl-2 antibodies (Fig. 3B). The Bcl-2 protein migrates in two bands that likely represent Bcl-2 monomers and dimers. FKBP38 only interacts with Bcl-2 in the presence of CaM-Ca2+, as described previously (3Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The formation of Bcl-2-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complexes changes the migration of Bcl-2 in the native gel. In the presence of Hsp90, however, the Bcl-2 migration is shifted back to a pattern observed for Bcl-2 in the absence of FKBP38. These results show that Hsp90 prevents interactions of FKBP38 and Bcl-2 and thus interferes with the formation of the Bcl-2-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. To test the effect of only the C90 domain on FKBP38 interactions with Bcl-2, we performed a Bcl-2 binding assay using recombinant FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ applied to MBP-Bcl-2 bound to maltose-Sepharose in the presence of different concentrations of recombinant Hsp90 C90 domain protein (Fig. 3C). FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ bound to the Sepharose when MBP-Bcl-2 was present, whereas the C90 protein reduced the amount of Bcl-2-bound FKBP38 protein in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, the interaction between FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ and the protein substrate Bcl-2 is inhibited by the C90 domain. Hsp90 not only inhibits the enzymatic activity of FKBP38, it also prevents the interaction of FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ with Bcl-2, suggesting a role for Hsp90 as the negative FKBP38 regulator in the control of neuronal apoptosis. To analyze further the influence of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex formation on the accessibility of the active site cleft of FKBP38, we performed a competition experiment using FKBP12 and FKBP38 as described previously (3Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The PPIase activity of FKBP12 is inhibited by FK506 and because of competition with the active site of FKBP38 recovered in the presence of FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ (Fig. 3D). The addition of Hsp90 reduced the measured FKBP12 activity, pointing to a diminished accessibility of the FKBP38 active site for FK506 in the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. According to the direct PPIase measurements (Fig. 3A), the C90 domain of Hsp90 caused no reduction in the FK506 competition between the active sites of FKBP38 and FKBP12 (Fig. 3D). Therefore, full-length Hsp90 conceals the active site of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex and thus prevents interactions with its substrates and inhibitors. The CaM-Ca2+-dependent FKBP38 interacts with Hsp90, as shown by immunoprecipitation experiments, native gels, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Thereby the TPR domain of FKBP38 mediates the interaction to Hsp90 (Fig. 2E). Similar interactions to Hsp90 have been shown between the TPR domains of other human immunophilins, such as FKBP51, FKBP52, Cyp40, and XAP2 (13Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C.

The TPR domain of FKBP38 therefore shares the property of Hsp90 binding with the TPR domains of other PPIases. However, the interaction between the TPR domain of FKBP38 and Hsp90 differs from previously described interactions between immunophilins and Hsp90 in a strict dependence on the presence of CaM-Ca2+. Our results demonstrate that FKBP38 interacts only with Hsp90, when the catalytically active FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex is preformed (Fig. 1). These data imply that the formation of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex increases the affinity of the TPR domain for Hsp90 leading to a ternary Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. Thus, the TPR domain of FKBP38 undergoes structural changes upon formation of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. The assembly of Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ via CaM-Ca2+ can be excluded, because the C90 domain of Hsp90 that cannot interact individually with CaM-Ca2+ binds also FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ exclusively (Fig. 2E). To our knowledge, FKBP38 is the first example of a TPR-containing protein that requires a cofactor-dependent activation for interaction with Hsp90. Besides Hsp90 interaction, FKBP38 has more characteristic properties that differ greatly between the free form of the protein and its complex with CaM-Ca2+, such as PPIase activity, binding of active site-directed ligands, and interaction with Bcl-2 (3Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, FKBP38 undergoes changes in its tertiary structure upon CaM-Ca2+ binding, which may involve restructuring events in the TPR domain of FKBP38 stabilizing a conformation that contributes to the assembly of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. Interestingly, the TPR domain of the Hsp90 interaction partner Cyp40 has been shown to undergo conformational dynamics in the free form of the protein (45Taylor P. Dornan J. Carrello A. Minchin R.F. Ratajczak T. Walkinshaw M.D. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 431-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In contrast to FKBP38, Cyp40 does not require binding to CaM-Ca2+ in order to interact with Hsp90. Furthermore, Hsp90 binding was shown to induce re-folding events in the TPR domain of protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), and this TPR domain exhibits a conformational diversity even in complex with Hsp90 (46Cliff M.J. Williams M.A. Brooke-Smith J. Barford D. Ladbury J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 717-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 47Cliff M.J. Harris R. Barford D. Ladbury J.E. Williams M.A. Structure (Lond.). 2006; 14: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The TPR domain of FKBP38, however, requires interactions with CaM-Ca2+ to adopt a fold that exhibits an interaction site for Hsp90. The conformational re-arrangements of the FKBP38 TPR domain extend our knowledge of structural dynamics in TPR domain proteins. PPIase measurements and binding assays revealed that the C-terminal domain of Hsp90 is sufficient for the formation of the ternary complex. The presence of ATP and the ATPase inhibitor geldanamycin does not influence the interaction of Hsp90 with the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, indicating that only the C-terminal domain of Hsp90 is involved in FKBP38 binding (Fig. 1B). Therefore, our data point to binding of the FKBP38 TPR domain to the C90 domain of Hsp90, which corresponds to other immunophilin-Hsp90 interactions (13Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 17Kazlauskas A. Poellinger L. Pongratz I. J. Biol.

In contrast to Hsp90 interactions with other TPR-containing PPIases, the formation of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex participates in the regulation of the active site of FKBP38. Activity measurements and the inhibitor competition assay show that the affinity of FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ for the low molecular weight ligand is diminished in the presence of Hsp90, whereas the C90 domain of Hsp90 does not inhibit the catalytic activity of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex. However, the binding of the C90 domain to FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ prevents the interaction with Bcl-2 (Fig. 3C). Thus, Hsp90 masks the catalytic cleft of the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, as shown by the FK506 competition experiment monitoring FKBP12 activity (Fig. 3D). On the other hand the interaction between the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex and Hsp90 may also influence Hsp90 by shifting the ratio between monomer and dimer toward the Hsp90 dimer (Fig. 1C). After formation of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, FKBP38 has a similar structural topology compared with the FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex, as shown by the highly structured near-UV CD spectra of both complexes. These results imply that Hsp90 binding does not reverse structural re-arrangement in FKBP38 leading to PPIase activity of FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+. In the ternary complex Hsp90 and FKBP38 do not compete for CaM-Ca2+ interaction, although FKBP38 and Hsp90 bind the CaM-Ca2+ complex separately (3Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9604-9610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Hsp90 was found to interact with CaM-Ca2+-dependent enzymes, such as the protein phosphatase calcineurin and the NOS, and to regulate their activity (30Song Y. Zweier J.L. Xia Y. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 31Takahashi S. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 2004; 65: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The binding of Hsp90 to FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ inhibits not only its enzymatic activity, but also interactions with Bcl-2 (Fig. 3). This observation is not unexpected because of the following: (i) Bcl-2 binds to the active site of FKBP38 and (ii) the active site-directed inhibition of FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ prevents interactions between Bcl-2 and the immunophilin (3Edlich F. Weiwad M. Erdmann F. Fanghanel J. Jarczowski F. Rahfeld J.U. Fischer G. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2688-2699Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, the Hsp90-mediated prevention of interactions between FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ and Bcl-2 is similar to the effect recently observed for the hepatitis C virus NS5A protein that interacts with FKBP38 also preventing Bcl-2-FKBP38 interactions (7Wang J.D.

However, elevated Hsp90 and Bcl-2 levels increase individually the Bcl-2 population that escapes the regulation by FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ (Fig. 4). Interestingly, some studies provided evidence that Hsp90 and Bcl-2 expression can be up-regulated in concert (42Dias S. Shmelkov S.V. Lam G. Rafii S. Blood. 2002; 99: 2532-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 43Guo Z. Lee J. Lane M. Mattson M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hsp90 was already shown to participate in the regulation of apoptosis that can be linked to Bcl-2-dependent pathways, and the co-administration of apoptotic stimuli and Hsp90 inhibitors potentiates the level of apoptosis compared with results in the absence of Hsp90 inhibitors (40Vanden Berghe T.

The formation of the Hsp90-FKBP38-CaM-Ca2+ complex restores Bcl-2 binding capacity for its cellular interaction partners and thus prevents apoptosis of neuronal cells (Fig. 4). Hsp90 plays a similar role as active site-directed ligands of FKBP38 in this regulatory pathway providing the basis of a physiological control of FKBP38 activity.

Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 6956-6961Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). hENT3 mediates nucleoside transport across lysosomal membranes, whereas the more distantly related hENT4, also known as the plasma membrane monoamine transporter, transports monoamine neurotransmitters and adenosine (at acidic pH) in brain and heart tissue (8Barnes K.

Thedinga K.H. Custers A.F. Hoos B. Van Belle H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 172: 273-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The primary mechanism by which the protective effects of adenosine are terminated is by its reuptake through ENTs that are present in high abundance on vascular endothelial cells (13Jennings L.L. Cass C.E. Ritzel M.W.L. Yao S.Y.M. Young J.D. Griffiths M. Baldwin S.A. Drug Dev. Res. 1998; 45: 277-287Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A group of highly potent inhibitors of nucleoside transport, draflazine, soluflazine, dilazep, dipyridamole, and NBMPR, block ENT-mediated adenosine uptake and thus potentiate protective effects of adenosine (14Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). These inhibitors, with the exceptions of draflazine and soluflazine, do not share any structural similarities with each other (Fig. 1A) and inhibit hENT1- and hENT2-mediated nucleoside transport, respectively, at nanomolar and micromolar concentrations.The mechanisms of inhibition of dipyridamole, dilazep, NBMPR, and draflazine have been addressed in several studies. Dipyridamole inhibits mammalian es transporters competitively when present at nanomolar concentrations, whereas dilazep, which has two ionizable groups with pKa values of ∼5 and 8, inhibits either allosterically or competitively depending on the pH (12Ijzerman A.P.

More recently, residue 33, predicted to lie at the extracellular end of TM 1 of hENT1 and hENT2, was shown to be a functionally important component of the binding sites for dilazep, dipyridamole, and nucleosides for both transporters (22Visser F.

Ile-429 in TM 11 of Caenorhabditis elegans ENT1 (CeENT1) plays a major role in dipyridamole interactions, whereas its counterpart in hENT1 (Leu-442) influences dipyridamole sensitivity when Met-33 is first mutated to Ile (21Visser F. Baldwin S.A. Isaac R.E. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11025-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Depending on experimental conditions, NBMPR binding has been shown to be either competitive or allosterically linked to the binding site for nucleoside permeants (15Koren R. Cass C.E. Paterson A.R.

Molecular determinants of binding of draflazine, which is a mixed type inhibitor of both nucleoside transport and NBMPR binding, and soluflazine to hENT1 have not yet been identified (12Ijzerman A.P.

The random mutagenesis and functional complementation screening methods that were previously employed in the identification of Met-33 and Leu-442 of hENT1 (21Visser F. Baldwin S.A. Isaac R.E. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11025-11034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) identified Phe-334 and Asn-338 of hENT1 as previously unrecognized residues involved in inhibitor binding. Mutants, largely based on their homologies with other ENT family members, were generated at each residue and tested for adenosine transport activities and inhibitor sensitivities by functional expression in yeast. The cell-surface abundance of each mutant was quantitatively determined using FTH-SAENTA, a novel membrane-impermeable NBMPR analog. Modeling of the TM 8 region as an α-helix was performed to assess the possibility that the identified residues line the permeant translocation pathway and/or inhibitor binding site(s). The results of this study suggest that residues in question are critical molecular determinants of coronary vasodilator binding, rates of catalytic turnover, and protein folding.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Media—KY114 (MATα, gal, ura3-52, trp1, lys2, ade2, hisd2000) was the parental yeast strain used to generate KTK, which produces recombinant herpes simplex thymidine kinase (30Hogue D.L. Ellison M.J. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9801-9808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and fui1::TRP1, which contains a disruption in the gene encoding the endogenous uridine permease (FUI1) (31Vickers M.F. Yao S.Y. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25931-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Other strains were generated by transformation of the yeast/Escherichia coli shuttle vector pYPGE15 (containing the constitutive phosphoglycerate kinase promoter) (32Brunelli J.P. Pall M.L. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1309-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) into KTK and fui1::TRP1 using a standard lithium acetate method (33Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were maintained in complete minimal medium (CMM) containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), amino acids (as required to maintain auxotrophic selection), and 2% glucose (CMM/GLU). Agar plates contained CMM with various supplements and 2% agar (Difco). Plasmids were propagated in E. coli strain TOP10F′ (Invitrogen) maintained in Luria broth with ampicillin (100 μg/ml).Plasmid Construction and Random Mutagenesis—The hENT1 reading frame was subcloned into pYPGE15 to generate pYPhENT1 as described previously (23Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The rENT1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using the primers (restriction sites underlined) XbaIrENT1 (5′-CCC TCT AGA ATG ACA ACC AGT CAC CAG-3′) and KpnIrENT1 (5′-CCC GGT ACC TCA CAC AAG TGC CCT TAA-3′) and inserted into pYPGE15 to generate pYPrENT1. Random mutagenesis of pYPhENT1 was performed by propagating the plasmid in the XL-1 RED mutator strain of E. coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 30–45 generations to obtain ∼1 mutation per cDNA, according to the procedure of Greener et al. (34Greener A. Callahan M. Jerpseth B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 375-385PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations resulting in various amino acid changes of the identified residues were generated using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).Phenotypic Complementation and Screening of Mutants—The complementation assay was based on the ability of recombinant hENT1 produced in yeast to salvage exogenously supplied thymidine under conditions of dTMP starvation (35Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, KTK cells transformed with pYPhENT1 using a lithium acetate procedure (33Gietz D. St Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2877) Google Scholar) were plated directly onto CMM/GLU plates containing methotrexate (MTX) at 50 μg/ml and sulfanilamide (SAA) at 6 mg/ml (CMM/GLU/MTX/SAA) at a pH of 7.0. Colonies formed with an efficiency of ∼105 transformants/μg DNA after incubation at 30 °C for 3.5 days in the presence of 10 μm thymidine, and complementation was prevented when either 100 μm dipyridamole or 1 μm draflazine was also present. Mutated pYPhENT1 (20 μg) was transformed into KTK cells, which were then plated onto CMM/GLU/MTX/SAA with 10 μm thymidine and either 100 μm dipyridamole or 1 μm draflazine and incubated at 30 °C for 3.5 days. Colonies with apparent resistance to dipyridamole inhibition of complementation were isolated, grown in 1 ml of liquid CMM/GLU for 2 days, and restreaked onto CMM/GLU/MTX/SAA plates with 10 μm thymidine and either 100 μm dipyridamole, 10 μm dilazep, or 1 μm draflazine. The mutant hENT1 cDNAs were amplified from the yeast colonies by PCR, subcloned back into nonmutated pYPGE15, and sequenced.Adenosine Transport in S. cerevisiae—Yeast cells containing pYPhENT1, pYPrENT1, or one of the various mutant transporters were grown in CMM/GLU media to an A600 = 0.5–1.2, washed twice in fresh medium, and resuspended to A600 = 4.0. Transport assays were performed at room temperature and at pH 7.4. Unlabeled adenosine, dipyridamole, dilazep, and NBMPR were obtained from Sigma, and [3H]adenosine was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Draflazine and soluflazine were kind gifts from the Janssen Research Foundation, Beerse, Belgium. The transport assays were performed in 96-well plates as described previously (36Zhang J. Visser F. Vickers M.F. Lang T. Robins M.J. Nielsen L.P. Nowak I. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 37Vickers M.F. Zhang J.

Briefly, 50-μl portions of yeast suspensions were added to 50-μl portions of 2× concentrated [3H]adenosine in 96-well microtiter plates. Because initial rates of adenosine transport into yeast cells producing recombinant ENTs persist for intervals of 60 min (22Visser F. Zhang J. Raborn R.T. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), single time points of 10 min were used to estimate initial rates of transport. Yeast cells were collected on filter mats using a Micro96 Cell Harvester (Skatron Instruments, Lier, Norway) and rapidly washed with deionized water. The individual filter circles corresponding to wells of the microtiter plates were removed from filter mats with forceps and transferred to vials for quantification of radioactivity by scintillation counting. For inhibitor concentration-effect relationships, the yeast suspensions were first incubated for 15–30 min with the inhibitor to allow equilibration of the inhibitor with its binding sites before the addition of radiolabeled permeant as described previously (23Visser F. Vickers M.F. Ng A.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 395-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The sulfhydryl modification experiments were performed essentially as described previously (38Zhang J. Tackaberry T. Ritzel M.W. Raborn T. Barron G. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 389-398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cells producing hENT1, F334C, or N338C were incubated with 25 mm methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA), a specific and highly reactive membrane-permeable probe for free sulfhydryl groups. The cells were rapidly washed three times with fresh media, resuspended to A600 = 4.0, and subjected to adenosine transport assays.Characterization of S. cerevisiae Membranes Containing Mutant hENT1 Proteins—Membranes were prepared from yeast cells harboring pYPhENT1 or mutants derived from this plasmid as described previously (35Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of protease inhibitors (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, and 1,10-phenanthroline) and protease inhibitor mixture for use with fungal and yeast extracts (Sigma). Their total protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). To quantify the abundance of hENT1 proteins by immunoblotting, samples were resolved by SDS, 12% (w/v) PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked by incubation with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk powder, and then incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight (1 μg/ml affinity-purified rabbit antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 254–272 of hENT1). Following incubation with a horseradish peroxidase conjugate of goat anti-rabbit IgG (1/50,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), antigens were visualized using Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Staining intensities were quantified using a Bio-Rad Fluor-S gel documentation system and multianalyst software (Bio-Rad).Intact yeast cells and total membrane fractions prepared as described above were assayed for their ability to bind [3H]NBMPR (Moravek, Brea, CA) using a filtration assay described previously (35Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, two to four samples of cells (106) or membranes (25 μg of protein) were incubated for 45 min with the desired concentrations of [3H]NBMPR (0.01–25 nm) alone or in the presence of either 0.5 μm unlabeled NBMPR (to quantify total specifically bound NBMPR) or FTH-SAENTA, a tight binding impermeant inhibitor of hENT1 that is structurally related to NBMPR (to quantify cell-surface specifically bound NBMPR). All experiments were conducted at 20 °C in binding buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). The cells or membranes were then collected on Whatman GF/B filters (Whatman) under vacuum and washed three times with cold binding buffer before quantification of radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the values obtained with either excess NBMPR or FTH-SAENTA from total values. The inhibition of [3H]NBMPR binding by dilazep or dipyridamole was measured by incubating the assay mixtures for 30 min with the desired concentrations of dilazep or dipyridamole in the presence of [3H]NBMPR. The concentrations that achieved 50% inhibition (IC50 values) were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism version 4.0). Apparent inhibition constants (Ki values) were calculated by the method of Cheng and Prusoff (39Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12181) Google Scholar) from the observed IC50 values.RESULTSRandom Mutagenesis and Screening—Growth of yeast cells in the presence of methotrexate and sulfanilamide results in the depletion of TTP pools and growth arrest (40Barclay B.J. Kunz B.A. Little J.G. Haynes R.H. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 172-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although yeast cells lack endogenous thymidine transport systems (41Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 11: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), production of recombinant hENT1 allows for salvage from the external medium of thymidine, which is then phosphorylated to TMP by recombinant herpes simplex thymidine kinase in KTK yeast cells (35Vickers M.F. Mani R.S. Sundaram M. Hogue D.L. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Cass C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When an inhibitor of hENT1 is added, thymidine salvage is blocked, providing a functional complementation assay for hENT1 mutants with reduced affinities for inhibitors. The yeast expression plasmid pYPhENT1 was randomly mutated by propagation in the E. coli mutator strain XL-1 RED and transformed into KTK yeast under complementation conditions in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of dipyridamole or draflazine. Soluflazine was not tested because high concentrations were required to inhibit complementation, and there were insufficient quantities available for screening. All of the clones capable of growth in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of dipyridamole contained mutations at Met-33, with the exception of two, which contained mutations resulting in the conversion of Phe at position 334 to Ser (F334S). All of the clones capable of growth in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of draflazine were identical and contained mutations that converted Asn at residue 338 to Ser (N338S). Both Phe-334 and Asn-338 are predicted to reside in TM 8 of hENT1 (Fig. 1B) (3Sundaram M. Yao S.Y. Ingram J.C. Berry Z.A. Abidi F. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45270-45275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Multiple Sequence Alignments of TM 8—To assess the level of conservation of the identified residues, multiple sequence alignments of the TM 8 region from 43 different ENT family members from a variety of different organisms was performed (data not shown). A portion of the multiple sequence alignments containing a few select sequences is presented in Fig. 1C. Phe-334 was conserved in 42% of the sequences analyzed and in 88% of the mammalian and nematode sequences. Many other ENTs from plants and protozoa contain bulky aliphatic side chains at positions corresponding to Phe-334, suggesting that hydrophobic residues are preferred. Asn-338 was conserved in 93% of the sequences analyzed, suggesting that this residue plays an important role in ENT structure and/or function.Effects of Mutations at Phe-334 and Asn-338 in hENT1 on the Concentration Dependence of Adenosine Transport—To determine the functional role of Phe-334 and Asn-338, a series of mutations at each position was generated based, in part, on the identities of corresponding residues in other ENT family members. Adenosine was selected as the test permeant because it is transported by more ENT family members than any other nucleoside and, in mammals, is an important physiologically active molecule whose activity is affected by transport inhibitors (42Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, yeast cells do not possess endogenous adenosine transport systems, do not metabolize extracellular adenosine (43King K. Damaraju V. Vickers M. Yao S. Lang T. Tackaberry T. Mowles D. Ng A. Young J. Cass C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and, when producing recombinant ENTs, display robust initial rates of adenosine uptake for time intervals of ≥60 min (22Visser F. Zhang J. Raborn R.T. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1291-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yeast cells producing recombinant “wild type” or mutated hENT1 were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of [3H]adenosine for 10 min in the absence (total uptake) or presence (background) of 10 mm uridine. The apparent Km and Vmax values and the Vmax:Km ratios (transport efficiencies) are presented in Table 1. hENT1 displayed apparent Km and Vmax values of 18.6 ± 2.3 μm and 1280 ± 30 pmol/mg/min, respectively, indicating that recombinant hENT1 displayed a similar affinity for adenosine when produced in yeast as has been observed in transfected mammalian cells (44Ward J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2078702698,"We reported here an efficient and generally applicable genomic analysis that uses transcriptional profiling to identify candidate substrates of regulatory enzymes, such as kinases and ubiquitin ligases. We applied this strategy to the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that controls sister chromatid separation and exit from mitosis. We found that a microtubule-associated protein, CKAP2, is a substrate of APC/C and demonstrated that ubiquitination and degradation of CKAP2 in vitro require a KEN-box and is mediated by Cdh1, an activator of APC/C. We showed that the levels of CKAP2 fluctuated across the cell cycle in culture cells, high in mitosis and low during mitotic exit. Overexpression of Cdh1 reduced the levels of CKAP2 in a KEN-box-dependent manner, while knockdown of Cdh1 increased the half-life of CKAP2. CKAP2 associated with centrosomal microtubules in late G2, but only after the separation of the duplicated centrosomes. During mitosis, CKAP2 associated with spindle poles and with spindle microtubules from prophase through anaphase and dis-appeared from microtubules during cytokinesis. The function of CKAP2 during mitosis does not seem essential, as efficient knockdown of CKAP2 neither altered the cell cycle distribution of the cells, nor generated observable mitotic defects. On the other hand, ectopic expression of either the wild-type or a non-degradable CKAP2 led to a mitotic arrest with monopolar spindles containing highly bundled microtubules. We concluded that CKAP2 is a physiological substrate of APC/C during mitotic exit and that a tight regulation of the CKAP2 protein level is critical for the normal mitotic progression. We reported here an efficient and generally applicable genomic analysis that uses transcriptional profiling to identify candidate substrates of regulatory enzymes, such as kinases and ubiquitin ligases. We applied this strategy to the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a ubiquitin ligase that controls sister chromatid separation and exit from mitosis. We found that a microtubule-associated protein, CKAP2, is a substrate of APC/C and demonstrated that ubiquitination and degradation of CKAP2 in vitro require a KEN-box and is mediated by Cdh1, an activator of APC/C. We showed that the levels of CKAP2 fluctuated across the cell cycle in culture cells, high in mitosis and low during mitotic exit. Overexpression of Cdh1 reduced the levels of CKAP2 in a KEN-box-dependent manner, while knockdown of Cdh1 increased the half-life of CKAP2.

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays key regulatory functions in diverse biological processes, ranging from cell cycle control, cell signaling, transcriptional regulation, immune-response to development (1Ciechanover A.

The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) 2The abbreviations used are: APC/C, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; siRNA, small interfering RNA; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; D-box, destruction box; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. is a key ubiquitin ligase that controls several transitions in the cell cycle (3Harper J.W.

APC/C-dependent degradation of cyclin A allows cells to progress from prophase to metaphase and the degradation of securin by the APC/C triggers the chromosome separation and anaphase onset. Late in anaphase, the destruction of cyclin B1 leads to the inactivation of the Cdk1 kinase activity and exit from mitosis. The APC/C also recognizes and degrades anillin, TPX2, Aurora A, Aurora B, and Plk1 during cytokinesis, thereby allowing an ordered transition into G1 (6Stewart S. Fang G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8730-8735Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Stewart S. Fang G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10516-10527Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 8Zhao W.M. Fang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33516-33524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, the APC/C path-way has been linked to the control of DNA replication, and components of the prereplication complexes, such as Cdc6 and Cdt1, and an inhibitor of DNA replication, geminin, have all been shown as substrates of the APC/C (9Petersen B.O. Wagener C. Marinoni F. Kramer E.R. Melixetian M. Denchi E.L. Gieffers C. Matteucci C. Peters J.M. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2330-2343Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 10Li A. Blow J.J.

Thus, APC/C-mediated proteolysis couples the S phase with the completion of mitosis and contributes to mechanisms ensuring that the genome is replicated only once per cell cycle. The activity of the APC/C is tightly regulated in the cell cycle: The APC/C becomes active from prometaphase until the end of G1. One of the main regulatory mechanisms for the APC/C is through its association with accessory-activating factors, Cdc20/fizzy and Cdh1/fizzy-related. Both Cdc20 and Cdh1 directly bind to and activate the APC/C ligase. Cdc20 associates with the APC/C from prometaphase to anaphase, responsible for the degradation of cyclin A, cyclin B, and securin, whereas Cdh1 maintains the activity of the APC/C from late anaphase through G1, targeting multiple substrates for degradation (12Kramer E.R. Gieffers C. Holzl G. Hengstschlager M. Peters J.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1207-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of the APC/C by mitotic kinases, such as Plk1, also contributes to its mitotic activation (5Peters J.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). On the other hand, negative regulation of the APC/C by inhibitory proteins, such as Emi1, BubR1, and Mad2, determines the precise temporal activity of the APC/C during mitosis (14Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 15Fang G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 16Tang Z.

Cell. 2001; 105: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The APC/C recognizes two motifs in its substrates: the destruction box (D-box; RXXL where X is any amino acid) and the KEN-box (19Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Although the exact biochemical mechanism for substrate recognition remains to be characterized, it has been reported that APC/C-Cdc20 recognizes D-box-containing substrates and that APC/C-Cdh1 recognizes both D-box and KEN-box-containing substrates (19Pfleger C.M. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A key question in understanding the function of the APC/C is to identify its substrates and to investigate their physiological function and the biological importance of their degradation. To develop a general approach for identification of APC/C substrates, we analyzed the transcriptional profiles of the known APC/C substrates involved in the cell cycle regulation and found that these substrates had expression profiles that co-varied with those of the known cell cycle regulators in tumor tissues, indicating that these substrates are indeed components of the cell cycle machinery whose expression is under selective pressures for co-variation during tumorigenesis. In addition, for the substrates that function in mitosis and cytokinesis, we found that the majority of them were transcriptionally induced in G2 or in mitosis. Thus, we searched for new candidate mitotic APC/C substrates whose expression co-varied with those of known cell cycle regulators in tumor tissues and whose expression was induced in G2/M in the cell cycle. Physiological substrates were then identified from this list of candidate mitotic regulators using an in vitro ubiquitination assay. In principle, this strategy is generally applicable to the identification of substrates for regulatory enzymes, such as ubiquitin ligases and kinases. Using this method, we have identified 9 new substrates of the APC/C and reported here the characterization of one of the substrates, CKAP2. CKAP2 was initially reported as a cytoskeleton-associated protein that is up-regulated in human gastric adenocarcinomas as well as in various tumor-derived cell lines (21Maouche-Chretien L. Deleu N.

Kim Y.I. Park K.H. Choi J. Ahn G. Park J. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 129: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CKAP2 is a p53 target gene that has been implicated in cell proliferation, genomic stability, and apoptosis, although the mechanism of its function remains largely unknown (23Jin Y. Murakumo Y. Ueno K. Hashimoto M. Watanabe T. Shimoyama Y. Ichihara M. Takahashi M. Cancer Sci. 2004; 95: 815-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Tsuchihara K. Lapin V. Bakal C. Okada H. Brown L. Hirota-Tsuchihara M. Zaugg K. Ho A. Itie-Youten A. Harris-Brandts M. Rottapel R. Richardson C.D. Benchimol S. Mak T.W.

Commun. 2006; 348: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We showed that CKAP2 is a substrate of the APC/C-Cdh1, both in vitro and in vivo. The levels of CKAP2 fluctuated in the cell cycle, high in mitosis and low as cells exit into G1. Indeed, CKAP2 was degraded during mitotic exit in vivo in a Cdh1-dependent manner, as knockdown of Cdh1 stabilized the CKAP2 protein and increased its half-life. The APC/C-Cdh1 recognized a KEN-box in the N-terminal region of CKAP2, and mutations in this KEN-box abolished ubiquitination in vitro and stabilized the mutant protein in vivo. Furthermore, ectopic expression of CKAP2, either the wild-type or the mutant protein, led to a mitotic arrest with monopolar spindles containing highly bundled microtubules, indicating that the regulation of the CKAP2 protein levels is essential for normal mitotic progression. We concluded that CKAP2 is a physiological substrate of the APC/C whose mitotic degradation regulates its activity, and hence mitotic progression. A Genomic Approach to Identify Substrates of the APC/C—To identify candidate G2/M-induced APC/C substrates with expression patterns co-varying with those of known cell cycle regulators in tumor tissues, we used published microarray data-bases. Whitfield et al. (26Whitfield M.L. Sherlock G. Saldanha A.J. Murray J.I. Ball C.A. Alexander K.E. Matese J.C. Perou C.M. Hurt M.M. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1977-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) performed genome-wide microarray analysis in HeLa cells across the cell cycle and identified 566 genes transcriptionally induced in G2 or in mitosis. Segal et al. (27Segal E. Friedman N. Koller D. Regev A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) analyzed co-expression profile of human genes among 1975 published microarrays derived from 22 different types of tumors. Based on statistic analyses of co-expression profiles, they organized human genes into different functional modules, each of which corresponds to a set of genes that act in concert to carry out a specific physiological function. Out of 577 functional modules identified, two modules function in the cell cycle regulation and consist of genes that co-vary (co-upregulate or co-downregulate) with known cell cycle regulators (27Segal E. Friedman N. Koller D. Regev A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed the 566 G2/M-induced genes from Whitfield study (26Whitfield M.L. Sherlock G. Saldanha A.J. Murray J.I. Ball C.A. Alexander K.E. Matese J.C. Perou C.M. Hurt M.M. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1977-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) for their co-variation with cell cycle genes identified by Segal et al. (27Segal E. Friedman N. Koller D. Regev A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). This allowed us to generate a candidate list of APC/C substrates. The full-length clones for these candidate genes were then purchased from Open Biosystems or requested from individual labs. The gene products were translated in vitro in reticulocyte lysates and assayed for ubiquitination by the APC/C-Cdh1 (8Zhao W.M. Fang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33516-33524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). A detailed list of candidate genes will be reported in a separate study. We focus on the characterization of CKAP2 in this article. Plasmids and Antibodies—Human CKAP2 gene, a gift from Dr. Joobae Park (Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Korea), was subcloned into pCS2-FA and pCS2-eGFP-FA vectors. KEN-box mutation in CKAP2 was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Histagged CKAP2 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1-404) was expressed in Escherichia coli, purified by nickel agarose under denaturing conditions, and used to immunize rabbits for production of antiserum. Anti-CKAP2 antibodies were subsequently purified against the antigen. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assays—Interphase and mitotic extracts were made from Xenopus eggs as described previously (14Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1871-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Interphase extracts from Xenopus eggs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Cdc27 antibody-protein A beads for 2 h at 4 °C to purify interphase APC/C (iAPC/C) (8Zhao W.M. Fang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33516-33524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The iAPC/C beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times in the XB buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH7.8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 50 mm sucrose) containing 500 mm KCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and two times in the XB buffer. Purified iAPC/C beads were then incubated with in vitro translated Cdh1 or Cdc20 for 1 h at 25 °C and then washed twice with the XB buffer. Ubiquitination reactions were initiated by mixing 35S-labeled substrate with E1 (50 μg/ml), E2 (50 μg/ml), ubiquitin (1.25 mg/ml), ubiquitin aldehyde (1 μm), and an energy regeneration mix (8Zhao W.M. Fang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33516-33524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Reactions were preformed at 25 °C and stopped at various times by addition of the SDS sample buffer. Samples from each time point were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Phosphorimager. In Vitro Degradation Assays—Interphase or mitotic Xenopus egg extracts, with or without prior incubation of in vitro translated Cdh1, were incubated with 35S-labeled substrates in the presence of ubiquitin (1.25 mg/ml), ubiquitin aldehyde (1 μm), and an energy regeneration mix at 30 °C, as described previously (13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Samples from each time point were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Phosphorimager. Cell Culture, siRNAs, and Transfection—HeLa S3 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and antibiotics. To determine the levels of the CKAP2 protein across the cell cycle, cells were synchronized either at the G1/S boundary by a double thymidine treatment or at prometaphase by a thymidine-nocodazole treatment (13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon, Inc. Sequences targeted to CKAP2 were (A) 5′-GGATATGTCTTGCACTTATTT-3′, (B) 5′-GGACTACCATGGCAGAAGATT-3′, and (C) 5′-GAGGACAAGTTGCTTAATTTT-3′. siRNA against Cdh1 was 5′-GCAACGATGTGTCTCCCTATT-3′ and the control siRNA (siGL2) was 5′-CGTACGCGGAATACTTCGATT-3′. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against Cdh1 was synthesized by in vitro transcription with the following sequence: 5′-GGATTAACGAGAATGAGAAGT-3′. Control shRNA against GFP was 5′-GCAAGCTGACCCTGAAGTTC-3′. siRNAs were transfected into HeLa cells using DharmaFect 1 (Dharmacon, Inc.). For CKAP2, all three siRNAs gave similar degrees of knockdown and all three gave identical phenotypes, confirming the specificity of the knockdown. DNA transfection was performed using Effectene (Qiagen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as instructed by the manufacturers. In experiments with ectopic expression of CKAP2 and its KEN mutant, the levels of expressed proteins was about 15 folds compared with that of the endogenous CKAP2 protein. To determine the stability of the CKAP2 protein in vivo, transfected cells were arrested at prometaphase by a nocodazole treatment followed by release into fresh media in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (8Zhao W.M. Fang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33516-33524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, lysed, and subjected to Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence—To determine the localization of CKAP2, cells were cultured on poly-lysine-coated glass cover-slips overnight and then fixed with -20 °C methanol. After fixation, cells were permeabilized and blocked with PBS-BT (1× PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin) at the room temperature for 30 min. Coverslips were subsequently incubated in primary and secondary antibodies diluted in PBS-BT. Images were acquired with Openlab 5.0 (Improvision) under a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope using ×100 oil immersion lens. Deconvolved images were obtained using AutoDeblur v9.1 and AutoVisualizer v9.1 (AutoQuant Imaging). A Genomic Approach to Efficiently Identify Mitotic Substrates of APC/C—To identify novel mitotic substrates of APC/C, we selected candidate genes based on their gene expression profiles and then assayed their ability to be ubiquitinated by the APC/C in an in vitro reconstituted APC/C assay. Our genomic analysis was based on two predictions. First, we predicted that substrates that solely function in mitosis or cytokinesis are likely transcriptionally induced in G2 or in mitosis prior to their function. On the other hand, we expected that only a subset, but not all, of these G2/M-induced genes acts in mitosis and cytokinesis and therefore needed another criterion to select functionally important ones. Second, we predicted that expression of genes in the core mitosis and cytokinesis machinery tends to co-vary during tumorigenesis, as these regulators are likely to function as one module during tumor proliferation. It has been reported that 566 genes in human genome are induced in G2 or in mitosis in HeLa cells (26Whitfield M.L. Sherlock G. Saldanha A.J. Murray J.I. Ball C.A. Alexander K.E. Matese J.C. Perou C.M. Hurt M.M. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1977-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Thus, we searched in published microarray databases (27Segal E. Friedman N. Koller D. Regev A. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1090-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 28Rhodes D.R. Yu J. Shanker K. Deshpande N. Varambally R. Ghosh D. Barrette T. Pandey A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 1-6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for novel ones among these 566 genes that transcriptionally co-varied (co-induced or co-repressed) in hundreds of tumor tissues with known cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin A, cyclin B, Plk1, Aurora A, Aurora B, and Cdc20. From these analyses, we generated a list of G2/M-induced genes (the candidate list) whose expression co-varied with those of known cell cycle regulators across hundreds of tumor tissues. Next, we determined whether this list enriched known mitotic substrates of the APC/C. We analyzed 16 known substrates of the APC/C that have been characterized at the beginning of this study. These substrates included cyclin A, cyclin B, Plk1, Aurora A, Aurora B, Nek2, Cdc20, UbcH10, securin, GTSE1, anillin, TPX2, Cdc6, geminin, ribonucleotide reductase M2, and SnoN (3Harper J.W.

Interestingly, all 12 genes were transcriptionally induced in G2 or in mitosis (26Whitfield M.L. Sherlock G. Saldanha A.J. Murray J.I. Ball C.A. Alexander K.E. Matese J.C. Perou C.M. Hurt M.M.

The remaining three, Cdc6, geminin, and ribonucleotide reductase M2 function in S phase (9Petersen B.O. Wagener C. Marinoni F. Kramer E.R. Melixetian M. Denchi E.L. Gieffers C. Matteucci C.

We concluded that our candidate list is highly enriched in mitotic substrates of the APC/C. Thus, we cloned the full-length genes from the candidate list, translated radioactively labeled proteins in vitro and then tested their ability to be ubiquitinated by the active APC/C-Cdh1 in a reconstituted assay (8Zhao W.M. Fang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33516-33524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). From these experiments, we identified 9 new substrates of the APC/C: CKAP2, MELK, MKLP2, Ect2, INCENP, HSET and three novel proteins (Fig. 1; data not shown). We reported the characterization of CKAP2 as a substrate of APC/C in this article. CKAP2 Is a Substrate of the APC/C-Cdh1 in Vitro—We investigated whether CKAP2 is a substrate of the APC/C ubiquitin ligase. In vitro ubiquitination and degradation assays were used to directly analyze the role of APC/C in the stability of CKAP2. Our ubiquitination assay was a two-step process (8Zhao W.M. Fang G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33516-33524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W. Mol Cell. 1998; 2: 163-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Interphase APC/C (iAPC/C) was first purified from Xenopus interphase extracts and activated by Cdc20 or Cdh1 that had been transcribed and translated in vitro. 35S-labeled CKAP2 was then incubated with active APC/C-Cdc20 or APC/C-Cdh1 and the kinetics of its ubiquitination assayed by SDS-PAGE. CKAP2 was efficiently ubiquitinated by APC/C-Cdh1, but not by APC/C-Cdc20 (Fig. 1A). The CKAP2-ub conjugates migrated as a smear above the input CKAP2 substrate. The APC/C-Cdc20 used in our assay was fully active, as it quantitatively ubiquitinated securin (Fig. 1B). The extent of ubiquitination on securin by APC/C-Cdc20 and APC/C-Cdh1 was so efficient that the heterogeneous securin-ub conjugates migrated as a smear across the whole lane, barely detectable in 15-60 min samples. To further confirm that ubiquitination of CKAP2 is APC/C-Cdh1-dependent, the recombinant Emi1, an inhibitor of APC/C (18Reimann J.D. Freed E. Hsu J.Y. Kramer E.R. Peters J.M. Jackson P.K. Cell. 2001; 105: 645-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), was incubated with APC/C and Cdh1 prior to the addition of the CKAP2 substrate. As expected, Emi1 efficiently blocked the ubiquitination of CKAP2 by APC/C-Cdh1 (Fig. 1C). Xenopus extracts are a powerful system to analyze the protein stability in a cell cycle dependent manner (13Fang G. Yu H. Kirschner M.W.

Although interphase extracts did not have any APC/C activity, addition of in vitro translated Cdh1 efficiently activated APC/C, leading to the degradation of 35S-labeled securin (Fig. 2B). The mitotic extracts had active APC/C-Cdc20, which targeted securin for degradation (Fig. 2B). When incubated with 35S-labeled CKAP2, Cdh1-a"

Similar to other ion channels, ENaC activity is set, in part, by its membrane levels. The small G protein RhoA increases ENaC activity by increasing the membrane levels of this channel. We hypothesize that RhoA increases ENaC activity by promoting channel trafficking to the plasma membrane.

This is consistent with a mechanism of increased ENaC trafficking to the membrane. Direct visualization of ENaC movement near the plasma membrane with total internal reflection fluorescence-fluorescence recovery after photobleaching revealed that RhoA accelerates ENaC trafficking toward the membrane. RhoA-facilitated movement of the channel was sensitive to disrupting the endomembrane system. Moreover, facilitating retrieval decreased ENaC activity but not trafficking toward the membrane. ENaC at the plasma membrane clustered and was laterally immobile suggesting that the cytoskeleton tethers or corrals membrane resident channels or membrane-directed vesicles containing ENaC. Disrupting microtubules but not microfilaments led to reorganization of ENaC clusters and slowed trafficking toward the membrane. The cytoskeleton is an established target for RhoA signaling.

Ion channels are integral membrane proteins. Regulated trafficking of these proteins to and from the plasma membrane in part controls their activity. This is true for ENaC, 3The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; eYPF-M, eYFP membrane marker; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DN-Dyn, dominant-negative dynamin; m, mouse. 3The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel; TIRF, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; FRAP, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; eYPF-M, eYFP membrane marker; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; DN-Dyn, dominant-negative dynamin; m, mouse. which is a nonvoltage-gated, Na+-selective ion channel. ENaC is localized to the apical plasma membrane of epithelia particularly that lining the distal renal nephron and colon and alveolar spaces (1Snyder P.M.

Thus, ENaC plays an important physiological role in negative feedback control of blood pressure, as well as epithelial surface hydration in the lungs. Indeed, improper regulation and dysfunction of ENaC are causative for some pulmonary and blood pressure disorders (4Lifton R.P. Gharavi A.G. Geller D.S.

Corticosteroids are the primary endocrine modulators of ENaC activity. One mechanism by which these steroids increase ENaC activity is by increasing the levels of this channel in the apical plasma membrane (1Snyder P.M.

We recently reported that the small G protein RhoA similarly increases ENaC activity by elevating membrane levels of the channel (7Pochynyuk O. Medina J. Gamper N. Genth H. Stockand J.D.

Regulation of ion channels, including several types of K+ channels (e.g. KCNA, KCNH, and KCNJ), by RhoA and other small G proteins is becoming widely appreciated (9Jones S.V. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), small G proteins in the RhoA family modulate channel activity by influencing their membrane levels. However, important questions and details remain unanswered regarding Rho protein regulation of these channels and in particular RhoA regulation of ENaC. For instance, we do not know the mechanism of action of RhoA on ENaC. Specifically, we do not know whether RhoA promotes ENaC trafficking to the plasma membrane or rather retards retrieval of this channel from the membrane to increase channel activity. Moreover, the protein machinery and cellular structures involved in RhoA actions on ENaC remain undefined. Rho proteins are GTP-dependent cellular signaling switches (reviewed in Ref. 13Ridley A.J. Traffic. 2001; 2: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Rho family members localize to the plasma membrane, as well as to intracellular membrane compartments, including endosomes and the Golgi complex. These proteins regulate cytoskeleton organization influencing both microfilaments and microtubules. In addition to or possibly because of effects on the cytoskeleton, Rho proteins play a role in membrane and vesicle trafficking affecting both endo- and exocytosis. Thus, Rho signaling potentially impinges upon ENaC trafficking to and/or from the membrane via effects on the cytoskeleton. We test here the hypothesis that RhoA increases ENaC activity by increasing ENaC movement toward the plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we combine electrophysiology with a fluorescence imaging strategy joining TIRF microscopy with FRAP to follow movement of ENaC toward the plasma membrane in living cells. We find that RhoA increases ENaC activity by increasing movement of the channel toward the membrane. ENaC at/near the membrane had low lateral mobility and clustered into defined areas, suggesting restricted confinement of the channel at this cellular locale. Microtubules but not microfilaments played an important role in ENaC clustering and movement toward the membrane. cDNA Constructs and Cell Culture—All chemicals and materials were purchased from either Fisher, Sigma, Biomol, or Calbiochem unless noted otherwise. CHO and COS-7 cells were maintained with standard culture conditions (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium + 10% fetal bovine serum, 37 °C, 5% CO2) and transfected using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as described previously (8Staruschenko A.

The plasmids encoding α-, β-, and γ-mouse ENaC and NH2-terminal eYFP fusion proteins of these channel subunits have been described previously (15Staruschenko A. Medina J.L. Patel P. Shapiro M.S.

J. 2005; 88: 3966-3975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As noted in these earlier publications, channels consisting of eYFP-tagged subunits exhibit functional behavior indistinguishable from native channels. The plasmid encoding the T635A mutant of γ-mENaC also has been described previously (17Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39161-39167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This mutation retards channel retrieval from the plasma membrane by disrupting an endocytic signaling tag embedded within the channel. The expression vector encoding constitutively active (G14V) RhoA was from the UMR cDNA Resource Center. The expression vectors encoding dominant-negative dynamin (Dyn2 K44A-GFP; DN-Dyn) and mouse Nedd4-2 were from M. McNiven (see Ref. 18Cao H. Thompson H.M. Krueger E.W. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and D. Pearce (see Ref. 19Bhalla V. Daidie D. Li H. Pao A.C. LaGrange L.P. Wang J. Vandewalle A. Stockand J.D. Staub O. Pearce D. Mol.

Cells were treated with brefeldin A for 24 h at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Cells were treated with latrunculin B (20 μm), cytochalasin D (20 μg/ml), and colchicine (500 μm) for 30-40 min. Digitonin (20 μm) was added just prior to experimentation. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min. Actin was subsequently stained in these cells with Oregon Green 514 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 20 min in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Electrophysiology—Whole-cell macroscopic current recordings of mENaC expressed in CHO cells were made under voltage clamp conditions using standard methods (8Staruschenko A. Nichols A. Medina J.L.

In brief, current through ENaC was the inward, amiloride-sensitive Na+ current with a bath solution of (in mm) 160 NaCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4) and a pipette solution of (in mm) 120 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2.0 ATP, and 0.1 GTP (pH 7.3). Current recordings were acquired with an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) patch clamp amplifier interfaced via a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) to a PC running the pClamp 9.2 suite of software (Axon Instruments). Cells were clamped to a 40-mV holding potential with voltage ramps (500 ms) from 60 down to -100 mV used to elicit current. ENaC activity is the amiloride-sensitive current density at -80 mV. Whole-cell capacitance, on average 8-10 picofarads, was compensated. Series resistances, on average 2-5 megohms, were also compensated. TIRF Microscopy—Fluorescence emissions from membrane marker (eYFP-M) and eYFP-tagged channel subunits were collected in living cells at room temperature using TIRF (also called evanescent field) microscopy to selectively illuminate the plasma membrane and thus focus on signals from this cellular locale. TIRF generates an evanescent field that declines exponentially with increasing distance from the interface between the cover glass and plasma membrane illuminating only a thin section (∼100 nm) of the cell in contact with the cover glass, including the plasma membrane (20Taraska J.W.

All TIRF experiments were performed in the total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy core facility housed within the Department of Physiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. We have previously described imaging ENaC containing eYFP-tagged subunits with TIRF microscopy (15Staruschenko A. Medina J.L. Patel P. Shapiro M.S. Booth R.E. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27729-27734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Staruschenko A. Adams E. Booth R.E. Stockand J.D. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3966-3975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The methods used in this study closely followed these published protocols. In brief, fluorescence emissions from fluorophore-tagged ENaC were collected using an inverted TE2000 microscope with through-the-lens (prismless) TIRF imaging (Nikon). This system was equipped with a vibration isolation system (Technical Manufacturing Corp.) to minimize drift and noise. Samples viewed through a plain Apo TIRF 60× oil immersion and high resolution (1.45 NA) objective. Fluorescence emissions from tagged subunits were collected with the Chroma Technology Corp. 514-nm laser filter set with band-pass emission (Z514BP) by exciting eYFP with an argon ion laser (80 milliwatts) with an acoustic optic tunable filter (Prairie Technologies, Inc.) used to restrict excitation wavelength to 514 nm. In this system, a 514-nm dichroic mirror (Z514rdc) separates the 514/10-nm (Z514/10×) and 560/50-nm (HQ560/50m) excitation and emission filters. Fluorescence images were collected and processed with a 16-bit, cooled charge-coupled device camera (Cascade 512F; Roper Scientific Inc.) interfaced to a PC running Metamorph software. This camera uses a front-illuminated EMCCD with on-chip multiplication gain. Images were collected with a 200-ms exposure time immediately before and after photobleaching and every subsequent minute. Images were not binned or filtered with pixel size corresponding to a square of 122 × 122 nm. FRAP—Fluorophore-tagged channels in and near the plasma membrane and membrane marker were photobleached with TIRF illumination using the argon ion laser (514 nm) at full power for 2 min. With such prolonged photobleaching, this maneuver may be more aptly termed photo-destruction or photolysis of the eYFP tag. Nevertheless, fluorescence emissions from membrane fluorophores were collected under TIRF illumination before and after photobleaching. Laser power, camera gain, and exposure times were constant throughout the course of the experiment except during photobleaching as noted above. All TIRF-FRAP experiments were performed 48-72 h. after transfection. Data Processing and Statistics—All summarized electrophysiology data were reported as the mean ± S.E. amiloride-sensitive current density. Summarized FRAP data were reported as the mean ± S.E. of relative FRAP, which is normalized to pre-bleach emission levels. Tau for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was calculated within the first 7 min using a single exponential curve. Particle tracking was used to determine the two-dimensional movement of eYFP-M and eYFP-ENaC in the plane of focus (lateral mobility). For this, the coordinates at the centers of circles approximating ENaC and eYFP-M clusters were tracked over time. Lateral diffusion constants (D) for ENaC and eYFP-M at the membrane were calculated from the square of the two-dimensional distances they covered (d2) using the following equation: d2 = 4Dt, where t is time (23Qian H. Sheetz M.P. Elson E.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 60: 910-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Summarized data were compared with either the Student’s (two-tailed) t test or a one-way analysis of variance in conjunction with the Dunnett or Student’s Newman Keuls post-test where appropriate. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. RhoA Promotes ENaC Trafficking to the Plasma Membrane—RhoA increases ENaC activity by increasing the membrane levels of this channel (7Pochynyuk O. Medina J. Gamper N. Genth H. Stockand J.D. Staruschenko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26520-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 8Staruschenko A. Nichols A. Medina J.L. Camacho P. Zheleznova N.N. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49989-49994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Increases in membrane levels result either from increased trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane or, alternatively, from a decrease in retrieval of the channel from this membrane. Retrieval of ENaC, in part, involves the action of dynamin (17Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39161-39167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Shimkets R.A. Lifton R.P. Canessa C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25537-25541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possible mechanisms of action, we tested whether RhoA actions on ENaC were additive with channel retrieval disrupted by expressing dominant-negative dynamin and channels resistant to retrieval. Fig. 1A shows a summary graph of ENaC activity in voltage-clamped CHO cells expressing the channel alone and in the presence of constitutively active (G14V) RhoA and DN-Dyn alone and together. Overexpression of either RhoAG14V or DN-Dyn alone with ENaC significantly increases channel activity. Co-expressing RhoAG14V plus DN-Dyn together with ENaC had additive effects significantly increasing channel activity above that for either alone. This finding is consistent with RhoA increasing ENaC activity through a mechanism independent of dynamin possibly involving increased channel trafficking to the membrane. The T635A substitution in the γ-subunit of mENaC impairs channel retrieval (17Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39161-39167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As apparent in Fig. 1B, ENaC containing this substitution has greater activity compared with channels containing all wild-type subunits. Co-expressing RhoAG14V with T635A-substituted ENaC had an additive effect further increasing channel activity above either alone. This finding agrees well with that made above and adds additional support to the idea that RhoA increases ENaC membrane levels and activity by affecting trafficking to the plasma membrane. Visualization and Quantification of ENaC Movement toward the Plasma Membrane—The electrophysiology experiments described above, although informative, were indirect with respect to quantifying effects on trafficking for their end point measurements are channel activity. To directly visualize and quantify RhoA effects on ENaC trafficking toward the plasma membrane, we combined TIRF microscopy with FRAP in a modification of the approach first used by Axelrod and co-workers (25Thompson N.L. Burghardt T.P. Axelrod D. Biophys. J. 1981; 33: 435-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 26Burghardt T.P. Axelrod D. Biophys. J. 1981; 33: 455-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) to investigate surface dynamics of biomolecules. With this approach, TIRF microscopy optically isolates fluorophore-tagged ENaC at the plasma membrane. This allows for signal selection from this pool of channels, as well as selective photobleaching of these channels. Recovery of fluorescence following photobleaching with TIRF illumination then allows quantification of the dynamics of channel trafficking toward the plasma membrane. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TIRF-FRAP to the study of trafficking of an integral membrane. As such, we initially confirm selective photobleaching of ENaC at/near the plasma membrane and characterize ENaC movements as compared with those of a peripheral membrane protein at this cellular locale. The membrane maker eYFP-M was used as a reporter for the latter. The palmitoylation domain of neuromodulin localizes this fluorescent fusion protein to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. The experiments in Fig. 2 demonstrate preferential photo-bleaching of ENaC in and near the plasma membrane abutting the coverglass versus total cellular pools of the channel with TIRF illumination. Shown in Fig. 2A are fluorescence micrographs of a cell expressing eYFP-ENaC (all three subunits tagged) before (left) and after (right) photobleaching with TIRF illumination. The top row of Fig. 2A contains fluorescence micrographs from a cell imaged with epifluorescence microscopy. The bottom row of Fig. 2A contains fluorescence micrographs from the same cell imaged with TIRF microscopy. As apparent in the representative cell and summarized in Fig. 2B, photobleaching with TIRF illumination has a pronounced effect on fluorescence emissions from channels at/near the membrane compared with the total cellular pool of these channels. The region of the cell in Fig. 2A overlaying the left of the nucleus with particularly strong signal in the epifluorescence image is likely the Golgi complex. With TIRF microscopy, the excitatory evanescent field decays exponentially from the coverglass over ∼100 nm (22Axelrod D. Traffic. 2001; 2: 764-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). As apparent in the TIRF images, the Golgi complex is not visible, indicating that it is removed enough from the interface of the coverglass and plasma membrane to be outside the evanescent field. One hallmark of ENaC as visualized with TIRF microscopy is also clear in these images. This channel routinely appeared in discrete clusters when viewed with TIRF microscopy. These clusters had morphologies ranging from small spheres of 0.82 ± 0.07 μm in diameter to elongated tubular structures of several microns in length (see also Figs. 4A, 5A, and 10B). In contrast to ENaC, eYFP-M had a uniform distribution with a small minority of this protein localizing to spherical particles of 1.1 ± 0.11 μm diameter (see Figs. 4A and 5A). ENaC distribution at/near the membrane reflects localization of the channel to discrete membrane microdomains or vesicles residing just below or docking with the plasma membrane.FIGURE 5ENaC but not eYFP-M recovery is impaired by disrupting cellular integrity.

As shown in Fig. 3A by the red circles, eYFP-M was freely mobile and readily moved within the field of illumination. In contrast, ENaC movement, as defined by the blue and green circles in Fig. 3A, was severely restricted. Because movement of eYFP-M appeared random, we tested whether this movement represented diffusion. Fig. 3B plots the square of the two-dimensional distance (d2) covered by eYFP-M (red) and ENaC (blue; shown with an expanded scale in Fig. 3C) clusters versus time. These data points were fit with the diffusion equation (defined in “Materials and Methods”) with the distance covered by both eYFP-M and ENaC increasing linearly over time. The calculated diffusion constants for eYFP-M and ENaC are 0.16 ± 0.005 and 0.0047 ± 0.001 μm2/min, respectively. Thus, clusters of eYFP-M move fast and are freely “mobile” compared with ENaC clusters, which move much slower to the point of being “immobile,” vibrating within a microdomain or docking site or around a tethering site. If eYFP-M has a uniform distribution and is freely mobile, then fluorescence recovery of this reporter following photo-bleaching with TIRF illumination should result primarily from the lateral diffusion of nonbleached reporter from adjacent plasma membrane not in contact with the coverglass. As shown in Fig. 4, this is what we observed. In contrast, if ENaC movement is restricted, then recovery after photobleaching cannot occur via lateral diffusion and must represent trafficking of the channel toward the membrane into the evanescent field of illumination. Fig. 4A shows fluorescence micrographs of representative COS-7 cells expressing the membrane marker eYFP-M (top) and eYFP-ENaC (bottom). Cells were visualized with TIRF microscopy. Cells are shown just prior to photo-bleaching with TIRF illumination (Fig. 4A, left), and 10 s (middle) and 30 min (right) after photobleaching. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching is present in both cases; however, a clear difference is present where recovery of eYFP-M but not eYFP-ENaC first appears at the periphery of the plasma membrane in contact with the coverglass. In contrast, recovery of eYFP-ENaC is uniformly spread across the entire field. This difference is particularly apparent in the line scans shown in Fig. 4B. These line scans s"

An atomic seesaw switch was formed for one-dimensional electronic conduction in the Ge dimer–row direction by using the STM to reversibly flip the buckling orientation of the Sn-Ge dimer and to set up standing-wave states."
https://openalex.org/W2019960866,"We previously showed that inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 2 (IHPK2) functions as a growth-suppressive and apoptosis-enhancing kinase during cell stress. Overexpression of IHPK2 sensitized ovarian carcinoma cell lines to the growth-suppressive and apoptotic effects of interferon β (IFN-β), IFN-α2, and γ-irradiation. Expression of a kinase-dead mutant abrogated 50% of the apoptosis induced by IFN-β. Because the kinase-dead mutant retained significant response to cell stressors, we hypothesized that a portion of the death-promoting function of IHPK2 was independent of its kinase activity. We now demonstrate that IHPK2 binds to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 and interferes with phosphorylation of transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), thereby inhibiting NF-κB signaling. IHPK2 contains two sites required for TRAF2 binding, Ser-347 and Ser-359. Compared with wild type IHPK2-transfected cells, cells expressing S347A and S359A mutations displayed 3.5-fold greater TAK1 activation following TNF-α. This mutant demonstrated a 6–10-fold increase in NF-κB DNA binding following TNF-α compared with wild type IHPK2-expressing cells in which NF-κB DNA binding was inhibited. Cells transfected with wild type IHPK2 or IHPK2 mutants that lacked S347A and S359A mutations displayed enhanced terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling staining following TNF-α.

By co-immunoprecipitation, we found that IHPK2 associated with TRAF2. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins serve as adapter proteins for the TNF-R and interleukin-1 receptor superfamilies (10Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W.

The role of TRAF2 in mediating the TNF-α response is controversial. Early studies with TRAF2 and TRAF5 knock-out mice or dominant negative (DN) TRAF2 mice suggested that these proteins were not essential or played redundant roles in TNF-induced NF-κB activation (12Yeh W.C.

Subsequent studies suggested that TRAF2–/– fibroblasts (15Devin A. Cook A. Lin Y. Rodriguez Y. Kelliher M. Liu Z.

Most recently, Aggarwal and co-workers (17Jackson-Bernitsas D.G. Ichikawa H. Takada Y. Myers J.N. Lin X.L. Darnay B.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Aggarwal B.B.

Within the trimeric signaling complex TRAF2 serves to recruit IκB kinase (IKK) and RIP1 to the TNF-R1 (18Devin A. Lin Y. Yamaoka S. Li Z. Karin M. Liu Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3986-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Song H.Y. Regnier C.H. Kirschning C.J. Goeddel D.V. Rothe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9792-9796Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Transforming growth factor β-activated kinase (TAK1) is a critical component of this cascade, functioning downstream of RIP1 and TRAF2 to activate IKKβ (20Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the binding of IHPK2 to TRAF2 might disrupt TNF-α signaling. The aims of this study were to identify motifs in IHPK2 required for TRAF2 binding and to determine whether disruption of IHPK2-TRAF2 binding would affect TNF-α signaling. Materials—Human IFN-β (Serono, Rockland, MA)-specific activity, 2.7 × 108 units/mg, was used in these studies. Construction of IHPK2 SXXE Mutants—IHPK2 was cloned into the pCXN2myc mammalian expression vector (21Kinoshita S. Suzuki H. Ito K. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. Pharm. Res. 1998; 15: 1851-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Using PCR, point mutations were made in IHPK2. The serine residues in SXXE were changed to AXXE. Thus, the wild type sequences (in bold) SXXE1, VDIVDNSDCEPKS; SXXE2, LLENLTSRYEVPC; SXXE3, PEVVLDSDAEDLE; and SXXE4, EDLSEESADESAG were changed to SXXE1, VDIVDNADCEPKS; SXXE2, LLENLTARYEVPC; SXXE3, PEVVLDADAEDLE; and SXXE4, EDLSEEAADESAG. This was done using primers 5′-pGTGGACATTGTAGATAATGCAGACTGTGAACCAAAAAGT-3′ and 5′-pACTTTTTGGTTCACAGTCTGCATTATCTACAATGTCCAC-3′ for SXXE1, 5′-pTTACTGGAAAACCTGACTGCCCGCTATGAGGTGCCTTGT-3′ and 5′-pACAAGGCACCTCATAGCGGGCAGTCAGGTTTTCCAGTAA-3′ for SXXE2, 5′-pCCCGAAGTGGTCCTGGACGCAGATGCTGAGGATTTGGAG-3′ and 5′-pCTCCAAATCCTCAGCATCTGCGTCCAGGACCACTTCGGG-3′ for SXXE3, and 5′-pGAGGACCTGTCAGAGGAAGCAGCTGATGAGTCTGCTGGT-3′ and 5′-pACCAGCAGACTCATCAGCTGCTTCCTCTGACAGGTCCTC-3′ for SXXE4 (p indicates phosphorylated 5′-nucleotide). The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into pCXN2myc. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. TRAF2 cDNA was cloned into pCXN2myc in a similar manner. Constructs were transfected into NIH-OVCAR-3 cells by nucleofection with Cell Line Nucleofector kit T (Amaxa, Koeln, Germany). For transient transfection studies, cells were utilized after 48 h. In other co-immunoprecipitation studies, transfectants were selected with G418 for 4 weeks of selection, and clones were pooled. Expression of mutants was monitored by immunoblotting. siRNA Target Sequence—The IHPK2 target sequence consisted of a 29-mer oligonucleotide representing the 21-nucleotide sequence starting at nucleotide 181 (AAAUUCACUCCCCAGUACAAA) and contained an 8-nucleotide sequence at the 3′-end complementary to the T7 promoter primer provided in the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed, and double-stranded RNA was prepared by in vitro transcription. The resulting double-stranded RNA was then treated with RNase A and DNase I to generate the final siRNA product. An oligonucleotide sequence that does not silence any mammalian gene (siRNA-scrambled, siSCR) was utilized as a negative control. Nucleofection was used to transiently transfect siRNAs into cells at a concentration of 40 nm. Immunoprecipitation—Mouse monoclonal antibody (15 μg) made in our laboratory was incubated with Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in cell lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 75 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors). For in vitro interaction studies, recombinant purified IHPK2 and TRAF2 (50 μg), encoded in pET32a and expressed in BL21-DE3 bacteria, were incubated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin. For in vivo interaction studies, total cell protein (100 μg) was immunoprecipitated with IHPK2 monoclonal antibody. Precipitate was subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with rabbit anti-mouse TRAF2 polyclonal antibody (Leinco Technologies, St. Louis, MO). Membranes were incubated with anti-mouse IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed using ECL reagents (Pierce). Converse experiments were performed by immunoprecipitating with anti-TRAF2 and probing with anti-IHPK2. Lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-NF-κB p50 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), anti-TAK1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), or anti-DR4 (Genetex, San Antonio, TX) and probed for IHPK2. Immunoblot Analysis—Total cell protein (50 μg) was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were incubated with antibody raised against TAK1, or phospho-TAK1, or phospho-AKT or AKT (Cell Signaling Technology), or human XIAP (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA), or GAPDH (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After washing, membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and developed using ECL reagents (Pierce). Band intensity was quantitated using densitometry (FluorChem SP imaging station; Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). -Fold induction was expressed as the ratio of normalized band intensities: (TNF-treated)/(PBS-treated). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—As a positive control for NF-κB induction, cells were treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for 15 min. Plates were washed with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma). Cells were scraped from plates and resuspended in cold CellLytic M lysis reagent (Sigma) with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Calbiochem). Lysates were incubated (4 °C, 30 min) followed by centrifugation (20,000 × g for 15 min). Supernatant protein concentrations were assessed using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay). The NF-κB consensus binding sequence oligonucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was end-labeled with [γ32-P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Roche Applied Science). DNA binding reactions were performed (30 min, 4 °C, 20 μg of protein) in 100 mm HEPES, 3.0 mm EDTA, 50% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.90, 5 μg of poly d(I-C), and labeled probe. Complexes were resolved on 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to film. To verify that band shifts were comprised of NF-κB, lysates were stimulated for 15 min with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) and incubated with 1 μg of anti-NF-κB p50 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA). Band intensity was quantitated by phosphor image analysis on a Storm-840 imager using Image Quant v 5.1 software (Amersham Biosciences). -Fold induction was expressed as the ratio of normalized band intensities: (TNF-treated)/(PBS-treated). IKK Assay—Whole cell extracts (300 μg of protein) were supplemented with 150 μl of Buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 5 mm para-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease mixture) and 2 μl of normal rabbit serum and mixed by rotation (4 °C, 1 h) (22DiDonato J.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 393-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose (80 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer A (without β-mercaptoethanol or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added and mixed by rotation at 4 °C, 1 h. Protein G-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation (800 × g, 1 min) and discarded. Anti-IKKα monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg; BD Biosciences) or anti-β-actin antibody was added to the supernatant and mixed by rotation (4 °C, 2 h). A 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose (60 μl) prepared in Buffer C (Buffer A plus 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2, without β-mercaptoethanol and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added and mixed by rotation (4 °C, 30 min). Protein G immunopellets were collected by centrifugation (800 × g, 30 s) and washed three times with Buffer B (Buffer A plus 250 mm NaCl) and once with Buffer C (Buffer A plus 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2). Immunopellets were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer with 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 50 μm unlabeled ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of recombinant GST-IκBα-(1–54) and incubated (30 °C, 30 min). Reactions were stopped with 15 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol), heated (95 °C, 10 min), and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels. Gels were rinsed, stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie (Bio-Rad) to visualize protein bands, rinsed, photographed, dried, and exposed to Kodak X-OMAT AR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) to detect substrate phosphorylation. IKK activation was quantified by phosphor image analysis (GE Healthcare). Antiproliferative Assays—Cells were treated with IFN-β during growth in RPMI 1640 (Mediatech Inc., Herndon, VA) and 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cells were confirmed mycoplasma-free by PCR. Growth was monitored using a colorimetric assay (23Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each treatment group contained 8 replicates. Cells were fixed and stained with sulforhodamine B after 4 days. Bound dye was eluted from cells, and absorbance (Aexp) was measured at 570 nm. One plate was fixed 8 h after plating to determine the absorbance representing starting cell number (Aini). Absorbance with this plate and that obtained with untreated cells at the end of the growth period (Afin) were taken as 0 and 100% growth, respectively. Thus, Percent Control Growth = 00%*(Aexp – Aini)/Afin – Aini). Expressed as a percent of untreated controls, a decrease in cell number (relative to starting cell number) is a negative number on the y-axis. TUNEL Assay—NIH-OVCAR-3 cells were exposed to TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 16 h. Apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling) staining using a kit (APO-BRDU kit; BD Biosciences). Cells were processed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The percentage of fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive cells was analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell scanning (Facsvantage; BD Biosciences). IHPK2 Binds TRAF2—Bacterially translated proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for IHPK2 (Fig. 1a, top lane), whereas antibody to the DR4 death receptor did not precipitate TRAF2 (Fig. 1a, bottom lane). Untransfected NIH-OVCAR-3 cells were treated with PBS or IFN-β (100 units/ml, 24 h); lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-IHPK2 followed by immunoblot (IB) with anti-TRAF2 antibody (Fig. 1b, top lane). IFN-β increased the interaction of IHPK2 with TRAF2. The converse experiment (IP with anti-TRAF2 and IB with IHPK2) gave similar results (second lane). Immunoprecipitation with irrelevant antibodies (p50 and TAK1) yielded no signal. IHPK2 Knock Down Induces IFN-β Resistance—We previously showed that IFN-β induced IHPK2 in a post-transcriptional manner (7Morrison B.H. Bauer J.A. Kalvakolanu D.V. Lindner D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24965-24970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This induction could be detected after IFN-β (100 units/ml, 24 h, Fig. 1c, top lane). Transient transfection with siRNA against IHPK2 (siIHPK2) efficiently suppressed IHPK2 expression, whereas scrambled siRNA (siSCR) did not. Because siRNA can potentially induce an IFN response, we examined effects of siRNA transfection on activation and phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT1. Treatment of untransfected cells with IFN-β induced phosphorylation of STAT1 after 30 min, which was no longer detectable after 24 h. Similar activation of STAT1 was detected in siIHPK2- and siSCR-expressing cells, suggesting that down-regulation of IHPK2 did not affect IFN signaling. The expression of STAT1, an IFN-stimulated gene, was increased in untransfected, siIHPK2-transfected, and siSCR-transfected cells (Fig. 1c, third lane). Transiently transfected NIH-OVCAR-3 cells were subjected to TUNEL analysis (Fig. 1d). Following IFN-β, cells expressing scrambled siRNA (siSCR) displayed 2-fold greater TUNEL staining (55%) compared with cells expressing siIHPK2 (23%). Similarly, siIHPK2 reduced the level of apoptosis following TNF-α from 67 to 32%. Hence, knock down of IHPK2 mRNA conferred resistance to apoptosis induced by IFN-β and by TNF-α. Inhibition of apoptosis correlated with enhanced proliferation. Anti-proliferative assays (Fig. 1e) revealed a 2-fold increase in ID50 for IFN-β in siIHPK2 cells compared with siSCR cells: 16 and 8 units/ml, respectively. IHPK2 Mutation Inhibits IHPK2-TRAF2 Binding—Ligation of death receptors such as Fas, TNFR1, DR4, and DR5 activates the external apoptotic pathway. TNF-α binds TNFR1, inducing clustering of TRADD and receptor-interacting protein (RIP1), which leads to caspase activation. However, ligation of TNFR1 generates not only a death signal but an additional survival signal mediated by NF-κB. Apo2L/TRAIL triggers apoptosis via binding to death receptors DR4 and DR5. Immunoprecipitation of NIH-OVCAR-3 cell lysates with IHPK2 monoclonal antibody showed that there was no association between IHPK2 and DR4 or DR5 (not shown). Treatment with IFN-β enhanced binding of IHPK2 to TRAF2 (Fig. 1b). The interaction was even stronger when TRAF2 and IHPK2 were co-transfected (Fig. 2a). When cells are transfected with only one construct (either IHPK2 or TRAF2, Fig. 2, a and b, lanes 1–2) less TRAF2 is immunoprecipitated when compared with co-transfection. IHPK2 contains four SXXE motifs, putative binding sites for TRAF2 (24Park Y.C. Burkitt V. Villa A.R. Tong L. Wu H. Nature. 1999; 398: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). For brevity, we named these sites S1 (S102), S2 (S211), S3 (S347), and S4 (S359). The four SXXE sites were point mutated (serine to alanine) singly and in combination. NIH-OVCAR-3 cells were stably co-transfected with IHPK2 mutants and TRAF2. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with IHPK2 monoclonal antibody. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that two of the SXXE mutations (S3 and S4) in combination (but not singly) reduced TRAF2 binding activity (Fig. 2a). Protein levels of IHPK2 and TRAF2 were comparable in transfected cells (Fig. 2b). Effect of IHPK2 Mutation on TAK1 Phosphorylation—Because TAK1 plays an important role in the TNFR-mediated cascade and functions immediately downstream of TRAF2 (20Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), we determined whether IHPK2 mutation had any effect on phosphorylation of TAK1. Wild type untransfected and vector-transfected cells displayed a 2.5- to 3-fold induction of phospho-TAK1 (pTAK1) in response to TNF-α (Fig. 3a). TNF-α failed to activate TAK1 above base line in cells expressing IHPK2 or the S3 or S4 single mutants (<1.5-fold induction of pAKT). However, phosphorylation of TAK1 following TNF-α was restored in cells containing S3&S4 double mutants (3- to 3.5-fold induction). Hence, the S3&S4 double mutant had diminished TRAF2 binding and no longer inhibited TAK1 phosphorylation. Effect of IHPK2 Mutation on AKT Phosphorylation—Because AKT may also contribute to NF-κB activation, mainly through phosphorylation of IKKα (25Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar), we determined whether IHPK2 mutation had any effect on activation of AKT. Wild type untransfected and vector-transfected cells displayed a 6-fold induction of phospho-AKT (pAKT) in response to TNF-α (Fig. 3b). The TNF-α response of cells expressing IHPK2 or the S3 or S4 single mutants was suppressed (1- to 1.5-fold induction of pAKT). However, the TNF-α response was restored in cells containing S3&S4 double mutants; they displayed 5- to 17-fold induction of pAKT (Fig. 3b, bars 6–9). Hence, the S3&S4 double mutant lost the ability to inhibit pAKT activation. Effect of IHPK2 Mutation on IκBα Kinase Activity—The IKK complex, consisting of α, β, and γ subunits, is responsible for phosphorylation of IκB, leading to IκB degradation, and subsequent nuclear translocation of NF-κB. TAK1 phosphorylates IKKβ, the main catalytic subunit, whereas AKT phosphorylates IKKα. We examined IKK enzymatic activity in lysates of cells stably transfected with IHPK2 mutants. IKK was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts using anti-IKKα antibody, and kinase activity was assessed using recombinant GST-IκBα-(1–54) as a substrate. TNF-α induced IKKα activity in wild type untransfected cells, vector-transfected cells, and all transfectants (Fig. 4). Cells expressing IHPK2 S3&4 double mutants displayed similar kinase activity as wild type cells or other transfectants. Therefore, the S3&4 mutant did not appear to modulate IKK enzymatic activity in vitro. Effect of IHPK2 Mutation upon NF-κB DNA Binding—We next determined whether IHPK2-TRAF2 binding and inhibition of TAK1 phosphorylation disrupted NF-κB signaling. In untransfected wild type NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, treatment with TNF-α resulted in robust NF-κB activation as demonstrated by EMSA (Fig. 5a). Supershift (ss) with anti-p50 confirmed the identity of NF-κB. Transfection with IHPK2 reduced the intensity of DNA binding activity in response to TNF-α (Fig. 5b, compare lanes 3–6). Quantitation of the band shift indicated a 3-fold reduction (Fig. 5b, bars 2 and 3). Hence, overexpression of IHPK2 blunted NF-κB DNA binding activity in response to TNF-α. Cells expressing two IHPK2 mutations (S3&4) demonstrated 7- to 11-fold activation of NF-κB compared with cells co-transfected with wild type IHPK2. The other IHPK2 mutants that lacked S3&4 mutations had blunted NF-κB activation (1-fold induction). Effect of IHPK2 Mutation on XIAP—Activated NF-κB translocates to the nucleus and induces transcription of target genes such as inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs). The X-linked mammalian inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) binds to caspase 3, caspase 9, DIABLO/Smac, HtrA2/Omi, and TAB1 (26Silke J. Hawkins C.J. Ekert P.G. Chew J. Day C.L. Pakusch M. Verhagen A.M. Vaux D.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Cells expressing IHPK2 mutants S3&4 displayed up to a 2.4-fold increase in XIAP. The IHPK2 single mutants (S3 and S4) acted like wild type IHPK2, resulting in suppressed XIAP expression (fold increase 0.1–0.9) (Fig. 6). Thus, effects of IHPK2 mutation upon XIAP induction correlated with changes in NF-κB DNA binding activity. IHPK2 Mutants Inhibit TNF-α-induced Apoptosis—The effects of IHPK2 mutation on TNF-α-induced apoptosis were analyzed by TUNEL (Fig. 7). Untransfected wild type and vector-transfected cells displayed 40 and 26% TUNEL positivity following TNF-α, respectively. Cells expressing IHPK2 or S3 or S4 single point mutations had enhanced TUNEL staining, 64, 51, 52%, respectively. Cells expressing the S3&S4 double mutation were 33% TUNEL-positive, a response that was similar to untransfected or vector-transfected cells. Therefore, the double mutant was defective in enhancing TNF-α-induced apoptosis. IHPK2 Mutants Affect Growth-suppressive Activities of IFN-β—The biological relevance of the IHPK2 mutations was determined in antiproliferative assays using pools of stable transfectants. Overexpression of IHPK2 sensitized cells to IFN-β, as the IC50 value fell from 15 to 6 units/ml in vector-transfected and IHPK2-transfected cells, respectively (Fig. 8). Constructs containing the S3&4 mutations conferred resistance to IFN-β, as the IC50 value increased from 15 units/ml in vector-transfected cells to 20–75 units/ml in double mutant-transfected cells, respectively. Cells expressing irrelevant IHPK2 mutations (IRREL, constructs lacking S3&4 mutations) displayed sensitivity to IFN-β between that of vector- and IHPK2-transfected cells. Therefore, overexpression of IHPK2 sensitized cells to IFN-β, and the S3&4 double mutation conferred resistance to IFN-β. In our previous study, overexpression of the kinase-dead IHPK2 mutant suppressed IFN-induced cell death, but the magnitude of suppression was 50%, even though transfection efficiency was 90%. Snyder and co-workers (8Nagata E. Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Bae B.I. Suzuki N. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1634-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that transfection of IHPK2 augmented the apoptotic activities of several cell stressors. Although transfection of all three subtypes of IHPK increased cell death, suppression of IHPK2, but not IHPK1 or IHPK3, abrogated apoptosis. Our studies and those of Snyder and co-workers suggest that kinase activity is not the sole determinant of the apoptotic activity of IHPK2. The present study provides evidence that IHPK2 is a TRAF2-interacting protein that suppresses TAK1 phosphorylation and inhibits NF-κB activation. In the absence of cell stressors such as IFN-β or TNF-α, IHPK2-TRAF2 interaction is still detected at low levels (Fig. 1b). This may be responsible for the ∼10% constitutive levels of apoptosis observed in NIH-OVCAR-3 cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that the SXXE mutations (S347A and S359A) in combination inhibited TRAF2 binding. Therefore, these residues are important for IHPK2-TRAF2 association. Cells expressing these IHPK2 mutations were more effective at phosphorylation of TAK1 and activation of NF-κB compared with cells expressing wild type IHPK2. Similarly, the double mutants were more effective at XIAP induction and more resistant to the apoptotic effects of IFN-β. The NF-κB pathway is activated following degradation of IκB (27Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). This pathway depends on the IKK complex, which contains three subunits, IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ. TRAF2 functions to recruit IKKα and IKKβ to the TNF-R1 receptor (18Devin A. Lin Y. Yamaoka S. Li Z. Karin M. Liu Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3986-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although initial studies utilizing TRAF2 knock-out MEFs suggested that TRAF2 did not play a role in activation of NF-κBby TNF-α (12Yeh W.C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billia F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar), later studies indicated that TRAF2 was indeed required for NF-κB activation. Nakano and co-workers (16Tada K. Okazaki T. Sakon S. Kobarai T. Kurosawa K. Yamaoka S. Hashimoto H. Mak T.W. Yagita H. Okumura K. Yeh W.C. Nakano H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36530-36534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) showed that TRAF2/TRAF5 double knock-out MEFs were severely impaired in NF-κB activation following TNF-α, suggesting that TRAF2 and TRAF5 function may be redundant. In squamous carcinoma, expression of DN-TRAF2 strongly inhibited transcription of an NF-κB reporter plasmid, whereas DN-TRAF5 had no effect on NF-κB activation (17Jackson-Bernitsas D.G. Ichikawa H. Takada Y. Myers J.N. Lin X.L. Darnay B.G. Chaturvedi M.M. Aggarwal B.B. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 1385-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Hence, in some carcinomas TRAF2 and TRAF5 function is not redundant. A model for this signaling cascade is: TNFR1-(RIP1/TRAF2)-TAK1-IKKβ-NF-κB. Knock-out MEFs that lack TAK1 cannot activate NF-κB in response to TNF-α and are highly sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis, indicating that the survival pathway is severely inhibited in these cells (20Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of IKKα, mediated by NF-κB-inducing kinase, appears to be intact in TAK1 knock-out MEFs (20Shim J.H. Xiao C. Paschal A.E. Bailey S.T. Rao P. Hayden M.S. Lee K.Y. Bussey C. Steckel M. Tanaka N. Yamada G. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Thus, TAK1 phosphorylates IKKβ but does not appear to phosphorylate IKKα. Immunoprecipitation experiments with recombinant proteins demonstrated that IKKβ is the main catalytic subunit of the IKK complex (28Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-IκBα-(1–54) fusion protein, containing glutathione and the first 54 residues of IκBα, is phosphorylated by IKK in the kinase assay. Antibodies directed against IKKβ disrupt IKK activity; therefore, antibodies against IKKα or IKKγ are generally utilized to precipitate the complex. Other proteins such as Cdc37 and Hsp90 may be required for optimal activity of the IKK complex (29Chen G. Cao P. Goeddel D.V. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 401-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). If such auxiliary proteins are not pulled down efficiently, the assay may not reflect the full extent of IκBα phosphorylation in vivo. Mutation of IHPK2 clearly affected TAK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3a) but did not affect IKK kinase activity in vitro (Fig. 4a). There is also cross-talk between TRAF2 and AKT in NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, as overexpression of IHPK2 inhibited AKT activation (Fig. 3b). CD40, a TNF receptor superfamily member, requires TRAF2 to activate AKT. In TRAF2 knock-out MEFs, and carcinoma cells that received siRNA-TRAF2, AKT phosphorylation was severely impaired (30Davies C.C. Mak T.W. Young L.S. Eliopoulos A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9806-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our studies suggest that following binding to TRAF2, IHPK2 functions to inhibit TAK1 phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylation, and subsequent NF-κB activation."

However, unlike the mammalian, yeast or Caenorhabditis elegans PIPKs, AtPIPK1–9 contain N-terminal putative membrane occupation and recognition nexus (MORN) motifs similar to those first reported in junctophilins (1Mueller-Roeber B.

In eukaryotic models PtdInsP kinases supply PtdIns(4,5)P2 for many cellular functions, and it is well known that phospholipids play an integral role in regulating the structure and dynamics of the cytoskeleton through the many actin-binding proteins that interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2 (7Simonsen A.

In some animal cell lines overexpression of PtdInsP kinases results in the formation of actin comet tails and stress fibers (13Yamamoto M. Hilgemann D.H. Feng S. Bito H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y.

In these animal cell lines, a functional PtdInsP kinase producing PtdIns(4,5)P2 was necessary to cause the changes in cytoskeletal structure (13Yamamoto M. Hilgemann D.H. Feng S. Bito H. Ishihara H.

In mammalian systems, PIPK activity has been recovered with an F-actin fraction, and the α, β, and γ isoforms have been identified as co-purifying with F-actin. The data support a model where these PIPKs do not directly interact with F-actin but that this interaction is mediated by the presence of Racs, small GTP-binding proteins (16Yang S.A. Carpenter C.L. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42331-42336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In plants, PtdIns kinase activity (17Xu P. Lloyd C.W. Staiger C.J. Drøbak B.K.

Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 2116-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), but it is not clear from these studies whether plant PtdInsP kinases directly bind F-actin or, like animal PIPKs, associate with a scaffold of actin-binding proteins. Actin remodeling in root hairs and pollen tubes, sites of rapid growth in plants, is sensitive to alterations in PtdIns(4,5)P2 biosynthesis. It was first noted that expression of mutant Arabidopsis Rac2 in tobacco pollen tubes decreased plasma membrane PtdIns(4,5)P2 and disrupted the normal actin filament orientation (19Kost B. Lemichez E. Spielhofer P. Hong Y. Tolias K. Carpenter C. Chua N.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The GFP-AtRac2 was localized to the apical tip of the pollen tube, and PtdInsP kinase activity was co-immunoprecipitated with Rac2 antibodies. More recent work in pollen tubes suggested that phospholipase C-mediated PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover also affected actin structure and suggested that PtdIns(4,5)P2 metabolism is necessary in normal pollen growth (20Dowd P.E. Coursol S. Skirpan A.L. Kao T.H. Gilroy S. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1438-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Helling D. Possart A. Cottier S. Klahre U. Kost B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Expression of inactive mutants of PLC isoforms resulted in increased levels PtdIns(4,5)P2 throughout the entire pollen tube and enriched at the apical tip (20Dowd P.E. Coursol S. Skirpan A.L. Kao T.H. Gilroy S. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1438-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 21Helling D. Possart A. Cottier S. Klahre U. Kost B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In both tobacco (21Helling D. Possart A. Cottier S. Klahre U. Kost B. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 3519-3534Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and petunia (20Dowd P.E. Coursol S. Skirpan A.L. Kao T.H. Gilroy S. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 1438-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), disruption of PLC hydrolysis of PtdIns(4,5)P2 using inactive mutants or chemical inhibitors of PLC resulted in tip swelling, suggesting that PLC-mediated PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover was essential for normal tip-directed growth. In root hairs, decreased tip-localized PtdIns(4,5)P2 resulting from a loss of the inositol phospholipid transfer protein, Atsfh1p, also resulted in unfocused root hair growth and disruption of the tip-directed actin filament orientation (22Vincent P. Chua M. Nogue F. Fairbrother A. Mekeel H. Xu Y. Allen N. Bibikova T.N. Gilroy S. Bankaitis V.A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Both in pollen and root hairs the data suggested that tip-localized PtdIns(4,5)P2 affected tip growth via F-actin-mediated vesicle trafficking (23Boss W.F. Davis A.J. Im Y.J. Galvao R.M. Perera I.Y. Subcell. Biochem. 2006; 39: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such a role for the inositol lipids in actin-mediated vesicle trafficking was supported by the work of Preuss et al. (24Preuss M.L. Serna J. Falbel T.G. Bednarek S.Y. Nielsen E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1589-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). They showed that mutants in PI4Kβ1 and PI4Kβ2 or treatment with latrunculin (24Preuss M.L. Serna J. Falbel T.G. Bednarek S.Y. Nielsen E. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1589-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) disrupted trafficking of specialized RabA4b-associated Golgi vesicles in root hairs. Blocking turnover of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and increasing PtdIns(4,5)P2 pools by a mutation in inositol lipid phosphatases also affected actin filament orientation and cell wall biosynthesis in inflorescent stems of Arabidopsis (25Zhong R. Burk D.H. Morrison W.H. II I Ye Z.H. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3242-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although all of these data strongly support a role for PtdIns(4,5)P2 regulating actin cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking in plants, the underlying mechanism is not known. Because the major family of plant PIPKs have a very different structure to the PIPKs of animals and yeast, it is important to understand how they are regulated and to identify their interacting partners. In this work our approach was to identify proteins that interact specifically with AtPIPK1 and AtPIPK10 and to determine whether one of the PIPKs would associate with F-actin. We show that Arabidopsis PIPK1 directly interacts with actin and recruits PI4Kβ1, suggesting a plant-specific mechanism for influencing cytoskeletal dynamics and lipid signaling. Because AtPIPK1 has an N-terminal MORN domain with the potential for tight membrane adhesion, the presence of AtPIPK1 on F-actin would provide a discrete pool of PtdIns(4,5,)P2 for actin-mediated vesicle trafficking and/or fusion. Production of GST Fusion Proteins in Escherichia coli—GST-AtPIPK1 and GST-AtPIPK10 were cloned and expressed in E. coli as previously described (4Perera I.Y. Davis A.J. Galanopoulou D. Im Y.J. Boss W.F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3427-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). AtPI4Kβ1 was PCR amplified using Pfx DNA polymerase with forward primer 5′-CACCATGCCGATGGGACGCTTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTCACACTCTTCCATTTAAGACCCGTTGGTA-3′. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO destination vectors (Invitrogen) and then into pDEST15 for expression of GST-AtPI4Kβ1 proteins in E. coli. The inactive form of AtPIPK1, AtPIPK1(K468A), was mutated in the ATP binding site using QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The ATP binding site was identified by sequence homology to that of the Human PtdInsP kinase, HsPIPK1α, and mutated as described (26Park S.J. Itoh T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4781-4787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutated construct was amplified with forward primer 5′-CTCAAGATGATAGATTTATGATCGCAACGGTGAAGAAATCAGAAGTCAAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTGACTTCTGATTTCTTCACCGTTGCGATCATAAATCTATCATCTTGAG-3′. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into the pENTR/SD/D-TOPO destination vectors (Invitrogen) and then into pDEST15 for expression of GST-AtPIPK1(K468A). Truncations of AtPIPK1, MORN, ΔMORN, ΔMORN/ΔL, ΔMORN/ΔC, and ΔMORN/ΔL/ΔC were produced as previously described (27Im Y.J. Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Johannes E. Allen N.S. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5443-5452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All GST fusion proteins were produced and purified as previously described (5Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified recombinant protein bound to the glutathione-Sepharose beads was stored at 4 °C until use in protein binding or activity assays. Plant Material—The recombinant binary plasmid pK7WGF2-HsPIPK1α was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens EHA105 by the freeze-thaw method. For stable transformation, NT-1 cells were transformed using A. tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer following the protocol of Perera et al. (4Perera I.Y. Davis A.J. Galanopoulou D. Im Y.J. Boss W.F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3427-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured weekly into 25 ml of NT-1 culture medium containing 50 μgml–1 kanamycin as described by Perera et al. (4Perera I.Y. Davis A.J. Galanopoulou D. Im Y.J. Boss W.F. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3427-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NT-1 cells expressing ΔMORN were produced as previously described (27Im Y.J. Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Johannes E. Allen N.S. Boss W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5443-5452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Protein Pulldown Assays—Protein pulldown assays were performed with purified recombinant protein incubated with precleared Triton-solubilized Arabidopsis membrane fractions for 2 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing in 30 mm β-cyclodextrin, phosphate-buffered saline (0.1 m KH2PO4, 0.1 m K2HPO4, 135 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl, pH 7.3), and final concentrations of 3 mm ATP or 0.5 mm GTP where indicated. Triton-solubilized Arabidopsis membranes were prepared by incubating a 40,000 × g pellet isolated as described previously in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 10 min at 4 °C then centrifuging at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a Triton-solubilized supernatant (5Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Membrane fractions were precleared by incubating the solubilized membranes with purified GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The cleared supernatant was used for protein-protein interactions. After incubation with the membrane proteins, the beads were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline. Direct interactions of proteins were investigated using purified recombinant proteins either coupled to beads, released from the beads with reduced glutathione (Novagen, manufacturers instructions), or cleaved from the GST tag with thrombin (Novagen, manufacturers instructions) in phosphate-buffered saline or where indicated by using purified native protein. After washing unbound proteins from the beads, the bound proteins and beads were either added directly into 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 100 °C for 5 min for separation by SDS-PAGE, or were used immediately for lipid kinase activity analysis. Mass Spectrometry—After SDS-PAGE, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and stained bands were selected for excision. Digestion was carried out with bands excised from 10% polyacrylamide gel stained with Coomassie in 20 ml of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2. 1 ml of modified trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega) solution (2 mg/ml in 50 mm acetic acid) was added to yield a final enzyme protein ratio of 1:10. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, 2 ml of 1 n HCl was added to bring the mixture to pH 3.0 and inactivate the trypsin. One-half of the sample (10 ml) was moved to another tube and mixed with 2 ml of 0.1 m Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphin (Pierce) in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 3.0. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min for reduction of the disulfide bond-containing tryptic peptides. 1-ml aliquots of reduced or non-reduced tryptic peptide mixtures were used for MALDI-MS analysis without further purification. MALDI time-of-flight MS analyses were carried out using a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) equipped with a pulsed UV nitrogen laser (337 nm, 3-ns pulse) and a dual microchannel plate detector. For molecular mass determination of peptides, spectra were acquired at linear-delayed extraction (DE) mode, acceleration voltage set at 25 kV, grid voltage at 95% of the acceleration voltage, delay time at 320 ns, and low mass gate set at 1000 Da. The mass to charge ratio was calibrated with the molecular mass of a mixture of proteins (mass, 5,734.58–16,952.56). For analysis of tryptic peptides, the spectra were acquired at reflectron-DE mode with acceleration voltage set to 20 kV, grid voltage at 72% of the acceleration voltage, delay time at 200 ns, and low mass gate at 250 Da. The mass to charge ratio was calibrated with the mass of a mixture of standard peptides (mass, 904.46–5,734.58). Saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 70% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix for analysis of tryptic peptides, and saturated sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix for protein analysis. 1 μl of a solution of reduced or non-reduced tryptic peptide mixture was applied on the MALDI plate followed by 1 μl of saturated matrix solution. Spectra were recorded after evaporation of the solvent and processed using Data Explorer software for data collection and analysis. Predicted masses were calculated by the ExPASy Peptide Mass program. Immunoblotting Blotting—After separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting. Membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline. Blots were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h followed by incubation in the secondary antibody for 1 h. Secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase or to IRDye800 (Pierce). For antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase, immunoreactivity was visualized by incubating the blot in SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and exposure to x-ray film. For the fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies, immunoreactivity was detected with Odyssey infrared imaging system (Licor, Lincoln NE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After immunoreactivity detection, total protein was visualized by staining the blots with Amido Black (Sigma). Lipid Kinase Assays—PtdInsP kinase activity and phosphatidylinositol kinase activity was assayed in duplicate as described by (5Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) with a final reaction volume of 50 μl. Each assay contained 10 μg of purified recombinant protein on glutathione-Sepharose beads that had been incubated with solubilized Arabidopsis membrane fraction or with purified proteins and washed once with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Lipid substrate was prepared using PtdIns4P or PtdIns (porcine brain; Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) from 1 or 5 mg/ml stocks, respectively. Lipids were dried under an N2 atmosphere and solubilized for use in the lipid kinase assays in the presence of cyclodextrins as described previously (5Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The lipid kinase assay was performed as described (5Davis A.J. Perera I.Y. Boss W.F. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1783-1789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Lipid extraction was performed using an acid solvent system. Extracted lipids were separated by TLC on silica gel plates (LK5D; Whatman, Clifton, NJ) using a CHCl3:MeOH: NH4OH:water (90:90:7:22, v/v) solvent system. The 32P-labeled phospholipids were quantified with a Bioscan System 500 imaging scanner. Actin Polymerization—Polymerization buffer contained 20 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, pH 6.5 (28Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. 1992; (Oxford University Press, New York): 47-71Google Scholar). Buffer was added to 30 μg of protein from the depolymerized actin fraction from Arabidopsis membranes, 5 μg of plasma membrane isolated from NT-1 cells as described previously (29Heilmann I. Perera I.Y. Gross W. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1999; 229: 1331-1339Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), or to 3 μg of pure actin containing purified recombinant proteins eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads with reduced glutathione. Polymerization reactions were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C, then the F-actin was pelleted by centrifugation. For centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, polymerization volume was 30 μl. For centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min, polymerization volume was 100 μl (28Carraway K.L. Carraway C.A.C. The Cytoskeleton: A Practical Approach. 1992; (Oxford University Press, New York): 47-71Google Scholar). Latrunculin treatments were performed by adding 10 μm latrunculin B to 2 gof 4-day-old NT-1 cells for 1 h (30Van Gestel K. Kohler R.H. Verbelen J.P. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 659-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). An equal volume of Me2SO was used as a control. Cells were harvested, and the plasma membrane was isolated as previously described (29Heilmann I. Perera I.Y. Gross W. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1999; 229: 1331-1339Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Insect Cell Protein Production—Serum-free Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells were obtained from Invitrogen and maintained at 28 °C at a concentration of 2.5 × 105 to 5 × 106 cells ml–1 in Sf-900 II insect cell serum-free medium (Invitrogen). The expression system used was the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated from the recombinant expression vectors according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Optimal production of AtPI4Kβ1 was 2 days after infection, and optimal production of AtPI4Kα1 (31Stevenson-Paulik J. Love J. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and AtPI4Kγ7(ΔN/ΔC) was on the third day after infection. 3R. M. Galvąo and W. F. Boss, unpublished results. All assays were performed using cells optimally producing the respective polypeptide. Infected cells were then harvested and lysed as previously described (31Stevenson-Paulik J. Love J. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cleared lysate was analyzed for protein concentration by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and used for protein-protein interactions. Cyclodextrin Enhanced Recovery of Proteins in Pulldown Reactions—Our first goal was to identify proteins that interacted specifically with AtPIPK1. For this purpose, constructs were developed to produce GST fusion proteins of AtPIPK1 and AtPIPK10 in E. coli to pulldown-interacting proteins from Arabidopsis cell fractions. Fig. 1 shows the production of the recombinant GST-tagged proteins in E. coli as detected by a GST antibody (Fig. 1A) and with antibodies raised against AtPIPK1 or AtPIPK10 (Fig. 1B). Although the antibodies raised against full-length AtPIPK1 and AtPIPK10 readily detected the recombinant E. coli-expressed proteins, these antibodies were unable to detect PtdInsP kinases from an Arabidopsis cell fraction (data not shown), suggesting that the antibodies were not robust and/or that the protein levels were very low. For this reason, we used GST antibodies or activity assays to monitor the enzymes. Because PtdInsP 5-kinase activity was associated with F-actin as well as plasma membranes from plants (18Tan Z. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 2116-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Heilmann I. Perera I.Y. Gross W. Boss W.F. Plant Physiol. 1999; 229: 1331-1339Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 32Sommarin M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 958: 268-278Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar), to increase the recovery of potential interacting proteins, cells were homogenized using a buffer developed to enhance the recovery of F-actin with the membranes (33Abe S. Ito Y. Davies E. J. Exp. Bot. 1992; 43: 941-949Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recovery of interacting proteins was compared using a 40,000 × g pellet and the soluble fraction from 4-day-old Arabidopsis cells grown in suspension culture. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” all fractions isolated from the suspension culture cells were pre-cleared by incubation with purified GST immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads to reduce the number of GST binding proteins. No interacting proteins were evident based on Coomassie and silver staining when the 40,000 × g supernatant was used for the pulldown assays with either GST-AtPIPK1 or GST-AtPIPK10 (data not shown); however, several proteins were evident if the Triton X-100-solubilized membrane fraction was used. Although there were interacting proteins present for both isoforms from the solubilized membrane fraction, there was not enough protein present on the stained gels to identify the proteins by mass spectrometry. To enhance the recovery of the solubilized proteins, we developed a protocol that involved adding cyclodextrins to the pulldown reaction mixture. Cyclodextrins have been used to aid in protein refolding and in sequestering lipids (34Fauvelle F. Debouzy J.C. Crouzy S. Goschl M. Chapron Y. J. Pharm. Sci. 1997; 86: 935-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Karuppiah N. Sharma A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). α-, β-, and γ-cyclodextrins (0–50 mm) were added after pre-clearing the Triton-solubilized membrane proteins to see which if any would enhance the recovery of interacting proteins. γ-Cyclodextrin did not improve the interaction of the Arabidopsis proteins with the recombinant proteins at any of the concentrations tested, and α-cyclodextrin enhanced the interactions of a few of the proteins from the membranes with the recombinant proteins (data not shown); however, when 30 mm β-cyclodextrin was added, there was a 6-fold increase in the recovery of the peptides detected (Fig. 1C). One possible explanation for the enhanced protein recovery is that the cyclodextrin helps the recombinant protein fold properly to allow for interaction with the Arabidopsis peptides (35Karuppiah N. Sharma A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In addition, cyclodextrin will sequester the Triton or lipids present in the membrane fraction and thereby may enhance the interaction of the protein partners during the pulldown reaction. Because β-cyclodextrin enhanced recovery and did not appear to affect the distribution or number of the proteins bands, it was used for all subsequent pulldown experiments using microsomal proteins unless indicated otherwise. AtPIPK1 and AtPIPK10 Recovered Different Proteins Based on Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Using the optimized pull-down conditions for experiments, we were able to recover sufficient amounts of interacting peptides to identify them by mass spectrometry. To eliminate any false positives, we selected only for Coomassie-"
https://openalex.org/W2157817864,"Functional transfer of mitochondrial genes to the nucleus is very common in some taxa but entirely lacking in others. Current evolutionary theories to account for this variation predict that outcrossing, which allows escape from Muller's ratchet and faster spread of beneficial mutations, should favor gene transfer. We find that functional gene transfer is more common in selfing or clonal plants than in outcrossing plants, a pattern opposite to prediction. We suggest that reproductive modes, such as selfing and vegetative reproduction, conserve adaptive mitonuclear gene combinations, allowing functional transfer, whereas outcrossing prevents transfer by breaking up these combinations."
https://openalex.org/W3101145216,"Between the nano- and micrometre scales, the collective behaviour of matter can give rise to startling emergent properties that hint at the nexus between biology and physics. Schrödinger's many-body equation accounts for the behaviour of isolated atoms or molecules up to sizes of a nanometre, but for objects between that sort of size and about a micrometre, things get really complicated. Yet it is this larger realm of 'emerging properties' that some physicists see as the key to a 'theory of everything', or a near as we can get to it. Piers Coleman argues that the introduction of collective behaviour into the equation, far from signalling an end to reductionism, instead heralds the birth of a 'new reductionism' with exciting potential to explain our world."
