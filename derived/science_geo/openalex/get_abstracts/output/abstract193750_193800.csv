(ii) The feeding of the ethionine resulted in a prompt reduction in the levels of serum fatty acids, phospholipides, and cholesterol. See PDF for Figure At the end of 25 days, negligible amounts of these lipides remained in serum. (iii) A reduction in the levels of low- and high-density lipoproteins also resulted from the feeding of ethionine. In general, the extent of reduction in all lipoprotein fractions paralleled that observed in lipides. (iv) The removal of ethionine from the diet led to a prompt restoration of the concentrations of all lipide and lipoprotein constituents to normal."

The materials tested (Chattanooga (carbonaceous) shale, from Tennessee, subbituminous coal, from Wyoming, coal from the Tennessee shale sample, and Swedish kolm) were subjected to destructive distillation. The results were evaluated on the basis of percentages of U in the original sample, in the ash of the sample, in the distillation char, and in the ash of the char. The content of U in the test specimens was determined by the extraction-fluorimetric procedure. From the test results it was concluded that destructive distillation of carbonaceous substances results in no appreciable loss of U."
