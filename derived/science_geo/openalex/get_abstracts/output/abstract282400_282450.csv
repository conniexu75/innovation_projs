https://openalex.org/W2056316750,"A very bright fireball observed over New South Wales in 1978 produced anomalous sounds clearly audible to some of the observers. An investigation of the phenomenon indicates that bright fireballs radiate considerable electromagnetic energy in the very-low-frequency (VLF) region of the spectrum. A mechanism for the production of VLF emissions from the highly energetic wake turbulence of the fireball is proposed. Trials with human subjects revealed a very extended range of thresholds for the perception of electrically excited sounds among a sample population, particularly when the VLF electric field excites surface acoustic waves in surrounding objects. This fact, together with variable propagation effects and local conditions, can account for the sporadic distribution of reports of anomalous sounds from fireballs and auroras."

A similar effect is produced by synthetic xanthopterin. The effect of these materials might be accomplished by (1) catalysis of the enzymatic synthesis of folic acid; (2) the release of folic acid not liberated by takadiastase from tissue complexes; or (3) their serving as substrate material for the enzymatic synthesis of folic acid. The data presented favor the last hypothesis and suggest that xanthopterin, or a substance derived from it, may constitute a portion of the folic acid molecule. The probable involvement of compounds related to ranthopterin in the formation of hemocytopoietic substances in several animal species is discussed."

An alleged scientist ought to have attained his majority when he has passed the twenty-first anniversary of his professional career. Unfortunately he may remain forever a minor, even if he has reached the age of discretion. Nevertheless, I propose to survey the increments to our knowledge of that animal, man, during the past score and odd of years, whether my utterances be the brash pipings of the callow juvenile, the resounding platitudes of waisty middle age, or the reminiscent quaverings of senility. In any event, I firmly absolve myself from responsibility for the anthropological accretions of which I here take note, since any pebble which I in passing may casually have dropped upon the rock pile has simply disappeared in the chinks between the ponder ous contributions of my more substantial colleagues. In short, like the famous young man on the hearse, I have just come for the ride."

https://openalex.org/W2018718075,"Progressive therapeutics depends on research, but at the same time it is a marked stimulant for promoting research. Through research will come much of the post-war advancement which may occur in medicine and allied sciences, drug manufacturing and educational centers. Success and survival will depend not only on cooperation, leadership and a shrewd business sense but on an adequate appreciation of opportunities, limitations and the value of fostering research by providing grants and fellowships. Much material assistance can be provided with mutual gain for all participants when such fellowships are established. This gain may extend past current problems into lifelong associations. If the manufacturer recognizes his opportunities and obligations and forges ahead to challenge or accept them instead of remaining on the defensive, there will be less likelihood of being fettered by purblind policies. Each one interested in research and therapeutics has responsibilities peculiar to himself, but there are few, regardless of occupation, who, at the completion of a job well done, does not feel as Pasteur, who said of the researcher: It is indeed a hard task when you believe you have found an important scientific fact and are feverishly anxious to publish it, to constrain yourself for days, weeks, years sometimes, to fight with yourself, to try to ruin your own experiments and only to proclaim your discovery after having exhausted all contrary hypotheses. But when, after so many efforts, you have at last arrived at certainty, your joy is one of the greatest which can be felt by a human soul, and the thought that you will have contributed to the honor of your country renders that joy still deeper."
