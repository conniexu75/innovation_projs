https://openalex.org/W1986308149,"Using the cytoplasmic domain of Fas in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interacting protein, FADD, which binds Fas and Fas-FD5, a mutant of Fas possessing enhanced killing activity, but not the functionally inactive mutants Fas-LPR and Fas-FD8. FADD contains a death domain homologous to the death domains of Fas and TNFR-1. A point mutation in FADD, analogous to the lpr mutation of Fas, abolishes its ability to bind Fas, suggesting a death domain to death domain interaction. Overexpression of FADD in MCF7 and BJAB cells induces apoptosis, which, like Fas-induced apoptosis, is blocked by CrmA, a specific inhibitor of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme. These findings suggest that FADD may play an important role in the proximal signal transduction of Fas."
https://openalex.org/W2122515902,"Mice deficient in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were generated to test the idea that iNOS defends the host against infectious agents and tumor cells at the risk of contributing to tissue damage and shock. iNOS-/-mice failed to restrain the replication of Listeria monocytogenes in vivo or lymphoma cells in vitro. Bacterial endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) caused shock and death in anesthetized wild-type mice, but in iNOS-/-mice, the fall in central arterial blood pressure was markedly attenuated and early death averted. However, unanesthetized iNOS-/-mice suffered as much LPS-induced liver damage as wild type, and when primed with Propionobacterium acnes and challenged with LPS, they succumbed at the same rate as wild type. Thus, there exist both iNOS-dependent and iNOS-independent routes to LPS-induced hypotension and death."

https://openalex.org/W2085173450,"Fas (also known as Apo1 and CD95) is a cell surface receptor involved in apoptotic cell death. Fas expression and function were analyzed in three children (including two siblings) with a lymphoproliferative syndrome, two of whom also had autoimmune disorders. A large deletion in the gene encoding Fas and no detectable cell surface expression characterized the most affected patient. Clinical manifestations in the two related patients were less severe: Fas-mediated apoptosis was impaired and a deletion within the intracytoplasmic domain was detected. These findings illustrate the crucial regulatory role of Fas and may provide a molecular basis for some autoimmune diseases in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2152445095,"Ligation of the extracellular domain of the cell surface receptor Fas/APO-1 (CD95) elicits a characteristic programmed death response in susceptible cells. Using a genetic selection based on protein-protein interaction in yeast, we have identified two gene products that associate with the intracellular domain of Fas: Fas itself, and a novel 74 kDa protein we have named RIP, for receptor interacting protein. RIP also interacts weakly with the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR1) intracellular domain, but not with a mutant version of Fas corresponding to the murine lprcg mutation. RIP contains an N-terminal region with homology to protein kinases and a C-terminal region containing a cytoplasmic motif (death domain) present in the Fas and TNFR1 intracellular domains. Transient overexpression of RIP causes transfected cells to undergo the morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Taken together, these properties indicate that RIP is a novel form of apoptosis-inducing protein."
https://openalex.org/W2081913102,"Rare major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-like CD1-specific T cells have been isolated from human blood, but it has not been determined whether these clones are part of a defined subset of CD1-specific T cells selected during T cell development, or whether their recognition of CD1 is a fortuitous cross-reaction. In mice, an entire subset of αβ thymocytes with a unique phenotype was found to be CD1-specific. This particular subset, and its human counterpart, provide evidence that CD1 has a general role in selecting and interacting with specialized αβ T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029120000,"Axonal transport has been intensively examined as a good model for studying the mechanism of organelle transport in cells, but it is still unclear how different types of membrane organelles are transported through the nerve axon. To elucidate the function of this mechanism, we have cloned KIF1A, a novel neuron-specific kinesin superfamily motor that was discovered to be a monomeric, globular molecule and that had the fastest reported anterograde motor activity (1.2 microns/s). To identify its cargo, membranous organelles were isolated from the axon. KIF1A was associated with organelles that contained synaptic vesicle proteins such as synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, and Rab3A. However, this organelle did not contain SV2, another synaptic vesicle protein, nor did it contain presynaptic membrane proteins, such as syntaxin 1A or SNAP-25, or other known anterograde motor proteins, such as kinesin and KIF3. Thus, we suggest that the membrane proteins are sorted into different classes of transport organelles in the cell body and are transported by their specific motor proteins through the axon."

Rigorous surface decontamination of the amber and aseptic procedures were used during the recovery of the bacterium. Several lines of evidence indicated that the isolated bacterium was of ancient origin and not an extant contaminant. The characteristic enzymatic, biochemical, and 16S ribosomal DNA profiles indicated that the ancient bacterium is most closely related to extant Bacillus sphaericus."

https://openalex.org/W2041758085,"Minor histocompatibility antigen disparities between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow donors and recipients are a major risk factor for graft versus host disease (GVHD). An HLA-A2.1-restricted cytotoxic T cell clone that recognized the minor histocompatibility antigen HA-2 was previously isolated from a patient with severe GVHD after HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation. The HLA-A2.1-bound peptide representing HA-2 has now been identified. This peptide appears to originate from a member of the non-filament-forming class I myosin family. Because HA-2 has a phenotype frequency of 95 percent in the HLA-A2.1-positive population, it is a candidate for immunotherapeutic intervention in bone marrow transplantation."

https://openalex.org/W2002068275,"Peripheral glia help ensure that motor and sensory axons are bathed in the appropriate ionic and biochemical environment. In Drosophila, peripheral glia help shield these axons against the high K+ concentration of the hemolymph, which would largely abolish their excitability. Here, we describe the molecular genetic analysis of gliotactin, a novel transmembrane protein that is transiently expressed on peripheral glia and that is required for the formation of the peripheral blood-nerve barrier. In gliotactin mutant embryos, the peripheral glia develop normally in many respects, except that ultrastructurally and physiologically they do not form a complete blood-nerve barrier. As a result, peripheral motor axons are exposed to the high K+ hemolymph, action potentials fail to propagate, and the embryos are nearly paralyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2048745424,"An optical pumping technique was used to enhance and localize nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals from an n-doped GaAs/Al0.1Ga0.9As multiple quantum well structure, permitting direct radio-frequency measurements of gallium-71 NMR spectra and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rates (1/T1) as functions of temperature (1.6 K < T < 4.2 K) and the Landau level filling factor (0.66 < v < 1.76). The measurements reveal effects of electron-electron interactions on the energy levels and spin states of the two-dimensional electron system confined in the GaAs wells. Minima in 1/T1 at v approximately 1 and v approximately 2/3 indicate energy gaps for electronic excitations in both integer and fractional quantum Hall states. Rapid, temperature-independent relaxation at intermediate v values indicates a manifold of low-lying electronic states with mixed spin polarizations."

A phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain has been identified which also binds specifically to tyrosine-phosphorylated targets, but is structurally different from SH2 domains. Expression cloning was used to identify targets of PTB domains. PTB domains bound to phosphotyrosine within a sequence motif, asparagine-X1-X2-phosphotyrosine (where X represents any amino acid), that is found in many signaling proteins and is not recognized by SH2 domains. Mutational studies indicated that high affinity binding of PTB domains may require a specific conformation of the motif."

Tytell A.A. Lampson G.P. Hilleman M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) or viral infection (2Ho M. Billiau A. Interferon 1: General and Applied Aspects. Elsevier, Amsterdam, The Netherlands1984: 79-120Google Scholar). IFNs induce the transcription of a large family of genes (3Williams B.R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) involved in the defense against viral infections, the control of cell proliferation and differentiation, and the modulation of immune responses (4Petska S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar).The 2-5A system is one of the major pathways induced by IFN; it has been implicated in some of the antiviral activities of the IFNs and might play an essential role in regulating RNA turnover and stability in cells (5Content J. Perez-Bercoff R. The Molecular Basis of Viral Replication. Plenum Press, New York1987: 163-189Crossref Google Scholar, 6Hassel B.A. Zhou A. Sotomayor C. Maran A. Silverman R.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).It has been described as composed of three enzymatic activities, e.g. 2-5A-synthetases, 2-5A-phosphodiesterase, and RNase L. 2-5A-synthetases are a family of four IFN-inducible enzymes which, upon activation by double-stranded RNA, convert ATP into the unusual series of oligomers known as 2-5A (7Kerr I.M. Brown R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 8Chebath J. Benech P. Hovanessian A. Galabru J. Revel M. J. Biol.

The 2-5A-phosphodiesterase might be involved in the catabolism of 2-5A from its 2′,3′ end (10Johnston M.I. Hearl W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8377-8382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steady state level of 2-5A, which is very unstable, could also be controlled by dephosphorylation by phosphatases (11Bayard B. Bisbal C. Silhol M. Cnockaert J. Huez G. Lebleu B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The 2-5A-dependent endoribonuclease L or RNase L is the effector enzyme of this system. Its activation by subnanomolar levels of 2-5A leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis by cleavage of mRNAs at the 3′ side of UpNp sequences (12Floyd-Smith G. Slattery E. Lengyel P. Science. 1981; 212: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).Variations in intracellular 2-5A and 2-5A-synthetase(s) levels have been observed during virus infection, cell growth, or cell differentiation even in the absence of exogenous IFN treatment (13Sen G. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Published data are more contradictory concerning RNase L; some suggest that IFN treatment or cell growth status increase RNase L activity whereas others report no alteration in RNase L activity in these circumstances (see Ref. 13Sen G. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for a review). These apparent contradictions might be explained by differences in the sensitivity of the methods used to detect RNase L. RNase L can indeed be detected by its binding to a radioactive 2-5A-3′-[32P]pCp probe (14Silverman R.H. Wreschner D.H. Gilbert C.S. Kerr I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 15Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), by its ability to degrade mRNAs (16Nilsen T.W. Maroney P.A. Baglioni C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7806-7811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or by Western blotting with polyclonal (17Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5808-5813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or monoclonal antibodies (18Salehzada T. Silhol M. Steff A.M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7733-7740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The correlations between variations of 2-5A/RNase L and the control of cell growth and differentiation, however, plead for a more general physiological role of this system. It is interesting to note here that RNase L is preferentially associated to polyribosomes (17Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5808-5813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RNase L was first described as a 200-kDa protein (19Slattery E. Ghosh N. Samanta H. Lengyel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4778-4782Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Its molecular weight varies with the conditions of analysis, with the protein concentrations, or with the origin of cell extract (20Floyd-Smith G. Yoshie O. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8584-8587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bisbal C. Salehzada T. Lebleu B. Bayard B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Zhou et al.(1993) have cloned a 80-kDa polypeptide (2DR) which binds 2-5A and cleaves poly(uridylic acid) in a reticulocyte extract but not in a wheat-germ extract (22Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). More recently the properties of the 2DR were studied after expression of its cDNA in insect cells and purification to homogeneity (23Dong B. Xu L. Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Lee X. Torrence P. Silverman R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14153-14158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have recently characterized a monoclonal antibody (mAb3) which neutralizes RNase L activity; it recognizes a RNA-binding protein of 80 kDa associated (but distinct) with the previously known 2-5A binding 80-kDa protein and with 2DR. We have therefore proposed that the high molecular mass protein complex (around 200 kDa) first characterized as RNase L contains at least two distinct polypeptides e.g. a 2-5A-binding protein (2-5ABP or 2DR) and a mAb3 recognized polypeptide which has been called RNABP (18Salehzada T. Silhol M. Steff A.M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7733-7740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its rôle in the functioning and regulation of RNase L in intact cells has not yet been elucidated.The control of mRNA turnover rate is now recognized as a critical element of gene expression regulation. However, the mechanisms responsible for mRNA degradation in mammalian cells are poorly understood (24Sachs A.B Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). The 2-5A system appears as a well characterized system of RNA degradation which might be involved in the control of RNA metabolism.We describe here the cloning of a polypeptide inhibitor of the 2-5A pathway; it will be referred to as RLI for RNase L inhibitor. This protein was isolated from an expression library by binding to 2-5ApCp. In vitro translation of this cDNA gives rise to a protein of 68 kDa which associates specifically with 2-5ABP and RNABP as shown by immunoprecipitation with the mAb3 monoclonal antibody. This in vitro translated 68-kDa protein can also form a complex with the 2DR protein.Evidence is prevailed that RLI is a regulatory protein whose co-expression inhibits the binding of 2-5A by the endogenous RNase L or by 2DR, and as a consequence the 2-5A-dependent activation of RNase L. RLI does not promote 2-5A degradation.Moreover the overexpression of the RLI cDNA in HeLa cells results in the inhibition of the IFN-activated 2-5A pathway.Although not regulated by IFN treatment RLI might be a key component of the IFN system and of the regulation of RNA stability in mammalian cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Cell ExtractsDaudi cells were grown in suspension culture and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 60 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells were grown in the same medium with 2 mM glutamine. Cells were treated with Huα/β IFN, as indicated; IFN was a generous gift of Dr. Ara Hovanessian (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France).Cell extracts were prepared as described previously (18Salehzada T. Silhol M. Steff A.M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7733-7740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); briefly, the cells were resuspended in 2 volumes of hypotonic buffer, disrupted in a Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g.Radiobinding Assay for RNase L and Radiocovalent Affinity Labeling of RNase LThe radiobinding assay (25Knight M. Cayley P.J. Silverman R.H. Wreshner D.H. Gilbert C.S. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1980; 288: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and the covalent labeling procedure (26Wreschner D.H. Silverman R.H. James T.C. Gilbert C.S. Kerr I.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 124: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were performed with S10 cell extracts, rabbit-reticulocyte lysates, or wheat-germ extracts (with or without the different cloned proteins translated) as a source of RNase L. 2-5A4-3′-[32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol) (27Bayard B. Bisbal C. Lebleu B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3730-3736Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used as probe, as indicated in the legends of the figures. The radiobinding and radiocovalent labeling procedures were utilized with the modifications previously described (21Bisbal C. Salehzada T. Lebleu B. Bayard B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Isolation of cDNA ClonesThe λ-Zap Daudi cell cDNA library (106 plaques) was a generous gift from Dr. G. Uzé (IGMM, Montpellier, France). It was screened with 2-5A4-3′-[32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol). The nitrocellulose filters were soaked in 10 mM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, dried, and overlaid onto phage plates for 3 h at 37°C. The filters were rinsed in buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 80 mM KCl, 5 mM Mg(OAc)2, 1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mM β-mercaptoethanol) (15Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) saturated with 5% (v/v) skimmed milk in buffer A, and rinsed again in buffer A without milk. They were then incubated overnight at 4°C in buffer A with 2-5A4-3′-[32P]pCp (5 × 105 disintegrations/min/filter). After washing in buffer A, the filters were autoradiographed on x-ray films. This procedure has led to the isolation of a 2861-bp clone named H2ABP.An internal primer determined from the sequence of H2APB was used to isolate by anchored PCR a full-length cDNA of 3568 bp coding for RLI (see Fig. 1A). Briefly, poly(dT) cDNA was first tailed with dG nucleotides with terminal transferase. This cDNA (0.5 μg) was amplified by PCR (30 cycles) in a final volume of 50 μl using a 5′ poly(dC) primer with PstI and BamHI sites (5′-TTTCTGCAGGATCCCCCCCCCCCC-3′) and an internal primer (5′-CACTTAGATCATGTTCCACCACAAT-3′) as described in Fig. 1A. This cDNA fragment was cloned in the BglII site of H2ABP to give the full-length cDNA of 3568 bp.The 2DR cDNA was obtained by PCR with primers determined from the published sequence (22Zhou A. Hassel B.A. Silverman R.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar).Nucleotide Sequence AnalysisH2ABP in pSK (pBluescript II SK, Stratagene) was sequenced by the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method (T7 sequencing kit, Pharmacia) after nested 3′ deletions. These deletions were generated with exonuclease III-S1 nuclease digestion followed by filling in with Klenow DNA polymerase (Pharmacia). The full-length cDNA was sequenced with the Sanger dideoxy method and internal primers.RNA AnalysisTotal cellular RNA was prepared using the guanidine thiocyanate-lithium chloride procedure (28Cathala G. Savouret J.F. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D DNA. 1983; 4: 327-333Google Scholar). Northern blot hybridizations were performed by standard techniques (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Probes were synthesized by the multiprime procedure (Ready-to-go kit, Pharmacia). After autoradiography, mRNAs were quantified by image analysis with the Bioimage program on a Millipore Sun Station. Each lane was normalized with the GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) probe.In Vitro Synthesis of RNA Coding for RLI and 2DRTranscription with T3 polymerase in the presence of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G was performed as described by the manufacturer (Promega). RNA was analyzed and quantified by electrophoresis in 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels in TBE buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8, 50 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA). RNA was extracted by phenol-dichloromethan (v/v) and precipitated with ethanol, 250 mM NaCl.In vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (with or without canine pancreatic microsomes), or in wheat-germ extracts were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The quantity of endogenous RNase L was estimated by the amount of bound 2-5ApCp, e.g. 9 × 103 disintegrations/min. Since the 2-5ApCp had a specific activity of 3 × 103 Ci/mmol and since it is considered that RNase L binds 2-5ApCp in a 1:1 ratio (30Silverman R. Jung D. Nolan-Sorden N. Dieffenbach C. Kedar V. SenGupta D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7336-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the amount of RNase L in the reticulocyte lysate assay is 1.3 × 10−15 mol. The translation of 2DR led to a 2-fold increase in the binding of 2-5ApCp; the amount of RNase L in the reticulocyte extract is therefore 2.6 × 10−15 mol. The concentration of the translated proteins was also quantified by [35S]methionine incorporation (specific activity 103 Ci/mmol). This later technique gave the same result for 2DR and 0.8 × 10−15 mol for the RLI.Reticulocyte translation incubations were used as a source of RLI, 2DR, or endogenous RNase L. Translation usually took place for 60 min at 30°C. Aliquots of each were mixed to generate various ratios of these proteins in 2-5A binding or RNA cleavage assays.Ribosomal RNA Cleavage by RNase LSpecific hydrolysis of rRNAs by 2-5A-activated RNase L was monitored in reticulocyte extracts with some modifications previously described (18Salehzada T. Silhol M. Steff A.M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7733-7740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RLI and 2DR were produced in rabbit reticulocyte extracts. The control extract was incubated in the same conditions as the extracts used for cell-free expression of 2DR or RLI cDNA. The different translation incubations were complemented or not with 100 nM 2-5A4 and further incubated for 30 min at 30°C. RNAs were extracted with phenol-dichloromethan and precipitated with 2 volumes of ethanol, 300 mM sodium acetate. The pellet was dried and resuspended in an electrophoresis loading buffer containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, TBE buffer, and 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue. Samples were analyzed on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel in TBE buffer. rRNAs and their degradation products were quantified by image analysis with the Bioimage program on a Millipore Sun Station.Western Blot Analysis and ImmunoprecipitationCell extracts or in vitro translated polypeptides were analyzed by Western blot (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44708) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose sheet. The nitrocellulose membrane was hybridized with 2-5ApCp (15Salehzada T. Silhol M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) or with mAb3 monoclonal antibody (18Salehzada T. Silhol M. Steff A.M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7733-7740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts or translation incubations were incubated 3 h at room temperature with a 1/1,000 dilution of mAb3 or control antibody. RNase L-antibody complexes were incubated overnight at 4°C with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and recovered by centrifugation. The beads were washed several times with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) aprotinin, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, and resuspended in one volume of 300 mM Tris, pH 8.9, 5% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 20% (v/v) glycerol buffer. The protein A-Sepharose was heated for 5 min at 95°C, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Stability of 2-5ApCp-Reticulocyte extracts were complemented or not with RLI or 2DR mRNA and incubated 1 h at 30°C in translation conditions. 2-5ApCp was then added, and the extracts were incubated at 4°C for 15 min (as for radiobinding) or at 37°C for increasing periods of time as indicated in the legend of Fig. 7. The loading buffer containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 1% (v/v) bromphenol blue, and 1% (v/;V) xylene cyanol was added. The samples were boiled 3 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were loaded onto 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels containing 7 M urea. The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis at 1,100-1,600 V until the bromphenol blue dye reached 15 cm from the bottom of the gel. The wet gel was exposed to a Kodak XAR5 x-ray film (32Miele M.B. Liu D.K. Kan N.C. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Fig. 7Stability of 2-5ApCp in reticulocyte extracts with or without RLI. 2-5ApCp (lanes 0, 3, and 10) was incubated with reticulocyte extract alone (lanes 1, 4, 6, and 8) or with reticulocyte extract and RLI (lanes 2, 5, 7, and 9) for 15 min at 4°C (lanes 1 and 2), or for 15 min (lanes 4 and 5), 30 min (lanes 6 and 7), 60 min (lanes 8 and 9) at 37°C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Expression Vectors and TransfectionsThe human H2ABP cDNA which encoded a truncated active form of RLI was directionally subcloned in pcDNAIneo (Invitrogen) by standard methods (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). H2ABP/pcDNAIneo or plasmid pcDNAneoI (7 μg each) were transfected in HeLa cells by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Stable transfectants were selected by culturing the cells in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Individual clones were isolated for analysis of expression of the transfected cDNA. The clone which expressed the cDNA at the highest level was selected for further studies.Antiviral Activity of InterferonspcDNAneo or H2ABP/pcDNAIneo cells were seeded at 105 cells/well. Cells were treated 24 h later with different dilutions of Huα/β interferon for 20 h. Cells were then infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0 for 1 h at 37°C in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Unadsorbed viruses were removed by three washings with RPMI containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Virus titers were determined 18 h later by an end point assay as described previously (33Milhaud P.G. Silhol M. Faure T. Milhaud X. Ann. Virol. 1983; 134E: 405-416Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression Cloning of Human RLIHuman Daudi cells were chosen as a source of mRNA because they contain a high basal level of 2-5A binding activity. The cDNA library (λ-Zap) was screened with a radiolabeled 2-5ApCp probe using the technique we have developed for the renaturation of RNase L activity on filter (15 and “Experimental Procedures”). We identified one positive clone among 106 plaques. This clone named H2ABP for human 2-5A binding protein contains a 2861-bp insert. It has an initiator ATG at residue 225 and is translated as a 39-kDa protein in rabbit reticulocyte extract or in wheat-germ extract. It is in an open reading from the first nucleotide. The full-length cDNA was, therefore, isolated by anchored PCR with the internal primer described in Fig. 1A. A 924-bp fragment which overlaps the H2ABP clone by 217 bp was obtained. This sequence was added to H2ABP by cloning in the BglII site. The sequence of the complete 3568-bp clone (RLI) is presented in Fig. 1B.Sequence Analysis of RLIRLI cDNA has a 5′-non-coding region of 118 nucleotides, a predicted open reading frame extending until nucleotide 1914, and a long 3′-untranslated region of 1654 bp. The open reading frame of 599 amino acids encodes a polypeptide of predicted molecular weight 67,515. The ATG at the beginning of the open reading frame has the characteristics of a “strong” initiator codon, e.g. a purine in position −3 and a G in +4 (34Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2794) Google Scholar). RLI contains two repeated ATP/GTP-binding sites or P-loop motifs (35Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar) : one from residues 110 to 117 and another from residues 379 to 386. Interestingly, RLI has a complete homology with the CX2CX2CX3C:4Fe4S-Ferredoxin motif between amino acids 55 and 66 (see Ref. 36Prince C.P. Grossman M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 153-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar for a review). Another remarkable feature is an internal repeat of 128 amino acids with 53% homology starting at amino acids 200 and 440 (Fig. 1B). RLI has a high number (32Miele M.B. Liu D.K. Kan N.C. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) of thiol groups and is very rich in leucine residues. Its estimated isoelectric point is 8.7.No significative homology with other cDNAs in the EMBL and Genbank data bases has been found.Regulation of RLI RNAs Expression by IFNThe cDNA of RLI hybridized with two cellular mRNAs of 3.5 and 2.8 kb in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). The same result was obtained in Daudi and CEM cells (data not shown). Huα/β IFN treatment did not regulate the two mRNAs which hybridize with the RLI clones, even at high concentration. There was no quantitative variation of these mRNAs as a function of the duration of IFN treatment. An induction of the 15-kDa protein, which has been described to be induced by IFN treatment (37Blomstrom D.C. Fahey D. Kutny R. Korant B.D. Knight Jr., E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8811-8816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was observed in the same conditions thus confirming that cells responded normally to IFN treatment.Fig. 2Regulation of RLI mRNA expression by human α/β-IFN. A, Northern blot analysis of total cytoplasmic RNA extracted from non-treated HeLa cells or from cells treated with 103 units/ml of Huα/β IFN for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 18, or 24 h. RNAs (20 μg) were fractionated on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and hybridized with the RLI cDNA probe, with a human 15-kDa probe or with a human GAPDH probe. The filter was submitted to autoradiography for 5 h for the GAPDH probe and for 12 h for the other probes. B, Northern blot analysis of total cytoplasmic RNA extracted from HeLa cells. RNAs (20 μg) were fractionated on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel and hybridized with the A and B RLI cDNA probes described in Fig. 1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To approach the difference between the 2.8- and 3.5-kb mRNAs, we made use of a 762-bp probe (A in Fig. 2B) specific of the 5′ end of RLI and a 764-bp probe (B in Fig. 2B) representing its 3′ end; their hybridization positions are indicated in Fig. 1A. As shown in Fig. 2B, probe A hybridizes with the two mRNAs while probe B hybridizes uniquely to the larger mRNA. These two mRNAs therefore differ in their 3′-untranslated region. The similarity between the sizes of the two natural mRNAs and those of the cDNAs we have cloned is purely coincidental.In a chase experiment using actinomycin D, the half-life of the RLI mRNAs was estimated to be 4 h in HeLa cells (data not shown).In Vitro Expression and Properties of RLIThe biological properties of the RLI clone were studied after expression in two cell-free translation systems, e.g. in a wheat-germ S30 (which is deficient in 2-5A/RNase L system) and in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (in which the 2-5A/RNase L system is present).The expression of the full-length RLI cDNA in wheat-germ or in rabbit reticulocyte extracts gave rise to a single polypeptide of 68 kDa as expected (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). The translation of 2DR cDNA gave rise to a single polypeptide of 80 kDa (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). The level of expression was a little lower in wheat-germ extract than in reticulocyte lysate for the two clones. No post-translational modifications of these polypeptides were observed when they were translated in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes (data not shown). The 2DR and RLI cDNA translation products were not recognized by the mAb3-specific monoclonal antibody that we have developed against RNase L (18Salehzada T. Silhol M. Steff A.M. Lebleu B. Bisbal C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7733-7740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, and as expected, only the 80 kDa polypeptide (RNABP) was revealed in reticulocyte extract, either before or after translation (compare lanes 1 to lanes 2 and 3). Likewise mAb3 did not recognize any proteins in the wheat-germ extract in which the 2-5A/RNase L system, and consequently RNABP is absent.Fig. 3In vitro translation of RLI cDNA. A, RLI (lanes 2 and 4) or 2DR (lanes 1 and 3) cDNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro in reticulocyte (lanes 1 and 2) or in wheat-germ (lanes 3 and 4) extracts in the presence of [35S]methionine. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. B, reticulocyte extracts with no mRNA (lane 1), after translation of 2DR (lane 2), or RLI (lane 3), and wheat-germ extracts with no mRNA (lane 4), after translation of 2DR (lane 5), or RLI (lane 6) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with the mAb3 monoclonal antibody specific of the RNase L complex. C, translation reactions of 2DR or RLI in wheat-germ or reticulocyte extracts and control extracts were spotted on nitrocellulose. No RNase L, 2DR, or RLI in wheat germ (0); 0.8 × 10−15 mol of RLI in wheat germ or in reticulocyte extracts (RLI); 1.3 × 10−15 mol of 2DR in wheat germ or in reticulocyte extracts (2DR); 1.3 × 10−15 mol of endogenous RNase L in reticulocyte e"

A potential role for A20, a novel zinc finger protein, in inhibiting B-cell apoptosis was suggested by our previous finding that it is induced by the Epstein-Barr virus LMP-1 gene product, a potent cell death inhibitor. We now show that CD40 activation induces A20 and that expression of A20 renders B-cell lines resistant to PCD. Additionally, we show that CD40 activation of A20 expression is mediated by inducible binding of NF-κB complexes to the A20 promoter and provide evidence for a critical role for Thr234 (in the CD40 cytoplasmic domain) in activating NF-κB.

The VWF-GPIb interaction was investigated by clustered charged-to-alanine scanning mutagenesis of VWF domain A1 between His-473 and Gly-716. Recombinant variants of VWF were assayed for binding to conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody NMC-4, for ristocetin-induced and botrocetin-induced binding to platelets, and for direct binding to botrocetin. Substitutions at 32 amino acids had no effect on VWF function. The epitope of NMC-4 depended on charged residues between Asp-514 and Arg-632 and not on segments previously implicated by peptide inhibition studies, Cys-474-Pro-488 and Leu-694-Pro-708. Substitutions at Glu-626 and in the segment Asp-520-Lys-534 abolished ristocetin-induced binding of VWF to GPIb but did not affect botrocetin-induced binding, suggesting that these regions are required for modulation by ristocetin but not for binding of VWF to GPIb.

It circulates in the blood as disulfide-linked multimers that are assembled from subunits of ≈250 kDa. The VWF multimers range in size from dimers of ≈500 kDa to >10,000 kDa. VWF does not bind spontaneously to platelets in blood but promotes thrombus formation by mediating platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury. This activation of adhesive properties is induced in vivo upon the binding of VWF to subendothelial connective tissue, particularly under the conditions of high shear stress that occur in the microcirculation. Activated VWF binds to the α chain of platelet glycoprotein Ib (GPIb) (1Handa M. Titani K. Holland L.Z. Roberts J.R. Ruggeri Z.M. J. Biol.

The first KpnI site was mutated by changing the codon for G100 from GGT to GGA, generating the plasmid pSVHVWF1.1. Plasmid pGEM-4ZNK (19Dong Z. Thoma R.S. Crimmins D.L. McCourt D.W. Tuley E.A.

DNA fragments containing each of 33 mutations were produced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using a polymerase chain reaction method essentially as previously described (19Dong Z. Thoma R.S.

Mutated NgoMI-KpnI fragments were recloned into pGEM-4ZNae, and the entire sequence was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing (Sequenase 2.0, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The mutated NgoMI-KpnI fragments then were cloned into pSVHVWF1.1. Human 293T cells (22Dubridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.S. Leong P.-M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell.

Ginsburg (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected by a calcium-phosphate method (23Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). In mock transfections, vector pSV7D DNA (24Burke R.L. Pachl C. Quiroga M. Rosenberg S. Haigwood N. Nordfang O. Ezban M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12574-12578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed once with phosphated-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with serum-free medium (Optimem-1, Life Technologies, Inc.). Recombinant VWF (rVWF) secreted in the medium was harvested 48 h later and concentrated using Centriprep-30 and Centricon-100 devices (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The VWF antigen was measured by an ELISA assay using polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF antibody 082 and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-human VWF antibody P226 (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) (25Tuley E.A. Gaucher C. Jorieux S. Worrall N.K. Sadler J.E. Mazurier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Multimer analysis was performed as described (26Raines G. Aumann H. Sykes S. Street A. Thromb. Res. 1990; 60: 201-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (<40 μl) of concentrated medium containing ≈70 ng of VWF were subjected to SDS-1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The VWF was detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-human VWF 082 (DAKO) and the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Monoclonal antibody NMC-4 was purified from ascites fluid by chromatography on recombinant protein A-agarose (RepliGen, Cambridge, MA) (27Ey P.L. Prowse S.J. Jenkin C.R. Immunochemistry. 1978; 15: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). The binding of NMC-4 to rVWF was assayed by ELISA as described above (25Tuley E.A. Gaucher C. Jorieux S. Worrall N.K. Sadler J.E. Mazurier C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6377-6381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) except that microtiter ELISA plates with U-shaped bottoms (Coster, Cambridge, MA) were coated for 24 h at 4°C with 25 μl of NMC-4, 7.5 μg/ml, in 0.1 M sodium carbonate, pH 9.6. The wells were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and then incubated for 105 min at room temperature with 15 μl of various concentrations of wild type or mutant rVWF diluted in PBS containing 3% BSA. The wells were washed again and incubated for 105 min at room temperature with 20 μl of peroxidase-conjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-human VWF P226 (DAKO) diluted 1:5000 in PBS containing 3% BSA. The plates were washed and incubated for 7 min with 100 μl of o-phenylenediamine solution (Sigma). The reaction was stopped by adding 3 M sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 490 nm was determined. Control assays performed with concentrated conditioned media from mock-transfected 293T cells gave absorbance values of zero. Ristocetin-induced binding of VWF to platelets was assayed as described (20Randi A.M. Jorieux S. Tuley E.A. Mazurier C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the total reaction volume (100 μl) contained 500 ng/ml rVWF, 2 × 108/ml human lyophilized platelets (Biodata, Hatboro, PA), 4% BSA (Sigma), and various concentrations (0-1.5 mg/ml) of ristocetin (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The VWF antigen present in the supernatant was measured by ELISA. Reaction mixtures without platelets were tested simultaneously to verify the absence of nonspecific VWF flocculation and sedimentation in the presence of ristocetin. Botrocetin-induced binding of VWF to platelets was assayed essentially as previously described (19Dong Z. Thoma R.S. Crimmins D.L. McCourt D.W. Tuley E.A. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6753-6758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 570 ng/ml rVWF, 0.2% BSA and various concentrations (0-20 μg/ml) of botrocetin in TBS. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the reaction mixtures were centrifuged, and VWF in the supernatant was measured by ELISA. Control assays were performed in the absence of platelets. With two exceptions, the mutant rVWF proteins did not bind spontaneously to platelets, and the results of platelet binding assays are expressed as the percentage of unbound VWF antigen relative to the value obtained with platelets but without ristocetin or botrocetin. In the case of the variant R545A in both assays and the variant (687-689)3A in the botrocetin-induced platelet binding assay, spontaneous binding to platelets occurred, and the values obtained in the presence of modulators were compared with those obtained without platelets or modulators. To summarize binding data in graphical form, values obtained for each mutant at specific concentrations of ristocetin or botrocetin were normalized to the corresponding values obtained for wild type rVWF as follows. 100−% unbound variant VWF100−% unbound wild type VWF×100(Eq. 1) Botrocetin binding to VWF was assayed according to Fujimura et al.(28Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Oyama R. Matsui T. Fukui H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Botrocetin (60 μg) was radioiodinated with 125I using a chloramine-T method (29Hunter W.M. Grenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (5859) Google Scholar) to a specific radioactivity of ≈2.5 × 106 cpm/μg, and the concentration of botrocetin was adjusted to 3 μg/ml in TBS containing 1% BSA. Anti-VWF monoclonal antibody 33E12 (18Mazurier C. Gaucher C. Jorieux S. Parquet G.A. Goudemand M. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 76: 372-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of the VWF subunit and has no effect on VWF binding to platelets in the presence of either ristocetin or botrocetin. The concentration of each mutant rVWF was determined by ELISA, with antibody 33E12 as the first antibody, and adjusted to 5 μg/ml with TBS. Polystyrene microtiter plates with eight strips (Coster) were coated for 16 h at 4°C with 100 μl of antibody 33E12 (10 μg/ml). After coating, the wells were washed three times with TBS, blocked with 3% BSA in TBS for 2 h at room temperature, and incubated with 25 μl of rVWF (5 μg/ml) for 3 h at room temperature. The wells were washed four times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-Tween), and radiolabeled botrocetin solution (5 μl, ≈35,000 cpm) was added for 30 min at room temperature. The wells were washed rapidly five times with TBS-Tween; the total time of washing wells was <1 min. After drying, each well was cut out, and the bound radioactivity was measured by γ spectroscopy. Nonspecific binding was obtained by testing concentrated supernatant from mock-transfected cells in the same assay system and was ≈1,400 cpm. Binding to wild type rVWF was ≈7,500 cpm. Specific binding for each mutant rVWF was calculated by subtracting nonspecific from total binding and normalized to the value obtained for wild type rVWF. The segment of VWF that was targeted for mutagenesis consists of ≈254 amino acid residues between His-463 and Gly-716. This segment contains domain A1 and part of VWF domain D3 (Fig. 1) and encompasses a fragment produced by digestion of VWF with dispase (Leu-480/Val-481-Gly-718); this fragment binds GPIb in a ristocetin-dependent or botrocetin-dependent manner (7Andrews R.K. Gorman J.J. Booth W.J. Corino G.L. Castaldi P.A. Berndt M.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8326-8336Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Miura S. Fujimura Y. Sugimoto M. Kawasaki T. Ikeda Y. Titani K. Yoshioka A. Blood. 1994; 84: 1553-1558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To simplify the production and analysis of mutant constructs, a clustered charged-to-alanine scanning strategy was chosen (14Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 15Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). All 68 charged amino acids including arginine, lysine, aspartate, glutamate, and histidine were changed singly or in small clusters to alanine. The 68 charged residues in the target sequence were covered in a total of 33 constructs (Fig. 1). For convenience the variant proteins were named according to the residue number of the mutated amino acid in the mature VWF subunit. If more than one charged amino acid was mutated, the range of residue numbers and the number of alanine substitutions is indicated. For example, in construct R545A, one arginine at position 545 was changed to alanine; in construct(557-563)4A, the four residues Glu-557, His-559, Asp-560, and His-563 were changed to alanine. To facilitate the mutagenesis procedure, the expression construct pSVHVWF1 was modified by eliminating the KpnI site at codon 99 of the VWF cDNA sequence. The resultant plasmid pSVHVWF1.1 has unique KpnI and NgoMI sites that facilitated the mutagenesis of amino acids 442-821 by a cassette replacement method. Human kidney 293T cells were transfected with each construct, and serum-free media were analyzed for the expression of mutant human rVWF. Initially, a construct containing the two mutations R511A and D514A was not detectably secreted; therefore, the independent mutants R511A and D514A were constructed and analyzed instead. All other mutant constructs were expressed and secreted efficiently. By ELISA, the level of expression of the variant rVWF proteins was 66 ± 23% (S.D.) of wild type rVWF. The rVWF was concentrated and subjected to multimer analysis using SDS-agarose gel electrophoresis without protein reduction. The multimer distribution of all the mutant proteins was similar to that of wild type rVWF and plasma VWF (Fig. 2). In every case, at least 12 multimer bands could be detected. The functional properties of the mutant VWF proteins were studied in four assays that depend on the GPIb binding domain. Antibody NMC-4 recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope within the A1 domain of VWF (9Mohri H. Fujimura Y. Shima M. Yoshioka A. Houghten R.A. Ruggeri Z.M. Zimmerman T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17901-17904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fujimura Y. Usami Y. Titani K. Niinomi K. Nishio K. Takase T. Yoshioka A. Fukui H. Blood. 1991; 77: 113-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shima M. Morimoto J. Imai S. Tsubura Y. Yoshioka A. Fukui H. J. Nara Med. Assoc. 1985; 36: 662-669Google Scholar). Reactivity with NMC-4 therefore was determined to provide an index of the structural integrity of the A1 domain of rVWF, and decreases in reactivity were used to localize the epitope of NMC-4. The ability to bind to platelet GPIb was assessed in the presence of ristocetin or botrocetin. In addition, the direct binding of radiolabeled botrocetin to each mutant rVWF protein was determined. Plasma VWF and wild type rVWF bound to NMC-4 with similar concentration dependence (Fig. 3A). Wild type rVWF appeared to bind slightly more avidly than plasma VWF; the cause of this apparent minor difference is not known but might be due to subtle differences in glycosylation or multimer structure or to proteolytic degradation of plasma VWF. The binding data for the mutant rVWF proteins are summarized in Fig. 3B. Compared to wild type rVWF, 26 mutant rVWF proteins bound normally to NMC-4. Seven mutant rVWF proteins exhibited ≤50% of normal binding to NMC-4: D514A,(520-524)2A,(549-552)2A,(608-611)3A,(613-616)2A, (629-632)2A, and R632A. These results suggest that amino acids in at least three discontinuous segments of domain A1 contribute directly to the epitope for NMC-4 or are required indirectly for its conformation. The conditions for ristocetin-induced binding of rVWF to platelets were optimized for wild type rVWF. In the absence of platelets, addition of ristocetin (1.5 mg/ml) directly to wild type rVWF (500 ng/ml) in conditioned medium was associated with precipitation and sedimentation of the VWF during centrifugation. This nonspecific aggregation was prevented by addition of 4% BSA (data not shown). Under these conditions, the binding of wild type rVWF to formalin-fixed human platelets increased as a function of ristocetin concentration, reaching a maximum of ≈40% binding at 1.5 mg/ml ristocetin (Fig. 4). Binding was blocked by monoclonal antibody 6D1 to platelet GPIb (16Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A. Blood. 1983; 61: 99-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown) as previously reported (20Randi A.M. Jorieux S. Tuley E.A. Mazurier C. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ristocetin-induced binding to platelets was determined for each mutant rVWF at several concentrations of ristocetin.2( 2Complete dose response binding data for all constructs are available from the authors upon request.) The dose response for wild type rVWF was determined simultaneously to control for variations among platelet preparations. Normal and loss-of-function phenotypes were distinguished clearly at the higher ristocetin concentrations. A total of 16 mutant constructs, representing 36 charged amino acid residues, had essentially normal ristocetin-induced binding to platelets. For another 12 constructs, containing mutations at 23 charged residues, little or no ristocetin-induced binding was observed. Representative results for several mutant rVWF proteins with these phenotypes are shown in Fig. 4B. The results for variants with normal and decreased binding can be summarized satisfactorily by histograms of the values obtained at 1.0 and 1.5 mg/ml ristocetin, normalized to wild type rVWF (Fig. 5). For 5 constructs, representing 10 charged residues, a gain-of-function phenotype was demonstrated most clearly at a low ristocetin concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (Fig. 4, C and D). These constructs were(497-501)3A,(505-506)2A, R511A, R545A, and (687-689)3A. One variant, R545A, bound spontaneously to platelets in the absence of ristocetin (Fig. 4D). For this group of mutant proteins, the increase in binding also was evident at higher ristocetin concentrations, although it was less dramatic (Fig. 5). The conditions selected for botrocetin-induced binding of rVWF to platelets are similar to those for ristocetin-induced binding, except that high concentrations of BSA were not required to prevent platelet-independent precipitation of VWF. Representative dose responses to botrocetin2 are shown in Fig. 6 for wild type rVWF and for the mutant rVWF proteins that were assayed for ristocetin-induced binding in Fig. 4. Two variants exhibited spontaneous binding. Approximately 30% of mutant R545A sedimented with platelets in the absence of botrocetin (Fig. 6D); this variant also exhibited spontaneous binding to platelets in the ristocetin-dependent assay (Fig. 4D). Approximately 27% of mutant(687-689)3A bound spontaneously to platelets under the botrocetin-dependent assay conditions, but none bound spontaneously under the ristocetin-dependent assay conditions. This difference appears to depend on the BSA concentration in the respective assays (data not shown). Half maximal binding of wild type rVWF occurred at ≈3 μg/ml botrocetin (Fig. 6). The binding of the mutant proteins at this fixed concentration of botrocetin is summarized in Fig. 7. With few exceptions, mutant rVWF proteins behaved similarly in both the ristocetin-dependent and botrocetin-dependent binding assays. A total of 18 constructs, encompassing 39 charged residues, exhibited normal botrocetin-induced binding. Interestingly, four constructs had normal botrocetin-induced binding but no ristocetin-induced binding:(520-524)2A,(527-531)3A, K534A, and E626A. Ten constructs, including 20 amino acids, exhibited decreased botrocetin-induced binding. Only two of these variants with decreased botrocetin-induced binding had normal ristocetin-induced binding: R636A and(663-667)3A. Two constructs with normal botrocetin-induced binding exhibited increased ristocetin-induced binding to platelets: (505-506)2A and R511A. Decreased botrocetin-induced platelet binding could be the result of mutations that affect the interaction of VWF with either botrocetin or GPIb; these two binding properties also could be linked conformationally (30Sugimoto M. Ricca G. Hrinda M.E. Schreiber A.B. Searfoss G.H. Bottini E. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5202-5209Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). To address this point, the binding of radiolabeled botrocetin to rVWF mutants was measured directly as described by Fujimura et al.(28Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Oyama R. Matsui T. Fukui H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In this assay, 125I-botrocetin (two chain) bound to wild type rVWF with an EC50 of ≈3.0 μg/ml (data not shown). For comparison, an EC50 of ≈1.7 μg/ml was determined for botrocetin binding to purified human plasma VWF in a similar assay (28Fujimura Y. Ti"
https://openalex.org/W2065310701,"Several laboratories have demonstrated a decrease in gap junctional communication in cells transformed by the src oncogene of the Rous sarcoma virus. The decrease in gap junctional communication was associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of the gap junction protein, connexin 43 (Cx43). This study was initiated to determine if the phosphorylation of Cx43 is the result of a direct kinase-substrate interaction between the highly active tyrosine kinase, pp60vsrc, and Cx43. Previous biochemical studies have been limited by the low levels of Cx43 protein in fibroblast cell lines. To obtain larger quantities of Cx43, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus expressing Cx43 in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells and subsequently purified the expressed Cx43 by immunoaffinity chromatography. We observed that this partially purified Cx43 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in vitro in the presence of kinase-active pp60src. Phosphotryptic peptide mapping indicated that the in vitro phosphorylated Cx43 contained phosphopeptides which comigrated with a subset of tryptic peptides prepared from Cx43 phosphorylated in vivo. Furthermore, coinfection of Sf-9 cells with recombinant baculoviruses encoding pp60vsrc and Cx43 resulted in the accumulation of phosphotyrosine in Cx43. Taken together, the evidence presented in this paper demonstrates that kinase active pp60csrc is capable of phosphorylating Cx43 in a direct manner. Since the presence of phosphotyrosine on Cx43 is correlated with the down-regulation of gap-junctional communication, these results suggest that pp60vsrc regulates gap junctional gating activity via tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43.

INTRODUCTIONGap junctions, which are found in plasma membranes of almost all animal cells, mediate cell-to-cell communication and maintain normal organ function (1Garfield R.E. Blennerhassett M.G.

Gap junctions are formed when a connexon (hemichannel) from one cell docks with a symmetrically opposed connexon from an adjacent cell forming a conduit which permits the passive diffusion of ions and small molecules (<1000 daltons) between neighboring cells. Each connexon consists of an oligomer of six connexin proteins that form the central aqueous pore (8Makowski L. Caspar D.L.D. Phillips W.C. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).Connexins are a family of gap junction proteins that are composed of four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops, an intracellular loop, and amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains located in the cytoplasm (9Hertzberg E.L.

The transmembrane domains and extracellular loops are highly conserved between family members and are believed to be responsible for channel structure, whereas the cytoplasmic domains are less conserved and may account for the differential regulation of gap junctions (12Dermietzel R.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1053-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) demonstrated that treatment of chemically transformed CH3 10T1/2 cells with retinoids simultaneously increased GJC and inhibited transformation. The most direct evidence supporting the role of GJC in transformation involved the introduction of connexin 43 (Cx43) into communication-deficient, carcinogen-transformed cells. Re-expression of Cx43 resulted in restoration of GJC, an inhibition of growth, focus formation (5Mehta P.P. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Rose B. Shalloway D. Loewenstein W.R. J. Membr.

The mechanisms that mediate changes in gap junctional permeability are at present incompletely understood. However, the increased phosphorylation of connexin induced by various stimuli is associated with modulation of channel gating (opening and closing) (31Loewenstein W.R. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1984; 50: 43-58Google Scholar, 32Stagg R.B. Fletcher W.H. Endocr. Rev. 1990; 11: 302-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). For example, cyclic AMP treatment of liver hepatocytes increased GJC and connexin 32 (Cx32) phosphorylation, which may be the result of activated cyclic AMP-dependent serine kinases (33Saez J.C.

Expression of the ras oncogene or TPA treatment of mouse primary keratinocytes decreased GJC and increased serine phosphorylation on Cx43 (15Brissette J.L. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Dotto G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5364-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor treatment of T51B rat liver epithelial cells produced a rapid, transient decrease in GJC, which was associated with increased serine phosphorylation on Cx43 (28Lau A.F.

Cell. 1993; 4: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).RSV possesses the oncogene v-src, which encodes a plasma membrane-associated tyrosine kinase, pp60vsrc (36Hunter T. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar, 37Parsons J.T. Weber M.J. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1989; 147: 79-127PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of pp60vsrc results in a loss of growth control and cellular transformation. Tyrosine phosphorylation on Cx43 in v-src-transformed cells correlates with a decrease in GJC (38Crow D.S. Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Kobe S.S. Lau A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 39Crow D.S. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F.

Cells infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of RSV demonstrated a rapid reduction in GJC and a transformed morphology when shifted to the permissive temperature, where pp60vsrc is active. At the nonpermissive temperature, where pp60vsrc is inactive, the cells exhibited high levels of GJC and a normal morphology (18Azarnia R. Loewenstein W.R. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 82: 191-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 30Azarnia R. Reddy S. Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Loewenstein W.R. Science. 1988; 239: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Cx43, purified from cells shifted to the permissive temperature, rapidly accumulated phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)), concomitant with the disruption of GJC (39Crow D.S. Kurata W.E. Lau A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 999-1003PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature, with normal levels of GJC contained Cx43 phosphorylated only on phosphoserine (Ser(P)) residues. These results indicated that pp60vsrc may decrease GJC by inducing the phosphorylation of Cx43 on tyrosine.Further evidence for this proposed mechanism came from experiments utilizing Xenopus oocytes expressing Cx43 and/or pp60vsrc. When Cx43 was coexpressed with pp60vsrc, junctional conductance was disrupted and Cx43 was phosphorylated on tyrosine. Oocytes coexpressing a mutated form of Cx43 (tyrosine 265 mutated to phenylalanine) and pp60vsrc did not demonstrate a decrease in GJC or tyrosine phosphorylation on Cx43 (41Swenson K.I. Piwnica-Worms H. McNamee H. Paul D.L. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 989-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although these results suggested that pp60vsrc may directly regulate channel gating via tyrosine phosphorylation of Cx43 on residue 265, it is possible that these events in the oocytes do not completely reflect the events in mammalian cells.pp60vsrc may activate a secondary tyrosine kinase, which then phosphorylates Cx43. One such tyrosine kinase could be the focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK(42Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), which is phosphorylated on tyrosine, activated in v-src-transformed cells (43Guan J.-L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), and associated with pp60src(44Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar).To test the hypothesis that Cx43 is a substrate of activated pp60src, we examined the ability of purified pp60v-srcsrc to phosphorylate either whole Cx43 purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells or the carboxyl tail region of Cx43 fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). In addition, we examined the phosphorylation of Cx43 coexpressed with pp60vsrc in insect cells. The results from this study indicated that Cx43 can serve as a substrate of activated pp60src in in vitro kinase reactions and in intact mammalian and insect cells. Furthermore, these data strongly suggest that the tyrosine residue(s) phosphorylated by pp60src are located in the carboxyl tail region of Cx43. Since tyrosine phosphorylation on Cx43 has been correlated with a down-regulation in GJC, these results suggest that activated pp60src has a direct role in modulating the gating of gap junctions.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell CultureSf-9 insect cells (Invitrogen) were grown as monolayers in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 3.3 g/liter yeastolate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 3.3 g/liter lactalbumin hydrolysate (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone) at 27°C. Sf-9 cells were infected with recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 5-10 and harvested 48-72 h post-infection. For coinfection experiments, cells were infected at a ratio of 1:2 for the recombinant pp60vsrc and Cx43 baculoviruses, respectively. Rat-1 and v-src-transformed Rat-1 fibroblasts were grown as described previously (45Johnson R.M. Wasilenko W.J. Mattingly R.R. Weber M.J. Garrison J.C. Science. 1989; 246: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Construction of Recombinant Transfer Vector and BaculoviruspVL1393-Cx43 was constructed from the transfer vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen) (46Summers M.D. Smith G.E. A Manual of Methods for Baculovirus Vectors and Cloned Insect Cell Culture Procedures. Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, College Station, TX1987Google Scholar) and the Cx43 cDNA (G2 clone) (47Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) contained in Bluescript (Stratagene). The Bluescript-G2 construct was digested with BanI (New England Biolabs) and the 1.8-kilobase pair BanI fragment containing the Cx43 cDNA was blunt-ended with Klenow (Promega), then digested with EcoRI (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). This fragment was then inserted into a SmaI-EcoRI site of pVL1393 transfer vector resulting in the recombinant transfer plasmid, pVL1393-Cx43.Recombinant baculovirus was generated by cotransfecting a monolayer of Sf-9 cells with recombinant transfer plasmid and BaculoGold baculovirus DNA (Pharmingen). Recombinant baculoviruses were then subjected to one round of plaque purification.Western Blot AnalysisExpression of Cx43 in Sf-9 cells was examined by harvesting cells at specified time points. Cells were then lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), and clarified in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge at 400,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.Samples for the biochemical subcellular localization experiments were obtained by lysing recombinant baculovirus-infected cells with cytosol extraction buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA (pH 7.5), 1 mM EGTA, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml aprotinin) in a Dounce homogenizer. The samples were centrifuged at 131,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was collected and stored as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended by passage through a 22-gauge, 3/8-inch needle five times in cytosol extraction buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100, followed by centrifugation at 400,000 ×g for 20 min at 4°C in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge. The supernatant was collected and stored as the particulate fraction.Protein concentrations were measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Whole and fractionated cell samples were boiled in an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (to achieve a final concentration of 2% SDS, 5%β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.004% bromphenol blue, and 0.03 M Tris (pH 6.8)), separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206057) Google Scholar), and electrotransfered to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.). The membranes were blocked overnight with blocking buffer (25 mM Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 1% bovine serum albumin), washed 30 min with wash buffer (25 mM Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4), 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mM EDTA), and incubated with rabbit antiserum directed against peptide 368-382 of Cx43 (anti-CT 368; 1:500 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed for 45 min in wash buffer, incubated with 1 μCi of 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for 1 h at room temperature, and washed for 30 min. Membranes were then autoradiographed using Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 film with the aid of an intensifying screen at −70°C. Immunoreactive bands were excised and quantitated with a Micromedics four-channel γ counter.Immunofluorescence MicroscopySf-9 cells were infected as described above and harvested 48 h post-infection. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at 4°C, washed two times in PBS, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS for 2 min at 4°C, and washed two times in PBS. Cells were incubated with Cx43 rabbit antiserum (anti-CT 368; 1:500 dilution) overnight at 4°C, washed two times, and blocked with normal goat serum (1:50 dilution) for 30 min at 4°C. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:80 dilution) (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C and washed three times in PBS. Cells were wet-mounted in 50% PBS, 50% glycerol containing 1 mg/ml p-phenylenediamine (Sigma) and visualized and photographed with a Zeiss Axioplane Universal microscope equipped with epifluorescence.Radiolabeling, Immunoprecipitation, and Quantitation of Cx43Sf-9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus encoding Cx43 as described above. At 24 h post-infection, the cells were radiolabeled with either EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix (NEG-072; DuPont NEN) at 100 μCi/ml in Grace's methionine-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) or [32Pi] (NEX-053; DuPont NEN) at 0.5 mCi/ml in Grace's phosphate-deficient medium (Cell Culture Facility, University of California, San Francisco) supplemented with 0.4% fetal calf serum, 5% complete TNM-FH medium, 20 μM MES (pH 6.1) (Sigma). Cells were labeled overnight (16 h) at 27°C and harvested. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence and labeled with EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix at 100 μCi/ml or [32Pi] at 0.5 mCi/ml in phosphate-deficient medium for 3 h at 37°C. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), 50 mM NaF, 160 μM Na2VO4, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), clarified, and immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum, rabbit serum directed against a Cx43 (CT368), or monoclonal antibody directed against pp60src (mAb 327, generously provided by Joan Brugge; 54) as described previously (38Crow D.S. Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Kobe S.S. Lau A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1754-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved on a 7.5-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel. Gels were dried and autoradiographed using Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 film at −70°C. Gels containing [35S]-labeled proteins were fluorographed prior to drying. Gel pieces containing 35S- or 32P-labeled Cx43 proteins were excised, rehydrated, and counted in 7.5% Scintigest (New England Nuclear)-Scintiverse fluid (Fisher Scientific) using a Beckman LS5000 liquid scintillation counter.Phosphoamino Acid Analysis32P-Labeled Cx43 was immunoprecipitated and gel-purified as described. The proteins were electrotransfered to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) and acid-hydrolyzed. The phosphopeptides were resolved on thin-layer cellulose plates in two dimensions at pH 1.9 and 3.5, as described previously in Ref. 49Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar. Autoradiography was performed with Kodak X-Omat XAR-5 film with the aid of an intensifying screen at −70°C.Preparation of Cx43 Monoclonal Antibodies and Immunoaffinity MatrixMonoclonal antibodies were made according to established techniques (50Goding J.W. Monoclonal Antibodies: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, London1983Google Scholar) against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 241-254 of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic domain of Cx43. The peptide was conjugated to rabbit serum albumin via an amino-terminal cysteine (51Lerner R.A. Green N. Alexander H. Liu F.-T. Sutcliffe J.G. Shinnick T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3403-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and BALB/c mice were immunized with the conjugate in Freund's adjuvant. 5 × 107 immune spleen cells were fused with 5 × 107 X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells. Hybridoma clones were selected in HAT medium, and supernatants were screened against the Cx43 peptide by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two clones, F-3 (IgG1) and D-7 (IgG1), out of the 208 hybridomas screened were found to be reactive with the Cx43 peptide.The immunoaffinity matrix was prepared with the D-7 monoclonal antibodies covalently bound to protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow beads (Sigma). Briefly, mouse ascites fluid was subjected to a 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation (52Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 511-552Google Scholar). The ammonium sulfate precipitate was resuspended in PBS and dialyzed overnight against PBS. The antibodies were then incubated with the protein G-Sepharose beads overnight at 4°C with gentle end-over-end mixing. The beads were washed with 200 mM triethanolamine (TEA) in PBS (pH 8.0) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with end-over-end mixing in 40 mM dimethylpalmilidate, 200 mM TEA, PBS (pH 8.0), followed by a 200 mM TEA (pH 8.0) wash and overnight incubation at room temperature in 40 mM dimethylpalmilidate, 200 mM TEA (pH 8.0) with end-over-end mixing. The beads were finally washed with 200 mM TEA (pH 8.0), incubated with 40 mM dimethylpalmilidate, 200 mM TEA (pH 8.0) for 2 h and incubated in 40 mM ethanolamine at room temperature for 2 h with end-over-end mixing. The beads were thoroughly washed with PBS and stored at 4°C in PBS containing merthiolate to prevent bacterial contamination (52Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

At 72 h post-infection, 4 × 108 cells were harvested from a suspension culture and washed in PBS at 4°C. The following steps were completed at 4°C. Cells were disrupted with 75 strokes (pestle A) in a Dounce homogenizer in 5 ml of homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). This homogenate was clarified in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 5 ml cell extraction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by gentle passage through a 22-gauge, 1.5-inch needle. The resuspended sample was Dounce homogenized with 20 strokes (pestle A) and incubated on ice for 15 min. The sample was clarified in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge at 400,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of Cx43 monoclonal antibody-protein G-Sepharose for 3 h with end-over-end mixing at 4°C. The slurry was then packed into a column and washed with cell extraction buffer, high salt wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), high salt glycine wash buffer (100 mM glycine (pH 4.0), 1 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), and glycine wash buffer (100 mM glycine (pH 5.5), 1% Triton X-100). Cx43 was eluted from the immunoaffinity matrix with a low pH glycine buffer (100 mM glycine (pH 2.5), 1% Triton X-100), and the eluate was neutralized immediately with 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).Activated pp60v-srcsrc was immunoaffinity-purified from Sf-9 cells infected with the recombinant baculovirus containing the c-src gene (Ref. 55Morgan D.O. Kaplan J.M. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 775-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar; kindly provided by David Morgan). The immunoaffinity column was generated by covalently coupling the monoclonal antibody directed against pp60src, mAb 327 (54Lipsich L.A. Lewis A.J. Brugge J.S. J. Virol. 1983; 48: 352-360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to protein A-agarose beads (Bio-Rad). The purification steps were performed as described previously (55Morgan D.O. Kaplan J.M. Bishop J.M. Varmus H.E. Cell. 1989; 57: 775-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar).In Vitro Protein Kinase AssayIn vitro protein kinase assays were performed using immunoaffinity-purified, kinase-active pp60v-srcsrc and/or partially purified Cx43 in a reaction volume of 20 μl containing 0.10 μg of Cx43, 0.10 μg of pp60v-srcsrc, kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 12 mM MnCl2, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μM Na2VO4) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont NEN, NEG-002Z, 6000 Ci/mmol) for 15 min at room temperature. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 2 × sample buffer and boiling.For depletion experiments, the kinase reaction was performed in two incubations. The first incubation included partially purified Cx43, pp60v-srcsrc, kinase buffer, and 5 nM unlabeled ATP. Following incubation for 15 min at room temperature, pp60v-srcsrc was immunodepleted from the reaction mixture by the addition of pp60src monoclonal antibodies (mAb 327) chemically coupled to protein A-agarose. The pp60v-srcsrc -depleted sample was then divided into two aliquots. To one portion, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP alone was added, and to the other portion, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP plus purified pp60v-srcsrc were added. These reactions were then incubated an additional 15 min at room temperature to permit radiolabeling to occur. The reactions were stopped with the addition of 2 × sample buffer and boiling. The proteins were resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

https://openalex.org/W1972339605,"The harmonic approximation for the potential energy of proteins is known to be inadequate for the calculation of many protein properties. To study the effect of anharmonic terms on protein vibrations, the anharmonic wave functions for the ground state and low-lying excited states of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) were calculated. The results suggest that anharmonic treatments are essential for protein vibrational spectroscopy. The calculation uses the vibrational self-consistent field approximation, which includes anharmonicity and interaction among modes in a mean-field sense. Properties obtained include the quantum coordinate fluctuations, zero-point energies, and the vibrational absorption spectrum."
https://openalex.org/W2058205481,"A novel heterologous expression system was used to examine the coupling of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) to neuronal voltage-gated ion channels. Cytoplasmic injection of mGluR2 cRNA into adult rat sympathetic neurons resulted in the expression of receptors that negatively coupled to N-type Ca2+ channels through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. Injection of mGluR1 alpha cRNA resulted in the expression of receptors that inhibited M-type K+ channels via a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Coupling was restricted to specific transduction elements and effectors, since mGluR2 did not inhibit M channels and mGluR1 alpha had minimal effects on Ca2+ channels. These findings demonstrate that heterologously expressed, and thus unambiguously identified, mGluR subtypes modulate specific neuronal ion channels through discrete signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1974913829,"The initial interaction between the ColE1 plasmid specific transcripts RNA I and RNA II, which function as antisense regulators of plasmid replication, comprises a transient complex between complementary loops found within the RNA secondary structures. Multidimensional heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to characterize complexes formed between model RNA hairpins having seven nucleotide complementary loops. Seven base pairs are formed in the loop-loop helix, with continuous helical stacking of the loop residues on the 3' side of their helical stems. A sharp bend in the loop-loop helix, documented by gel electrophoresis, narrows the major groove and allows bridging of the phosphodiester backbones across the major groove in order to close the hairpin loops at their 5'-ends. The bend is further enhanced by the binding of Rom, a ColE1 encoded protein that regulates replication."
https://openalex.org/W1979582578,"The c-kit-encoded tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor (Kit/SCFR) is crucial for the development of hematopoietic cells, melanoblasts, and germ cells. Ligand stimulation of Kit/SCFR leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. We recently showed, that protein kinase C (PKC) acts in an SCF-stimulated negative feedback loop, which controls Kit/SCFR tyrosine kinase activity and modulates the cellular responses to SCF (Blume-Jensen, P., Siegbahn, A., Stabel, S., Heldin, C.-H., and Rönnstrand, L.(1993) EMBO J. 12, 4199-4209). We present here the identification of the major phosphorylation sites for PKC in Kit/SCFR. Two serine residues in the kinase insert, Ser-741 and Ser-746, are PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites in vivo and account for all phosphorylation by PKC in vitro. Together they comprise more than 60% of the total SCF-stimulated receptor phosphorylation in living cells and 85-90% of its phosphorylation in resting cells. Two additional serine residues, Ser-821 close to the major tyrosine autophosphorylation site in the kinase domain and Ser-959 in the carboxyl terminus are SCF-stimulated PKC-dependent phosphorylation sites. However, they are not phosphorylated directly by PKC-α in vitro. Both specific receptor tyrosine autophosphorylation and specific receptor-associated phosphatidylinositide 3′-kinase activity was increased approximately 2-fold in response to SCF in PAE cells stably expressing Kit/SCFR(S741A/S746A). Furthermore, the kinase activity of Kit/SCFR(S741A/S746A) toward an exogenous substrate was increased, which was reflected as a decreased Km and an increased Vmax, in accordance with the negative regulatory role of PKC on Kit/SCFR signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2043781898,"Integrins mediate signal transduction through interactions with multiple cellular or extracellular matrix ligands. Evidence is accumulating that the I (or A) domain, a ∼200-residue inserted sequence in some integrin α subunits, mediates ligand binding. We have previously shown that Thr-221 of the putative ligand binding sites within α2 I domain of α2β1 is critical for binding to collagen (Kamata, T., and Takada, Y. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 26006-26010). Here we report that the mutation of Thr-206 of αL blocks intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) binding to αLβ2 and mutation of Thr-209 of αM blocks ICAM-1 and C3bi binding to αMβ2. The data indicate the Thr residues of αM and αL corresponding to Thr-221 of α2 are critically involved in the ligand interaction with β2 integrins. The mutations of the Asp-137 and Asp-239 of αL also block ICAM-1 binding to αLβ2, as do the corresponding Asp residues of α2 or αM in collagen/α2β1 or C3bi/αMβ2 interactions, respectively. These data suggest that these Thr and Asp residues, conserved among I domains, are critical for interaction with structurally distinct ligands (e.g. ICAMs, C3bi, and collagen)."

Here we report that SP applied outside the patch pipette inhibited the single-channel activity, recorded on-cell, of the inward rectifier. The PKC inhibitors staurosporine and PKC(19-36) suppressed this effect in whole-cell mode and in on-cell single-channel mode. A diacylglycerol analog mimicked the SP effect, and PKC(19-36) suppressed this analog effect. SP irreversibly suppressed the inward rectifier in neurons treated with okadaic acid. These results indicate that a diffusible messenger mediates the SP effect, that its signal transduction involves phosphorylation by PKC, and that dephosphorylation by a serine/threonine protein phosphatase mediates its recovery."

Recently, it has been demonstrated that two human VDAC genes, HVDAC1 and HVDAC2, produce three proteins that differ most significantly at their amino termini. These results suggest that the distinct amino termini lead to the targeting of individual VDAC isoforms to different cellular compartments. Consistent with this hypothesis, recent reports suggest that HVDAC1 is found in the plasma membrane of mammalian cells. To define the subcellular location of HVDAC isoforms, HVDAC genes were modified so that the encoded proteins contain COOH-terminal epitopes recognized by either of two monoclonal antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W1980079864,"The hematopoietic neutral serine proteases leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G are synthesized as inactive precursors, but become activated by removal of an amino-terminal dipeptide and are stored in granules. Moreover, the pro forms of elastase and cathepsin G show carboxyl-terminal prodomains of 20 and 11 amino acids, respectively, which are not present in the mature enzymes. To investigate mechanisms for processing, activation, and granular targeting, we have utilized transgenic expression of myeloid serine proteases in the rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL-1 (Gullberg, U., Lindmark, A., Nilsson, E., Persson, A.-M., and Olsson, I.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 25219-25225). Leukocyte elastase was stably expressed in RBL-1 cells, and the translation products were characterized by biosynthetic labeling followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography. Processing of a main pro form of 34 kDa into mature 31- and 29-kDa forms was demonstrated. Translocation of mature forms to granule-containing fractions was shown by subcellular fractionation experiments. The processed forms were enzymatically active, judging by the occurrence of amino-terminal processing demonstrated by radiosequence analysis, the acquisition of affinity for the protease inhibitor aprotinin, and the appearance of elastase activity in transfected RBL cells. To investigate the function of the carboxyl-terminal prodomains, deletion mutants of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G lacking the carboxyl-terminal extension were constructed and transfected into RBL cells. Our results show that as full-length proteins, the deletion mutants were converted to active enzymes and transferred to granules with kinetics similar to that of wild-type enzymes. We conclude that human leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G are converted into enzymatically active forms when expressed in RBL cells and targeted for storage in granules; the carboxyl-terminal prodomains are necessary neither for enzymatic activation nor for targeting to granules in RBL cells.

A regulated process of proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic cells along distinct lineages of maturation results in production of functionally competent blood cells. The neutrophil granulocyte is the dominant cell of the myeloid lineage and is of major importance in host defense. Characteristically, the neutrophil contains particular cytoplasmic granules formed in a sequential manner during its maturation and whose content is released during phagocytosis or regulated secretion. Peroxidase-positive azurophil granules are produced during the promyelocyte stage of differentiation, while the subsequent myelocyte stage gives rise to specific peroxidase-negative granules (1Bainton D.F. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. Raven Press, New York1992: 303-324Google Scholar, 2Borregaard N. Lollike K. Kjeldsen L. Sengel H. Bastholm L. Nielsen M.H. Bainton D.F. Eur. J. Haematol. 1993; 51: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The azurophil granule contains typical lysosomal enzymes and can therefore be regarded as a specialized form of lysosome. Besides lysosomal hydrolases, the azurophil granules store bactericidal proteins that are unique for the myeloid lineage (3Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Blood. 1990; 76: 2169-2181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Elsbach P. Weiss J. Gallin J.I. Goldstein I.M. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates.

Among them are the neutral serine proteases leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G, both belonging to a superfamily of hematopoietic serine proteases including granzymes of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and certain mast cell proteases (6Salvesen G.

These serine proteases are characteristically stored in granules in a processed catalytically active form, but are transiently present as inactive zymogens; activation is likely to follow the post-translational removal of an amino-terminal dipeptide in a pregranular compartment (6Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 9Brown G.R.

Lysosomal enzymes are often phosphorylated on mannose residues of carbohydrate side chains in order to provide binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors, which mediate the transfer to lysosomes (13Kornfeld S. Mellmann I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence indicates that alternative mechanisms, independent of mannose 6-phosphate receptors, exist for traffic to lysosomes (14Rijnboutt S. Kal A.J. Geuze H.J. Aerts H. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23586-23592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Glickman J.N. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In particular, the azurophil granule proteins seem to be independent of mannose-6-phosphate for subcellular sorting, but the mechanisms by which these proteins are retrieved from the secretory pathway and targeted for storage in granules are unknown (16Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A heterogeneous pattern of oligosaccharide side chains among the different types of azurophil granule proteins of neutrophils suggests that carbohydrates are not of general importance for sorting. Promyeloperoxidase shows “high mannose” oligosaccharide side chains (17Nauseef W.M. Olsson I. Arnljots K. Eur. J. Haematol. 1988; 40: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); procathepsin G and proelastase have complex oligosaccharide side chains (18Lindmark A. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Blood. 1990; 76: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the antibacterial defensins lack carbohydrates (19Valore E.V. Ganz T. Blood. 1992; 79: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for typical lysosomal enzymes, the processing of azurophil serine proteases involves late proteolytic cleavage in a pregranular or granular compartment (16Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). As a consequence, prodomains are eliminated by proteolysis during the processing of the precursor into the mature enzyme. In addition to an amino-terminal dipeptide, the pro forms of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G contain carboxyl-terminal prodomains not found in the mature enzymes (8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Judging by comparison of the predicted sequence from cDNA (20Farley D. Salvesen G. Travis J. Biol. Chem.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2228-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), the carboxyl-terminal prodomain of leukocyte elastase comprises 20 amino acids. Cathepsin G is also subject to carboxyl-terminal processing, and although not exactly defined, cleavage may take place after Ser224 to remove 11 amino acids (6Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to investigate the role of the carboxyl-terminal prodomains of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G for enzymatic activation and granular targeting. We have recently utilized a transgenic expression model for myeloid serine proteases in a rat basophilic/mast cell line and showed that human cathepsin G is adequately processed, enzymatically activated, and targeted to granules for storage in these cells (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that transgenic human leukocyte elastase is similarly processed and sorted to granules in this cell line. To investigate a possible role of the carboxyl-terminal prodomains in intracellular sorting or enzymatic activation, cDNA deletion mutants that lacked the prodomains were utilized. We found that the carboxyl-terminal prodomains of elastase and cathepsin G are dispensable for granular targeting in RBL cells and that deletion of these domains does not seem to interfere with folding and enzymatic activation of the native protein. The eukaryotic expression vectors pRC/CMV and pCEP4 were from Invitrogen (Leek, The Netherlands). Both vectors provide cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression of introduced cDNA and confer resistance to Geneticin and hygromycin B, respectively, which allows selection of recombinant cells. [3S]Methionine/[3S]cysteine (cell labeling grade) and [3H]isoleucine were from Amersham International (Buckinghamshire, UK). Prior to use, [3H]isoleucine was concentrated 10-fold in a vacuum centrifuge. Percoll and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B were from Pharmacia (Uppsala). Hygromycin B, protein G-agarose, aprotinin-agarose, and N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide were from Sigma. Geneticin was from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Federal Republic of Germany). Rabbit polyclonal antisera to leukocyte elastase and to cathepsin G were obtained by immunization of rabbits (24Ohlsson K. Olsson I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 25Olsson I. Venge P. Blood. 1974; 44: 235-246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human cDNA for leukocyte elastase was produced from total RNA from the HL-60 leukemic cell line using reverse transcription and PCR1( 1The abbreviations used are: PCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) amplification of cDNA with primers based on a published nucleotide sequence (21Takahashi H. Nukiwa T. Yoshimura K. Quick C.D. States D.J. Holmes M.D. Whang-Peng J. Knutsen T. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14739-14747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the Gene Amp® RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. By designing the PCR primers, the Kozak consensus leader sequence for maximum translational efficiency (26Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4135) Google Scholar) was introduced, and the flanking restriction enzyme sites HindIII and NotI were included for subsequent cloning into plasmid. PCR primers were as follows: upstream, 5′-GACTTCAGAAGCTTGCCACCATGACCCTCGGCCGCCGACTCG-3′; and downstream, 5′-GACTTCAGGCGGCCGCTCAGTGGGTCCTGCTGGCCGGGTCCGG-3′ (start and stop codons in boldface). The resulting PCR product was cloned into pRC/CMV to create the expression vector pRC/CMV-elastase. Similarly, cDNA for cathepsin G (generously provided by Dr. G. Salvesen, Duke University, Durham, NC) was cloned into the expression vector pCEP4-CatG as described (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant of leukocyte elastase was created by PCR amplification of leukocyte elastase cDNA with the downstream primer 5′-GACTTCAGGCGGCCGCTCATTGGATGATAGAGTCGATCCAG-3′, thereby introducing a stop codon (boldface) after Gln247. Analogously, a deletion mutant of cathepsin G was constructed using the downstream primer 5′-GACTTCAGGCGGCCGCTCAGCTTCTCATTGTTGTCCTTATCC-3′, introducing a stop codon (boldface) after Ser224. The deletion mutants of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G were sequenced and cloned into pRC/CMV and pCEP4 to create the expression vectors pRC/CMV-elastaseΔ248-267 and pCEP4-CatGΔ245-255, respectively. All cDNA constructs were sequenced to verify the integrity of the reading frame and the desired mutations. The deletion mutants are depicted schematically in Fig. 1. polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. RBL-1 cells were transfected using the Bio-Rad electroporation apparatus. Transfection of RBL-1 cells by electroporation was performed with electrical settings of 960 microfarads and 300 V as described elsewhere (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After electroporation, Geneticin (2 mg/ml) or hygromycin B (1200 units/ml) was added to select for recombinant clones expressing the Geneticin resistance gene of pRC/CMV or the hygromycin B resistance gene of pCEP4, respectively. Individual clones growing in the presence of antibiotic were isolated, expanded into mass cultures, and screened for expression of elastase or cathepsin G by biosynthetic labeling. Clones with the most pronounced expression were chosen for further experiments. The rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL-1 was a gift from Dr. L. Hellman. Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (complete medium) (GIBCO Ltd., Paisley, UK) in 5% CO2 at 37°C in a fully humidified atmosphere. Exponentially growing cells were used in all experiments. Biosynthetic labeling of newly synthesized proteins was performed as described elsewhere (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, cells were starved for 30 min, followed by pulse labeling with [3S]methionine/[3S]cysteine for 30 min. In chase experiments following pulse labeling, cells were resuspended in complete medium. At timed intervals, cells were withdrawn and subjected to extraction or homogenization and subsequent subcellular fractionation. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described elsewhere (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol.

Briefly, the cell homogenate was fractionated in a Percoll density gradient, after which nine fractions were collected, with fraction 9 containing all cytosol. The distribution of lysosomes and Golgi elements in the density gradient was determined, by assaying β-hexosaminidase and galactosyltransferase as described elsewhere (27Hultberg B. Lindsten J. Sjöblad S. Biochem. J. 1976; 155: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 28Bretz R. Stäubli W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 77: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), to fractions 1-3 and 5-8, respectively (data not shown). For immunoprecipitation, whole cells or Percoll-containing subcellular fractions were solubilized, and biosynthetically labeled elastase or cathepsin G was immunoprecipitated and subjected to electrophoretic analysis (SDS-PAGE) followed by fluorography as described previously (18Lindmark A. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Blood. 1990; 76: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adsorption to aprotinin-agarose was performed essentially as described by Salvesen and Enghild (8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and as previously described in detail (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed, and the lysate was allowed to react for 60 min at room temperature with 200 μl of a 50% suspension of aprotinin-agarose/107 cells. The aprotinin with bound material was washed, followed by incubation for 45 min at 4°C in 5 ml of elution buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 300 mM NaCl) to obtain the release of bound material. Elastase or cathepsin G in the eluate or remaining in the lysate after adsorption to aprotinin-agarose (lacking affinity for aprotinin) was immunoprecipitated as described (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For determination of the amino-terminal sequence of processed elastase and cathepsin G, biosynthetic labeling with [3H]isoleucine followed by amino acid sequencing was performed in the following way. Cells (1 × 108) were starved for 30 min in 50 ml of isoleucine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Select-Amine kit, GIBCO Ltd.) in order to reduce intracellular isoleucine supplies, after which the cells were incubated in 25 ml of identical medium supplemented with [3H]isoleucine (200 μCi/ml) to achieve metabolic labeling of synthesized proteins. During the subsequent chase, cells were incubated in 50 ml of complete medium. Following pulse labeling for 30 min and chase for 2 h, respectively, cell lysates were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed as described above. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semidry electroblotting, and the membrane was subjected to autoradiography for 1 week. By guidance of the autoradiogram, radioactive bands were excised and subjected to Edman amino acid degradation, performed by the Biomedical Service Unit at University of Lund. The initial 10 degradation cycles were assayed for radioactivity using a scintillation counter. The enzymatic activity of elastase was assayed using N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide as substrate (29Bieth J. Spiess B. Wermuth C.G. Biochem. Med. 1974; 11: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). A cell extract was prepared and assayed as described elsewhere (30Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 × 108 cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and the cell pellet was frozen and thawed twice, after which it was resuspended in 0.9 ml of 100 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 1 M MgCl2 and 0.1% Triton X-100. After 30 s of sonication with an ultrasonicator (Kistner Lab, Stockholm, Sweden) to obtain complete homogenization of the cells, 2 ml of 5 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 1 M NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 was added, and the lysate was centrifuged at 32,000 × g at 4°C for 2 h to remove DNA. Of the remaining lysate, 500 μl was mixed with 250 μl of 200 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, containing 1 M NaCl, and the mixture was heated to 40°C, after which 250 μl of 2 mMN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide (dissolved in dimethyl fluoride) was added. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min, after which the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 μl of soybean trypsin inhibitor (200 μg/ml), and the absorbance at 410 nm was read. A standard curve was obtained by replacing the cells with various amounts of porcine pancreatic elastase (Sigma). Measurements were performed within a linear range of 0.15 to 1.5 A (83-830 units/ml elastase). Stable clones of RBL cells expressing human leukocyte elastase (RBL/elastase cells) were established by transfection with pRC/CMV-elastase. The biosynthesis of transgenic elastase was characterized by biosynthetic labeling and immunoprecipitation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No labeled material was specifically immunoprecipitated from wild-type RBL cells (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows pulse labeling of RBL/elastase cells, followed by chase for the time periods indicated. After 30 min of pulse labeling, a main translation product of 34 kDa was found. In addition, two minor products with apparent masses of 37 and 32 kDa, respectively, were precipitated. The 32-kDa form was found to be an initial translation product, as it was the dominating form after 10 min of pulse labeling and was converted into the 34-kDa form following chase of the label for 20 min (data not shown); this processing from 32 to 34 kDa most probably represents glycosylation events. The nature of the 37-kDa form is not clear. After 2 h of chase, almost all of the labeled material was reduced to 31 kDa, most likely corresponding to proteolytic removal of the carboxyl-terminal prodomain (8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and prolonged chase resulted in the appearance of an additional 29-kDa form, distinguishable after 4 h of chase. A substantial amount of the proteolytically unprocessed forms of transgenic elastase was released into the culture medium (Fig. 2), which is commonly seen with lysosomal enzymes (16Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The intracellular processed forms were stable during the 4 h of the experiment, without obvious signs of degradation. These data suggest the initial synthesis of a 34-kDa pro form of elastase that with time is carboxyl-terminally processed into a 31-kDa form and, to some extent, further into a 29-kDa form. To correlate the processing with subcellular translocation, pulse-chase experiments were performed, followed by subcellular fractionation. After 30 min of labeling, most of the newly synthesized elastase was present in fractions of intermediate density, corresponding to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi elements (Fig. 3), with the 34-kDa form as the dominant one. Following 90 min of chase, most of the 34-kDa pro form was processed into a 31-kDa form and transferred to dense fractions corresponding to granules. Labeled transgenic elastase still remained, after 5 h of chase, in dense fractions, and a minor portion was converted into a 29-kDa form. These data are analogous to those shown for transgenic cathepsin G in RBL cells (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and indicate that proteolytic processing of proelastase occurs during or after transfer to a granular compartment, where the mature enzyme is stored. By transfection of RBL cells with carboxyl-terminally deleted cDNA for leukocyte elastase or cathepsin G, cell clones were established expressing elastase (RBL/elastaseΔ248-267) and cathepsin G (RBL/CatGΔ245-255), respectively, lacking the carboxyl-terminal prodomains. The deletion mutants are depicted schematically in Fig. 1. Fig. 4 shows the initial synthesis of a 31-kDa form in RBL/elastaseΔ248-267 cells. Thus, the initially synthesized form of the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant (31 kDa) corresponds to that of the processed full-length enzyme (31 kDa), supporting the notion that the carboxyl-terminal prodomain is removed during processing of the full-length proenzyme from 34 to 31 kDa (Fig. 2). Similar to RBL/elastase cells, the RBL/elastaseΔ248-267 cells showed, after 30 min of labeling, a small amount of elastase of lesser size (30 kDa), which disappeared while chasing the label. As for the full-length protein, this smaller (30 kDa) form may represent an early translation product that is, as the result of early glycosylation events, converted to the 31-kDa form. After 4 h of chase, a minor part was further processed into a 29-kDa form. A considerable amount of the labeled material was secreted into the medium, but after ∼1 h of chase, the intracellular labeled protein remained stable during the 4 h of the experiment. Most of the extracellular release occurred during the 1st h of chase, after which the secreted forms disappeared to some extent (Fig. 4). As for the full-length protein, the stability of the intracellular enzyme suggests transfer to a storage compartment, and translocation of newly synthesized elastase lacking the carboxyl-terminal prodomain was indeed demonstrated by subcellular fractionation. Fig. 5 shows that elastaseΔ248-267 is targeted to dense fractions corresponding to granules, analogous to what was shown for full-length elastase in Fig. 3. Fig. 5 also demonstrates that 30 min of pulse labeling of RBL/elastaseΔ248-267 cells results in two visible translation products of 31 and 30 kDa. As seen in experiments with full-length elastase, the smaller product disappeared by chasing the label, which probably reflects glycosylation of the protein. Following 90 min of chase, the main initial translation product of 31 kDa was transferred to dense fractions, where a minor part was further processed into a 29-kDa form, distinguishable after 5 h of chase. Likewise, it was found that cathepsin G lacking the carboxyl-terminal prodomain (CatGΔ245-255) was targeted to granule-containing fractions (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G are, like full-length proenzymes, efficiently sorted for storage in a granular compartment in RBL cells. Leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G are synthesized as inactive zymogens, but are enzymatically activated in a pregranular or granular compartment. The removal of an amino-terminal dipeptide, catalyzed by the thiol protease dipeptidyl peptidase I, is a prerequisite for enzymatic activation (8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 11McGuire M.J. Lipsky P.E. Thiele D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2458-2467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the activation of the transfected serine proteases in RBL cells, their affinity for the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin was investigated. By pulse labeling and then chasing the label, followed by adsorption to aprotinin-agarose, we demonstrated the acquisition of affinity to aprotinin for transgenic elastase, elastaseΔ248-267, and CatGΔ245-255. Fig. 6 shows similar results for all three enzyme variants, with binding of most of the labeled material to aprotinin after 2-5 h of chase. These results are consistent with results from experiments with endogenous elastase and cathepsin G (8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) as well as with transgenic cathepsin G (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting amino-terminal removal of the dipeptide, leading to enzymatic activation. Indeed, using a radiosequencing technique, amino-terminal processing with removal of a dipeptide was indicated for both transgenic elastase (Fig. 7A) and cathepsin G (Fig. 7B). The amino acid sequences of mature elastase and cathepsin G begin with one and two isoleucines, respectively (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to the immature forms, which contain the activation dipeptide (Ser-Glu and Gly-Glu, respectively) prior to the isoleucines. Cells were labeled with [3H]isoleucine for 30 min, followed by chase for 2 h, and radiosequencing was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After 30 min of labeling, 34-kDa proelastase and 32.5-kDa procathepsin G showed, upon sequencing, the presence of radioactivity in the third fraction, corresponding to amino acid 3 in the amino-terminal sequence, indicating the presence of the activation dipeptide followed by labeled isoleucine (Fig. 7). Following 2 h of chase, however, the processed forms of elastase and cathepsin G with masses of 31 kDa showed considerable radioactivity in fraction 1 of the sequencing chromatogram, thus indicating that cleavage of the dipeptide had occurred. The persisting radioactivity in fraction 3 following chase indicates that activation was incomplete at this point, which is concordant to results above showing incomplete acquisition of affinity for aprotinin after 2 h of chase (Fig. 6). To estimate the relative enzymatic activity in RBL cells expressing transgenic elastase, an enzymatic assay was employed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As might be predicted from the results of experiments with adsorption to aprotinin (Fig. 6), RBL/elastaseΔ248-267 cells contained elastase activity comparable to that of RBL/elastase cells. The elastase activity in RBL/elastaseΔ248-267 cells was 561 ± 95 units, and the corresponding value for RBL/elastase cells was 490 ± 108 units, while wild-type RBL cells contained 75 ± 27 units (per 5 × 107 cells, ± S.E., n = 3). These results demonstrate that transgenic elastase is enzymatically activated and that a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal prodomain obviously does not interfere with the conversion of the zymogen form into catalytically competent enzyme. A similar enzymatic assay for cathepsin G (31Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) could not be employed due to strong interference of endogenous proteases from the RBL cells. The aim of this work was to elucidate processing and sorting mechanisms for the granule serine protease family of myeloid origin (3Lehrer R.I. Ganz T. Blood. 1990; 76: 2169-2181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar). Certain mast cell proteases belong to this family of enzymes, and therefore, the rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL should also be equipped with processing and sorting mechanisms for the hematopoietic serine proteases. Indeed, granzyme A and cathepsin G cDNAs transfected into this cell line both produced functional enzymes (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Nakajima H. Henkart P.A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1057-1063PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, RBL cells were employed in both our previous (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and present studies. Our data show that transgenic human leukocyte elastase is converted into active enzyme and targeted to granules in RBL cells. Moreover, this study demonstrates that both leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G lacking the carboxyl-terminal prodomain are still targeted to dense granule-containing fractions and converted into catalytically active forms. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal extension of these enzymes is obviously unnecessary for sorting and enzymatic activation in RBL cells. Generally speaking, lysosomal enzymes are synthesized as larger precursors that undergo limited proteolysis during and after intracellular sorting, involving cleavage of both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal prodomains (16Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In some cases, either amino- or carboxyl-terminal prodomains have proved important for folding, intracellular targeting, and enzymatic activation of the protein (33Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the biological role of prodomain processing remains obscure for most lysosomal enzymes. Our results show that processing and sorting of human leukocyte elastase transfected into RBL cells follow a scheme that corresponds to previous findings concerning the processing of endogenous neutrophil elastase (6Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 665-671PubMed Google Scholar, 8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Lindmark A. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. Blood. 1990; 76: 2374-2380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lindmark A. Gullberg U. Olsson I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and are similar to results from studies on endogenous and transgenic cathepsin G (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mature form of leukocyte elastase had an apparent mass of 31 kDa and was found in dense granule fractions isolated by Percoll density gradient separation. This form appeared in granule fractions after 90 min of chase, suggesting that transport into granules requires <2 h. The 31-kDa product was stable for at least 5 h, although some slow processing into a 29-kDa form did occur. Several lines of evidence strongly indicate that the protein was converted into enzymatically active forms; the acquisition of affinity for the serine protease inhibitor aprotinin was demonstrated, and it was confirmed by radiosequencing for both elastase and cathepsin G that amino-terminal processing occurred with removal of the activation dipeptide. Moreover, we also demonstrated the presence of elastase activity in extracts of transfected RBL cells. A fraction of newly synthesized leukocyte elastase failed to be retained in the cells and was secreted as precursor forms, which is a common feature in lysosomal enzyme processing (16Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the promyelocyte, leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G are stored in azurophil granules, which can be regarded as specialized forms of lysosomes, and they seem to be targeted to granules in a mannose 6-phosphate-independent manner (16Hasilik A. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 130-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In yeast, some enzymes contain prodomains that are necessary and sufficient for mannose 6-phosphate-independent targeting into the vacuole, the yeast analogue of the mammalian lysosome (35von Figura K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Stack J.H. Emr S.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Also in mammalian cells, mechanisms for lysosomal delivery that are independent of mannose 6-phosphate exist (14Rijnboutt S. Kal A.J. Geuze H.J. Aerts H. Strous G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23586-23592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Glickman J.N. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A transient mannose 6-phosphate-independent membrane association has been demonstrated for procathepsins D, C, and L (37Burge V. Mainferme F. Wattiaux R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 797-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 38McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15438-15445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Rijnboutt S.

Commun. 1992; 182: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Among these, the membrane association of cathepsin D involves interaction with prosaposin that binds to cathepsin D immediately after synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (41Zhu Y. Conner G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3846-3851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent demonstration that the prodomain of cathepsin L, which shows a close resemblance to vacuolar sorting sequences of enzymes in yeast, binds to an intracellular transmembrane proenzyme receptor (42McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 43McIntyre G.F. Godbold G.D. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 567-572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) makes a functional role of prodomains in lysosomal mannose 6-phosphate-independent targeting likely. And thus, the carboxyl-terminal prodomains of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G may be necessary for granular sorting (8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consequently, carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants were constructed to investigate this hypothesis. Our results show that deletion of the prodomain does not interfere with sorting, as the deletion mutants were transferred to granules with the same kinetics as full-length proteins. Targeting mechanisms in RBL cells may, however, be different from those operating in the promyelocytes, as the granules of RBL cells are not identical to azurophil granules of promyelocytes. The timing for cleavage of the carboxyl-terminal prodomains of elastase and cathepsin G was reported to parallel the removal of an amino-terminal activation dipeptide (8Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, other data suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal processing may precede cleavage of the amino-terminal dipeptide (23Gullberg U. Lindmark A. Nilsson E. Persson A.-M. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25219-25225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are further supported by our results from radiosequencing indicating that following 2 h of chase, when the carboxyl-terminal processing was accomplished judging by reduction in apparent mass, the removal of the amino-terminal dipeptide was still incomplete. These data suggest that amino-terminal processing and activation of the protein need to take place on protein lacking the carboxyl-terminal prodomain. The present demonstration that the carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants of elastase and cathepsin G were transformed into active enzymes, as judged by the acquisition of affinity for aprotinin and the occurrence of elastase activity in transfected cells, strongly argues against an important function of the carboxyl-terminal prodomains in enzyme folding and prevention of premature activation of the zymogen forms. However, the question of whether or not previous removal of the carboxyl-terminal prodomain is a prerequisite for the cleavage of the amino-terminal dipeptide to occur is still not resolved. Among the myeloid serine proteases, azurocidin has been reported to have a carboxyl-terminal prodomain, comprising three amino acids, that is removed during processing (44Morgan J.G. Sukiennicki T. Pereira H.A. Spitznagel J.K. Guerra M.E. Larrick J.W. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3210-3214PubMed Google Scholar). For other members of the hematopoietic serine protease superfamily, the information is incomplete, and it is not known whether all members are carboxyl-terminally processed. Whatever the case, our present data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal prodomain seems to be dispensable for folding, activation, and granular targeting of the enzymes. Besides neutral serine proteases, the azurophil granules contain several lysosomal hydrolases and thus expose the content to a highly proteolytic environment. Similarly, the granules of RBL cells, used in this experimental model, store both serine proteases and lysosomal enzymes (45Metzger H. Alcaraz G. Hohman R. Kinet J.P. Pribluda V. Quarto R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 419-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 46Kido H. Izumi K. Otsuka H. Fukusen N. Kato Y. Katunuma N. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 1061-1065PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal processing of leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G might merely be the result of exposure of protease-sensitive regions, but the enzyme(s) responsible for this action are not identified. In conclusion, this investigation has demonstrated that human leukocyte elastase, following transfection into rat RBL cells, is targeted for storage in granules and converted into enzymatically active forms. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal prodomains of both leukocyte elastase and cathepsin G were found to be dispensable for enzymatic activation as well as granular targeting of the enzymes in RBL cells.

https://openalex.org/W2028847888,"CD20 is a transmembrane protein that functions as a Ca2+-permeable cation channel (Bubien, J. K., Zhou, L. J., Bell, P. D., Frizzel, R. A., and Tedder, T. F.(1993) J. Cell Biol. 121, 1121-1132) and is involved in growth regulation of B lymphocytes. In order to further investigate the role of calcium entry in cell cycle progression, we introduced the cDNA encoding a Ca2+-permeable cation channel, CD20, into Balb/c 3T3 cells. Balb/c 3T3 cells transfected with a vector containing cDNA encoding CD20 expressed the CD20 protein, which was detected by assaying the binding of a monoclonal antibody against CD20. Calcium-permeable cation channel activity was detected in CD20-expressing cells by whole cell patch clamp recording and microfluorometric determination of the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration using fura-2. The expression of CD20 induced significant alterations in the responses of the cells to insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). IGF-I induced DNA synthesis by control cells only when they had been pretreated with both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF). In contrast, DNA synthesis by 30% of the quiescent CD20-expressing cells was initiated in response to IGF-I in the absence of priming with PDGF and EGF. When control quiescent cells were primed with PDGF and EGF, the addition of IGF-I led to the initiation of DNA synthesis after 14 h or more, whereas it induced DNA synthesis by CD20-expressing cells primed with PDGF and EGF 4 h earlier. The IGF-induced DNA synthesis was dependent on extracellular Ca2+, and expression of CD20 reduced the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ required for it. Furthermore, DNA synthesis by approximately 25% of the CD20-expressing cells was initiated after priming with PDGF and EGF, even in the absence of the progression factor IGF-I. These results indicate that CD20 expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells functions as a constitutively active Ca2+-permeable cation channel and that expression of CD20 accelerates G1 progression in a Ca2+-dependent manner. CD20 is a transmembrane protein that functions as a Ca2+-permeable cation channel (Bubien, J. K., Zhou, L. J., Bell, P. D., Frizzel, R. A., and Tedder, T. F.(1993) J. Cell Biol. 121, 1121-1132) and is involved in growth regulation of B lymphocytes.

These results indicate that CD20 expressed in Balb/c 3T3 cells functions as a constitutively active Ca2+-permeable cation channel and that expression of CD20 accelerates G1 progression in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Mammalian nontransformed fibroblasts, such as Balb/c 3T3 cells, become quiescent when they are cultured in serum-free medium for a sufficient time. Multiple growth factors are required for such quiescent cells to reenter the cell cycle and to initiate DNA replication (1Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Although there is a great deal of information available about the molecular events regulating G0-G1 transition (see Ref. 2Wiesmuller L. Wittinghofer F. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 247-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar for review) and transition of G1-S boundaries (see Ref. 3Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar for review), the molecular events controlling mid-G1 progression remain relatively uncharacterized. G1 progression is the rate-limiting step in the entire cell cycle (1Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). Pledger and colleagues (4Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2839-2843Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) showed that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PDGFplatelet-derived growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorIGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor-IDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFCSfetal calf serumBSAbovine serum albuminPBSphosphate-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridine[Ca2+]concentration of cytosolic free Ca2+MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.) renders quiescent Balb/c 3T3 cells “competent” in terms of responding to growth factors in plasma. Competent cells enter the cell cycle and progress to the S phase in the presence of progression factors in plasma (5Stiles C.D. Capone G.T. Scher C.D. Antoniades H.N. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). The active components in plasma are epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) (6Russell W.E. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2389-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and it is the latter that promotes progression through the G1 phase (6Russell W.E. Van Wyk J.J. Pledger W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2389-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 7Scher C.D. Shepard R.C. Antoniades H.N. Stiles C.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 217-241PubMed Google Scholar). We extended these data by showing that EGF renders competent cells responsive to IGF-I (8Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that such EGF-primed competent cells, designated “primed competent cells,” progress toward the S phase when incubated with IGF-I alone. It should be emphasized that neither quiescent nor PDGF-treated competent cells are able to initiate DNA synthesis in the presence of IGF-I alone (4Pledger W.J. Stiles C.D. Antoniades H.N. Scher C.D.

Physiol. 1990; 143: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this respect, primed competent cells are responsive to IGF-I in terms of cell growth. It is well known that Ca2+ is required for cell proliferation (10Lu K.P. Means A.R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 40-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and is indispensable for cells to progress to the S phase. Our previous results indicated that IGF-I activated a Ca2+-permeable cation channel in primed competent cells (8Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blockade of the IGF-sensitive channel attenuated IGF-induced DNA synthesis and stimulation of Ca2+ entry into primed competent cells by adding BAYK8644 increased DNA synthesis to some extent (11Nishimoto I. Hata Y. Ogata E. Kojima I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12120-12126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, reduction of Ca2+ entry terminated G1 progression induced by IGF-I (12Kojima I. Mogami H. Shibata H. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10003-10006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, we postulated that continuous stimulation of Ca2+ entry may be a critical intracellular message of the progression activity of IGF-I (8Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kojima I. Mogami H. Shibata H. Ogata E. J. Biol.

CD20 is a 35-kDa integral membrane protein expressed in B lymphocytes (13Stashenko P. Nadler L.M. Hardy R. Schlossman S.F. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 1678-1685PubMed Google Scholar). It is unique in that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against CD20 modulate proliferation and differentiation of B lymphocytes; some antibodies inhibited DNA synthesis (14Tedder T.F. Forsgren A. Boyd A.W. Nadler L.M. Schlossman S.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whereas others stimulated it (15Golay J.T. Clark E.A. Beverley P.C. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 3795-3801PubMed Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that CD20 is involved in the regulation of B lymphocyte growth. The cDNA encoding CD20 was cloned, and the primary structure of CD20, which contains four predicted membrane-spanning domains with both C and N termini located in the cytoplasm (16Tedder T.F. Streuli M. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), suggests that it may function as an ion channel. Indeed, when CD20 molecules were expressed in non-lymphoid cells, they generated transmembrane Ca2+ conductance (17Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzel R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Therefore, CD20 appears to function as a Ca2+-permeable cation channel, which may be involved in growth regulation. In this respect, CD20 and the IGF-sensitive channel have some properties in common (8Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzel R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Both are Ca2+-permeable channels and activate processes that are independent of the membrane potential and, furthermore, may be involved in cell growth. It is therefore of great interest to establish whether expression of CD20 in fibroblasts alters the cell cycle progression induced by IGF-I. In the present study, we cultured CD20-expressing Balb/c 3T3 cells and assessed their G1 progression in response to IGF-I. Recombinant human IGF-I was supplied by Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan); recombinant PDGF-BB was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). EGF was from Collaborative Research (Lexington, MA), and the cell proliferation detection kit was purchased from Amersham Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Balb/c 3T3 cells (clone A31) provided by the RIKEN cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.) under humidified conditions of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37°C. Quiescent cells were obtained by incubating confluent cells in DMEM containing 0.5% platelet-poor plasma for 24 h, and IGF-responsive primed competent cells were obtained by incubating quiescent cells sequentially with 1 nM PDGF and 10 nM EGF as described previously (8Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kojima I. Kitaoka M. Ogata E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1990; 143: 529-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The CD20 cDNA was amplified from Raji cell (B lymphoblastoid cell line) poly(A)+ RNA using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from Raji cells using oligo(dT)-cellulose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and the RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The synthesized cDNA was used for subsequent polymerase chain reaction as follows: 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, 74°C for 2 min, 20 cycles. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-AGGAGTCTCGAGAGCAAAATG-3′ and 5′-CAGTCGACAGAAGAATCAC-3′, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into a TA Cloning pCRII vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The human CD20 cDNA clone was subcloned into the XhoI site of the Epstein-Barr virus vector pMEP4, which possesses an inducible human metallothionein IIa gene enhancer/promoter (Invitrogen). The CD20 expression vector (CD20-pMEP4) construct was purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, and Balb/c 3T3 cells were transfected with the CD20-pMEP4 vector by electroporation using a Gene Pulsar (Bio-Rad). The cells were washed once with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested with 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA, and then resuspended in PBS at a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml. A 0.8-ml aliquot of this suspension with 100 μg of CD20-pMEP4 was transferred to an electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) and placed on ice for 5 min, after which electroporation at a setting of 300 V and 500 microfarads was carried out. The cells were allowed to recover on ice for 10 min and then were divided into 100-mm culture dishes containing culture medium. 12 h after electroporation, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were cultured in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS. 48 h after electroporation, the cells were replaced at a lower concentration, and transfected cells were selected using 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). After 10-14 days, independent colonies were picked up, grown in 35-mm dishes, and screened for a high level of expression of human CD20 by determining the binding of a mAb against CD20 as described below. A monospecific mAb against CD20 (CBL 456; Cymbus Bioscience Ltd., Southampton, UK) was used for Western blotting and immunostaining. For the binding assay, the IgG was iodinated by the chloramine T method (18Hunter W.H. Greenwood F.C. Nature. 1962; 194: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (5860) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 ml of 250 mCi of Na125I dissolved in 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and 5 ml of chloramine T solution (2 mg/ml in 0.2 M phosphate buffer) were added to the IgG (3 mg in 30 ml of 0.1 M phosphate buffer), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by adding sodium metabisulfite solution, and the labeled IgG was collected by chromatography on a 1 × 6-cm Bio-Gel P-60 column equilibrated with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The specific activity of the 125I-labeled IgG was approximately 80 mCi/mg. The confluent cells grown in 6-well plates were washed twice with binding buffer (DMEM containing 0.2% BSA) and incubated for 1 h in this buffer containing 125I-labeled IgG (2 × 105 cpm/0.4 ml) at 32°C. Then, the cells were washed three times with the binding buffer and lysed by adding 0.5 ml of 0.5 N NaOH, and the radioactivity associated with the cell lysate was counted. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of excess unlabeled antibody. For immunostaining, cells were grown on coverslips, fixed for 10 min in 10% formalin/PBS, washed with PBS, blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA, and incubated with anti-CD20 overnight at 4°C. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Japan) at room temperature for 1 h, and, after a final wash with PBS, immunostaining was carried out using diaminobenzidine. The cells were harvested, and the total RNA was isolated using Isogene and quantitated spectrophotometrically. 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2 M formaldehyde, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.0), 8 mM sodium acetate, and 1 mM EDTA and transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+; Amersham Japan) using a capillary blotting technique with 10 × sodium citrate buffer. Hybridization was performed with a probe of the CD20 cDNA fragment, provided by Dr. T. Tedder of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA) labeled with fluorescein-CTP by the random priming procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Japan). Positive signals were detected using the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody and Limiphos AP detection reagent (Amersham Japan). Synthesis of DNA was assessed in two ways. For the measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material, cells were cultured in 24-well plates and rendered primed competent. The primed competent cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing IGF-I and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured as described previously (8Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to measure the labeling index, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Amersham Japan) was added instead of [3H]thymidine and was incubated for the times indicated in Fig. 5. The cells were fixed with PBS containing 10% formalin, and immunocytochemical detection of the BrdUrd incorporated into the nuclei was performed using a detection kit (Amersham Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analysis was done by Student's t test. The cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was monitored using fura-2, as described previously (19Kato M. Hoyland J. Sikdar S.K. Mason W.T. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 447: 171-189Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on coverglasses were incubated with 2 μM fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) for 20 min at room temperature (20-25°C), and each coverglass was then placed on a flow-through chamber mounted on the stage of a TMD microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The perifusion medium comprised 135 mM NaCl, 4.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM Hepes/NaOH (pH 7.4). Dual wavelength microfluorometry of the fura-2 fluorescence was carried out using an image-intensifying charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) equipped with a fluorimeter (Nikon). The fluorescence excited at both 340 and 380 nm was measured at 510 nm. The emission signals excited at 340 and 380 nm and the ratio of these signals (340/380 ratio) were recorded by a computer system (Hamamatsu Photonics). In some experiments, the cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration was calibrated as described elsewhere (20Kojima I. Mogami H. Ogata E. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: E307-E311PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were recorded by the method described by Hamil et al.(21Hamil O.P. Marty M. Neher E. Sakman B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar) using a computer-based amplifier system, a List EPC 9 patch clamp amplifier (List, Darmstadt, Germany) controlled by E9 screen software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). The whole cell configuration was achieved by a sharp aspiration immediately after seal formation to rupture the plasma membrane within the seal. In this configuration, the soluble cytosolic contents are dialyzed by the pipette solution. Voltage clamp recording that had been compensated by capacity and leak current subtraction was started after the series resistance fell below 20 megaohms, taking the voltage error into consideration. All these experiments were carried out at 26-30°C. The pipette solution comprised 120 mMN-methyl-D-glucamine glutamate, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mM EGTA, and 1 μM free Ca2+. The bath solution comprised 150 mMN-methyl-D-glucamine glutamate, 5 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM free Ca2+. Under these conditions, the principal membrane-permeant ion was Ca2+, and the only ionic gradient was Ca2+. The free Ca2+ concentration was determined by the calcium-EGTA buffer (8Kojima I. Matsunaga H. Kurokawa K. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16561-16567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quiescent cells were washed 3 times with phosphate- and Ca2+-free DMEM, incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free DMEM, and labeled metabolically by culturing in DMEM containing [32P]orthophosphate (100 mCi/ml) for 3 h. After labeling, the cells were washed with PBS, incubated in Ca2+-free DMEM for 15 min in the presence or absence of 2 mM Ca2+, washed 3 times with PBS, 0.1% sodium azide, and lysed in 0.5 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate butter (pH 7.4) containing 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.68 M sucrose, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mM sodium vanadate, 1 mg/ml BSA, 20 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 2 mg/ml pepstatin A, 2 mg/ml iodoacetamide, and 50 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-CD20 mAb and protein G-Sepharose (50%, v/v) as follows. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C to remove the detergent-insoluble materials and nuclei. Then each lysate was transferred to a tube containing 30 ml of prewashed protein G-Sepharose and 2 mg of anti-CD20 mAb, and the mixture was incubated for 12 h at 4°C with constant rotation. The resulting immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 10 mM NaF, 0.5 M NaCl, and 1 mg/ml BSA and then twice with PBS. The precipitated proteins were eluted from the Sepharose gel by incubation in 30 ml of Laemmli sample butter (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) in a boiling water bath for 3 min. Electrophoresis in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) SDS was carried out using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide slab gels as described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), after which gel was fixed using 30% (v/v) methanol, 10% (v/v) acetic acid, and 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at room temperature. The gels were autoradiographed using XAR-5 X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.) and an intensifying screen. The relative molecular weights of the proteins were determined using rainbow-colored protein weight markers (Amersham Japan). Human cDNA encoding the entire translated region of the CD20 gene was subcloned into an Epstein-Barr virus vector, pMEP4, and transfected into Balb/c 3T3 cells. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were isolated, and the expression levels of the positive clones were analyzed by Northern blotting. A stable oligoclonal cell line that expressed CD20 was isolated. Fig. 1 shows the Northern blotting analysis results of these CD20-transfected cells. These cells were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FCS with or without 80 μM ZnCl2 for 24 h. CD20-transfected cells treated with ZnCl2 expressed CD20 mRNA, whereas untreated cells did not. We used two methods to show that the CD20-transfected cells but not the control cells expressed CD20 protein. Fig. 2 shows the time course of the binding of a mAb against CD20 to the cells. The CD20-transfected cells cultured with DMEM containing 80 μM ZnCl2 expressed immunoreactive CD20 protein (CD20-expressing cells), whereas those cultured without ZnCl2 (control cells) did not. The levels of immunoreactive CD20 remained elevated for at least 24 h after the removal of ZnCl2 from the CD20-transfected cells (Fig. 2). Immunohistochemically, over 80% (206 of 250 cells) of the CD20-transfected cells treated with 80 μM ZnCl2 expressed immunoreactive CD20 protein, which was absent in the cells that were not treated thus.Fig. 2Binding of antibody against CD20 in CD20-expressing cells. CD20-transfected cells were incubated for the indicated periods with (●) or without (○) 80 μM ZnCl2, and binding of 125I-labeled antibody was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In some experiments, binding was measured in cells 24 h after the removal of ZnCl2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to determine whether the expressed CD20 protein acts as a Ca2+-permeable channel, we monitored the changes in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) in response to elevation of the extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Fig. 3A shows the changes in [Ca2+]c in the CD20-expressing cells monitored by measuring the fluorescence of a Ca2+ indicator, fura-2. Increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from almost zero to 1.25 mM resulted in a [Ca2+]c rise in 27.8% (89 of 320) of the CD20-expressing cells but no change in the other 72.2%. However, when the extracellular Ca2+ concentration was raised from almost zero to 10 mM, the [Ca2+]c increased in approximately 75% (241 of 320) of the CD20-expressing cells. A typical response is shown in Fig. 3B. Therefore, approximately 75% of the CD20-expressing cells tested responded to changes in extracellular Ca2+ concentration, and 28% were considered to be good responders (). The [Ca2+]c of control and untransfected cells did not change significantly under these conditions (data not shown). The resting [Ca2+]c values in the responders and non-responders measured in 1.25 mM Ca2+-containing medium were 186 ± 70 and 104 ± 54 nM (mean ± S.E., n = 20), respectively. The resting [Ca2+]c of the control cells was identical to that of the non-responders. Next, we examined Ca2+ conductance by the whole cell patch clamp technique. Fig. 4 shows the leak-subtracted steady-state current-voltage relationship for the CD20-expressing cells. Expression of CD20 induced an increase in Ca2+ conductance. In 25% of the cells (27 of 108), the inward Ca2+ current in response to a voltage jump to −100 mV was greater than 30 pA, as shown in Fig. 4, and, in approximately 50% (52 of 108) of the cells, a smaller inward current (less than 20 pA in response to −100 mV) was observed. The inward Ca2+ current was negligible in the control cells (data not shown). These results demonstrate that constitutive expression of CD20 enhanced the plasma membrane Ca2+ permeability of approximately 75% of the CD20-expressing cells and confirm the previous observations of Bubien et al.(17Bubien J.K. Zhou L.J. Bell P.D. Frizzel R.A. Tedder T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1121-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+ entry into approximately 25% of the CD20-expressing cells was greater than that into the rest. These results are summarized in Table I.Fig. 4Calcium current in CD20-expressing cells. CD20-transfected cells were treated with ZnCl2 for 24 h. Whole cell mode patch clamp recording was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the current-voltage relationship for Ca2+ current is presented. ●, cells in which calcium current in response to −100 mV was greater than 30 pA; ○, cells in which calcium current in response to −100 mV was less than 20 pA.

The resulting starved CD20-expressing cells were used in this experiment. Control quiescent cells were obtained by incubating confluent CD20-transfected cells in DMEM containing 0.2% platelet-poor plasma for 24 h. When the CD20-expressing and control cells were treated with 0.2% platelet-poor plasma for 24 h, no nuclear labeling was detected (see below). Pretreatment with ZnCl2 for 24 h did not affect DNA synthesis by untransfected cells (data not shown). In order to determine the time course of entry into the S phase, the time course of nuclear labeling with BrdUrd was measured. When control cells rendered primed competent were incubated with 1 nM IGF-I, they traversed the cell cycle, and nuclear labeling took place after 12 h. As shown in Fig. 5A, nuclear labeling of control cells was first detected at 14 h a"
https://openalex.org/W2061280331,"The initiation of saliva formation by parotid acinar cells, which comprise the majority of cells in this salivary gland, is initiated by the release of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, substance P) from parasympathetic nerves. In response to substance P and the muscarinic agonist carbachol, two ligands that activate phospholipase C-linked receptors, which stimulate fluid secretion, PKCδ was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The maximal agonist-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation occurred within seconds of the addition of either agonist and then returned rapidly to a smaller increased level. Phorbol ester also caused a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, which reached a maximal level 5 min after the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and staurosporine. Ionophore-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i or activation of the β-adrenergic receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, or insulin receptor did not promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in early signal transduction events promoted by the activation of muscarinic and substance P receptors and suggests that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ has a role in the activation of fluid secretion by neurotransmitters binding to phospholipase C-linked receptors. The initiation of saliva formation by parotid acinar cells, which comprise the majority of cells in this salivary gland, is initiated by the release of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, substance P) from parasympathetic nerves. In response to substance P and the muscarinic agonist carbachol, two ligands that activate phospholipase C-linked receptors, which stimulate fluid secretion, PKCδ was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The maximal agonist-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation occurred within seconds of the addition of either agonist and then returned rapidly to a smaller increased level. Phorbol ester also caused a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation, which reached a maximal level 5 min after the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was blocked by tyrosine kinase inhibitors genistein and staurosporine. Ionophore-mediated elevation of [Ca2+]i or activation of the β-adrenergic receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor, or insulin receptor did not promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in early signal transduction events promoted by the activation of muscarinic and substance P receptors and suggests that the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ has a role in the activation of fluid secretion by neurotransmitters binding to phospholipase C-linked receptors. INTRODUCTIONThe protein kinase C (PKC)1( 1The abbreviations used are: PKCprotein kinase Canti-P-Tyranti-phosphotyrosinePMSFphenylmethylsufonyl fluorideEGFepidermal growth factorPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) family of proteins currently consists of 12 members that are phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine-specific protein kinases (for review, see Nishizuka, 1992Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4214) Google Scholar and Hug and Sarre, 1993Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The family is subdivided into those members that are calcium-dependent conventional PCKs (α, βI, βII, γ), calcium-independent novel PKCs (δ, ε, η, θ), and atypical PKCs (ζ and t/λ). Another subgroup may include PKCμ, a recent addition to the PKC family. With the exception of the atypical PKC group, all members are activated by phorbol esters, which bind to the site at which the endogenous activator sn-1,2-diacylglycerol binds. In addition to the activation of PKC by phospholipids and/or Ca2+, other phospholipids, notably phosphoinositides produced by the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, have been found to activate members of the conventional PKC and novel PKC family (Singh et al., 1993Singh S.S.

Different cells have different profiles of PKC isoforms, and recent studies suggest that isoforms may have distinct and different functions in cells (Li et al., 1994bLi W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P.

Multiple members of the PKC family of enzymes exist in parotid acinar cells, including PKCα (Terzian and Rubin, 1993Terzian A.R. Rubin R.P. Arch. Oral. Biol. 1993; 38: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).2( 2S. P. Soltoff, unpublished results.) Parotid acinar cells have been a focus of study for the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, and the subsequent entry of Ca2+ across the plasma membrane via capacitative entry mechanisms (Komabayashi et al., 1992Komabayashi T.

CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 153-179Google Scholar). These events lead to the activation of Ca2+-sensitive channels and the initiation of saliva formation, events that are controlled by the release of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, substance P) from parasympathetic nerves. While examining the effects of growth factors and other receptor ligands on the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of parotid acinar cells, we found that the muscarinic agonist carbachol and substance P promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of an ∼80-kDa protein and that phorbol ester promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of the same band, which was identified as the δ isoform of PKC.Several studies have overexpressed various PKC isoforms to examine the functions of specific isoforms. These and other studies have reported that PMA promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. PKCδ (and PKCα) expression was increased in c-Ha-ras-transformed fibroblasts (Borner et al., 1992bBorner C. Guadagno S.N. Hsiao W.W.-L. Fabbro D. Barr M. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12900-12910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PKCδ was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated in c-Ha-ras-transformed keratinocytes (Denning et al., 1993Denning M.F. Dlugosz A.A. Howett M.K. Yuspa S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26079-26081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a myeloid progenitor cell line (32D cells) and in NIH 3T3 cells that overexpressed PKCδ, phorbol ester stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (Li et al., 1994aLi W. Mischak H. Yu J.-C. Wang L.-M. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 32D cells in which PKCδ and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor were overexpressed, platelet-derived growth factor stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ and myeloid differentiation (Li et al., 1994bLi W. Yu J.-C. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In an earlier study using 32D cells, differentiation was promoted in cells in which PKCα and -δ were overexpressed, but not in cells in which PKC βII, ε, ζ, or η was overexpressed (Mischak et al., 1993aMischak H. Goodnight J. Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Schaechtle C. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Pierce J.H. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6090-6096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In NIH 3T3 cells, overexpression of PKCδ produced changes in cell morphology and slowed cell growth, while very different changes (increase in growth rate and in cell density at confluence) were obtained by overexpression of PKCε in these cells (Mischak et al., 1993bMischak H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 20110-20115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The present study utilizes freshly isolated dispersed cells from rat parotid gland. The rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in the acinar cells suggests that this biochemical event contributes to the normal physiological responses promoted by the release of neurotransmitters from parasympathetic nerves that promote fluid secretion and saliva formation in this exocrine gland.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsAll chemicals were reagent grade or better. PMA and 4α-PMA were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Carbamyl choline (carbachol) and substance P were purchased from Sigma. Anti-phosphotyrosine was a generous gift of Dr. Tom Roberts (Dana Farber, Boston, MA). [32P]PO4 was purchased from DuPont NEN. Anti-protein kinase C δ antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories, Kingston, NY, or Taconic, Germantown, NY), 200-250 g, were used for all experiments.Cell Preparation and SolutionsFreshly dispersed parotid acinar cells were prepared as described previously (Soltoff et al., 1989Soltoff S.P. McMillian M.K. Cantley L.C. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Talamo B.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 93: 285-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cells were suspended at ∼2 mg/ml in a medium (Solution A) of the following composition: 116.4 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5 mM butyrate, 5.6 mM glucose, pH 7.4. Cells were kept on ice prior to use. Samples (1.5 ml) of the cell suspension were stirred and equilibrated at 37°C for 10-15 min prior to use.Immunoprecipitations and Western BlottingAfter the cells were exposed to the agonists or inhibitors, the cells were pelleted by a brief spin in a microcentrifuge (Brinkmann 5414). The supernatant was removed and replaced by 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 0.2 mM vanadate, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.5). The lysates were vortexed and centrifuged at 16,000 × g at 4°C for 15 min. The cleared supernatants were transferred to fresh 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. A portion (5-10% of the volume) of the lysate was removed and combined with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 6.25% (v/v) SDS, 0.72 N β-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue for color). The remainder was incubated with either anti-P-Tyr (6.6 μg/ml) or anti-PKCδ (1-2 μg/ml) antibodies and protein A-Sepharose (4 mg/ml lysate), and the samples were rocked at 4°C for 3 h or overnight. At the end of the incubation, the immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, washed 3 times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mM NaCl, 15.7 mM NaH2PO4, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 2.68 mM KCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4), two times in 0.1 M Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 M LiCl, and two times in TNE (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5). All wash solutions contained 0.2 mM vanadate. The majority of the TNE was removed, the remaining volume was diluted with an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 5-10 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins and the lysate fractions were subjected to electrophoresis or stored at - 80°C prior to electrophoresis.Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-7% polyacrylamide separating gel with a 3% stacking gel. Proteins were transferred to 0.2 μm pore-size nitrocellulose filters, and the filters were blocked with TBS (20 mM Tris (pH 7.6), 137 mM NaCl), 2% (w/v) BSA for 1 h. The filters were washed in TTBS (TBS, 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20) three times. The nitrocellulose filters were exposed to anti-PKCδ antibody (0.2 μg/ml) or anti-P-Tyr antibody (1 μg/ml) in TTBS/1% BSA for ∼16 h at 4°C. The filters were washed three times in TTBS, and exposed to anti-rabbit (for anti-PKCδ) or anti-mouse (for anti-P-Tyr) horseradish peroxidase (Boehringer-Mannheim) at a 1:10,000 dilution in TTBS/1% BSA for 1 h. All washes and exposure to the secondary antibody were performed at room temperature. Filters were washed three times with TTBS and twice with TBS, and were visualized on x-ray film (Kodak) using a chemiluminescence system (Amersham or DuPont NEN). In some experiments, the filters were stripped by exposing them to 62.5 mM Tris (pH 6.8), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1 M), 2% (w/v) SDS at 70°C for 40 min. The stripped filters were washed several times in TTBS, once in TBS, blocked with TBS, 2% BSA for one hour, and reprobed with antibody for 16 h. Blots were then treated as described above.In Vivo Labeling and Phosphoamino Acid AnalysisIn vivo phosphorylation studies were performed by labeling the cells with [32P]PO4. Cells were suspended in solution A, except NaH2PO4 was omitted. A suspension of cells was incubated at 37°C and exposed to [32P]PO4 (2-3 mCi/ml cells) for ∼1-2 h, after which they were resuspended in an identical pre-warmed medium in the absence of [32P]PO4. Cells were exposed to PMA, carbachol, or vehicle (Me2SO). The cells from each experimental condition were collected and pelleted, the supernatant was removed and the tube was rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline without dislodging the pellet. The cell pellet was lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, to which anti-PKCδ (2-3 μg/ml) antibody was added. The antibody was collected using protein A-Sepharose and washed as described above. The proteins were transferred to 0.45 μm pore size Immobilon-P (Millipore) using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot system and a transfer buffer of the following composition: 25 mM Tris base, 192 mM glycine in 15% (v/v) methanol, pH 8.2-8.3.In some cases the immobilized phosphorylated PKCδ proteins were cut out and subjected to acid hydrolysis for two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis as described previously (Boyle et al., 1991Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar).Cell Fractionation (Translocation) ExperimentsFractionation experiments were conducted with modifications of the protocol outlined in Olivier and Parker, 1994Olivier A.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2758-2763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Cells were suspended and stirred at ∼2 mg of protein/ml and equilibrated at 37°C for 10 min prior to use. Upon treatment, cells were quickly pelleted, the physiological solution was replaced with Buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mM sucrose, 2.5 mM magnesium acetate, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM benzamidine), and this was removed and replaced with 2 ml of homogenization buffer (Buffer A plus 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM EDTA, 4 μg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin; 1 mM phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride). The cells were resuspended, and the suspension was homogenized for 40 strokes in a tight Dounce homogenizer followed by a 5-s sonication (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT; setting 7) repeated 3 times. The homogenate was centrifuged for 30 min at 70,000 rpm at 4°C in a Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge. A portion (∼5%) of the supernatant (cytosolic fraction) was collected as cytosolic lysate, and an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated at 100°C for 8 min. The detergent-soluble proteins were solubilized by adding Buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM sodium fluoride, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent, 4 μg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mM phenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM benzamidine) to the pellet; the solution was vortexed, transferred to a Dounce homogenizer, and broken apart with 20 strokes. Detergent-soluble proteins were collected by spinning the sample at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. A portion (∼5%) of the supernatant was collected as membrane lysate, sample buffer was added, and the samples were heated. In some experiments, the remainder of the supernatants of the cytosolic fraction and membrane fraction were used for immunoprecipitation studies using anti-PKCδ antibody (2 μg/ml) or anti-P-Tyr antibody (6.6 μg/ml). After addition of protein A-Sepharose as above, the immunoprecipitates were rocked at 4°C for 3 h or overnight and collected and washed as described above.DataAll experiments were conducted at least twice with similar results to those shown in the figures.RESULTSCarbachol, Substance P, and PMA Stimulate the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PKCδCarbachol and substance P, two receptor ligands that stimulate the production of diacylglycerol in parotid cells, and PMA, which binds to the diacylglycerol binding site on PKC, all stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Differences among the stimuli were highlighted in a comparison of their time courses (Fig. 1, A and B). In cells exposed to carbachol or substance P for varying periods of time up to 15 min, the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was greatest for cells exposed to these stimuli for ∼15 s, and then it diminished to a lower level. Within 15 min, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation was close to that found in untreated cells. Previous studies on inositol trisphosphate production and [Ca2+]i elevation in parotid cells demonstrated that the stimulatory effects of substance P rapidly diminished due to homologous receptor desensitization, although the effects of carbachol were maintained for up to 10 min or longer (McMillian et al., 1987McMillian M.K. Soltoff S.P. Talamo B.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Sugiya et al., 1987Sugiya H. Tennes K.A. Putney Jr., J.W. Biochem. J. 1987; 244: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ elicited by both carbachol and substance P displayed a very early increase and then a decline. The decrease in tyrosine-phosphorylated PKCδ (Fig. 1, A and B) without a decrease in the mass of the PKCδ protein (Fig. 1C) indicates that a protein-tyrosine phosphatase was activated. This suggests that the activation of tyrosine phosphatase activity is also involved in the stimulation of these cells by carbachol and substance P.Effects of PMA were observed at times as early as ∼15 s (Fig. 1, A and B). However, in contrast to the effects of the two receptor-mediated ligands, the PMA-promoted phosphorylation of PKCδ continued to increase up to 5 min of exposure. For all three stimuli, similar findings were observed when proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-PKCδ antibody and immunoblotted with anti-P-Tyr antibody (Fig. 1A) or when proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-P-Tyr antibody and immunoblotted with anti-PKCδ antibody (Fig. 1B). The results suggest that PKCδ is involved in early signal transduction events subsequent to the activation of the muscarinic and substance P receptors in the parotid acinar cell.In lysates of parotid acinar cells, PKCδ appears as a doublet protein at ∼80 kDa (Fig. 2). Although the doublet appears in both stimulated and unstimulated cells in some experiments, in most experiments the mass of the upper band appears to increase with stimulation. This is most readily detected in cells treated with PMA, but also it is seen in carbachol- or substance P-stimulated cells (Fig. 1C). Anti-P-Tyr antibody preferentially immunoprecipitates and immunoblots the upper form of the enzyme, indicating that this is the tyrosine-phosphorylated form. The anti-PKCδ antibody immunoprecipitates and immunoblots both forms of enzyme. This is observed easily when proteins immunoprecipitated using anti-PKCδ antibody are immunoblotted for both PKCδ and tyrosine phosphorylation, and are compared side by side with lysates (Fig. 2). This also demonstrates that the tyrosine-phosphorylated enzyme accounts for only a portion of the upper band of PKCδ (Fig. 2). The identification of the upper band as the tyrosine-phosphorylated form is consistent with the stimuli producing a mobility shift to a slower migrating form of the isoenzyme due to an increase in phosphorylation, which consists of both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation (see below).Fig. 2Identification of tyrosine phosphorylated PKCδ in anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates of carbachol- and PMA-treated parotid acinar cells. Unstimulated cells (-) or cells stimulated with PMA (200 nM) or carbachol (1 × 10−5 M) for 5 min were lysed. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-PKCδ, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was probed with anti-PKCδ (leftpanel). The nitrocellulose blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-P-Tyr antibody (middlepanel). Lysates (rightpanel) are from a separate experiment using cells treated as described. PKCδ is visualized as a doublet in cell lysates and in anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates. The upper band of the doublet was selectively immunoprecipitated by anti-P-Tyr antibody (Fig. 1B).

For cells treated with PMA for 15 min, 20 nM PMA produced a measurable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. This was increased by 200 nM PMA, and concentrations of 1 μM (Fig. 3) or 2 μM (not shown) did not produce an increase over that promoted by 200 nM. The results obtained using inactive phorbol ester (4α-PMA) were similar to those found in cells treated with vehicle (Me2SO) alone (not shown).Fig. 3Concentration dependence of the stimulatory effect of PMA on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Cells were treated with 20-1000 nM PMA for 15 min or treated with 0.2% Me2SO (0), and proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-P-Tyr and immunoblotted using anti-PKCδ antibody. Tyrosine phosphorylation is modest but observable at 20 nM PMA and is maximal at 200 nM PMA. Proteins were visualized on x-ray film using enhanced chemiluminescence. Molecular mass markers (in kDa) are indicated on the left. The arrow on the right designates the location of the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of PKCδ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Carbachol and PMA Stimulate Phosphorylation of PKCδ in VivoCarbachol and PMA both produced substantial increases in the phosphorylation of PKCδ in cells that were prelabeled with [32P]PO4 and then exposed to these stimuli. A 2-min exposure to PMA increased the phosphorylation to 6 times that found in unstimulated cells, and carbachol increased it to 4 times the basal level (Fig. 4). Similar increases were observed in cells treated for 5 or 15 min (not shown).Fig. 4Carbachol and PMA stimulate the in vivo phosphorylation of PKCδ. Parotid acinar cells were labeled with [32P]PO4, washed to remove the extracellular isotope, and resuspended (see “Experimental Procedures”). Cells were treated with 0.2% Me2SO (-), PMA (200 nM), or carbachol (1 × 10−3 M) for 2 min, after which they were lysed. PKCδ was immunoprecipitated using anti-PKCδ antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, and exposed to x-ray film. The arrow on the right designates the location of PKCδ. Similar results were obtained using cells treated with stimuli for 5 or 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In some experiments the PKCδ band at ∼80 kDa was cut out and subjected to two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis. Although the in vivo [32P]PO4 labeling was sufficient to demonstrate an increase in serine phosphorylation (not shown) in PMA-treated cells, consistent with the activation of PKCδ activity by these stimuli, the in vivo labeling was not sufficient to observe the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation makes up only a small fraction of the enhanced in vivo phosphorylation in the anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates shown in Fig. 4. A similar conclusion concerning the relatively small fraction of tyrosine phosphorylated PKCδ was made from results obtained from anti-P-Tyr immunoblots of anti-PKCδ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2).Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PKCδ Is Not Promoted by Protein Kinase A-linked Receptors, EGF and Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinases, and Calcium IonophoreOther stimuli were examined for their ability to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (Fig. 5). Isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist that activates protein kinase A in these cells, was examined at concentrations as high as 10−4 M and did not promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in any significantly detectible manner. Ionomycin, a calcium ionophore, was without effect at 10−6 or 10−5 M, which are concentrations that cause large increases in [Ca2+]i. EGF (100 ng/ml) produced an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple proteins in parotid acinar cells, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (not shown), but it did not promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Insulin (100 nM) also was without effect on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. These results suggest that the carbachol-, substance P-, and phorbol ester-promoted tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ was not mediated by an increase in [Ca2+]i or an activation of protein kinase A and that the activation of two receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (the EGF and insulin receptors) also was insufficient to promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ in parotid acinar cells. EGF promotes increases in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in some cells (Hughes et al., 1991Hughes A.R. Bird G.St.J. Obie J.F. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 254-262PubMed Google Scholar), and its lack of effect on PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in parotid cells may reflect a relatively low density of EGF receptors and the sensitivity of detection of this event.Fig. 5Comparison of the effects of various stimulatory agents on PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in parotid acinar cells. Cells were treated with vehicle (-) or exposed to the following concentrations of stimuli: PMA (200 nM), carbachol (1 × 10−4 M), substance P (1 × 10−7 M), ionomycin (1 × 10−6 M), isoproterenol (10−4 M), EGF (100 ng/ml), and insulin (100 μM). Cells were exposed for 5 min (PMA, carbachol, isoproterenol, EGF, insulin), 1 min (ionomycin), or both times (substance P). At the end of the exposure period, proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysed cells using anti-P-Tyr antibody, subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using anti-PKCδ antibody. Proteins were visualized on x-ray film by using enhanced chemiluminescence. Only cells exposed to PMA, carbachol, and substance P demonstrated a measurable increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. EGF (100 ng/ml), insulin (100 nM), and isoproterenol (10−5 M) also did not produce a significant effect on PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation at shorter times of agonist exposure (0.2 and 1 min). The arrow on the right designates the location of the tyrosine phosphorylated form of PKCδ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Genistein and Staurosporine Block PKCδ Tyrosine PhosphorylationThe effects of two tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and staurosporine, were examined on the tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ. Cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 15 min prior to exposure to carbachol or PMA. The tyrosine phosphorylation promoted by PMA was partially reduced at 0.1 μM staurosporine and was not observable at 1 μM or 5 μM staurosporine (not shown). The effects of PMA or carbachol were partially reduced by 1 and 10 μM genistein, and 100 μM produced an almost complete reduction in the PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation (not shown). These experiments indicate that the effects of carbachol and PMA are mediated via staurosporine- and genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2008106258,"Leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is a cell surface adhesion receptor for intercellular adhesion molecule-1, −2, and −3 (ICAM-1, −2, −3). Using human/murine chimeras of the I-domain of the LFA-1 α subunit (CD11a), we recently identified the epitopes recognized by eight monoclonal antibodies against CD11a that inhibit LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1. In this report, we determined that replacement of the entire human I-domain with the entire murine I-domain in CD11a completely abrogated LFA-1 binding to human ICAM-1 without affecting the gross conformation or heterodimer formation of LFA-1, as assayed by antibody binding. In order to assess which residues of the I-domain are responsible for binding to ICAM-1, we tested the ability of a panel of human/murine I-domain chimeras to bind to human ICAM-1. When complexed with CD18, all CD11a chimeras bound ICAM-1 at levels comparable to wild-type CD11a/CD18, indicating that the residues in these chimeras which differ in human and murine I-domains may not play a critical role in LFA-1 binding to ICAM-1. A series of point mutations of residues that are conserved between murine and human CD11a I-domains, as well as between CD11b and CD11c, were also generated. Substitution of alanine for proline at position 192 in the human CD11a I-domain abrogated adhesion of LFA-1 to ICAM-1. Antibody binding data suggested that this was due to conformational changes within the I-domain. Mutation of the aspartic acids at positions 137 and 239 to either alanine or lysine completely destroyed ICAM-1 binding. The conformation of LFA-1 alanine mutants was not significantly altered. This suggests that these aspartic acids are required for binding of human LFA-1 to human ICAM-1."

The loss of GTP binding due to mutations in the GTP-binding element of MxA was accompanied by a loss of antiviral activity (7Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P. Schwemmle M.

Natural and recombinant His-MxA form high molecular weight oligomers, a characteristic of unknown significance. His-MxA purified from E. coli retains antiviral activity; it blocked in vitro transcription of vesicular stomatitis virus (9Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and influenza A virus (10Landis H. Hefti H.P. Pavlovic J. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Inhibition of viral polymerase activity by His-MxA was observed irrespective of whether the reaction mixture contained GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs (9Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F.

Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that binding rather than hydrolysis of GTP is of functional importance.Little is known about the functional domains of MxA. A domain that determines antiviral specificity is located near the COOH terminus; MxA with a single amino acid substitution at position 645 was active against influenza A virus, but unlike wild-type MxA, the mutant protein failed to inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus in vivo(11Zurcher T.

Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we observed that a His-MxA mutant that lacks the COOH-terminal 300 amino acids had lost GTPase activity. This result suggested that the NH2-terminal fragment that harbors the tripartite GTP-binding consensus element (14Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) requires sequences from the COOH terminus to form a functional GTPase. We have now studied the influence of COOH-terminal sequences of MxA for GTPase activity in more detail. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the COOH-terminal 99 amino acids are required for GTPase activity, whereas sequences located between the GTP-binding consensus element and the COOH-terminal domain are dispensable. Mild proteolysis of His-MxA yielded a large NH2-terminal and a small COOH-terminal polypeptide that formed a stable GTPase-active complex, suggesting that the COOH terminus folds back and interacts with the GTP-binding consensus element to form the active center of the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid ConstructionsAll mutant constructs were derived from plasmid pHis-MxA (7Pitossi F.

The construct pHis-MxA(1-301), pHis-MxA(1-362), pHis-MxA(1-599), and pHis-MxA(1-655) were generated by digesting full-length pHis-MxA with HindIII and either BglII, SalI, BclI, or NarI, blunting the ends with Klenow polymerase, and re-ligating the products. Because of this cloning procedure, the mutant MxA proteins had extra amino acids at their COOH termini. The extra sequence of His-MxA(1-301) and His-MxA(1-599) was Ser-Leu-Ile-Ser, of His-MxA(1-655) Gln-Pro-Asn, and of His-MxA(1-362) Glu-Ala. The construct pHis-MxA(Δ301-576) was generated by cutting pHis-MxA with BglII to release a 725-nucleotide fragment and re-ligating the products.Purification of Histidine-tagged Wild-type and Mutant MxA ProteinsHistidine-tagged wild-type and mutant MxA proteins were purified from E. coli as described (7Pitossi F.

Complete conversion of His-MxA to the p60-p10 complex was verified by running treated and untreated samples on SDS-PAGE gels and staining with Coomassie Blue. 200-μl samples of proteinase K-treated His-MxA were loaded on a Superose 12 HR10/30 gel filtration column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Most of the p60-p10 complex was found in the void volume. This material was applied to a HR5/5 Mono Q chromatography column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer B containing 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The p60-p10 complex eluted at 350 mM NaCl.For large scale purifications, 1 ml of proteinase K-treated His-MxA (6-8 mg/ml) was subjected to a Hi Load 16/60 Superdex™ 200 HR preparative grade gel filtration column (Pharmacia) equilibrated with glycerol-free buffer B. Column fractions between void volume (>600 kDa) and 400 kDa were pooled and purified by Mono Q chromatography as described above. Yields of p60-p10 complex were about 20-40% of the His-MxA starting material.Protein SequencingThe proteinase K-resistant 60-kDa and 10-kDa polypeptides were recovered from 10% and 20% SDS-PAGE gels, respectively, by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Sequencing from the NH2 terminus was performed with an Applied Biosystems 477A Protein Sequencer.GTPase AssaysGTPase assays were performed as described (8Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C.

Briefly, 0.1-0.2 mg/ml purified wild-type or mutant His-MxA was incubated at 37°C in buffer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 nM AMP-PNP, 13 nM [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and 1 mM GTP). Where indicated, a lower GTP concentration was used. After stopping reactions with 0.5% SDS and 2 mM EDTA, samples were spotted onto polyethylenimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (MN300, Macherey and Nagel, Düren, Germany), and the nucleotides were separated in a solution containing 1 M LiCl and 1 M acetic acid. The dried plates were exposed to x-ray films. The signals were quantified using a digital autoradiograph LB286 (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany).Determination of Dissociation ConstantsDetermination of the dissociation constants Kd of proteinase K-treated His-MxA and His-MxA(1-362) for the fluorescent nonhydrolyzable GTP analog mant-GMP-PNP was done as described for wild-type MxA (8Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Estimating the Degree of His-MxA OligomerizationThe degree of oligomerization was estimated by performing gel filtration experiments. 500-μl samples of Mono Q-purified wild-type or mutant His-MxA (at about 1 mg/ml) were loaded on a Hi Load 16/6 Superdex™ 200 HR preparative grade gel filtration column (S-200) (Pharmacia) in buffer B at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and fractions of 1.4 ml were collected. The elution profiles were analyzed by running samples of each second column fraction on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and staining with Coomassie Blue.RESULTSCOOH-terminal Deletions Destroy GTPase Activity of MxAWhile studying the effect of MxA on the in vitro transcription of vesicular stomatitis virus, we observed that the COOH-terminally truncated mutant His-MxA(1-362) lacked measurable GTPase activity (9Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of COOH-terminal sequences for GTPase activity in more detail, we created E. coli expression constructs for a series of MxA mutants with COOH-terminal deletions of variable lengths (Fig. 1). The shortest deletion was 7 amino acids in His-MxA(1-655), the longest deletion was 361 amino acids in His-MxA(1-301). Because of the cloning procedure, all mutant proteins contained two to four foreign amino acids at the COOH terminus. Since wild-type and mutant His-MxA carried a histidine tag at the NH2 terminus, convenient purification from bacterial lysates was possible by a single round of nickel chelate agarose chromatography. We have shown previously that this procedure yields MxA of acceptable purity and high specific GTPase activity (7Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J.

Several independent preparations of the mutants His-MxA(1-301), His-MxA(1-362), and His-MxA(1-599) lacked measurable GTPase activity, whereas preparations of His-MxA(1-655) showed very low GTPase activity (Fig. 1).To measure the low GTPase activities more accurately, we purified selected preparations of the various MxA mutants by Mono Q column chromatography. Like wild-type His-MxA, the mutant proteins eluted from the Mono Q column between 250 and 350 mM NaCl. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that mutants His-MxA(1-301) and His-MxA(1-362) were about 90% pure as judged by Coomassie Blue staining, whereas the other mutants were only about 50% pure (Fig. 2). The prominent contaminant at about 30 kDa presumably represents an NH2-terminal fragment of His-MxA because it is recognized by an antiserum to full-length MxA but not by an antiserum to a COOH-terminal fragment that comprises amino acids 301 to 662 (data not shown). Purification by Mono Q chromatography of wild-type His-MxA had little effect on its specific GTPase activity, which was 11.4 mol of GTP/min/mol (Fig. 1). The Mono Q-purified mutants His-MxA(1-301), His-MxA(1-362), and His-MxA(1-599) failed to convert GTP to GDP at a rate that was high enough for detection under our assay conditions (<0.04 mol of GTP/min/mol) (Fig. 1). This picture did not change when the substrate concentration was varied from 0.1 to 1.5 mM (data not shown). The specific activity of His-MxA(1-655) was 0.15 mol of GTP/min/mol (Fig. 1). Mixing experiments showed that the COOH-terminal His-MxA mutants did not influence the GTP hydrolysis rate of wild-type His-MxA, demonstrating that the low GTPase activity in the former preparations was not due to the presence of inhibitory contaminants (data not shown).Fig. 2Purity of wild-type (wt) and mutant His-MxA proteins. Samples (4 μg/lane) of the various His-MxA preparations after nickel chelate affinity chromatography and fractionation on Mono Q were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Blue.

Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we tested whether our inactive MxA mutants would show a different behavior. Running samples of the various His-MxA mutants on an S-200 gel filtration column revealed that they were all present as oligomers; the loaded material eluted mostly with the column void volume (data not shown), indicating that the oligomers were 600 kDa or larger.Since the various MxA deletion mutants contained the tripartite GTP-binding consensus element, which is located in the NH2-terminal half of MxA (Fig. 1), it was of interest to test whether they would still bind GTP. Since His-MxA(1-362) could be purified most easily, we chose this mutant for binding studies that were performed with the fluorescence-labeled nonhydrolyzable GTP analog mant-GMP-PNP (8Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using this assay, the dissociation constant of wild-type His-MxA for mant-GMP-PNP was determined to be 0.75 μM (Fig. 1). However, we failed to demonstrate specific binding of fluorescent mant-GMP-PNP to His-MxA(1-362) under identical assay conditions, indicating that the Kd was higher than 100 μM. This result suggested that COOH-terminal sequences of MxA are required for both binding and hydrolysis of GTP.A Deletion Mutant with Intact COOH Terminus Exhibits GTPase ActivityTo challenge the hypothesis that sequences from near the COOH terminus of MxA are required for GTP hydrolysis, we generated the expression construct pHis-MxA(Δ301-576), which codes for an MxA variant with intact NH2 and COOH termini but which lacks the 275 amino acids between positions 301 and 576 (Fig. 1). His-MxA(Δ301-576) could be purified fairly well from bacterial lysates (Fig. 2) and had a specific GTPase activity of 0.98 mol of GTP/min/mol, which corresponds to about 9% of wild-type activity. A more detailed examination showed that the Km for the GTP hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by His-MxA(Δ301-576) was 1,150 μM (Fig. 1). The Km of wild-type His-MxA for this reaction was 260 μM.Treating MxA with Proteinase K Yields Two Resistant Polypeptides of 60 and 10 kDa Which Form a GTPase-active ComplexProteins are often composed of functional domains that are connected by linkers. The linkers are usually more accessible to proteolytic degradation than the compact structures of the domains. Mild treatment of purified wild-type His-MxA with proteinase K resulted in rapid degradation of the full-length protein and accumulation of a prominent 60-kDa fragment (p60) which could be visualized by 10% SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, proteinase K-treated His-MxA retained GTPase activity (Fig. 3B), indicating that the catalytic site remained functional. Conversion of His-MxA to p60 was completed within about 5 min, and the p60 polypeptide resisted further degradation by proteinase K for up to 120 min (data not shown). The yields of proteinase K-resistant fragment varied between preparations of His-MxA and were negatively affected by prolonged storage at −80°C and repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. Analysis of proteinase K-treated His-MxA by 20% SDS-PAGE revealed the presence of several small protein fragments, but their significance was unclear. To examine whether one of these polypeptides was complexed with p60, proteinase K-treated His-MxA was subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 12 column, and samples of the various fractions were analyzed for polypeptide content and GTPase activity. The bulk of p60 eluted with the void volume (Fig. 4, lanes 2-4), indicating that it formed oligomers like full-length His-MxA. Column fractions containing p60 showed approximately equimolar amounts of a 10-kDa polypeptide (p10), suggesting that the two fragments formed a complex. The column fractions that exhibited high GTPase activity contained both p60 and p10 (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the p60-p10 complex was the active entity. Further purification of the p60-p10 complex was achieved by applying pooled gel filtration fractions (Fig. 5, lane 1) containing p60-p10 to Mono Q chromatography. Both the p60-p10 complex and GTPase activity eluted from this column at about 350 mM NaCl (Fig. 5, lanes 2-5). The complex showed a specific GTPase activity of 11 mol of GTP/min/mol, its Km for GTP hydrolysis was 330 μM, and its Kd for mant-GMP-PNP was 2 μM (Fig. 1). These values were almost identical to those of full-length His-MxA, suggesting that proteinase K treatment did not affect the catalytic site and that the association between p60 and p10 was similar to wild-type MxA.Fig. 3Mild digestion of His-MxA with proteinase K has little effect on GTPase activity. Panel A, samples of Mono Q-purified His-MxA were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE before (lane 1) or after (lane 2) incubation with proteinase K.

The NH2-terminal sequence of p60 was LCSQYNN, which corresponds to positions 41-47 of MxA (Fig. 6); the NH2-terminal sequence of p10 was QSSSATD, which corresponds to positions 564-570. Thus, proteinase K treatment removed the 40 nonconserved NH2-terminal amino acids of MxA as well as a small internal fragment. The internal cleavage site maps to a region of MxA (positions 555-575) which is poorly conserved in Mx proteins from mammals and birds (16Bernasconi D. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1994; 15: 47-53Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These results agreed well with the concept that had emerged from the MxA deletion analysis, which suggested intramolecular interactions of COOH- and NH2-terminal sequences.Fig. 6NH2-terminal sequences of proteinase K-resistant fragments p60 and p10 and relationship to full-length MxA. After partial digestion of His-MxA with proteinase K, the resistant polypeptides p60 and p10 were gel purified and sequenced from their NH2 termini. Derived sequence information (indicated in capital letters, single-letter code) allowed to map the two fragments to MxA regions with high sequence conservation. Dotted areas mark two regions of MxA which were identified as highly variable by previous sequence comparisons (16Bernasconi D. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1994; 15: 47-53Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe principal conclusion from the experiments presented here is that binding and hydrolysis of GTP by the interferon-induced MxA protein require both an intact GTP-binding consensus element and an intact COOH terminus. Deletion mutants of MxA that lacked 7 or more COOH-terminal amino acids exhibited greatly reduced GTPase activity, whereas a mutant with intact NH2 and COOH termini but lacking 275 internal amino acids retained a high degree of activity. Furthermore, biochemical analysis showed that sequences from the NH2-terminal half of MxA which include the tripartite GTP-binding consensus element are in physical contact with amino acids from near the COOH terminus. Thus, the structural requirements for GTP binding and GTP hydrolysis by MxA are without precedent. Our results suggest that the GTP binding pocket of MxA has a structure that could be distinct from that of p21ras, elongation factor Tu, and other well known GTPases (17Wittinghofer A. Pai E.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 382-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. Mccormick F.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 246-250Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar). They may explain the unique biochemical parameters of MxA: low affinity for GTP (Kd 20 μM) and even lower affinity for GDP (Kd 100 μM), the need for very high substrate concentrations for high rates of GTP hydrolysis (kcat 27 min−1, Km 260 μM), and no need of accessory factors for performing multiple cycles of GTP hydrolysis (8Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13512-13517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Our findings that even small COOH-terminal deletions had a strong negative effect on the GTPase activity of MxA was unexpected in the light of earlier findings with the Mx-related protein Vps-1p of yeasts. Radiolabeled GTP bound similarly well to full-length Vps-1p and certain NH2-terminal Vps-1p fragments (21Vater C.A. Raymond C.K. Ekena K. Howald-Stevenson I. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting that a relatively small region that comprises the tripartite GTP-binding consensus element is necessary and sufficient for binding of GTP by Vps-1p. Since our experiments with deletion mutant His-MxA(1-362) showed that COOH-terminal sequences are not only required for hydrolysis but also for binding of GTP to MxA, it appears that the nucleotide binding pockets of Vps-1p and MxA have also quite different structures despite sequence similarity (22Rothman J.H. Raymond C.K. Gilbert T. O'Hara J. Stevens T.H. Cell. 1990; 61: 1063-1074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, a direct comparison of the Vps-1p and MxA mutant studies is not possible because no information is available on the GTP hydrolysis activities of the various Vps-1p mutants.Mild degradation of purified His-MxA with proteinase K yielded valuable information regarding the tertiary structure of this GTPase. Protease treatment has been applied to remove poorly structured amino acid sequences from a variety of proteins, including the G protein Gtα(23Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 24Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 366: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar), elongation factor Tu (25la Cour T.F.M Nyborg J. Thirup S. Clark B.F.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2385-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 26Kurnak F. Science. 1985; 230: 32-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), and methionyl-tRNA synthetase (27Brunie S. Zelwer C. Risler J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 411-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Typically, the resulting protease-resistant polypeptides were easier to crystallize than the starting material, presumably because their structures were more compact. In the case of MxA, two protease-resistant fragments (p60 and p10) were identified which corresponded almost exactly to Mx regions previously identified as highly conserved among mammals and birds (16Bernasconi D. Schultz U. Staeheli P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1994; 15: 47-53Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since the two fragments copurified as a stable complex during gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography, they must interact very strongly with each other. It is unknown at present which amino acids are actively participating in this interaction. Mutational analysis will be necessary to determine whether the putative leucine zipper motif located near the COOH termini of all Mx proteins (28Melen K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is involved. Our results suggest that a compact structure (p10) that consists of the 99 COOH-terminal amino acids folds back to interact with the body (p60) of the MxA molecule (Fig. 7). The short stretch of nonconserved amino acids located between p10 and p60 may serve as a hinge. We believe that the alternative possibility that p10 of a first MxA molecules interacts with p60 of a second MxA molecule is less likely. Such a scenario would be compatible with the observation that MxA forms high molecular weight oligomers. However, proteinase K should then degrade the MxA oligomers to monomers, which was clearly not the case; the p60-p10 complex purified as a high molecular weight entity (Fig. 4). Since all MxA variants described in this study retained the ability to form high molecular weight oligomers, it seems that oligomerization of MxA is mediated by sequences located between amino acids 41 and 301. This view is in agreement with results from experiments with the mouse Mx1 protein which defined a self-assembly motif in the NH2-terminal moiety near the GTP-binding element (5Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 7Two-domain model for the MxA-associated GTPase activity. Panel A, a domain in the COOH-terminal 99 amino acids of MxA (p10) forms a stable complex with sequences in the NH2-terminal part of MxA (p60) to yield a GTPase-active molecule. Panel B, after treatment with proteinase K, nonconserved regions (which presumably serve spacer functions) are removed, resulting in a stable complex of p60 and p10 which retains GTPase activity. Panel C, GTPase activity is retained in deletion mutant His-MxA(Δ301-576), which has most of the COOH-terminal p10 domain left intact. Panel D, complex formation is impaired in the COOH-terminal mutants of MxA which lack GTPase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results of our mutation analysis agree with the proposed structural model for MxA (Fig. 7) and suggest that back-folding of p10 is indeed required for GTPase activity of Mx proteins. Mutants of MxA which lack some COOH-terminal amino acids of p10 or which lack p10 altogether showed greatly reduced GTPase activity. By contrast, mutant His-MxA(Δ301-576), which has a nearly unchanged p10 domain but a grossly truncated p60 domain, retained a high degree of GTPase activity. The proposed model can also account for our earlier observa-tion3( 3M. Schwemmle, F. Pitossi, and M. F. Richter, unpublished results.) that GTPase activity is rapidly and irreversibly lost upon treating MxA with denaturing agents. It is conceivable that such treatment opens up the p60-p10 complex and that re-formation of the complex may not occur spontaneously. We further observed that high yields of protease-resistant p60-p10 complex were only obtained with fresh MxA preparations that exhibited high specific GTPase activity. MxA preparations of low specific GTPase activity were degraded rapidly to small peptides, suggesting that the entire p60-p10 complex rather than the two individual polypeptides forms a compact tertiary structure. It will be of interest to crystallize the p60-p10 complex and to determine its structure.

The loss of GTP binding due to mutations in the GTP-binding element of MxA was accompanied by a loss of antiviral activity (7Pitossi F. Blank A. Schröder A. Schwarz A. Hüssi P. Schwemmle M. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6726-6732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that nucleotide binding is important for function.

His-MxA shows low affinity for GTP (8Richter M.F. Schwemmle M. Herrmann C. Wittinghofer A. Staeheli P. J. Biol.

Natural and recombinant His-MxA form high molecular weight oligomers, a characteristic of unknown significance. His-MxA purified from E. coli retains antiviral activity; it blocked in vitro transcription of vesicular stomatitis virus (9Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and influenza A virus (10Landis H. Hefti H.P. Pavlovic J. Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Inhibition of viral polymerase activity by His-MxA was observed irrespective of whether the reaction mixture contained GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs (9Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F.

Virology. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that binding rather than hydrolysis of GTP is of functional importance.Little is known about the functional domains of MxA. A domain that determines antiviral specificity is located near the COOH terminus; MxA with a single amino acid substitution at position 645 was active against influenza A virus, but unlike wild-type MxA, the mutant protein failed to inhibit vesicular stomatitis virus in vivo(11Zurcher T. Pavlovic J. Staeheli P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1657-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and in vitro(9Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). GTPase activity of His-MxA was not affected by this mutation (9Schwemmle M. Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B.

Weining K.C. Richter M.F. Schumacher B. Staeheli P. Virology. 1995; 206: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we observed that a His-MxA mutant that lacks the COOH-terminal 300 amino acids had lost GTPase activity. This result suggested that the NH2-terminal fragment that harbors the tripartite GTP-binding consensus element (14Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1992; 66: 4705-4709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) requires sequences from the COOH terminus to form a functional GTPase. We have now studied the influence of COOH-terminal sequences of MxA for GTPase activity in more detail. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that the COOH-terminal 99 amino acids are required for GTPase activity, whereas sequences located between the GTP-binding consensus element and the COOH-terminal domain are dispensable. Mild proteolysis of His-MxA yielded a large NH2-terminal and a small COOH-terminal polypeptide that formed a stable GTPase-active complex, suggesting that the COOH terminus folds back and interacts with the GTP-binding consensus element to form the active center of the enzyme."

Activation of the transforming potential of Raf-1 has been associated with N-terminal truncation and/or fusion to other proteins, suggesting that the Raf-1 N-terminal half harbors a negative regulatory domain. Seven internal deletion mutants that together scan the entire N-terminal half of human Raf-1 protein were generated to map functional regions in this regulatory domain. Effects of the deletion mutations on kinase activity of Raf-1 were evaluated using a baculovirus/insect cell overexpression system and an in vitro kinase assay with the known physiological substrate of Raf-1, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. Deletion of amino acids 276-323 in the unique sequence between conserved regions 2 and 3 leads to modest elevation of Raf-1 basal kinase activity, whereas deletion of amino acids 133-180 in conserved region 1 results in diminished kinase activity. Surprisingly, none of the Raf-1 N-terminal deletion mutants, including a truncated version that is transforming in rodent fibroblasts, exhibits greatly increased levels of basal kinase activity. In addition, while activation of Raf-1 kinase by Ras requires sequences in conserved region 1, only the C-terminal half containing the kinase domain of Raf-1 is required for activation by Src.

The intermediaries between Raf-1 and MAP kinases are the dual specificity tyrosine/serine/threonine kinases, MAP kinase kinases (MKKs or MEKs) (5Ahn N.G. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Curr. Opin.

Activated MAP kinases are responsible for regulating the functions of a variety of substrates that ultimately control gene expression and DNA synthesis (7Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J.

Raf-1 is encoded in the c-raf-1 gene (13Bonner T.I. Oppermann H. Seeburg P. Kerby S.B. Gunnell M.A. Young A.C. Rapp U.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which belongs to a family of protooncogenes that includes two other active members, A-raf-1 (14Beck T.W. Huleihel M. Gunnel M.A. Bonner T.I. Rapp U.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 595-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and B-raf(15Ikawa S. Fukui M. Ueyama Y. Tamaoki N. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2651-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). A-raf-1 and B-raf genes are expressed specifically in urogenital and brain tissues, respectively, whereas the c-raf-1 gene is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined (16Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar). c-raf-1 was first identified in its tumorigenic form, v-raf, the oncogene of the acutely transforming retrovirus, murine sarcoma virus 3611 (17Rapp U.R. Goldsborough M.D. Mark G.E. Bonner T.I. Groffen J. Reynolds F.H. Stephenson J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Activation of the transforming potential of Raf-1 has also been associated with N-terminal truncation and fusion to other sequences (18Ishikawa F. Sakai R. Ochiai M. Takaku F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 653-658PubMed Google Scholar, 19Stanton V.P.J. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Heidecker G.

These observations suggest that the Raf-1 N-terminal sequences contain a negative regulatory domain, deletion of which results in deregulation of the C-terminal kinase domain. Sequence comparisons among members of the raf family reveal the presence of three blocks of conserved sequences: conserved regions (CR) 1, 2, and 3 (21Heidecker G. Kolch W. Morrison D.K. Rapp U.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 53-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). CR1 contains a cysteine-rich “zinc finger” motif, related to a similar structure in protein kinase C (22Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3521) Google Scholar), that has been shown to coordinate 2 mol of zinc (23Ghosh S. Xie W.Q. Quest A.F. Mabrouk G.M. Strum J.C. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10000-10007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CR2 consists of a stretch of 20 amino acids rich in serine and threonine residues; these are targets of phosphorylation by Raf-1 autokinase activity as well as by other serine/threonine-specific protein kinases, including protein kinase C (24Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar, 25Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CR3, which spans the C-terminal half of Raf-1, comprises the catalytic domain. Interspersed among these conserved regions are sequences unique to Raf-1. Current models of Raf-1 regulation postulate that the N-terminal regulatory domain represses the transforming potential and kinase activity of the C-terminal catalytic domain (26Rapp U.R.

To fine map functional regions in the N-terminal regulatory domain of Raf-1 protein, we engineered a series of internal deletion mutants that together scan the entire N-terminal half of human Raf-1. These deletions were designed to systematically disrupt conserved as well as unique sequences in the N-terminal half of Raf-1 protein. Wild-type and mutant Raf proteins were expressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system to examine effects of these mutations on regulation of Raf-1 kinase activity toward MKK, which is the only known physiological substrate of Raf-1 (27Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 28Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M.

Significantly, results show that none of the Raf-1 deletion mutants display greatly increased levels of basal kinase activity. Previous studies demonstrated that Raf-1 protein expressed in insect cells can be synergistically activated by Src and Ras proteins expressed from co-infected recombinant baculoviruses (30Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Analysis of our deletion mutants revealed that, while Ras activates Raf-1 kinase through sequences in CR1 as previously reported (31Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Decker S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), only the C-terminal half of Raf-1 containing CR3 is required for activation by Src. Together, these findings suggest that the function of the Raf-1 N-terminal domain is not merely to repress activity of the C-terminal kinase domain and that regulation of Raf-1 kinase activity is more complex than predicted from current models. Plasmid p627 containing human c-raf-1 cDNA (13Bonner T.I. Oppermann H. Seeburg P. Kerby S.B. Gunnell M.A. Young A.C. Rapp U.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Dodecameric XhoI linker (sequence CTCGAGCTCGAG) was ligated into restriction enzyme cleavage sites of c-raf-1 according to the linker insertion mutagenesis strategy described previously (33Stone J.C. Atkinson T. Smith M. Pawson T. Cell. 1984; 37: 549-558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Locations of the unique XhoI insertion sites, which are entirely predictable, were identified by detailed restriction mapping. Using selected pairs of XhoI linker insertion mutants, a second generation of mutants was constructed by deleting intervening sequence between two insertion sites. A 2.3-kilobase Bsu36I/ApaI fragment of full-length c-raf-1 cDNA from p627 was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector, pBlueBac (Invitrogen). BamHI/NsiI fragments of the seven deletion mutants and a 2-kilobase EcoRI/EcoRI fragment encoding the truncation mutant 22W that lacks the N-terminal 305 amino acids (19Stanton V.P.J. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) were subcloned into a similar baculovirus transfer vector, pBlueBacIII (Invitrogen). The recombinant transfer vectors were then cotransfected with linear wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA into Sf9 insect cells. Recombinant baculoviruses containing Raf-coding sequences were screened for Raf protein expression by immunoblot analysis, and positive clones were plaque-purified using standard procedures (34Park S. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11612-11618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Raf antibodies were prepared against a peptide corresponding to the extreme C-terminal 12 amino acids (sequence CTLTTSPRLPVF), which was coupled to purified human IgG with m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (35Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Raf antibody was obtained from Transduction Laboratories. Monoclonal anti-Ras antibody, LA-069, was obtained from the NCI Repository (Quality Biotech). The murine hybridoma cell line producing monoclonal anti-Src antibody (monoclonal antibody 327) was kindly provided by J. S. Brugge (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals). Sf9 cells were infected with wild-type baculovirus (A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) or the indicated Raf recombinant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 5, alone or in combination with c-Src or v-Ras recombinant viruses at multiplicities of infection of 15. Infected cells were harvested at 48-54 h postinfection and frozen at −80°C until ready to be lysed. Cell pellets were lysed in modified insect lysis buffer (MILY buffer; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM leupeptin, 1 μM antipain, 0.1 μM aprotinin, and 5 mM sodium orthovanadate) (25Morrison D.K.

Clarified lysates (equivalent to 1 × 106 cells) were incubated with polyclonal anti-Raf antiserum for 1 h on ice, followed by collection of the immunoprecipitates with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Immune complexes were washed twice with MILY buffer and one time with kinase reaction buffer (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM MnCl2), and then incubated for 20 min at 25°C with 200 ng of purified, polyhistidine-tagged MKK1 or MKK2 proteins (chemically inactivated by FSBA treatment) (36Dent P. Chow Y.-H. Wu J. Morrison D.K. Jove R. Sturgill T.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer supplemented with 1 mM dithiothreitol, 15 μM ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.). Reactions were terminated by addition of 4 × SDS sample buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 50% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue) and boiling for 5 min. Reaction products were then electrophoresed through 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membranes, and autoradiographed. These nitrocellulose membranes were analyzed in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager or an AMBIS 4000 radioisotope detector to directly quantify the phosphorylation levels. To confirm that equivalent amounts of Raf proteins were precipitated in the kinase reactions, these same membranes were then probed with anti-Raf antibodies, which were detected using anti-rabbit immunoglobulin followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Corp.). To assess the contributions of Raf-1 N-terminal conserved and unique sequences (Fig. 1A) to regulation of its kinase activity, 24 XhoI linker insertion mutations were introduced at predicted enzyme cleavage sites in human c-raf-1 cDNA (Fig. 1B). From these linker insertion mutants, seven internal deletion mutants were derived in which segments between combinations of two linker insertion sites were removed. These in-frame deletions were designed to target blocks of conserved or unique sequences in the N-terminal half of Raf-1, as diagrammed in Fig. 1C. To analyze the kinase activities of these mutants, a baculovirus/insect cell system was used that allows expression of high levels of kinase-active Raf-1 (30Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Full-length Raf-1 and deletion mutants of the expected sizes were expressed at comparable levels from recombinant baculoviruses in infected Sf9 cells (Fig. 2). Raf-1 and deletion mutants d1 through d5 appear as multiple bands on immunoblots, whereas d6 and d7 appear as well defined single bands. Multiple species of Raf-1 have also been detected in mammalian cells and probably result from phosphorylation (21Heidecker G. Kolch W. Morrison D.K. Rapp U.R. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 58: 53-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For analysis of kinase activity, an in vitro kinase assay was developed using two isoforms of MAP kinase kinase, MKK1 and MKK2, which are physiologically relevant substrates of Raf-1 (27Kyriakis J.M. App H. Zhang X.-F. Banerjee P. Brautigan D.L. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1992; 358: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 28Dent P. Haser W. Haystead T.A. Vincent L.A. Roberts T.M.

Nature. 1993; 364: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Expression of Raf proteins in baculovirus-infected insect cells. Sf9 cells were infected with indicated recombinant baculoviruses, and proteins in whole-cell lysates were separated through a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with anti-Raf serum and then with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents. Mobilities of all the Raf proteins are consistent with the predicted molecular masses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 3A shows our standard in vitro kinase assay using purified MKK1 protein, irreversibly inactivated with FSBA, which possesses no kinase activity of its own (lane4). Significant levels of phosphorylation on MKK1 were seen in reactions containing anti-Raf immunoprecipitates prepared from lysates of Raf-1 virus-infected Sf9 cells (lane6), and this kinase activity could be competed out when the anti-Raf serum was preincubated with the corresponding synthetic peptide antigen (lane5). These results demonstrate that MKK1 is specifically phosphorylated by Raf-1 in this reaction. A kinetic analysis of Raf-d7 kinase activity on MKK1 shows that the in vitro reaction rate of Raf-d7, which has an elevated basal kinase activity (see below), remains linear for at least 45 min under our standard reaction conditions (Fig. 3B). For all the experiments described below, we used conditions similar to this assay and terminated the reactions at 20 min to ensure that the kinase activities of Raf proteins were analyzed in the linear range. Experiments were also performed using insect cell-expressed Raf340D, a Raf mutant with highly activated kinase (37Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), showing that at least 30-fold elevation of the basal kinase activity of Raf-1 can be detected under our in vitro kinase reaction conditions (data not shown). In the same reaction conditions, Raf-1 kinase activities toward purified, FSBA-inactivated preparations of MKK1 and MKK2 were compared (Fig. 4). Raf-1, either at its basal level or activated by co-expressed c-Src or v-Ras proteins, consistently shows a substrate preference toward MKK1 over MKK2. MKK1 was therefore used as exogenous substrate in all of the subsequent in vitro kinase assays. Kinase activities of the various Raf mutants were analyzed to evaluate effects of the deletions on Raf-1 basal kinase activity (Fig. 5). In order to normalize the levels of Raf-1 proteins in the in vitro kinase assays, small amounts of immune serum were used so that the anti-Raf antibody would be saturated and immunoprecipitate similar amounts of Raf proteins, as confirmed by Western blotting analysis (Fig. 5B). In several independent experiments, Raf-d7 consistently showed a 2-3-fold higher kinase activity over wild-type Raf-1 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, Raf-d4, lacking the cysteine-rich zinc finger motif, showed only 10-40% the activity of Raf-1. The other deletion mutants revealed no consistently significant differences in kinase activity compared with Raf-1 (Fig. 5B). A kinase-inactive mutant (ATPM) of Raf-1 (25Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a negative control to estimate background activity in the in vitro kinase assays. Basal kinase activities of the Raf mutants were relatively unaffected by the presence or absence of 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1% SDS, or 5 mM sodium orthovanadate in the cell lysis buffer, and similar results were obtained using a monoclonal anti-Raf antibody for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). These results demonstrate that deletions that together span the length of the N-terminal regulatory domain do not lead to striking activation of Raf-1 kinase activity in this assay system. Earlier studies showed that Raf-1 protein can be activated by co-expressed Src or Ras proteins in the baculovirus/insect cell system (30Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 37Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell.

A. 1993; 90: 5772-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Utilizing a similar system and our panel of Raf-1 mutants, we assessed the regions in the N-terminal half of Raf-1 protein involved in regulation of Raf-1 by these upstream activators. We used constitutively active v-Ras (30Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and chicken c-Src (34Park S. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11612-11618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is active because of lack of the negative-regulating Tyr527 kinase in insect cells, as the activators. Ras or Src protein was overexpressed with Raf proteins in co-infected Sf9 cells (Figs. 6B and 7B) using multiplicities of infection that ensure favorable activator:Raf ratios. As shown in Fig. 6, A and C, Raf-d2, Raf-d3, and 22W lost the ability to be activated by Ras, whereas the other deletion mutants and Raf-1 showed 2-4-fold elevated kinase activities in response to Ras. Surprisingly, the basal kinase activity of 22W was consistently lower than that of wild-type Raf-1. The common residues deleted in Raf-d2, Raf-d3, and 22W are amino acids 53-132. Since this region is also required for interaction of Raf-1 with Ras (32Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Decker S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 39Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar, 40Chuang E. Barnard D. Hettich L. Zhang X.-F. Avruch J. Marshall M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with the conclusion that the physical interaction of Raf-1 and Ras is essential for Raf-1 activation by Ras. On the other hand, the MKK1 phosphorylating activities of Raf-1, 22W, as well as all seven deletion mutants were activated 5-7-fold by co-expressed Src protein (Fig. 7, A and C). Variable phosphorylation of Raf proteins and immunoglobulin heavy chain, which might partly be due to co-precipitated Src kinase, was observed but did not correspond to the extent of MKK1 phosphorylation. In addition, some of the Raf phosphorylation could be due to autokinase activity enhanced by Src, as previously reported (30Williams N.G. Roberts T.M. Li P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Raf-1 proteins, but not co-precipitated Src protein, account for the elevated MKK1 kinase activity, as evidenced by the low level of phosphorylation on MKK1 despite substantial immunoglobulin heavy chain phosphorylation in the case of ATPM/Src co-infection. These results demonstrate that the sequences required for activation by Src do not reside in the N-terminal 323 amino acids. Genetic analysis of v-Raf and other Raf-1 mutants showed that deletions in the N-terminal half, in some cases accompanied by fusion to unrelated sequences, activate the oncogenic potential of Raf-1 (19Stanton V.P.J. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These findings led to the hypothesis that the N-terminal half of Raf-1 contains a negative regulatory domain, which represses the catalytic domain contained in the C-terminal half of the protein. Direct evidence for specific regions in the N-terminal domain that demonstrably repress Raf-1 protein kinase activity, however, is lacking from previous studies. To explore the mechanism of Raf-1 kinase regulation by the N-terminal domain, we engineered a panel of internal deletion mutants designed to systematically dissect potential regulatory elements in the N-terminal half of Raf-1. Analysis of the Raf-1 deletion mutants revealed that, contrary to expectations from current models, the N-terminal domain does not function to simply repress the C-terminal kinase domain. Significantly, targeted deletion of various conserved and unique regions in the N-terminal domain of Raf-1 protein did not substantially affect its basal kinase activity, with the notable exceptions of Raf-d4 and Raf-d7. The Raf-d4 mutant has a deletion that removes the zinc finger motif in CR1. This cysteine-rich motif in Raf-1 is of interest because homologous zinc finger structures in protein kinase C have been shown to be essential for phorbol ester binding and kinase activation and have been implicated in translocation of the kinase to the membrane (41Ono Y. Fujii T. Igarashi K. Kuno T. Tanaka C. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4868-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 42Burns D.J. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18330-18338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While deletion of the zinc finger in Raf-d4 did result in partially defective kinase activity, a larger deletion in Raf-d3 encompassing the entire CR1 had little effect on the Raf-1 basal kinase activity. One possible explanation for this apparent contradiction is that the zinc finger might have a conformational or functional role only in the context of the intact CR1. In the case of Raf-d7, deletion of amino acids in the unique sequence between CR2 and CR3 resulted in modestly (2-3-fold) elevated kinase activity. Interestingly, the deleted region of Raf-d7 contains a consensus MAP kinase phosphorylation sequence, Pro-X-Thr∗-Pro (amino acids 308-311). MAP kinases have been shown to phosphorylate Raf-1 both in vitro(43Anderson N.G. Li P. Marsden L.A. Williams N. Roberts T.M. Sturgill T.W. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and in vivo in insulin-stimulated cells (44Lee R. Cobb M.H. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1088-1092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with phosphorylation events occurring in the region deleted in Raf-d7 is the finding that this mutant protein, unlike wild-type Raf-1, migrated as a single species upon electrophoresis through SDS-polyacrylamide gels. It has been suggested that phosphorylation of Raf-1 by MAP kinases may have an important physiological role, such as in an inhibitory feedback loop (8Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). While any regulatory effect that might result from phosphorylation of this site remains to be demonstrated, our results on Raf-d7 support the suggestion that a negative regulatory element exists in this region between CR2 and the catalytic domain. Another deletion mutant, Raf-d6, which has the entire CR2 deleted, also appeared as a single species on Western blots. This conserved region is rich in serine and threonine residues that are potential phosphorylation sites, including Ser259 phosphorylated by protein kinase C (24Kolch W. Heidecker G. Kochs G. Hummel R. Vahidi H. Mischak H. Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Rapp U.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) and Thr268 phosphorylated by Raf-1 autokinase activity (25Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17309-17316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because Raf-d6 does not show a significantly different kinase activity compared with wild-type Raf-1, however, no regulatory function of CR2 is required for Raf-1 kinase activity. Our finding that none of the N-terminal deletion mutants possess greatly elevated kinase activity is surprising in light of the prediction, from earlier genetic studies on activation of Raf-1 oncogenic potential (19Stanton V.P.J. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Heidecker G. Huleihel M. Cleveland J.L. Kolch W. Beck T.W. Lloyd P. Pawson T. Rapp U.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2503-2512Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), that at least some of these mutants would have acquired deregulated kinase activity. For example, the 22W Raf-1 mutant, which resembles v-Raf in that it lacks most of the N-terminal regulatory domain, is oncogenic in rodent fibroblasts (19Stanton V.P.J. Nichols D.W. Laudano A.P. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Deletion of CR2 also has been associated with activation of the Raf-1 transforming potential (18Ishikawa F. Sakai R. Ochiai M. Takaku F. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 653-658PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier genetic studies, however, the kinase activities of transforming Raf mutants could not be measured reliably because an appropriate physiological substrate had not been identified yet. In the present study, we find that neither 22W nor Raf-d6, which contains a deletion of CR2, exhibits elevated kinase activity toward MKK. While the in vitro kinase assay that we employ here is highly specific and sensitive to a wide range of Raf-1 kinase activities, we cannot exclude the possibility that this assay is not an accurate measure of in vivo kinase activities. For instance, mutant Raf-1 proteins might be unstable in cell lysates or during incubation in the in vitro kinase assay; however, the fact that all of the deletion mutants examined here can be substantially activated by Src argues against this possibility. Alternatively, the kinase activities of Raf proteins expressed in insect cells might not reflect their activities in mammalian cells due to crucial differences in cellular regulatory molecules. Moreover, it remains possible that oncogenic activation of Raf-1 involves subtle changes in substrate specificity rather than elevated levels of kinase activity. Earlier studies established that Ras binds with high affinity through its effector domain to the Raf-1 N-terminal domain in a GTP-dependent manner (39Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A.

This physical interaction has been shown to be essential for Raf-1 activation by Ras (31Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Decker S. Jove R. Mol. Cell.

A. 1992; 89: 2922-2926Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) showed that co-expressing Raf-1 with either Ras or Src in insect cells led to moderate activation of Raf-1 kinase activity, and that maximal activation required both Src and Ras together. These findings raised the possibility of the presence of both Ras-dependent and Ras-independent mechanisms for Raf activation. Using our panel of mutants, we dissected the N-terminal half of Raf-1 for regions involved in responding to Ras and Src in an attempt to gain further insight into how these activators cooperate. Raf-1 N-terminal deletions that affect amino acids 53-132, which are required for Raf-1 to bind Ras in vitro and in vivo(32Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Decker S. Jove R. Mol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 5318-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), abolished activation of Raf-1 kinase by Ras. It is notable that no other region outside of CR1 is essential for Raf-1 activation by Ras. On the other hand, our finding that all seven deletion mutants and 22W are activable by Src provides direct evidence that the N-terminal domain is completely dispensable for activation of Raf-1 kinase by Src. Consistent with other recent studies (31Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 32Pumiglia K. Chow Y.-H. Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K. Decker S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), this finding demonstrates that Src can activate Raf-1 through a Ras-independent mechanism. The Src-response element in Raf-1 might involve the previously described C-terminal tyrosine residues, Tyr340 and Tyr341, which have been identified as the major tyrosine phosphorylation sites of Raf-1 when co-expressed with activated tyrosine kinases in insect cells (37Fabian J.R. Daar I.O. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7170-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Additional studies will be required to determine whether phosphorylation on these tyrosine residues of Raf-1 is directly responsible for its activation. Recent reports have suggested that Ras functions in the activation of Raf-1 by recruiting it to the plasma membrane (49Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 50Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In this context, our findings are consistent with a model in which the N-terminal domain has a role in mediating interactions with other molecules that regulate the kinase activity or subcellular localization of Raf-1 rather than simply repressing its kinase activity. Once localized to the membrane, other activation events, such as tyrosine phosphorylation of the C-terminal catalytic domain, may activate Raf-1 kinase activity. In the case of Raf-1 N-terminal mutants that do not bind Ras, overexpression of Src kinase together with these mutants in insect cells may overcome the requirement for Ras. Under normal circumstances in mammalian cells, however, signal transduction from membrane-associated tyrosine kinases may still depend on activated Ras to target Raf-1 to the membrane. This model predicts that Ras and tyrosine kinases normally function in concert for Raf-1 activation, a prediction that is consistent with classical experiments in mammalian cells (51Smith M.R. DeGudicibus S.J. Stacey D.W. Nature. 1986; 320: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 52Stacey D.W. Tsai M.H. Yu C.L. Smith J.K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 2: 871-881Crossref Google Scholar) as well as the finding that maximal activation of Raf-1 kinase in insect cells requires co-expression of both Ras and Src (30Williams N.G. Roberts T.M.

https://openalex.org/W2024823042,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) has been extensively studied as an exogenous agent that stimulates the expression of extracellular matrix proteins and their cell-surface integrin receptors in a variety of cell types. However, the recent demonstration of autocrine TGF-β growth effects in a number of cell types suggests that the steady-state expression of extracellular matrix and integrin proteins and their biological activity may also be under autocrine TGF-β control. Previously, we reported that repression of autocrine TGF-β1 activity by constitutive expression of a full-length TGF-β1 antisense cDNA led to abrogation of autocrine negative TGF-β and, as a result, increased tumorigenicity and anchorage-independent growth of a poorly tumorigenic, well-differentiated colon carcinoma cell line designated FET (Wu, S., Theodorescu, D., Kerbel, R. S., Willson, J. K. V., Mulder, K. M., Humphrey, L. E., and Brattain, M. G.(1992) J. Cell Biol. 116, 187-196). Consequently, we have used this model system to study the effects of repression of autocrine TGF-β1 activity on the expression of integrin α5β1 and integrin α5β1-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin. The expression of the integrin α5 subunit was reduced in TGF-β1 antisense transfected FET cells at both mRNA and protein levels as determined by RNase protection assays and immunoprecipitation, respectively. Autocrine TGF-β1 had no effect on the transcription of integrin α5 and β1 subunits, indicating that autocrine TGF-β1 may regulate integrin α5β1 expression at the post-transcriptional level. The diminished expression of integrin α5β1 on the cell surface led to the reduced adhesion of TGF-β1 antisense transfected cells to fibronectin. This phenomenon could be reversed by treatment with exogenous TGF-β1.

INTRODUCTIONCell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM),1( 1The abbreviations used are: ECMextracellular matrixFNfibronectinTGF-βtransforming growth factor βCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferaseMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide.) mediated in part by the integrin family of cell-surface glycoproteins, plays an important role in the control of cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and invasion (1Ruoslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 2Schwartz M.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1503-1506PubMed Google Scholar). Integrins are formed by the noncovalent association of an α subunit with a β subunit. The β1 subunit dimerized by at least six α subunits, termed α1-α6, constitutes the largest component of the integrin family. Among them, α1β1, α2β1, and α3β1 are the receptors for collagen, laminin, and other ECM proteins, whereas α5β1 is the receptor specific for FN.Integrins have an important biological role as mediators of cell matrix-cell interaction. A number of studies have demonstrated that integrins are associated with transformation and differentiation of certain cell types. For example, overexpression of integrin α5β1 reverses tumorigenicity and anchorage-independent growth in transformed Chinese hamster ovary cells (3Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1990; 60: 849-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained in a stable variant of the K562 erythroleukemia cell line that overexpresses integrin α5β1(4Symington B.E. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In contrast, loss of integrin α5β1 expression is associated with a transformed phenotype of fibroblasts (5Plantefaber L.C. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1989; 56: 281-290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), and increased tumorigenicity was shown in integrin α5β1-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell variants (6Schreiner C. Fisher M. Hussein S. Juliano R.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1738-1740PubMed Google Scholar). The integrins also have a signal transduction function that affects the expression of many essential genes relevant to matrix remodeling during differentiation. For example, monoclonal antibody to integrin α5β1 induces the expression of two extracellular matrix-degrading metalloproteinases, collagenase and stromelysin (7Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that antibody to α5 leads to increased DNA synthesis in quiescent HT1080 cells (8Wang D. Birkenmeier T.M. Yang J. Venkateswarlu S. Humphrey L. Brattain M.G. Sun L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar).The role of integrins in a wide array of biological processes underlines the significance of determining the mechanisms by which particular cell types control the steady-state expression of these receptors as well as the mechanisms by which the extracellular environment can alter their expression. Extensive studies have shown that the expression of integrins is under the control of several growth factors and cytokines. For example, platelet-derived growth factor BB was found to induce integrin α5 and β3 subunit expression in rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells (9Janat M.F. Argraves W.S. Liau G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 588-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and interleukin-1β was shown to increase integrin α2 and α5 subunit mRNA levels, but to decrease integrin α4 subunit mRNA levels in MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells (10Milam S.B. Magnuson V.L. Steffensen B. Chen D. Klebe R.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Among the growth factors, TGF-β has been the most extensively studied exogenous modulator of the expression of ECM proteins and their integrin receptors (11Roberts A.B. McCune B.K. Sporn M.B. Kidney Int. 1992; 41: 557-559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). TGF-β has been shown to stimulate the expression of FN and collagen and their incorporation into the ECM (12Ignotz R.A. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4337-4345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of integrin subunits in the αβ1 subfamily have been shown to be stimulated by TGF-β in human fibroblasts (13Roberts C.J. Birkenmeier T.M. McQuillan J.J. Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.-T. Yamada K.M. McDonald J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4586-4592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Heino J. Ignotz R.A. Hemler M.E. Crouse C. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 380-388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells with TGF-β markedly decreases integrin α3 subunit mRNA and protein levels with concomitant increases in α2, α5, and β1 subunit expression (15Heino J. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21806-21811Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm matrix was found to down-regulate TGF-β1 synthesis at the transcriptional level in mouse epithelial cells (16Streuli C.H. Schmidhauser C. Kobrin M. Bissell M.J. Derynck R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).As indicated above, most studies of TGF-β function and mechanism have centered around treatment of cells with one of the TGF-β isoforms. However, it is generally believed that TGF-β exerts its role in an autocrine as well as a paracrine fashion (17Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 593: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The autocrine negative growth activity of TGF-β was demonstrated by the ability of neutralizing TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 antibodies to increase proliferation, DNA synthesis, and anchorage-independent growth (18Arteaga C.L. Coffey Jr., R.J. Dugger T.C. McCutchen C.M. Moses H.L. Lyons R.M. Cell Growth & Differ. 1990; 1: 367-374PubMed Google Scholar, 19Hafez M.M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We have used stable transfection of a TGF-β1 antisense cDNA to demonstrate autocrine TGF-β1 activity in a colon carcinoma cell line designated FET (21Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Characterization of transfected FET cells with constitutively repressed TGF-β1 expression showed high cloning efficiency in anchorage-independent assays and enhanced tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice. These studies suggested that loss of autocrine TGF-β activity may be an important step in progression of malignancy. Given the effects of exogenous TGF-β treatment on the expression of integrins in a wide variety of model systems, we hypothesized that autocrine TGF-β1 may control biological function by regulating steady-state integrin receptor expression and consequently cellular interactions with the ECM. We have tested this hypothesis using the FET model system, described above, in which autocrine TGF-β activity was constitutively repressed (21Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and CultureThe FET human colon carcinoma cell line was originally established in vitro from a primary human colon tumor (22Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L. Willson J.K.V. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). FET TGF-β1 antisense transfected cells (FET B) and FET control cells transfected with the neomycin-resistant gene were established and characterized as described previously (21Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in chemically defined McCoy's 5A serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 20 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), 4 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Sigma) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 as described previously (23Boyd D.D. Levine A.E. Brattain D.E. McKnight M.K. Brattain M.G. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 2469-2474PubMed Google Scholar). Subcultures were obtained by treatment with 0.125% trypsin in Joklik's tissue culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% EDTA.RNase Protection AssaysTotal RNA was isolated from cultured cells by the guanidine isothiocyanate method (24Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). RNase protection assays were performed as described by Wu et al. (25Wu S. Sun L. Willson J.K.V. Humphrey L. Kerbel R. Brattain M.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1993; 4: 115-123PubMed Google Scholar). The α5 subunit template was constructed by subcloning a 405-base pair BamHI-AccI fragment of the human α5 subunit cDNA into plasmid pBSK (Stratagene cloning system). A 214-base pair SpeI-PstI fragment of integrin β1 cDNA was also inserted into the pBSK vector. Both α5 and β1 subunit antisense probes were prepared using T3 RNA polymerase. The construction of the TGF-β1 antisense probe has been described previously by Wu et al.(21Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Determinations of the integrin subunit and TGF-β1 mRNA levels in total RNA samples (40 μg) were performed with 1 × 106 cpm of each of the labeled probes. The hybridization mixture was digested with RNase A and RNase T1, followed by treatment with proteinase K. The protected fragment of the probe was analyzed by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography.ImmunoprecipitationTo quantitate the cell-surface α5 subunit protein level, 107 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and cell-surface proteins were labeled with 0.1 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce). The labeled cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1 ml of extraction buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40). Cell extract (300 μl) was precleared with 30 μl of protein G-agarose suspension (Pierce) for 8 h at 4°C. Biotinylated integrin α5β1 was immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of monoclonal anti-human integrin α5 antibody (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 50 μl of protein G-agarose after overnight incubation at 4°C. The precipitates were washed six times with buffer containing 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Tween 20. The biotinylated α5 and β1 subunits were dissociated from the immune complex by heating the samples in SDS nonreducing sample buffer at 95°C for 10 min and were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II gel apparatus. The proteins were electrotransferred onto an Immun-Lite blotting membrane (Bio-Rad), which was then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated for 1 h in the presence of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Life Technologies, Inc.). A chemiluminescent substrate, 3-(2-spiroadamantane)-4-methoxy-4-(3-phosphoryloxy)phenyl-1,2-dioxetane disodium salt (Bio-Rad), for alkaline phosphatase was then added to the blot. The α5 and β1 subunits were visualized after autoradiography.Transient Transfection and CAT AssayThe α5 subunit promoter-CAT constructs used in this study have been reported previously (26Birkenmeier T.M. McQuillan J.J. Boedeker E.D. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20544-20549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter activity was measured using the Pα5-924 CAT and Pα5-1300 CAT constructs containing 924 and 1300 base pairs, respectively, 5′ of the α5 transcription start site. FET Neo control and TGF-β1 antisense transfected cells were transfected with 30 μg of promoter-CAT plasmids together with 10 μg of β-galactosidase plasmid by electroporation with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 250 V and 960 microfarads. The electroporated cells were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes in the serum-free medium and harvested after 48 h. The expression of the CAT reporter gene was assayed to determine the α5 promoter activity in these cells. The cell pellets were resuspended in 0.25 M Tris (pH 7.8) and lysed by three cycles of freeze-thaw. β-Galactosidase activity in the cell extracts was quantified to normalize the amounts of extracts for CAT assay. Aliquots representing equal amounts of β-galactosidase activity were incubated with [14C]chloramphenicol (0.25 μCi) and acetyl coenzyme A (114 μg) for 6 h at 37°C, extracted with ethyl acetate, and separated by thin-layer chromatography as described by Sambrook et al.(27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The levels of acetylated chloramphenicol were quantitated by the AMBIS image acquisition and analysis system. Isolation of nuclei and nuclear run-on assays were performed essentially as described by Greenberg and Ziff (28Greenberg M.E. Ziff E.B. Nature. 1984; 311: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) with some modifications (29Sun L. Wu S. Coleman K. Fields K.C. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Cell Adhesion and MTT AssaysNinety-six-well Corning tissue culture plates were coated with FN at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 5.0, and 10.0 μg/ml for 2 h at 37°C and then rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Confluent cells were detached by treatment with trypsin, plated at 6 × 104 cells/well on FN-coated plates, and incubated for 90 min in a humidified incubator. Unattached cells were gently washed away by four rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, and attached cells were determined by the MTT assay as described previously (30Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45551) Google Scholar, 31Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 936-942PubMed Google Scholar).The specificity of cell adhesion to FN was determined using the monoclonal anti-human integrin α5 subunit antibody. The antibody was added to FN-coated plates at dilutions of 1:50-1:500 and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Determination of cell adhesion and the MTT assay were performed as described above.RESULTSExogenous TGF-β1Increases Integrin α5Subunit mRNA Steady-state Level in FET Parental CellsThe FET cell line is a poorly tumorigenic, well-differentiated human colon carcinoma cell line that was previously established in vitro from a primary tumor and has been extensively characterized (22Brattain M.G. Levine A.E. Chakrabarty S. Yeoman L. Willson J.K.V. Long B.H. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1984; 3: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 32Howell G.M. Sun L. Ziober B.L. Wu S.P. Brattain M.G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1993; 12: 275-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FET cells expressed high levels of TGF-β1 mRNA, but no detectable TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 mRNAs by Northern blot analysis (21Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). To determine whether exogenous TGF-β1 can stimulate integrin α5 subunit expression in FET parental cells, the steady-state levels of mRNA from the cells treated with TGF-β1 (5 ng/ml) at different time points were compared by RNase protection assay (Fig. 1). The steady-state mRNA level of integrin α5 subunit was increased after 12 h of exposure to TGF-β1, while a maximal increase was observed after 24 h of TGF-β1 treatment.Repression of Autocrine TGF-β Activity Reduces Integrin α5Subunit mRNA Steady-state Level and Cell-surface Integrin α5β1ExpressionRepressed autocrine TGF-β activity was obtained by constitutive expression of a TGF-β1 antisense cDNA in FET cells. A typical stable clone, designated FET B, that expresses high levels of TGF-β1 antisense cDNA was selected for these studies (21Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The steady-state mRNA levels of integrin α5 and β1 subunits in FET B and FET Neo control cells were determined by RNase protection analysis (Fig. 2). FET B cells showed an ~5-fold reduction of the TGF-β1 mRNA level, as published previously (21Wu S. Theodorescu D. Kerbel R.S. Willson J.K.V. Mulder K.M. Humphrey L.E. Brattain M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The expression of integrin α5 subunit mRNA was reduced ~2.5-fold in FET B cells compared with FET Neo cells. The modulation of α5 expression was relatively specific in that integrin β1 subunit mRNA expression was not altered by repression of autocrine TGF-β. In addition, there was no change in the mRNA levels of integrin α2 and α3 subunits (data not shown). Reduced α5 mRNA expression suggested a corresponding reduction of α5β1 receptor expression on the cell surface of FET B cells compared with FET Neo cells. This was confirmed by immunoprecipitation experiments examining the cell-surface expression of integrin α5β1 (Fig. 3).Figure 2:Integrin α5 and β1 mRNA levels in FET cells transfected with TGF-β1 antisense expression plasmid (FET B) and control plasmid (FET Neo). Total RNA was isolated from both cell lines. Integrin α5 and β1 subunit mRNAs, TGF-β1 mRNA, and actin mRNA were detected in 40 μg of total RNA by a RNase protection assay. The two photographs are from one gel. Because of the low expression of the integrin α5 subunit, the upper photograph was exposed for a longer period of time than the lower one. Actin mRNA levels are shown to indicate equal loading of the samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3:Cell-surface integrin α5β1 protein levels in FET cells transfected with TGF-β1 antisense cDNA (FET B) and control plasmid (FET Neo).

McQuillan J.J. Boedeker E.D. Argraves W.S. Ruoslahti E. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20544-20549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into FET B and FET Neo cells. The levels of CAT enzyme, expressed under the control of the integrin α5 promoter, were quantitated using the standard assay for [14C]chloramphenicol conversion (Fig. 4). There was no difference in the CAT activity in FET B and FET Neo cells after transfection with the CAT constructs. A nuclear run-on assay was performed to confirm these results (data not shown). Again, no difference in the α5 subunit transcription rate was observed in FET B and FET Neo cells. These results indicate that autocrine TGF-β does not regulate integrin α5β1 expression at transcriptional levels.Figure 4:Integrin α5 promoter (924- and 1300-base pair fragments) activity in FET cells transfected with TGF-β1 antisense expression plasmid (FET B) and control plasmid (FET Neo). A, FET B and FET Neo cells were transfected with Pα5-924 CAT and Pα5-1300 CAT plasmids. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. β-Galactosidase activity in cell extracts was normalized for CAT assay. B, the amounts of product and remaining substrate were quantitated by scanning the autoradiographic film. The graph was plotted by the ratio of product to substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reduction of Cell-surface Integrin α5β1Expression Leads to Reduced Cell Adhesion to FN That Can be Reversed by Exogenous TGF-β1TreatmentNext, it was determined whether the down-regulation of α5β1 expression affected biological function as reflected by alterations of cell adhesion to FN (Fig. 5). Levels of enhancement ranged from ~1.4 to 2.8-fold for FET Neo cells when coating was performed at FN concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 10 μg/ml, while FN coating had little effect on FET B cell adhesion as an enhancement of only 1.4-fold over bovine serum albumin coating was obtained at a FN concentration of 10 μg/ml (Fig. 5A). Thus, adhesion to FN-coated culture plates relative to bovine serum albumin-coated plates was enhanced 4-5-fold for FET Neo cells relative to FET B cells in the FN range between 1.2 and 10 μg/ml. Treatment of both FET Neo and FET B cells with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1 increased the level of binding to FN-coated plates over bovine serum albumin controls (Fig. 5B). After TGF-β1 treatment, the level of enhancement of adhesion to FN for both cell types was approximately equal. These results indicate that repression of autocrine TGF-β leads to reduced adhesion to FN. Moreover, treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 led to restoration of binding to FN. The reduced levels of adhesion in FET B cells were consistent with the lower steady-state levels of cell-surface integrin α5β1 in these cells relative to control FET Neo cells. We hypothesized that restoration of adhesion after TGF-β1 treatment of FET B cells was due to induction of integrin α5β1 expression. Consequently, the concentration-dependent effects of TGF-β1 treatment on cell-surface integrin α5β1 expression were determined by immunoprecipitation in both types of cells. TGF-β1 treatment increased both FET Neo and FET B expression of cell-surface integrin α5β1 (data not shown).Figure 5:Adhesion of FET control (○) and FET TGF-β1 antisense transfected (●) cells as a function of FN concentration. Substrates were prepared by coating 96-well Corning tissue culture plates with FN at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, 2.4, 5.0, and 10.0 μg/ml for 2 h. Cells from confluent cultures were seeded at 6 × 104/well onto FN-coated plates and allowed to adhere for 90 min. After removal of unattached cells, adhesion was determined by the MTT assay. The effects of TGF-β1 were determined by treating the cells for 48 h prior to the adhesion assay. A, no TGF-β1; B, 5 ng/ml TGF-β1. Each point is the average of two individual experiments determined from triplicate wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since repression of autocrine TGF-β1 activity down-regulated cell-surface integrin α5β1 expression and cell adhesion to FN, it was of importance to determine whether the reduced cell adhesion to FN was mediated by loss of cell-surface expression of integrin α5β1. Therefore, blocking of adhesion to FN by monoclonal antibody against the α5 subunit was performed (Fig. 6). Blocking with α5 antibody showed 60 to 20% inhibition of adhesion to FN in FET Neo control cells at antibody dilutions of 1:50-1:500. In contrast, FET B cells showed very little dependence upon integrin α5β1 for binding to FN as a 1:50 dilution of α5 antibody resulted in only a 20% reduction of binding. Lower antibody concentrations did not give significant levels of inhibition of binding to FN. Antibodies to α2 and α3 subunits had little or no effect on binding to FN at 1:50 dilutions (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, blocking of adhesion to FN by α5 antibody was also performed to determine whether restoration of cell adhesion to FN by treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 was due to increased expression of cell-surface integrin α5β1 (Fig. 6B). After treatment of FET B cells with 5 ng/ml TGF-β1, the levels of integrin α5β1-mediated adhesion to FN in FET B cells were similar to those in FET Neo cells at the same antibody dilution as shown in Fig. 6B. Therefore, it appears that repression of autocrine TGF-β selectively reduces integrin α5β1-mediated adhesion to FN. Treatment with exogenous TGF-β1 selectively restores the relative degree of integrin α5β1-mediated adhesion to FN in FET B cells.Figure 6:Inhibition of adhesion of FET control (■) and FET TGF-β1 antisense transfected (□) cells to FN by antibodies to integrin receptors.

Mammals, for instance, have a diverse array of active site protease inhibitors in the plasma. In addition, mammals have α2-macroglobulin (α2M), which binds active proteases, and the α2M-protease complex is then cleared from the plasma by a receptor-mediated endocytotic process. α2M is also present in the plasma of many invertebrates, and in the American horseshoe crab, Limulus polyphemus, it is the only protease inhibitor in the plasma. To search for a clearance process for proteases in Limulus, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled proteins were injected into the blood, and the fluorescence in the plasma and associated with the blood cells was determined. FITC-labeled trypsin was cleared with an initial mixing period (0-10 min) and a rapid clearance period (10-30 min), followed by the reappearance of FITC in the plasma (45-90 min). Before and during the clearance process, the labeled trypsin was associated with a complex having a molecular mass identical to that of Limulus α2M, and that was precipitated by antibodies directed against Limulus α2M. The fluoresceinated material that reappeared in the plasma after 45 min was of low molecular mass (<10 kDa) and thus appears to have experienced degradation. The clearance of trypsin requires its protease activity, since phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride-inactivated, FITC-labeled trypsin was cleared only very slowly if at all (t > 180 min). FITC-labeled, trypsin-reacted Limulus α2M was cleared rapidly from the plasma of Limulus, whereas FITC-labeled, native Limulus α2M persisted undiminished in excess of 400 min. The blood cells of Limulus bound FITC-labeled trypsin-reacted Limulus α2M, and the peak of recovery from the blood cells coincided with the minimum concentration of FITC-labeled protein in the plasma, suggesting that the blood cells participate in the clearance of α2M-protease complex from the plasma. Thus, we have demonstrated the existence of a clearance pathway in Limulus that operates selectively on enzymatically active proteases and have shown that Limulus α2M is the probable agent for protease clearance. This is the first documentation of a protease clearance pathway in invertebrates and represents the first identified physiological function for α2M in invertebrates.

The presence of synthetic mechanisms for Xyl-MU-initiated bioactive oligosaccharides, unrelated to glycosaminoglycan or glycolipid, is of considerable interest.In the present study, a novel Xyl-MU derivative produced by cultured human skin fibroblasts in the presence of Xyl-MU was isolated and analyzed. Its structure was sulfate-O-3GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU. The structure of the nonreducing terminal site of the oligosaccharide was the same as that of the oligosaccharide chain of a human peripheral nerve-derived glycolipid, which reacts with a mouse monoclonal antibody, HNK-1 (14Chou D.K.H.

Nakamura T. Kon A. Tamura S. Endo M. J. Biochem.(Tokyo). 1991; 109: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105/100-mm plastic dish (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and then subcultured after being grown to confluence. Fibroblasts at passage 4-7 were used for the study. Confluent cultured fibroblasts were incubated for 72 h in Eagle's MEM containing 0.5 mM Xyl-MU at 37°C, and the culture medium was recovered.High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)A high performance liquid chromatograph (Hitachi L-6200, Hitachi Co., Tokyo, Japan) connected to a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-1050, Hitachi Co.) was used. Xyl-MU derivatives were detected by their fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm and an emission wavelength of 380 nm. PA-monosaccharides were detected by their fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm.

Sturgeon R.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1970; 12: 448-452Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). An aliquot of purified sample was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) containing 0.015 M NaIO4 and incubated at 4°C for 120 h in the dark. Forty microliters of ethylene glycol was added and allowed to react for 1 h at 20°C. This was followed by the addition of 60 μl of 0.25 M NaBH4 in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer (pH 8.0), and the mixture was allowed to react for 18 h. Then, the pH was adjusted to 4.0 by the addition of acetic acid, and the solution was evaporated to dryness repeatedly in the presence of methanol under reduced pressure to remove the borate. The resulting reduced samples were mixed with 0.1 N HCl and allowed to stand at 20°C for 30 min, after which each reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.1 N NaOH.Analytical MethodsIn order to determine their sugar composition, samples were hydrolyzed in 2 N HCl at 100°C for 4 h and then pyridylaminated, as described previously (16Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Kawasaki H. Kon A. Ohishi S. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 21: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The resulting PA-monosaccharides were identified and quantified by HPLC analysis on an Ultrasphere ODS column (16Takagaki K. Nakamura T. Kawasaki H. Kon A. Ohishi S. Endo M. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1990; 21: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Mass spectra of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide were obtained using an ion spray mass spectrometer (Sciex API-III, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an atmospheric pressure ionization source, as described previously (20Takagaki K. Kojima K. Majima M. Nakamura T. Kato I. Endo M. Glycoconj. J. 1992; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Each sample (0.1 nmol/ml) was dissolved in 0.5 mM ammonium acetate/acetonitrile (50:50) and injected at 2 μl/min using a micro-HPLC syringe pump (pump 22, Harvard Apparatus Inc., MA).Dot-blot AnalysisDot-blot analysis of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was performed using a modification of the method described by Sorrell et al.(21Sorrell J.M. Mahmoodian F. Caterson B. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 252: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide, GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU and Xyl-MU (1 nmol each) were applied to the same sheet of nitrocellulose. The sheet was incubated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin at 20°C for 1 h and then washed with PBS and incubated in PBS containing HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml) at 4°C for 24 h. The sheet was then washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody at 20°C for 2 h. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, H2O2 and 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulfonate) were added.Solid Phase Binding AssayBinding of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide to HNK-1 monoclonal antibody was determined using a modification of a solid-phase binding assay procedure (22Cantarero L.A. Butler J.E. Osborne J.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 105: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A Corning® enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate was coated with 0, 5, 10, or 20 μg of HNK-1 monoclonal antibody (dissolved in 100 μl of 0.1 M carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Then, the plate was washed with PBS and blocked with 100 μl of PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 2 h. The plate was washed with PBS 3 times. The Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide and GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU (40 pmol each), dissolved in 100 μl of PBS, were then added, and the plate was incubated at 4°C for 24 h, followed by washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 3 times. In order to solubilize the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharides binding to HNK-1, 50 μl of 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.5) was added, and the plate was incubated at 4°C for 48 h. To estimate the HNK-1-binding Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharides, the recovered Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharides were subjected to HPLC.RESULTSProduction of the Xyl-MU-induced Oligosaccharide by Cultured Human Skin FibroblastsHuman skin fibroblasts were incubated for 72 h in Eagle's MEM containing 0.5 mM Xyl-MU at 37°C. The pooled medium (20 l) was dialyzed, and the dialyzable fraction was concentrated with a lyophilizer. In order to purify the MU derivatives, the concentrated sample was subjected to gel filtration on a Sephadex G-15 column (4.1 × 150 cm), which was equilibrated and eluted with distilled water at a flow rate of 50 ml/h (Fig. 1). The fluorescence intensity of the eluate was monitored at excitation and emission wavelengths of 325 and 380 nm, respectively. The presence of Sia-Gal-Xyl-MU (Fig. 1, arrow1), GlcA-Xyl-MU (Fig. 1, arrow3), Gal-Gal-Xyl-MU (Fig. 1, arrow4), Gal-Xyl-MU (Fig. 1, arrow5), and Xyl-MU (Fig. 1, arrow6) was confirmed using gel-filtration HPLC (Shodex OHpak KB-803). Moreover, a fraction containing an unknown fluoro-labeled oligosaccharide was detected (Fig. 1, arrow2). Then, the fractions containing the novel Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide were collected and purified, and the structure of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was analyzed.Isolation of the Xyl-MU-induced OligosaccharideThe fractions containing the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide were recovered, concentrated, and applied to a Sephadex G-15 column (2.1 × 27 cm) equilibrated with 0.1 M acetic acid (Fig. 2). In addition to the peak of Sia-Gal-Xyl-MU, another fluoro-labeled peak (Fig. 2, peak2) was obtained. This peak was detected as a single one on reverse-phase HPLC using Shodex C18-5B, and was recovered, rechromatographed with the same column, and used for analyses as a purified sample (Fig. 3). The yield of the purified Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was 300 nmol from 20 liters of the pooled medium.Figure 2:Gel-filtration rechromatography on Sephadex G-15. The recovered fractions from Sephadex G-15 (Fig. 1) of the dialyzable fraction of the culture medium were applied to a Sephadex G-15 column (2.1 × 27 cm) equilibrated and eluted with 0.1 M acetic acid at a flow rate of 36 ml/h, and 3-ml fractions were collected.

The resulting PA-sugars were identified and quantified using an Ultrasphere ODS column. The Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was composed of MU, xylose, and glucuronic acid in molar ratios of 1.0:0.73:1.1 but contained no galactose, glucosamine, and galactosamine (Table I).Table ICarbohydrate composition of 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-xyloside-induced oligosaccharideTable ICarbohydrate composition of 4-methylumbelliferyl β-D-xyloside-induced oligosaccharideEnzymic Digestion of the Xyl-MU-induced OligosaccharideEnzymic digestion of the purified Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was performed. An aliquot of the oligosaccharide was incubated with β-glucuronidase and then subjected to gel-filtration HPLC on a Shodex OHpak KB-803 column. The oligosaccharide did not shift from the control position after digestion (Fig. 4b), nor did it shift after digestion with alkaline phosphatase (data not shown). The peak of the oligosaccharide was shifted to a position corresponding to GlcA-Xyl-MU after sulfatase digestion (Fig. 4c). The results of analysis with Smith degradation and mass spectrometry of the sulfatase-digestion product indicated that the glucuronic acid residue was linked at the C-4 position of xylose on this oligosaccharide, as already reported for GlcA-Xyl-MU (12Nakamura T. Izumi J. Takagaki K. Shibata S. Kojima K. Kato I. Endo M. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sulfatase digestion product was incubated with β-glucuronidase, and the elution time of the oligosaccharide after digestion was shifted to that of Xyl-MU (Fig. 4d). The digestion product was incubated with β-xylosidase, and the peak was shifted to that of MU (data not shown). These results indicated that the sequence of the carbohydrate components of this Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was sulfate-GlcA-Xyl-MU.Figure 4:Analysis by HPLC of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide after incubation with various enzymes.

The spectrum showed a major peak at m/z 563 (Fig. 5a), and therefore this peak was analyzed as the precursor ion for fragmentation by tandem mass spectrometric analysis. Four product ion peaks with mass numbers of 97, 175, 307, and 483 were obtained and identified as (sulfuric acid-H)−, (MU-H)−, ((Xyl-MU)-H)−, and ((GlcA-Xyl-MU)-H)−, respectively (Fig. 5b). Thus, the structure of this Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was identified as sulfate-GlcA-Xyl-MU.Figure 5:Mass spectra of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide. a, the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide; b, product ions on tandem mass spectrometric analysis spectrum of Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide using m/z 563 as the precursor ion (a).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Smith Degradation of the Xyl-MU-induced OligosaccharideFrom the analytical results described above, the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide appeared to be GlcA-Xyl-MU with a sulfated glucuronic acid residue. Therefore, its structure was most likely to be sulfate-O-2GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU, sulfate-O-3GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU, or sulfate-O-4GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU (Fig. 6, a-c). In order to examine the sulfate to glucuronic acid linkage position, an aliquot of the purified Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was subjected to Smith degradation. The degradation product was hydrolyzed in 2 N HCl at 100°C for 4 h, pyridylaminated, and analyzed by HPLC on an Ultrasphere ODS column. PA-glucuronic acid was detected. If the sulfate had been linked at any position other than the C-3 position of glucuronic acid, the glucuronic acid would have been cleaved and thus not detected as PA-glucuronic acid. Therefore, this result indicated that the structure of the oligosaccharide was sulfate-O-3GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU (Fig. 6b).Figure 6:Possible structures of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide. a, sulfate-O-2GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU; b, sulfate-O-3GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU; c, sulfate-O-4GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Binding of the Xyl-MU-induced Oligosaccharide for HNK-1Dot-blot analysis of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide was performed.

Binding of the Xyl-MU-induced oligosaccharide to HNK-1 was also analyzed using solid-phase binding assay.

In this study, human skin fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of Xyl-MU, a large quantity of medium was recovered and concentrated, and a minor unknown Xyl-MU derivative was detected by HPLC. This Xyl-MU derivative was purified using gel filtration chromatography and HPLC and then subjected to carbohydrate composition analysis, enzyme digestion, Smith degradation, and ion spray mass spectrometric analysis.

Therefore, it is possible that the sulfated glucuronic acid residue was transferred from glycolipid, glycoprotein, or glycosaminoglycan through the activity of exo-β-glucuronidase. However, GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU, considered to be a mediator of sulfate-O-3GlcAβ1-4Xylβ1-MU, was also detected in the culture medium, and its production was not inhibited by the addition of a β-glucuronidase inhibitor (12Nakamura T.

https://openalex.org/W2028523997,"To test the hypothesis that a large portion of the bait region of human α2-macroglobulin (α2M) can be removed without adversely affecting the protein's structural and functional properties, we expressed two human α2M variants with truncated bait regions and examined whether these variants folded normally and functioned as proteinase inhibitors. Each variant contains sites that are normal bait region cleavage sites in wild-type α2M, including the primary trypsin cleavage site. The truncated bait regions are shorter by 23 and 27 residues, respectively, and lack the C-terminal portion as well as different parts of the N-terminal section of the bait region. We found that such bait region truncation permitted normal folding of the monomers as well as formation of the thiol ester and dimerization by disulfide cross-linking, although the resulting species bound 6-(p-toluidino)-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid in a manner more like thiol ester-cleaved α2M than native α2M. The variants' thiol esters reacted with nucleophiles at rates identical to wild-type α2M. Surprisingly, however, the truncations prevented the noncovalent association of the covalent 360-kDa dimers that normally gives tetrameric α2M, decoupled bait region cleavage from thiol ester activation, and resulted in the inability of the two variants to “trap” proteinase. This was despite apparent cleavage of the bait region by proteinase, albeit at very much reduced rates relative to wild-type tetrameric α2M. The kinetics of thiol ester cleavage-dependent protein conformational changes also changed from sigmoidal to exponential. These findings indicate that residues in the bait region appear to be necessary for noncovalent association of 360-kDa disulfide-linked dimers to give tetrameric α2M and suggest a role for the bait region in normal α2M in coupling bait region cleavage to the sequence of conformational changes that result in thiol ester activation and ultimately proteinase trapping. To test the hypothesis that a large portion of the bait region of human α2-macroglobulin (α2M) can be removed without adversely affecting the protein's structural and functional properties, we expressed two human α2M variants with truncated bait regions and examined whether these variants folded normally and functioned as proteinase inhibitors. Each variant contains sites that are normal bait region cleavage sites in wild-type α2M, including the primary trypsin cleavage site. The truncated bait regions are shorter by 23 and 27 residues, respectively, and lack the C-terminal portion as well as different parts of the N-terminal section of the bait region. We found that such bait region truncation permitted normal folding of the monomers as well as formation of the thiol ester and dimerization by disulfide cross-linking, although the resulting species bound 6-(p-toluidino)-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid in a manner more like thiol ester-cleaved α2M than native α2M. The variants' thiol esters reacted with nucleophiles at rates identical to wild-type α2M. Surprisingly, however, the truncations prevented the noncovalent association of the covalent 360-kDa dimers that normally gives tetrameric α2M, decoupled bait region cleavage from thiol ester activation, and resulted in the inability of the two variants to “trap” proteinase. This was despite apparent cleavage of the bait region by proteinase, albeit at very much reduced rates relative to wild-type tetrameric α2M. The kinetics of thiol ester cleavage-dependent protein conformational changes also changed from sigmoidal to exponential. These findings indicate that residues in the bait region appear to be necessary for noncovalent association of 360-kDa disulfide-linked dimers to give tetrameric α2M and suggest a role for the bait region in normal α2M in coupling bait region cleavage to the sequence of conformational changes that result in thiol ester activation and ultimately proteinase trapping."

Using confocal fluorescence and patch-clamp recordings from single human neutrophils, in the presence of protein kinase C inhibitors, we studied the transient cytosolic acidification and whole-cell H+ current induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α (rhTNFα). Intracellular pH changes were monitored utilizing the ratiometric imaging of the dual emission fluoroprobe, carboxyseminaphthorhodafluor-1, AM acetate. Bath application of 1000 units/ml rhTNFα or 0.1 μM fMLP changed the fluorescence of fluoroprobe-loaded cells, indicating generation of cytosolic H+ ions. In the absence of Ca2+ in the pipette solution, exposure of cells to rhTNFα or fMLP for 10 s activated voltage-dependent H+ currents. From tail current analysis, the threshold voltage for H+ current activation was ≈ -50 mV. These fMLP- or rhTNFα-activated voltage-dependent H+ currents were augmented further in the presence of 0.1 mM of NADPH in the pipette solution, and they were inhibited by bath application of 50 μM of apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. These results indicate that rhTNFα- or fMLP-induced NADPH oxidase in human neutrophils gives rise to the activation of voltage-dependent H+ currents.
