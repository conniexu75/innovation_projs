https://openalex.org/W2139250164,"The hypothesis that quiescent CD4+ T lymphocytes carrying proviral DNA provide a reservoir for human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1) in patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was examined. In a study of 22 patients successfully treated with HAART for up to 30 months, replication-competent virus was routinely recovered from resting CD4+ T lymphocytes. The frequency of resting CD4+ T cells harboring latent HIV-1 was low, 0.2 to 16.4 per 10(6) cells, and, in cross-sectional analysis, did not decrease with increasing time on therapy. The recovered viruses generally did not show mutations associated with resistance to the relevant antiretroviral drugs. This reservoir of nonevolving latent virus in resting CD4+ T cells should be considered in deciding whether to terminate treatment in patients who respond to HAART."

After depletion of CD8 cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of both patients and normal donors, activation of patient CD4 lymphocytes with immobilized antibodies to CD3 and CD28 enabled the isolation of virus from PBMCs of six patients despite the suppression of their plasma HIV RNA to fewer than 50 copies per milliliter for up to 2 years. Partial sequencing of HIV pol revealed no new drug resistance mutations or discernible evolution, providing evidence for viral latency rather than drug failure."
https://openalex.org/W2062629127,"The wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans nematode ages rapidly, undergoing development, senescence, and death in less than 3 weeks. In contrast, mutants with reduced activity of the gene daf-2, a homolog of the insulin and insulin-like growth factor receptors, age more slowly than normal and live more than twice as long. These mutants are active and fully fertile and have normal metabolic rates. The life-span extension caused by daf-2 mutations requires the activity of the gene daf-16. daf-16 appears to play a unique role in life-span regulation and encodes a member of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 3 (HNF-3)/forkhead family of transcriptional regulators. In humans, insulin down-regulates the expression of certain genes by antagonizing the activity of HNF-3, raising the possibility that aspects of this regulatory system have been conserved."

https://openalex.org/W2104485296,"The Janus family of tyrosine kinases (JAK) plays an essential role in development and in coupling cytokine receptors to downstream intracellular signaling events. A t(9;12)(p24;p13) chromosomal translocation in a T cell childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient was characterized and shown to fuse the 3' portion of JAK2 to the 5' region of TEL, a gene encoding a member of the ETS transcription factor family. The TEL-JAK2 fusion protein includes the catalytic domain of JAK2 and the TEL-specific oligomerization domain. TEL-induced oligomerization of TEL-JAK2 resulted in the constitutive activation of its tyrosine kinase activity and conferred cytokine-independent proliferation to the interleukin-3-dependent Ba/F3 hematopoietic cell line."

https://openalex.org/W2048043734,"Geomorphic evidence that Mars was warm enough to support flowing water about 3.8 billion years ago presents a continuing enigma that cannot be explained by conventional greenhouse warming mechanisms. Model calculations show that the surface of early Mars could have been warmed through a scattering variant of the greenhouse effect, resulting from the ability of the carbon dioxide ice clouds to reflect the outgoing thermal radiation back to the surface. This process could also explain how Earth avoided an early irreversible glaciation and could extend the size of the habitable zone on extrasolar planets around stars."
https://openalex.org/W2022718682,"Angiostatin is one of the most potent inhibitors of angiogenesis. Reports have shown that metalloelastase, pancreas elastase, plasmin reductase, and plasmin convert plasminogen to angiostatin. However, the cleavage sites of plasminogen by those enzymes have not been determined. Here we demonstrate that two members of the human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, matrilysin (MMP-7) and gelatinase B/type IV collagenase (MMP-9), hydrolyze human plasminogen to generate angiostatin fragments. The cleavage sites have been determined. The 58-kDa bands derived from plasminogen by MMP-7 and MMP-9 both have the N-terminal sequence KVYLSEXKTG, which corresponds to that of angiostatin. This N terminus is identical to that of the starting plasminogen itself and corresponds to residues 97–106 of prepro-plasminogen. The 42- and 38-kDa bands generated by MMP-7 both have the N-terminal sequence VVLLPNVETP, which corresponds to the amino acid sequence 467–476 of prepro-plasminogen, between kringle domain 4 and 5. MMP-9 cleaves plasminogen to generate a 42-kDa fragment with the N-terminal sequence PVVLLPNVE, 1 residue upstream of the MMP-7 cleavage site. These results indicate that MMP-7 and MMP-9 may regulate new blood vessel formation by cleaving plasminogen and generating angiostatin molecules.

Embryo implantation and placentation, embryo growth and morphogenesis, menstruation, and wound healing all require new blood vessel formation to supply oxygen and other nutrients. Neovascularization is also critical for patients with coronary artery diseases; the newly formed collateral circulation allows blood flow to bypass the blocked coronary artery and supply blood to the heart in preventing heart attacks. Uncontrolled and persistent angiogenesis is involved in many pathological processes such as cancer growth and metastasis and vascular, rheumatoid, and other diseases (4Folkman J. Nat.

Because angiogenesis is essential for tumor growth and metastasis, anti-angiogenic therapy may become the most effective treatment for starving tumor cells and preventing the spread of cancer to other parts of the body (1Folkman J.

Angiostatin is an internal fragment of plasminogen consisting of the first four kringle domains of plasminogen, which is a key proenzyme in the fibrinolytic system (8Groskopf W.R. Summaria L.

Angiostatin is a specific inhibitor of endothelial cell proliferation and one of the most effective and specific natural inhibitors of angiogenesis. It mediates the suppression of metastasis in a Lewis lung carcinoma (11O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J.

Angiostatin represents a molecule that is generated by a primary tumor to inhibit both primary and secondary tumor growth. Recombinant angiostatin has been used successfully to suppress tumor growth and metastasis in animal model systems (12Sim B.K.L. O'Reilly M.S. Liang H. Fortier A.H. He W. Madsen J.W. Lapcevich R.

The identification of the responsible enzymes that cleave the precursor proteins and the elucidation of the cleavage sites in these proteins can uncover new mechanisms of growth regulation in the vascular system. One of the enzymes responsible for the generation of angiostatin in Lewis lung carcinoma has been identified as macrophage-derived metalloelastase (matrix metalloproteinase-12, MMP-12) 1The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; HNG, human 98-kDa neutrophil gelatinase B; MMP-2, 72-kDa gelatinase A/type IV collagenase; MMP-7, matrilysin; MMP-9, 92–98-kDa gelatinase B/type IV collagenase; MMP-12, metalloelastase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. (15Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). In addition, plasmin and plasmin reductase are responsible for generating angiostatin from plasminogen (16Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 17Stathakis P. Fitzgerald M.

However, none of the cleavage sites by these enzymes have been determined. We now show that human matrilysin (MMP-7) and human neutrophil gelatinase B/type IV collagenase (HNG, MMP-9) also convert human plasminogen to angiostatin fragments. Furthermore, we determine that the cleavage sites in plasminogen by MMP-7 and MMP-9 are located between kringle domains 4 and 5, which is in good agreement with the estimation that angiostatin consists of the first four kringle domains in plasminogen (11O'Reilly M.S.

Human plasminogen was purchased from Sigma. Human plasmin was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Plasminogen was diluted to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Active human neutrophil gelatinase B/type IV collagenase (HNG, MMP-9) was purified as described (18Sang Q.-X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Active human recombinant matrilysin (MMP-7) was a generous gift from Dr. Harold E. van Wart of Syntex Discovery Research, Palo Alta, CA (18Sang Q.-X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Sang Q.A. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Human MMP-7 and MMP-9 were tested for the ability to digest plasminogen in a 1× assay buffer (50 mm Tricine buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.05% Brij-35 (polyoxyethylene lauryl ether), and 0.02% NaN3). Time course of digestion of plasminogen for each enzyme varied according to enzyme concentration and catalytic activity. All reactions were stopped with a half-volume of 3× denaturing buffer (0.15 m Tris, pH 6.7, 6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.03% bromphenol blue, 8m urea) and run on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions using a Bio-Rad mini-gel apparatus. Protein bands were visualized using a silver stain method (20Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). The electrophoresis and electrophoretic transfer of proteins were carried out as described previously (18Sang Q.-X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Sang Q.A. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequences of relevant protein bands were determined by automated Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer (18Sang Q.-X. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1251: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Sang Q.A. Bodden M.K. Windsor L.J. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The identified peptide sequences were utilized in a search and alignment analysis performed against all the protein data banks using the BLAST program. 2National Center for Biotechnology Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Plasminogen, at 15 μm, was incubated with 1 μm MMP-9 (human neutrophil gelatinase B, HNG) or 1 μm MMP-7 (matrilysin) in 1× assay buffer at 37 °C for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 1, MMP-7 digested plasminogen at a much faster rate than MMP-9. Plasminogen (about 108 kDa) was transformed into three major bands at about 58, 42, and 38 kDa by MMP-9 and a broad band of 38–45 kDa by MMP-7. To assure band formations were in fact enzyme products of plasminogen, all incubations performed contained controls of plasminogen and the enzymes by themselves for the allotted time. A detailed time course study of digestion of plasminogen by MMP-9 and MMP-7 was carried out (Fig. 2). Plasminogen at 15 μm was incubated with 1 μm MMP-9 or 1 μm MMP-7 in 1× assay buffer at 37 °C for a total of 120 h for MMP-9 and 24 h for MMP-7. Samples were taken at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h for MMP-9 (Fig. 2 A) and 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h for MMP-7 (Fig. 2 B). Digestion was stopped by addition of a half-volume of 3× denaturing buffer with reduction and heating. As shown in Fig. 2, both MMP-9 and MMP-7 converted the 108-kDa plasminogen into three major bands at an estimated molecular mass of 58, 42, and 38 kDa. Cleavage of plasminogen by MMP-9 is very slow (Fig.2 A), whereas cleavage of plasminogen by MMP-7 is fast and almost complete within 24 h (Fig. 2 B). Attempts to quantitatively analyze the digestion products produced over time using a densitometric scanning method were unsuccessful. The 58-kDa bands generated from plasminogen by MMP-9 and MMP-7 both have the N-terminal sequence KVYLSEXKTG (Fig.3), which is the same as the N-terminal sequence of the angiostatin generated by elastase (11O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A. Moses M. Lane W.S. Cao Y. Sage E.H. Folkman J. Cell. 1994; 79: 315-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3180) Google Scholar). The N terminus is also identical to that of the starting 108-kDa plasminogen band sequenced and corresponds to residues 97–106 of the prepro-plasminogen. The 42- and 38-kDa bands generated from plasminogen by MMP-7 both have the N-terminal sequence VVLLPNVETP (Fig. 3), which corresponds to residues 467–476 of the prepro-plasminogen, at the junction between kringle domain 4 and kringle domain 5 of the plasminogen molecule. The 42-kDa band generated from plasminogen, cleaved by MMP-9, has the N-terminal sequence PVVLLPNVE (Fig. 3), 1 residue upstream of the MMP-7 cleavage site. Therefore, MMP-7 cleaves the Pro466-Val467 peptide bond and MMP-9 cleaves the Pro465-Pro466 peptide bond in the prepro-plasminogen sequence. These experiments show that matrilysin (MMP-7) and gelatinase B/type IV collagenase (MMP-9) have angiostatin-converting enzyme activities. Both cleave plasminogen at the sites between kringle domain four and five to generate angiostatin molecules consisting of the first four kringle domains of plasminogen. These two enzymes show slightly different cleavage site specificities, MMP-7 cleaving the Pro466-Val467 peptide bond, and MMP-9, the Pro465-Pro466 peptide bond in the prepro-plasminogen sequence. All reported angiostatin species that consist of the first four kringle domains of human and murine plasminogen, generated both in vitro and in vivo, or made as recombinant proteins exhibit the biological activities of angiostatin isolated from plasma (e.g. inhibition of endothelial proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor growth and metastasis) (11O'Reilly M.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29461-29467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Therefore, the angiostatin fragments consisting of the first four kringle domains of plasminogen generated by MMP-7 and MMP-9 should also have these biological activities. The physiological relevance and significance of the generation of angiostatin by MMP-7 and MMP-9 in vivo remain to be investigated. Other reports have not demonstrated any direct evidence to exclude the possibility that MMP-7 and MMP-9 are the responsible enzymes for generating angiostatin. Serine proteinase activities, but not metalloproteinase activities, have been reported to be responsible for the generation of bioactive angiostatin from purified human plasminogen or plasmin in three human prostate carcinoma cell lines (PC-3, DU-145, and LN-Cap) (22Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Patrick M. Boggio L. Cundiff D.L. Schnaper H.W. Madison L. Volpert O. Bouck N. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Soff G.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4887-4890PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Soff and co-workers (16Gately S. Twardowski P. Stack M.S. Cundiff D.L. Grella D. Castellino F.J. Enghild J. Kwaan H.C. Lee F. Kramer R.A. Volpert O. Bouck N. Soff G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10868-10872Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) have determined that plasmin itself in the presence of reduced glutathione is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of plasmin to angiostatin. To investigate why the metalloproteinase activities were not responsible for converting plasminogen to angiostatin in those three prostate cancer cell lines, we have examined if those cell lines produce active MMP-7 and MMP-9. None of the three cell lines produce any MMP-7. PC-3 and DU145 cells produce pro-MMP-9, and LN-Cap expresses some pro-gelatinase A (pro-MMP-2). None of those cell lines expresses any active forms of MMP-9. Thus, it is not possible for MMP-7 and MMP-9 to be the responsible enzymes for generating angiostatin because the active forms of these two enzymes are not available in that particular prostate cancer model system. In summary, it is possible that matrix metalloproteinases can act as angiostatin-converting enzymes in other model systems. One member of the MMP family, macrophage metalloelastase (MMP-12), has been shown to generate angiostatin and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in vivo (15Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Some correlative results in that study have suggested that MMP-9 produced by macrophages in tumors is not likely to be responsible for angiostatin-converting enzyme activity. However, those data did not specify if the MMP-9 activity detected was due to pro-MMP-9 or activated MMP-9, because the gelatin zymogram assay can detect both latent and active forms of MMP-9. Pro-MMP-9 does not cleave plasminogen, so it cannot generate angiostatin. No direct biochemical evidence has been provided to confirm the conclusion that MMP-9 is not the responsible enzyme to generate angiostatin (15Dong Z. Kumar R. Yang X. Fidler I.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 801-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the paper alternatively suggested, the levels of MMP-9 in their system may not have been high enough to produce the amount of angiostatin that can be detected in the bioassay. The activity of MMP-9 toward plasminogen may be lower than MMP-12. In summary, it is still possible that active MMP-9 can be partially responsible for the angiostatin-converting enzyme activity. This possibility is confirmed by our biochemical studies. Our biochemical data have demonstrated that MMP-9 cleaves plasminogen to generate an angiostatin fragment, although the rate of catalysis is slower than that of MMP-7. Moreover, it is well documented that MMP-7 and MMP-9 are expressed in many types of tissues and cells, for example tumor tissues (23Newell K.J. Witty J.P. Rodgers W.H. Matrisian L.M. Mol. Carcinogen. 1994; 10: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 24Heppner K.J. Matrisian L.M. Jensen R.A. Rodgers W.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 149: 273-282PubMed Google Scholar), fibroblasts (25Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and developing mononuclear phagocytes (26Busiek D.F. Ross P. McDonnell S. Murphy G. Matrisian L.M. Welgus H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9087-9092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that these two enzymes may also be physiologically relevant angiostatin-converting enzymesin vivo. It would be interesting to find out if any other members of the MMP family can also convert plasminogen to angiostatin molecules. The specificity, efficiency, detailed cleavage sites, biological activity, and physiological relevance of angiostatin fragments generated by different enzymes remain to be determined and compared. We are currently undertaking such studies. The angiostatin species generated by an enzyme with an identical C terminus as angiostatin isolated from human plasma will be the most physiologically relevant, and this enzyme will be identified as the angiostatin-converting enzyme. The most potent angiostatin species may be selected for clinical trial for the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis.

Deafness in the family is associated with a protein-truncating mutation in a human homolog of the Drosophila gene diaphanous . The truncation is caused by a single nucleotide substitution in a splice donor, leading to a four–base pair insertion in messenger RNA and a frameshift. The diaphanous protein is a profilin ligand and target of Rho that regulates polymerization of actin, the major component of the cytoskeleton of hair cells of the inner ear."
https://openalex.org/W2093515639,"Induction of apoptosis by oncogenes like c- myc may be important in restraining the emergence of neoplasia. However, the mechanism by which c- myc induces apoptosis is unknown. CD95 (also termed Fas or APO-1) is a cell surface transmembrane receptor of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family that activates an intrinsic apoptotic suicide program in cells upon binding either its ligand CD95L or antibody. c- myc –induced apoptosis was shown to require interaction on the cell surface between CD95 and its ligand. c-Myc acts downstream of the CD95 receptor by sensitizing cells to the CD95 death signal. Moreover, IGF-I signaling and Bcl-2 suppress c- myc –induced apoptosis by also acting downstream of CD95. These findings link two apoptotic pathways previously thought to be independent and establish the dependency of Myc on CD95 signaling for its killing activity."
https://openalex.org/W1975358464,"The signal transduction pathway or pathways linking extracellular signals to myogenesis are poorly defined. Upon mitogen withdrawal from C2C12 myoblasts, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p42Erk2 is inactivated concomitant with up-regulation of muscle-specific genes. Overexpression of MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) inhibited p42Erk2 activity and was sufficient to relieve the inhibitory effects of mitogens on muscle-specific gene expression. Later during myogenesis, endogenous expression of MKP-1 decreased. MKP-1 overexpression during differentiation prevented myotube formation despite appropriate expression of myosin heavy chain. This indicates that muscle-specific gene expression is necessary but not sufficient to commit differentiated myocytes to myotubes and suggests a function for the MAPKs during the early and late stages of skeletal muscle differentiation."

The amino-terminal domain of the bifunctional PAM protein is a peptidylglycine alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase (PHM) with two coppers that cycle through cupric and cuprous oxidation states. The anomalous signal of the endogenous coppers was used to determine the structure of the catalytic core of oxidized rat PHM with and without bound peptide substrate. These structures strongly suggest that the PHM reaction proceeds via activation of substrate by a copper-bound oxygen species. The mechanistic and structural insight gained from the PHM structures can be directly extended to dopamine beta-monooxygenase.

These cells also possess uniquely high cellular and mitochondrial zinc levels. Correlations among zinc, citrate, and m-aconitase in prostate indicated that zinc might be an inhibitor of prostate m-aconitase activity and citrate oxidation. The present studies reveal that zinc at near physiological levels inhibited m-aconitase activity of mitochondrial sonicate preparations obtained from rat ventral prostate epithelial cells. Corresponding studies conducted with mitochondrial sonicates of rat kidney cells revealed that zinc also inhibited the kidney m-aconitase activity. However the inhibitory effect of zinc was more sensitive with the prostate m-aconitase activity. Zinc inhibition fit the competitive inhibitor model. The inhibitory effect of zinc occurred only with citrate as substrate and was specific for the citrate →cis-aconitate reaction. Other cations (Ca2+, Mn2+, Cd2+) did not result in the inhibitory effects obtained with zinc. The presence of endogenous zinc inhibited the m-aconitase activity of the prostate mitochondrial preparations. Kidney preparations that contain lower endogenous zinc levels exhibited no endogenous inhibition of m-aconitase activity. Studies with pig prostate and seminal vesicle mitochondrial preparations also revealed that zinc was a competitive inhibitor against citrate of m-aconitase activity. The effects of zinc on purified beef heart m-aconitase verified the competitive inhibitor action of zinc. In contrast, zinc had no inhibitory effect on purified cytosolic aconitase. These studies reveal for the first time that zinc is a specific inhibitor of m-aconitase of mammalian cells. In prostate epithelial cells, in situ mitochondrial zinc levels inhibit m-aconitase activity, which provides a mechanism by which citrate oxidation is limited.

In prostate epithelial cells, in situ mitochondrial zinc levels inhibit m-aconitase activity, which provides a mechanism by which citrate oxidation is limited. Prostate secretory epithelial cells have the specialized function and capability of accumulating and secreting extraordinarily high levels of citrate. This is achieved by the existence of a uniquely limiting m-aconitase 1The abbreviations used are: m- and c-, mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase, respectively. activity that minimizes the oxidation of citrate via the Krebs cycle. Consequently, citrate synthesized by these cells is accumulated and secreted (which we refer to as “net citrate production”), thereby accounting for the extremely high (20–150 mm) citrate content of human prostatic fluid. In typical mammalian cell metabolism, m-aconitase is not a regulatory, rate-limiting enzyme. Consequently, the steady-state citrate/isocitrate ratio of most cells is generally maintained at about 11/1, which is established by the aconitase equilibrium reaction, 88 citrate ↔ 4 cis-aconitate ↔ 8 isocitrate. In contrast, the citrate/isocitrate ratio in prostate is generally about 30/1. Also, the intracellular citrate concentration of prostate cells is estimated to be about 1.2 mm as compared with about 0.1–0.4 mm for typical mammalian cells. These and other relationships of prostate citrate metabolism and regulation are detailed in our recent review articles (1Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 18: 25-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 19: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Costello L.C. Franklin R.B.

CRC Press, Inc., New York1997: 115-150Google Scholar). This paper addresses the mechanism associated with this uniquely limiting m-aconitase activity of prostate cells. The level of prostate m-aconitase enzyme appears to be similar to that associated with other cells, although the levels of m-aconitase activity and citrate oxidation are significantly lower in prostate cells (5Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B.

Urology. 1996; 48: 654-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus the limiting m-aconitase activity is due to unique properties of the enzyme and/or unique mitochondrial conditions that inhibit the enzyme activity. Based on the close correlations between zinc and citrate levels in prostate and the fact that prostate cells accumulate the highest level of zinc in the body, we reasoned that zinc might be involved in the m-aconitase/citrate relationship (1Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 18: 25-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 19: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Costello L.C.

CRC Press, Inc., New York1997: 115-150Google Scholar). Moreover, earlier studies provided evidence that zinc could be an inhibitor of prostate m-aconitase activity (8Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Enzyme. 1981; 26: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge no other studies have been reported concerning zinc as an inhibitor of m-aconitase activity. This report 1) demonstrates that zinc at low concentrations is a specific inhibitor of mammalian cell m-aconitase activity, 2) presents preliminary kinetic information concerning the mechanism of zinc inhibition, 3) establishes that physiological levels of zinc inhibit the m-aconitase activity of prostate epithelial cells, and 4) provides the basis for establishing an important and unique role of zinc in prostate citrate metabolism. Young adult male Wistar rats weighing between 300 and 350 g were employed as the source of tissues for these studies. The handling and treatment of animals were in accordance with the regulations and guidelines of the National Institutes of Health and the University of Maryland. The preparation of prostate epithelial cells and kidney cells from male rats as well as the procedure for obtaining mitochondrial preparations has been described previously (5Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Metabolism. 1996; 45: 442-449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Urology. 1996; 48: 654-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Generally, the mitochondria were isolated in 250 mm sucrose containing 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2. The mitochondrial preparations were generally sonicated in 50 mm HEPES buffer. The sonicates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fluid was the source for m-aconitase activity. In some experiments, the supernatant fluid was passed through a Bio-Rad 10DG desalting column to remove endogenous substrates. All steps were conducted at 2–4 °C. The protein concentration of the sonicate preparations was determined by the method of Bradford (9Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Before use, the sonicates were incubated with activating solution (5 mmcysteine, 0.5 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate) to activate the m-aconitase. Specific modifications of these procedures are described in the presentation of the results. Purified m-aconitase was prepared in the laboratory of Dr. Kennedy from beef heart mitochondria and was activated anaerobically with Fe2+, dithiothreitol, and dithionite as described previously (10Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.E. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To remove excess low molecular activating agents, the protein solution was rapidly desalted anaerobically on G-50 Sephadex columns equilibrated with 0.1 m HEPES/K+, pH 7.5, using the method of Penefsky (11Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The active enzyme was frozen in 25-μl pellets in liquid nitrogen and stored at −77 °C until used. Mitochondrial aconitase activity was determined fluoroenzymatically by coupling the m-aconitase reaction with isocitric dehydrogenase as described previously (7Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Urology. 1996; 48: 654-659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Fluorometer tubes contained 1.0 ml of 50 mm HEPES with 0.1 mm Mg2+ (pH 7.2). Generally 10 μl of excess isocitric dehydrogenase (Sigma), 10 μl of excess NADP, and 5–20 μl of mitochondrial extract (to provide ∼50 μg of mitochondrial protein) were added to establish the base-line fluorescence. The aconitase reaction was run at 25 °C and initiated by the addition of substrate (usually from 0.01–1.0 mmfinal concentration citrate or cis-aconitate), and the reduction of NADP was recorded. The m-aconitase activity is reported as μmol of NADPH formed (i.e. substrate utilized)/mg of protein/min. This assay measures m-aconitase activity in the direction citrate → cis-aconitate → isocitrate. For this assay to work properly, isocitric dehydrogenase must not be limiting, and we check these conditions with each assay. In some experiments, aconitase activity was determined by dual-wavelength spectrophotometry by tracking either the utilization or formation ofcis-aconitate at 240/280 μm. The zinc content of mitochondrial preparations was determined by atomic absorption as described previously (12Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1996; 30: 26-32Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Enzyme-inhibitor kinetics were analyzed with the enzyme-PC computer program developed by Lutz and Rodbard (13Lutz R.A. Rodbard D. Enzyme. 1986; 36: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This program provides analysis for pure, partial, and mixed types of competitive, uncompetitive, and noncompetitive inhibition. The results presented are representative of the data obtained from experiments that were repeated two or more times to ensure the consistency and reproducibility of the results. We previously demonstrated that the addition of zinc in the range of 1–10 mm markedly inhibited the m-aconitase activity of prostate mitochondrial preparations (8Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Enzyme. 1981; 26: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recently the in situ concentration of mitochondrial zinc was determined to be in the range of 50–1100 ng/mg of mitochondrial protein (equivalent to approximately 0.15–3.0 mm zinc), depending upon the cell type (12Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1996; 30: 26-32Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Within this range, the zinc levels of prostate cells is 2–20 times greater than the level in nonprostate cells. The present studies were initiated to establish the effect of more physiological concentrations of zinc on prostate m-aconitase activity. The results (Fig. 1) demonstrate that zinc in the range of 0.004–0.015 mm (equivalent to approximately 3–11 μg of zinc/mg of mitochondrial protein) inhibited the m-aconitase reaction, citrate → isocitrate, in the presence of 0.05 mm citrate as substrate. The inhibition exhibited a linear dose response effect over this range. In parallel assays, zinc also exhibited an inhibitory effect on kidney m-aconitase activity (Fig. 1). For the prostate preparation, the I50 (50% inhibition) = 0.01 mm zinc, and I25 = 0.004 mmzinc. The I25 concentration was equivalent to approximately 3 μg of zinc/mg of mitochondrial protein. For kidney, I25 = 0.011 mm (9 μg of zinc/mg of protein), and I50 = 0.02 mm. Consequently, the m-aconitase activity of the prostate preparation was 2–3 times more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of zinc than the kidney preparation. This difference between prostate and kidney was consistently observed in all the experiments and with varying concentrations of citrate as substrate. It is also important to note that the effective inhibition concentration (e.g. I25 = 0.004 mmzinc) occurs when the zinc concentration is less than 10% that of the citrate (substrate) concentration. Under the conditions of this assay (0.05 mm citrate, 0.004 mm zinc, pH 7.2), about 94% of the citrate (0.047 mm) would remain unchelated. 2J. Glusker, personal communication. The reported log Kf (formation constant) for zinc-citrate is 3.6–4.5 (14Westergaard N. Banke T. Wahl P. Sonnewald U. Schouseboe A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3367-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or 6.0 (15Sillen L. Martell A.E. Stability Constants of Metal-Ion Complexes. 2nd Ed. Chemical Society, London1964Google Scholar) depending upon the medium conditions. Thus the availability of unchelated citrate as substrate in the presence of the low concentrations of zinc is not responsible for the decreased m-aconitase activity. This was also evident from the aconitase reaction rates (not shown), which always exhibited an initial linear rate that was used for the calculation of initial velocity (Vo). Moreover, a decreased enzyme activity due to decreased substrate availability would not result in the competitive inhibitor kinetics as presented below. Because the levels of m-aconitase enzyme in the prostate and kidney sonicates could differ in relation to the protein level of the sonicates, we also determined the effect of zinc with varying amounts of sonicate. The results demonstrated that over the range of 10–100 μg of mitochondrial protein, the inhibitory effect of zinc was constant. With purified m-aconitase (discussed below) zinc inhibition was constant over a 20-fold (0.15–3.0 μg) range. Therefore the inhibitory effects of zinc were independent of the variations of enzyme levels employed in these studies. These results clearly established that zinc inhibited the overall m-aconitase reaction citrate → cis-aconitate → isocitrate. Which specific reaction was inhibited by zinc needed to be addressed. Therefore the effect of zinc on the m-aconitase reaction was determined when cis-aconitate replaced citrate as substrate,i.e. cis-aconitate → isocitrate reaction. The addition of zinc at concentrations up to 0.1 mm in the presence of 0.1 mm cis-aconitate had little or no inhibitory effect on the cis-aconitate → isocitrate reaction. Therefore the effect of zinc in the overall reaction citrate →cis-aconitate → isocitrate must have occurred at the citrate → cis-aconitate step. This was also confirmed by studies described below (Fig. 6) with purified m-aconitase. Moreover zinc at these inhibitory levels had no effect on the reaction citrate ← cis-aconitate → isocitrate as determined by the spectrophotometric disappearance of cis-aconitate (results not shown), and zinc exhibited no inhibitory effect on the reaction isocitrate → cis-aconitate or on isocitric dehydrogenase activity. Consequently, the inhibitory effect of zinc within the concentrations employed is specific for and limited to citrate as substrate and essentially inhibits the m-aconitase reaction in the direction citrate → isocitrate. This is extremely important since, within the context of the Krebs cycle function, citrate is the natural substrate of m-aconitase, and the effect of zinc would be to inhibit citrate oxidation. We then attempted to obtain some preliminary information concerning the kinetic properties of the enzyme activity and the inhibitor characteristics of zinc on prostate and kidney m-aconitase. The m-aconitase activity for the reaction citrate → isocitrate of kidney mitochondrial preparations (V m = 80–110 nmol/mg of protein/min) was always consistently and significantly higher than prostate (V m = 30–40 nmol/mg of protein/min). This verifies the earlier reports that m-aconitase activity of prostate epithelial cells is lower than other cells (1Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 18: 25-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 19: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Urology. 1997; 50: 3-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Franklin R.B. Costello L.C. Naz R.K. The Prostate, Basic and Clinical Concepts. CRC Press, Inc., New York1997: 115-150Google Scholar). However theK m (0.05–0.08 mm) for citrate was essentially the same for kidney and prostate preparations. A typical representation of the enzyme-inhibitor characteristics obtained in these studies is presented in Fig. 2. The Lineweaver-Burk plots and computer analysis of inhibitor models revealed that at the low concentrations (up to about 0.0125 mm zinc in the presence of 0.05 mm citrate as substrate), zinc acted as a competitive inhibitor of the m-aconitase reaction citrate → isocitrate in prostate and kidney preparations. The K i values were slightly but consistently higher for prostate (K i = 0.007 mm) than for kidney (0.004 mm). At zinc concentrations greater than 0.0125 mm (for example 0.025 mm) and approaching stoichiometry with the citrate concentration, the inhibitory effect of zinc did not conform to any of the typical classes of the inhibitor model. At the higher zinc concentrations, chelation with citrate significantly decreased the concentration of free citrate as substrate. Therefore the decrease in m-aconitase activity with high zinc concentrations was probably a reflection of decreased substrate availability rather than a true inhibitory effect of zinc on m-aconitase. We then attempted to determine if this inhibitory effect was specific for zinc. Consequently the possible effects of Ca2+, Mn2+, and Cd2+ were determined. Ca2+ or Mn2+ concentrations up to 10 × greater than the zinc range employed exhibited no inhibitory effect on the m-aconitase reaction. At concentrations equivalent to or higher than the citrate concentration, some inhibition resulted, but such effects would be of no physiological importance. Cd2+ in the range of 0.01–0.1 mm did exhibit an inhibitory effect on prostate and kidney m-aconitase. However the inhibition fit either an uncompetitive or noncompetitive type of inhibition but definitely did not fit the competitive inhibition model. This is consistent in part with an effect of Cd2+ on the sulfhydryl groups of m-aconitase since Cd2+ exhibits a higher affinity for thiols than zinc. Consequently, the inhibition of m-aconitase by low zinc concentrations is not representative of a generalized divalent cationic or chelating effect that is shared by other cations. In all the studies described above, the mitochondrial preparations were obtained by isolation with sucrose medium in the absence of EDTA or other chelating agents. Therefore, there was no attempt to extract any of the endogenous zinc that was present in the mitochondria. Consequently, the possibility existed that the m-aconitase activity of the mitochondrial preparations might be inhibited by the presence of endogenous zinc. This was an extremely important factor to consider, since prostate mitochondria reportedly contain much higher zinc levels than nonprostate mitochondria (12Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1996; 30: 26-32Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This relationship was investigated by comparing the m-aconitase activities of mitochondria prepared with medium containing EDTA and with medium lacking EDTA for both prostate and kidney preparations. In these studies, each isolated mitochondrial preparation was divided into two aliquots before sonication. Each aliquot was washed three times in either sucrose medium or sucrose medium containing 1.0 mmEDTA. This was followed by two washings in sucrose medium without EDTA to remove any traces of EDTA from the final preparation. Sonication and final preparation proceeded in the regular manner. Fig.3 presents the enzyme kinetic results of this study. Treatment of the mitochondria with EDTA had no effect on kidney m-aconitase activity. In contrast, EDTA treatment resulted in a consistent increase in prostate m-aconitase activity. The results also demonstrated that the minus-EDTA preparation exhibited the properties of a competitive inhibitor, which is consistent with the probability that this effect was due to endogenous zinc. These results are consistent with earlier studies (8Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Enzyme. 1981; 26: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which demonstrated that EDTA treatment of prostate mitochondria increased citrate oxidation while having no effect on kidney mitochondrial citrate oxidation. To obtain additional evidence that endogenous zinc was responsible for these results, the effects of the addition of zinc or EDTA to the aconitase reaction assay medium for EDTA and minus-EDTA-treated prostate preparations were determined (Fig.4). The isolation of prostate mitochondria in sucrose/EDTA medium resulted in an increased m-aconitase activity, with no such effect observed with the kidney mitochondrial preparation, which is consistent with the results presented in Fig. 3. For prostate, the addition of 0.006 mm zinc to the reaction mixture for the EDTA preparation resulted in the inhibition of m-aconitase activity, which approached the activity of the minus-EDTA preparation in the absence of added zinc. The addition of 0.0125 mmzinc to the assay reaction containing 0.1 mm citrate decreased the m-aconitase activity below the activity of the minus-EDTA-treated preparation. Under these conditions about 92–96% of the citrate remained unchelated and available as substrate. This reaffirms and extends the zinc inhibition effects presented in Figs. 1and 2. With kidney, EDTA treatment had no effect on the m-aconitase activity, and the addition of zinc to the assay medium inhibited the activity. We also determined the effects of the addition of EDTA to the reaction medium on the m-aconitase activity (Fig. 4). When 0.1 mmEDTA was added to the reaction of the minus-EDTA preparation of prostate, the m-aconitase activity was increased and approached the activity of the EDTA-treated preparation, but the addition of 0.1 mm EDTA to the reaction assay had no effect on the activity of the EDTA preparation. This demonstrated the endogenous presence of an m-aconitase inhibitor in the minus-EDTA mitochondrial preparation, which was most likely zinc. In contrast, the addition of EDTA to the assay medium had no significant effect on the m-aconitase activity of either EDTA or minus-EDTA-treated kidney preparations. To relate these EDTA effects to zinc, the zinc content of the mitochondrial preparations was determined. EDTA treatment reduced the prostate zinc concentration from 344 to 122 ng/mg of protein and reduced the kidney zinc concentration from 55 to 22 ng/mg of protein. These results confirm the reported (12Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1996; 30: 26-32Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) significantly higher mitochondrial level of zinc in prostate epithelial cells as compared with kidney or other cells. It must be noted that although EDTA treatment decreased the zinc content of both prostate and kidney preparations, the levels of zinc in the prostate preparation remained proportionately higher than the kidney levels. This correlates with the observed differences in the effects on the m-aconitase activity of the preparations and on citrate oxidation as reported earlier (8Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Enzyme. 1981; 26: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The endogenous levels of zinc in the kidney mitochondria are apparently too low to exhibit an inhibitory effect on m-aconitase activity so that EDTA treatment has no effect on the activity. The much higher endogenous level of zinc does inhibit the m-aconitase activity of prostate mitochondria; therefore, the reduction of zinc concentrations by EDTA treatment results in increased m-aconitase activity. Even after EDTA treatment the zinc level (122 ng/mg of protein) of the prostate mitochondria remained significantly higher than the level (22 ng/mg protein) of the kidney preparation, which indicates that prostate mitochondria contains a much higher nondiffusible (i.e. not extracted from the intact mitochondria during isolation) zinc component than kidney mitochondria. The relationship of this component to m-aconitase will require future studies involving the purification of the prostate enzyme. As in our previous report (12Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1996; 30: 26-32Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the zinc level of the mitochondrial preparations represents the remaining zinc upon completion of the isolation and harvesting of the mitochondrial pellet. It is most probable that the in situ mitochondrial level of zinc is somewhat higher than the remaining level. Nevertheless, collectively these results demonstrate that under in situ or physiological conditions, zinc is an inhibitor of m-aconitase activity in the direction of citrate → isocitrate in prostate epithelial cells. We also had the opportunity to obtain some fresh pig prostate and seminal vesicle glands that are also citrate-producing glands. Mitochondrial preparations were obtained from the glandular epithelial cells in the same manner described for rat ventral prostate, and the effects of zinc on pig prostate and seminal vesicle m-aconitase activity were determined. The results (Fig.5) demonstrate that zinc significantly inhibited m-aconitase activity of both preparations and that zinc inhibition fit the competitive inhibition model. The kinetic values for the prostate and seminal vesicle activities, respectively, wereV m = 12 and 20 nmol/mg of protein/min,K m = 0.009 and 0.08 mm, andK i = 0.001 and 0.01 mm. Despite some specific cell and species variations in the values of the kinetic parameters, these studies with a variety of sources of mitochondria from rat and pig tissues consistently demonstrate that low levels of zinc inhibit the m-aconitase activity of the mitochondrial preparations. Considering the diversity of the somewhat crude preparations, the consistency of the zinc inhibition is rather remarkable. It became essential to determine if the inhibitory effect was due to a direct effect of zinc on the substrate-aconitase complex or an interaction of zinc with other components of the mitochondrial preparations, which in turn inhibited the m-aconitase activity. Therefore we determined the effects of zinc on purified m-aconitase isolated from bovine heart (10Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.E. Dreyer J.-L. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11098-11105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results (Fig.6) demonstrate that zinc was a competitive inhibitor of the m-aconitase reaction citrate → isocitrate. The purified enzyme exhibited a K m = 0.08 mmand K i = 0.002 mm. Zinc inhibition was obtained with as little as 0.001 mm zinc in the presence of 0.1 mm citrate. This adds support to the likelihood that zinc at levels approximating the in situ level of mitochondrial zinc inhibits the m-aconitase activity of prostate cells. With 0.1 mm cis-aconitate as substrate, zinc concentrations lower than 0.025 mm had no effect on m-aconitase activity, and as much as 0.05 mm zinc exhibited only 25% inhibition (Fig. 6). Consequently the competitive inhibition effect of low zinc levels was specific for the citrate →cis-aconitate reaction. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of zinc was independent of the enzyme concentration over the range of 0.15–3.0 μg of enzyme (results not shown). These results with purified m-aconitase essentially corroborate the results obtained with the mitochondrial preparations and demonstrate that the in situ effect of zinc is due to a direct inhibition of m-aconitase enzyme. The use of the purified active enzyme allowed us to compare the zinc effects on m-aconitase activity in the presence and absence of the cysteine/Fe2+ activating solution used in the mitochondrial sonicate studies. The inhibition by zinc was essentially the same in either case so that the presence of activating solution was not involved in this effect. The effects of zinc on m-aconitase and purified cytosolic (c-) aconitase were compared. Under conditions (0.2 mm citrate, 0.01 mm zinc), which resulted in 45% inhibition of m-aconitase, zinc had no effect on c-aconitase activity. Thus this inhibitory effect is specific for the m-aconitase isozyme. This is an important distinction since both isozymes contain identical active site structures. These studies conclusively demonstrate that zinc at physiological or near physiological levels is a specific inhibitor of mammalian cell m-aconitase. The kinetic results demonstrate that zinc acts as a competitive inhibitor of m-aconitase and that this effect occurs only with citrate as substrate. Whether free zinc or a zinc-citrate complex competes with citrate for the enzyme active site is unknown at this time. Zinc inhibition was achieved under conditions in which the molar ratio of zinc to citrate was as low as 0.01 (for the purified enzyme). Such conditions would result in free citrate = 99.3% and zinc-citrate chelate = 0.7%. For a zinc-citrate chelate to be the competitive inhibitor form would require that the chelate has an extremely high affinity binding to the enzyme. Moreover, if a zinc-citrate complex competed with free citrate for the active site of the enzyme, one might expect that c-aconitase as well as m-aconitase might be inhibited, which is not the case. From knowledge of the structure of m-aconitase as determined by x-ray crystallography, binding of a zinc-citrate chelate to the active site might not be expected because of steric constraints (16Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It is of particular significance to note that Lauble et al. (16Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 437-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Emptage M.H. Beinert H. Stout C.D. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stout, personal communication.Refinement of the structures in which either trans-aconitate or 4-hydroxy-trans-aconitate is bound to the enzyme (16Lauble H. Kennedy M.C. Beinert H. Stout C.D. J. Mol.

Cytosolic aconitase lacks this putative zinc binding site (18Frishman D. Heinz M.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), which might provide an explanation for the absence of zinc inhibition and would indicate a possible site for the inhibitory effect of zinc on m-aconitase. It is apparent that the mechanism of zinc inhibition of m-aconitase will require additional studies with the purified enzyme. In regard to the uniquely limiting m-aconitase activity associated with citrate-producing prostate cells, the present report establishes that the higher levels of mitochondrial zinc that characterize these cells inhibit m-aconitase activity and subsequent citrate oxidation. In contrast, the endogenous zinc concentration of kidney (nonprostate cells) mitochondrial preparations appears to be too low to exhibit an inhibitory effect on m-aconitase activity. The existence in prostate cells of a limiting m-aconitase activity is a unique relationship, since m-aconitase generally is not considered to be a limiting and regulating enzyme in the pathway of citrate metabolism of mammalian cells. However prostate cells have the unique function of producing and secreting high levels of citrate. The inhibition of the citrate →cis-aconitate reaction minimizes citrate oxidation and provides the most efficient metabolic step to optimize net citrate production. This relationship also provides an explanation for the high citrate/isocitrate ratio (30–40 to 1), which characterizes the prostate. Moreover, testosterone and prolactin regulate citrate oxidation of prostate epithelial cells by altering the level of mitochondrial zinc, which in turn altered the m-aconitase activity (5Costello L.C. Liu Y. Franklin R.B. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 112: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Liu Y. Costello L.C. Franklin R.B.

Consequently it is evident that zinc plays a key role in regulating m-aconitase activity and subsequent citrate oxidation of prostate epithelial cells. These relationships are of particular significance in prostate cancer. In contrast to the high citrate and zinc content of normal human prostate, prostate cancer tissue contains very low citrate and zinc levels that are similar to the levels typically associated with most normal soft tissue (1Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 18: 25-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 2Costello L.C. Franklin R.B. Prostate. 1991; 19: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Costello L.C.

CRC Press, Inc., New York1997: 115-150Google Scholar). Whereas normal human prostate epithelial cells are citrate-producing cells, malignant prostate epithelial cells are citrate-oxidizing cells. These relationships coupled with the current results of this study provide compelling evidence 1) that m-aconitase activity is not limited in malignant prostate cells, thereby permitting the typical oxidation of citrate via the Krebs cycle, and 2) that the malignant cells contain a low level of mitochondrial zinc, which alleviates the inhibition of the m-aconitase activity. This concept warrants further investigation and will be important for understanding the metabolic implications in the pathogenesis and treatment of prostate cancer.

https://openalex.org/W2081113306,"μ opioid receptors are subject to phosphorylation and desensitization through actions of at least two distinct biochemical pathways: agonist-dependent μ receptor phosphorylation and desensitization induced by a biochemically distinct second pathway dependent on protein kinase C activation (1). To better understand the nature of the agonist-induced μ receptor phosphorylation events, we have investigated the effects of a variety of opiate ligands of varying potencies and intrinsic activities on μ receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. Exposure to the potent full agonists sufentanil, dihydroetorphine, etorphine, etonitazine, and [d-Ala2, MePhe4, Glyol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) led to strong receptor phosphorylation, while methadone,<i>l</i>-α-acetylmethadone (LAAM), morphine, meperidine, DADL, β-endorphin<sub>(1–31)</sub>, enkephalins, and dynorphin A<sub>(1–17)</sub> produced intermediate effects. The partial agonist buprenorphine minimally enhanced receptor phosphorylation while antagonists failed to alter phosphorylation. Buprenorphine and full antagonists each antagonized the enhanced μ receptor phosphorylation induced by morphine or DAMGO. The rank order of opiate ligand efficacies in producing μ receptor-mediated functional desensitization generally paralleled their rank order of efficacies in producing receptor phosphorylation. Interestingly, the desensitization and phosphorylation mediated by methadone and LAAM were disproportionate to their efficacies in two distinct test systems. This generally good fit between the efficacies of opiates in μ receptor activation, phosphorylation, and desensitization supports the idea that activated receptor/agonist/G-protein complexes and/or receptor conformational changes induced by agonists are required for agonist-induced μ receptor phosphorylation. Data for methadone and LAAM suggest possible contribution from their enhanced desensitizing abilities to their therapeutic efficacies."

Heteromultimeric assembly is probably used for creating a diversity of H+-gated cation channels acting as neuronal acid sensors in different pH ranges. H+-gated cation channels are ligand-gated ion channels activated by the simplest possible ligand, the proton. In nociceptive neurons those channels are thought to be responsible for the sensation of pain that accompanies tissue acidosis (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol.

We have recently cloned a proton-gated cation channel (ASIC,acid sensing ionchannel 1) (4Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The closest structural homologue of ASIC is MDEG (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol.

Upon the same mutations that in Caenorhabditis elegans degenerins induce degeneration of specific neurons (7Chalfie M. Wolinsky E.

In addition, native MDEG also behaves as a H+-gated Na+ channel. The variety of H+-gated cation channels with different ion selectivities, pH dependencies, and kinetics described in sensory neurons (1Bevan S. Yeats J. J. Physiol.

Neurobiol. 1994; 43: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggests that ASIC and MDEG are probably only the first two members of this novel ion channel family and that other genes for new H+-activated Na+ channels remain to be discovered. However, the existence of different genes is probably only one of the ways used to create a diversity of H+-gated cation channels. Many other types of ion channels are known to form heteromultimers of structurally related subunits, resulting in the assembly of channels with novel properties (11Barnard E.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, other structural homologues of the ASIC and MDEG channels, such as the epithelial amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel (12Canessa C.M. Schild L. Buell G. Thorens B. Gautschi I.

Bioessays. 1996; 18: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), require heteromultimeric subunit assembly for their function. All these considerations taken together suggest that new channels might be formed by heteromultimers of ASIC and MDEG subunits. This paper provides both electrophysiological and biochemical evidence that ASIC, together with MDEG, form heteromultimeric channels with properties distinct from those of the parental subunits. Experiments were performed on adult Wistar rats by using standard procedures (4Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Brains were fixed in ice-cold 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer solution (PBS, 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. pH 7.4) for 8 h and then immersed overnight at 4 °C in a 20% sucrose/PBS solution. Frozen sections (10 μm) were cut on a cryostat (Leica) at −25 °C, collected on 3-aminopropylethoxysilane-coated slides and stored at −20 °C until use. Four antisense oligonucleotides, complementary to the rat cDNA sequences of ASIC and MDEG, were used to detect ASIC and MDEG transcripts, respectively. The sequences of the oligonucleotides were: ASIC, 5′-GGTGTAGAAGAGGATACTCGCCGACAGAGACTTC-3′ or 5′-AACAGACACCACTCTTTCCTCAGAACTGGTATCTCAGGA-3′ and MDEG, 5′-ATGAGCACCTGTGACACAATGCCAAACCAC3′ or 5′-GTCTACATGTTTCGTGGACGTACGTACGAGTCTGAAGAATGTCGC-3′. Probes were 3′-end-labeled with [α-33P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Radiochemicals) by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Sections were treated consecutively with 0.1 m glycine in PBS for 10 min, PBS for 3 min, 5 μg/ml proteinase K diluted in 0.1m Tris, 50 mm EDTA (pH 8.0) for 15 min at 37 °C, 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS (pH 7.2) for 5 min. Slides were then rinsed 10 min in PBS, acetylated for 10 min in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine, and dehydrated. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 37 °C in hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 500 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, 1% Denhardt, 5% Sarcosyl, 250 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm NaPO4 in 2 × SSC, and the radiolabeled probe (0.2 ng/ml, 8 × 108 dpm/μg)). After hybridization, slides were washed in 1 × SSC at room temperature for 30 min before dehydration, drying, and exposure to Hyperfilm-βmax (Amersham Corp.) for 6 days. Slides were then dipped in Ilford K5 nuclear emulsion (diluted 1:1 with water) and exposed 4 weeks. Sections were then stained with cresyl violet and coverslipped. The specificity of labeling was verified by cold displacement of the radioactive probe with a 500-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide and by the use of two specific oligonucleotide probes for each subunit complementary to nonconserved regions in either the coding or the noncoding sequences of the cDNAs. Primers were designed to add the FlagM2 epitope (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys) (Eastman Kodak Co.) to the NH2 terminus of MDEG and the T7tag epitope (Met-Ala-Ser-Met-Thr-Gly-Gly-Gln-Gln-Met-Gly) (Novagen) to the NH2 terminus of ASIC. The tagged ASIC and MDEG coding sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned in the pVL 1393 vector (PharMingen). SF9 cells were transformed with either pVL-ASIC-T7tag or pVL-MDEG-Flag vector, and recombinant baculovirus was isolated according to the “baculoGold” protocol (PharMingen). 7 × 106 SF9 cells were infected with 108 recombinant baculovirus particles (ASIC-T7tag, MDEG-Flag, or both). Four days later, cells were harvested, washed in PBS, sonicated at 4 °C in solubilization buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0, 1% desoxycholate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm iodoacetamide) and subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 80,000 × g. An aliquot of the supernatant containing 50 μg of protein was incubated overnight with 10 μl of M2 anti-Flag mouse monoclonal antibody immobilized on Sepharose (Eastman Kodak Co.). After a 30 s 8000 × g spin, the supernatant was saved and the pellet was washed six times in 500 μl of solubilization buffer and twice with PBS. Both supernatant and pellet were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (9% acrylamide) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C extra Amersham). The blots were saturated 30 min with TBST (10 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0, 1% Tween 20) containing 4% BSA, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either M2 anti-Flag antibody (anti MDEG-Flag) or anti-T7tag monoclonal antibody (anti-ASIC-T7tag) in TBST containing 2% BSA. After 5 washes with TBST, the blots were incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunotech) 1:10,000 in TBST containing 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, washed with TBST and revealed using a substrate for enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, Pierce). Oocytes were injected with 0.1 or 0.25 ng of cRNA and microelectrode voltage-clamp and patch-clamp recordings were performed two days after injection. For outside-out patch the pipettes contained: 140 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) (with KOH). The bath medium contained: 140 mm NaCl (or 140 mm LiCl or 140 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride), 2 mmMgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) (adjusted with HCl, NaOH, LiOH, or tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide). Rapid pH changes from the initial pH of 7.4 were produced by rapid perfusion with bath solution adjusted to the pH values indicated in Figs. 2, 3, 4. Data were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 500 Hz for analysis (Biopatch software).Figure 3Selectivity and single channel conductance of the ASIC/MDEG channel.

The highest expression levels were detected in the olfactory bulb, neo and allocortical regions, dentate granule cells, as well as in pyramidal cells of CA1–CA3 subfields of the hippocampal formation, habenula, basolateral amygdaloid nuclei, and in the Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellum. A diffuse expression was observed over most other regions of the basal ganglia, including thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, striatum and globus pallidus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons, and medulla. ASIC and MDEG transcripts were expressed at low levels in choroid plexus. Coexpression of both transcripts in the same type of neurons was observed in all regions of gray matter, which are strongly labeled. Fig. 1 A, panels c–d, show an example of the high degree of colocalization of ASIC and MDEG in the Purkinje and granule cells of the cerebellar cortex. These results are consistent with observations made by others (22Garcia-Añoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). This colocalization led us to analyze whether MDEG and ASIC could interact to form a proton-activated channel and whether this new channel had different properties from those of the parental subunits expressed alone. The direct demonstration of an association of ASIC and MDEG was obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments. ASIC and MDEG were tagged with short epitopes (“T7tag™” and “Flag™”) introduced at their NH2 terminus. The tagged proteins ASIC-tag and MDEG-Flag were expressed either alone or coexpressed in SF9 cells using a baculovirus system. Electrophysiological analysis of the infected cells was carried out to show that the introduction of the epitope does not alter the channel properties (data not shown). The detergent solubilized membranes of SF9 cells expressing either ASIC-tag or MDEG-Flag or both subunits were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Flag(MDEG) antibody, and both the immunoprecipitated fractions and the supernatants were analyzed by Western blot. Analysis of the blots with the anti-Flag(MDEG) antibody (Fig. 1 B, top panel) revealed that at least 50% of MDEG-Flag was immunoprecipitated (lane 2) and that the anti-Flag(MDEG) antibody did not cross-react with ASIC-tag (lane 1). We then incubated the same blots with an anti-tag(ASIC) antibody (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel) to analyze whether immunoprecipitation of MDEG-Flag caused coprecipitation of ASIC-tag. The anti-tag(ASIC) antibody did not cross-react with MDEG-Flag, since a signal was only obtained with samples that contained ASIC-tag. When both ASIC-tag and MDEG-Flag were co-expressed in the same cells, immunoprecipitation with the anti-Flag(MDEG) antibody caused co-precipitation of ASIC-tag (lane 3), indicating that ASIC-tag associates with MDEG-Flag to form a heteromultimeric channel. The heteromultimeric association occurs in vivo and not after solubilization of the cells. No co-immunoprecipitation of ASIC-tag by the anti-Flag(MDEG) antibody was found when we used a mixture of membranes from cells expressing either ASIC-tag or MDEG-Flag (lane 4, bottom panel). Both ASIC (4Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar) and MDEG (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) expressed in Xenopus laevisoocytes form amiloride-sensitive H+-gated cation channels that are activated transiently when the extracellular pH drops (4Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). 2Lingueglia, E., de Weille, J. R., Bassilana, F., Heurteaux, C., Sakai, H., and Waldmann, R. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, in press. The ASIC and the MDEG channels have different inactivation kinetics, ion selectivities, and pH dependencies (Figs. 2, B, E, and F, and 3E). Coexpression of both ASIC and MDEG yields an amiloride-sensitive H+-gated current (Fig. 2 A) with single exponential inactivation kinetics that are intermediate between those of the ASIC and the MDEG current (Fig.2, E and F) instead of the biphasic kinetics that would be expected for two independent homomultimeric channels. The pH dependence of the H+-activated current obtained after coexpression of ASIC and MDEG (Fig. 2 B) is less steep than with either subunit alone and the pH at which half-maximal activation occurs (pH0.5 = 4.8) is situated between that obtained with ASIC (pH0.5 = 6.2) or MDEG (pH0.5 ≤ 4.1) alone. Besides, the pH dependence curve of the ASIC/MDEG channel is monophasic, while a biphasic curve is expected for independent equimolar expression of the two subunits (Fig. 2 B, dashed line). The channel formed after coexpression of ASIC and MDEG is less selective for Na+ versus K+than either the ASIC or the MDEG channel (Fig.3, A, B, and E), suggesting that most of the channel activity recorded in oocytes expressing both ASIC and MDEG is due to a heteromultimeric channel. Amiloride blocks the ASIC/MDEG channel as it blocks ASIC and MDEG activity (Fig. 2, C and D). TheK 0.5 value for this inhibition is 20 μm. The single channel conductance of the ASIC/MDEG channel is 10 picosiemens (Fig. 3, C andD). Substitution of an alanine just before the second putative transmembrane domain of the degenerin MEC-4 of the nematode C. elegans by bulky amino acids, such as phenylalanine or valine, causes degeneration of mechanosensitive neurons (23Hong K. Driscoll M. Nature. 1994; 367: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This phenotype was proposed to be due to a gain-of-function of a putative stretch-activated channel composed of three subunits, MEC-4, MEC-6, and MEC-10 (19Huang M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1994; 367: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Mutation of the corresponding amino acid (Gly430) in MDEG also causes constitutive activity and cell death (5Waldmann R. Champigny G. Voilley N. Lauritzen I. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10433-10434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We initially reported that identical mutations (Gly431 → Val or → Phe) introduced into ASIC do not cause constitutive channel activity (4Waldmann R. Champigny G. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1997; 386: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). However a more exhaustive study of the amiloride-insensitive basal currents of ASIC Gly431 mutants revealed a low constitutive channel activity for G431V or a larger activity for the G431F mutant (Fig.4, A and B). These constitutive channels were not inhibited by 1 mm amiloride (not shown) and have a reversal potential (E rev) of +30 mV for G431V and +15 mV for the G431F mutant (Fig.4 B). Responses to external H+ were also markedly altered by mutations. Increases in H+ concentrations did not induce any channel activation of the G431V mutant and they decreased the amplitude of the constitutive current of the G431F mutant (Fig. 4 D). ASIC(G431V) and ASIC(G431F) were found to greatly alter the properties of MDEG (Fig. 4, C, D, andE). Coexpression of the ASIC mutant G431V with MDEG inX. laevis oocytes induced an amiloride-insensitive nonselective current (Fig. 4, A and C) with an intensity which is much higher than the sum of MDEG or ASIC(G431V) currents (Fig. 4 A), indicating that a novel heteromultimeric channel has been formed by association of both subunits. Extracellular acidification from pH 7.4 to below pH 7 further activated the ASIC(G431V)/MDEG (pH0.5 = 6.2) or ASIC(G431F)MDEG (pH0.5 = 5.8) channels (Fig. 4, D andE). Since the mutant subunits ASIC(G431V) and ASIC(G431F) cannot form proton-activated channels by themselves, and since the activation of MDEG requires an extracellular acidification to pH values lower than 5 (Fig. 4E), the proton activated current recorded at pH values above pH 5.5 in oocytes co-expressing ASIC(G431V) or ASIC(G431F) together with MDEG can only be explained by the formation of a heteromultimeric channel. Like many other ligand-gated cation channels, such as the ionotropic glutamate and purinergic receptors (11Barnard E.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 305-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ASIC as well as MDEG subunits can form both homomultimeric and heteromultimeric channels. The formation of heteromultimeric channels with novel properties augments the repertory of H+-gated channels and introduces new possibilities of regulation. For example, ASIC displays a consensus site for protein kinase A phosphorylation in position 474 and two consensus sites for protein kinase C phosphorylation in positions 40 and 497. Association with MDEG introduces a new consensus site for protein kinase C in position 39. Interestingly H+-gated cation currents with kinetics and pH dependencies similar to those of the heteromultimeric ASIC/MDEG channel were recorded in brain neurons (24Ueno S. Nakaye T. Akaike N. J. Physiol. (Lond .). 1992; 447: 309-327Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Rapid acidic pH transients accompany synaptic activity and were proposed to be involved in neuromodulation (25Krishtal O.A. Osipchuk Y.V. Shelest T.N. Smirnoff S.V. Brain Res. 1987; 436: 352-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Chesler M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 401-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that H+-gated cation channels present in neurons, such as ASIC and MDEG, but also the heteromultimeric ASIC/MDEG channels, have a mediatory role between extracellular acidic transients and changes in neuronal excitability.

https://openalex.org/W2009742151,"The rapid decrease of a response to a persistent stimulus, often termed desensitization, is a widespread biological phenomenon. Signal transduction by numerous G protein-coupled receptors appears to be terminated by a strikingly uniform two-step mechanism, most extensively characterized for the beta2-adrenergic receptor (beta2AR), m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (m2 mAChR), and rhodopsin. The model predicts that activated receptor is initially phosphorylated and then tightly binds an arrestin protein that effectively blocks further G protein interaction. Here we report that complexes of beta2AR-arrestin and m2 mAChR-arrestin have a higher affinity for agonists (but not antagonists) than do receptors not complexed with arrestin. The percentage of phosphorylated beta2AR in this high affinity state in the presence of full agonists varied with different arrestins and was enhanced by selective mutations in arrestins. The percentage of high affinity sites also was proportional to the intrinsic activity of an agonist, and the coefficient of proportionality varies for different arrestin proteins. Certain mutant arrestins can form these high affinity complexes with unphosphorylated receptors. Mutations that enhance formation of the agonist-receptor-arrestin complexes should provide useful tools for manipulating both the efficiency of signaling and rate and specificity of receptor internalization."

To identify the reaction intermediates that form by the human excision repair nuclease, we adopted three approaches: purification of functional DNA·protein complexes, permanganate footprinting, and the employment as substrate of presumptive DNA reaction intermediates containing unwound sequences 5′ to, 3′ to, or encompassing the DNA lesion. The first detectable reaction intermediate was formed by substrate binding of XPA, RPA, XPC·HHR23B plus TFIIH (preincision complex 1, PIC1). In this complex the DNA was unwound on either side of the lesion by no more than 10 bases. Independent of the XPG nuclease function, the XPG protein stabilized this complex, forming a long lived preincision complex 2 (PIC2). The XPF·ERCC1 complex bound to PIC2, forming PIC3, which led to dual incisions and the release of the excised oligomer. With partially unwound DNAs, thymine cyclobutane dimer was excised at a fast rate independent of XPC·HHR23B, indicating that a major function of this protein is to stabilize the unwound DNA or to aid lesion unwinding in preincision complexes.

In humans, nucleotide excision repair is the sole DNA repair activity for removing bulky adducts. The repair reaction involves two basic steps, damage excision by dual incisions and repair synthesis. Mutations that interfere with damage excision give rise to xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) 1The abbreviations used are: XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; TFIIH, transcription factor IIH; HHR23B, human homolog B of Rad23; ERCC, excision repair cross-complementing; PIC, preincision complex; T[6–4]T, thymine-thymine [6–4] photoproduct; T<>T, cyclobutane thymine dimer; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; TFIIH, transcription factor IIH; HHR23B, human homolog B of Rad23; ERCC, excision repair cross-complementing; PIC, preincision complex; T[6–4]T, thymine-thymine [6–4] photoproduct; T<>T, cyclobutane thymine dimer; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).

XP is genetically heterogeneous; mutations in seven genes, XPA through XPG, may give rise to the disease (see Ref. 2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Important progress has been made in recent years in understanding the molecular basis of XP and the roles of XP proteins in nucleotide excision repair. These studies have culminated in reconstitution of repair activity in vitro using purified repair proteins (for review, see Refs. 3Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

From these biochemical experiments it was concluded that the minimal set for damage removal activity (i.e. excision nuclease) is composed of six repair factors. They are XPA, TFIIH (which includes XPB and XPD), XPC·HHR23B, XPG, XPF·ERCC1, and RPA (5Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

In addition to identifying all of the proteins for excision nuclease activity, recent studies have also characterized the individual repair factors and their interactions with one another and with DNA in considerable detail.

In addition to these functional properties of the repair factors, protein-protein interactions among the various factors have been investigated. XPA binds to XPF·ERCC1 (26Li L. Elledge S.J.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5396-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). These structural and functional properties of the repair factors have led to the proposal of models on assembly and catalysis by excision nuclease. However, no specific intermediates have been detected with either gel retardation or footprinting techniques in support of the reaction mechanism models. In this investigation, we set out to study the events taking place from the damage recognition step to the release of the damage in an oligonucleotide. Specifically, we wished to detect the excision reaction intermediates of repair protein-DNA complexes and the conformation of DNA within these complexes. Using a biotin-tagged substrate and purified repair factors, we show that the first protein-DNA complex detectable by the streptavidin pull-down assay requires XPA, RPA, XPC·HHR23B, and TFIIH proteins as well as ATP hydrolysis. This complex is termed Preincision Complex 1 (PIC1). PIC1 is relatively unstable and forms a tighter, more stable complex called Preincision Complex 2 (PIC2) in the presence of XPG, even when XPG has lost its 3′-junction nuclease activity because of an active-site mutation. XPF·ERCC1 does not bind to PIC1, but it does bind to PIC2 containing either wild-type or mutant XPG. We call the complex that forms with all six repair factors PIC3. When PIC3 contains the active-site mutant XPG, only the 5′-incision is made by this complex (31Wakasugi M. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16030-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, when the complex is formed with wild-type XPG, it immediately leads to dual incision and release of the excised oligomer of 24–32 nucleotides in length. Permanganate footprinting reveals that in PIC1, the DNA is unwound on both sides of the lesion by 5–10 nucleotides. In PIC2, the unwound region remains the same length as in PIC1 but becomes more stable. PIC3 does not promote further unwinding but leads to dual incisions that expose a 24–32-nucleotide region in the strand complementary to the damaged strand to permanganate modification. Using model substrates containing mispaired DNA 3′, 5′ or 3′ and 5′ to the lesion, it was confirmed that lesion unwinding is on the reaction pathway and that the main function of XPC·HHR23B is to aid in DNA unwinding.

Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16030-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We used a 136-base pair duplex with a T[6–4]T photoproduct. The complete nucleotide sequence of the T[6–4]T substrate is identical to the T[6–4]T substrate employed previously (34Mu D. Tursun M. Duckett D.R. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) except that the 5′-terminal guanine of the T[6–4]T-containing strand was replaced by a cytosine in this study. The oligonucleotide containing a site-specific photoproduct (5′-GTAT[6–4]TATG-3′) was provided by X. Zhao and was prepared by the method of Smith and Taylor (35Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11143-11151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This oligomer was 5′-phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (7,000 Ci/mmol, ICN) using T4 kinase and annealed with other five partially overlapping oligonucleotides. After ligation, the full-length 136-mer with an internal 32P label at the fourth phosphodiester bond 5′ to T[6–4]T was purified through an 8% denaturing and a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Since the substrate has a protruding guanine and a cytosine at either 3′-end, dGTP and biotinylated dCTP were used to fill in the one-base protruding ends, resulting in the biotinylation of the 3′-terminus of the T[6–4]T-containing strand. Subsequently, the biotinylated substrate DNA was incubated with streptavidin covalently linked to magnetic beads (Dynabead M-280, Dynal) and became linked to magnetic beads. Following pulling down using a magnet, the substrate was ready for the pull-down experiments. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the pull-down experiments were initiated by incubating a subset of the six excision nucleases constituents and the magnetic bead-attached substrate (50 fmol) in 25 μl of excision reaction buffer (30 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) with or without 2 mm ATP at 30 °C for 60 min. The substrate DNA was then pulled down by holding a magnet beneath the reaction vial and washed twice with 100 μl of excision reaction buffer containing 2 mm ATP to remove loosely bound proteins. The washed DNA pellet was then resuspended in 25 μl of excision reaction buffer with 2 mm ATP containing the repair proteins that were omitted in the first pull-down incubation and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. To examine if dual incisions had occurred in this second incubation, the reaction mixture was deproteinized, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed using an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The protocol of permanganate footprint method was adapted from Refs. 36Borowiec J.A. Zhang L. Sasse-Dwight S. Gralla J.D. J. Mol.

The 5′-terminally 32P-labeled T[6–4]T substrate was incubated with the indicated amounts of repair proteins at 30 °C for 60 min in excision reaction buffer with 2 mm ATP in a total volume of 25 μl. Subsequently, KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 5 mm. After 1 min at room temperature, β-mercaptoethanol was supplemented to 1 m to stop the permanganate reaction. Following deproteinization by proteinase K and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was resuspended in 50 μl of 1 m piperidine and incubated at 90 °C for 10 min. After evaporation under vacuum to remove piperidine, the permanganate-modified thymines were revealed by resolving the DNA products on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Internally 32P-labeled bubble substrates containing T<>T were synthesized as described by Mu and Sancar (25Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7570-7573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The 32P label was in the fourth phosphodiester bond 5′ to the photodimer. The sequences of oligonucleotides 1–7 (as indicated in Fig. 9 A) used to construct the substrates have been published (25Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Individual repair proteins or combinations of them were mixed with a magnetic bead-linked substrate, and then the DNA and DNA-bound proteins were isolated using a magnet. To the purified DNA·protein complexes, the remaining repair factors were added, and repair was measured by the excision assay. In preliminary experiments we failed to isolate complexes with one to three repair factors and proceeded to conduct experiments with combinations of four and five repair factors. We were able to isolate complexes with four and five repair factors which we named Preincision Complex 1 and 2, respectively. These complexes are most likely on the pathway for formation of excision nuclease complex because they can lead to dual incisions upon encountering the missing components. Results of pull-down experiments conducted with two factor omissions are shown in Fig. 2. As apparent the only two-factor omission that produced a nucleoprotein complex purifiable by the pull-down assay is the one formed in the absence of XPF·ERCC1 and XPG proteins (Fig. 2, lane 2). All other pull-down experiments involving pairwise omissions of repair factors failed to produce excision products (data not shown). The formation of this complex (named PIC1) with XPA, RPA, XPC·HHR23B, and TFIIH is ATP-dependent (compare lanes 2 and3). Most importantly, the addition of the XPG and XPF·ERCC1 nucleases to buffer-washed PIC1 resulted in the dual incision typical of human excision nuclease, indicating that the first four factors formed a structure conducive to assembly of active excision nuclease. Hence it is reasonable to conclude that the complex formed with these four repair factors is on the pathway to dual incision. Previously, we reported that with the pull-down assay a preincision complex could be isolated from an XPF mutant cell extract, which upon incubation with purified XPF·ERCC1 protein led to excision of damage (6Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). However, pull-down experiments with a rodent XP-G mutant cell extract failed to yield a productive preincision complex, suggesting a role for XPG in the preincision events (6Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This previous result with the rodent XP-G mutant cell extract seemed to be contradictory with the present data shown in Fig. 2 (lane 2), which indicates that a productive preincision complex (i.e. PIC1) can be formed in the absence of both XPG and XPF·ERCC1. Hence, we conducted single factor omission experiments using purified proteins. The results in Fig. 2 (lane 4) show that in the absence of XPF·ERCC1, a productive complex (designated PIC2) must have been pulled down from the mixture of XPA, RPA, TFIIH, XPC·HHR23B, and XPG so that its subsequent encounter with purified XPF·ERCC1 led to damage excision. The excision was not caused by nonspecific association of repair factors with substrate DNA because all other single omission experiments failed to give dual incisions under these conditions (see Fig. 3). As in the case of PIC1, the formation of this second preincision complex, PIC2, was also ATP-dependent (data not shown). In light of the results of the pull-down experiments using purified proteins, it is very likely that PIC1 may have been pulled down from the rodent XP-G mutant cell extract. Since in that study only the purified XPG protein was added back to the buffer-washed PIC1 (6Mu D. Hsu D.S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8285-8294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), dual incisions failed to occur because of the absence of XPF·ERCC1 in the second incubation. Significantly, comparison of the excision signals in XPG/XPF·ERCC1 and XPF·ERCC1 omission experiments shown in Fig. 2 and in repeated experiments conducted under identical conditions indicated that the excision signal obtained with PIC2 is much stronger than that obtained with PIC1. The most likely explanation is that PIC2 is more stable than PIC1 and better survives the repeated washes during pull-down so that upon addition of the omitted factor efficient excision takes place. This interpretation was supported by the experiments that probed the structure of DNA within these complexes as described below. The dependence of formation of PIC1 and PIC2 on ATP and the fact that TFIIH has helicase activity (15Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Chambon P. Egly J.M.

Hence, we probed the DNA for unwinding within these complexes by KMnO4 treatment, which oxidizes unpaired thymines and renders them cleavable by alkali treatment. The substrate was a duplex of 136 base pairs with a centrally located T[6–4]T and a terminal radiolabel in the complementary strand. Fig.4 indicates the positions of Ts near the lesion in both strands, and Fig.5 A shows the results of permanganate probing of PIC1. In the absence of any repair factor both T(+1) and T(−1) were slightly reactive with permanganate, consistent with previous reports that T[6–4]T photoproducts unwind DNA in the immediate vicinity of the lesion (38Taylor J.-S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1994; 27: 76-82Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 39Kim J.-K. Patel D. Choi B.-S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1995; 62: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Upon incubation of substrate with XPA, RPA, and XPC·HHR23B, the three factors that have been implicated in damage recognition (3Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar, 4Wood R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 135-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 24Reardon J.T. Mu D. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19451-19456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), no additional hypersensitive sites appeared. This indicates that complexes that form with these factors do not substantially disrupt the duplex. In contrast, when TFIIH was included, the DNA was unwound in both directions as evidenced by permanganate hypersensitivity extending to T(+4) and T(−5) and by the enhanced sensitivity at T(+1) and T(−1) (Fig. 5 A, lane 5). This unwinding was not caused by the nonspecific helicase action of TFIIH binding to the partially unwound T[6–4]T and enlarging it by the dual (3′ to 5′ and 5′ to 3′) helicase activities because the unwinding required XPA, RPA, and XPC·HHR23B in addition to TFIIH (Fig. 5 A, lanes 6–8). The reaction also required ATP hydrolysis because it was inhibited by ATPγS; hence the unwinding had the characteristics of helicase action (lane 9). As expected, the combination of the four repair factors had no effect on the undamaged DNA control (lanes 11 and 12). Together these data lead us to conclude that XPA, RPA, XPC·HHR23B, and TFIIH make a specific complex with damaged DNA and unwind it around the lesion in both 5′ and 3′ directions more than 5 base pairs but less than 10 base pairs.Figure 5Unwinding of T[6–4]T in PIC1 is dependent on XPA, RPA, XPC·HHR23B, TFIIH, and ATP. Panel A, mixtures of XPA (20 ng), RPA (250 ng), and XPC·HHR23B (10 ng) were incubated with increasing amounts of TFIIH (lane 2, 0 ng; lane 3, 0.5 ng; lane 4, 3 ng; lane 5, 6 ng), and the T[6–4]T substrate (50 fmol) containing a 32P label at the 5′-terminus of the undamaged strand in 25 μl of excision reaction buffer with 2 mm ATP. After incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, unpaired thymines were probed using the permanganate chemical footprinting method. Lanes 5–8 contained 6 ng of TFIIH. In lane 9, the nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, ATPγS, was added to the reaction mixture to a final concentration of 2 mm before permanganate treatment. A Maxam-Gilbert purine sequencing ladder of the substrate DNA is shown in lane 10. The thymines reactive with permanganate are indicated with open circles and those immediately external to the reactive thymines byclosed circles. The permanganate probing experiment was performed with an unmodified substrate DNA of the same nucleotide sequence (lanes 11 and 12) under the indicated conditions. Panel B, diagram showing the “repair bubble” in PIC1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the excision assay suggests that PIC2 is more stable in PIC1, we wished to learn about the structure of the DNA in this complex. Under optimal conditions for formation of PIC1, we did not detect any effect of XPG (which defines the PIC2) on DNA sensitivity to permanganate. However, upon carrying out the KMnO4 reaction with limiting amounts of TFIIH, a clear XPG effect was observed. As shown in Fig.6 both T(+4) and T−5) became more sensitive to KMnO4 oxidation with increasing concentrations of XPG. However, even with the highest concentrations of XPG used, the extent of unwinding in PIC2 was indistinguishable from that in PIC1. It thus appears that PIC1 is less stable than PIC2 and that by using high concentration of TFIIH, the equilibrium is shifted toward fully unwound conformation. The presence of XPG in the complex stabilizes it, possibly through its interaction with TFIIH (5Mu D. Park C.-H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of target proteins as well as 14-3-3 are important for protein-protein interactions. Here, we describe the purification of a protein kinase from porcine brain that phosphorylates 14-3-3 ζ on Thr-233. This protein kinase has been identified as casein kinase Iα (CKIα) by peptide mapping analysis and sequencing. Among mammalian 14-3-3, only 14-3-3 τ possesses a phosphorylatable residue at the same position (Ser-233), and we show that this residue is also phosphorylated by CKI. In addition, we show that 14-3-3 ζ is exclusively phosphorylated on Thr-233 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The residue 233 is located within a region shown to be important for the association of 14-3-3 to target proteins. We showed previously that, in 293 cells, only the unphosphorylated form of 14-3-3 ζ associates with the regulatory domain of c-Raf. We have now shown thatin vivo phosphorylation of 14-3-3 ζ at the CKIα site (Thr-233) negatively regulates its binding to c-Raf, and may be important in Raf-mediated signal transduction. 14-3-3 proteins mediate interactions between proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation.

The name 14-3-3 was given to an abundant mammalian brain protein family due to its particular migration pattern on two-dimensional DEAE-cellulose chromatography and starch gel electrophoresis (1Aitken A.

Seven mammalian forms of 14-3-3 (β, γ, ε, τ, η, ζ, and ς) have been found, and two are specifically expressed in T cells (τ) and epithelial cells (ς). The 14-3-3 family is highly conserved, and individual proteins are either identical or contain a few conservative substitutions over a wide range of mammalian species. All are dimeric proteins with a pI around 4.5 and a subunit mass of 30–33 kDa. Homologues of 14-3-3 proteins have also been found in a broad range of eukaryotic organisms. Although the exact function of 14-3-3 is not known, various biological activities have been ascribed for 14-3-3: activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases (2Ichimura T. Isobe T. Okuyama T.

New findings have suggested many additional roles for the 14-3-3 family, in particular mediating interactions between components involved in intracellular signal transduction (7Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The discovery of the interaction of specific 14-3-3 proteins with Raf (3Aitken A. Trends Biochem.

Whether 14-3-3 directly activates Raf is still controversial, and activation of Raf by 14-3-3 may in fact be due to stabilization rather than stimulation of Raf activity (10Morrison D. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that dimerization may provide a mechanism for Raf activation (11Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M.

Since different signaling proteins have been shown to associate with distinct 14-3-3 isoforms, heterodimeric 14-3-3 could act as a scaffold protein to mediate the formation of protein complexes. Indeed, it has been shown that Raf can form a complex with Bcr (23Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or A20 (24Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J.

Nature. 1995; 376: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) showed they are highly helical proteins, and the dimer forms a large negatively charged channel, the interior of which contains residues that are almost invariant throughout the family. The specificity of interaction of each 14-3-3 protein with diverse target proteins may involve the outer surface of the protein. 14-3-3 dimerization has been shown to be essential for target binding (17Liu Y.-C.

In addition, phosphatase treatment of Raf-1 and Bcr inhibits their associations with 14-3-3 in vitro (33Michaud N.R. Fabian J.R. Mathes K.D. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Analysis of the major phosphorylation site of Raf has led to the identification of a novel sequence motif RSXSP XP (where SP is phosphoserine) that may represent a conserved interaction sequence within 14-3-3-binding proteins (34Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1186) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 ζ was shown to be phosphorylated in human embryonic kidney cells, and only the unphosphorylated form bound to the N-terminal regulatory domain of Raf (35Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the phosphorylation of 14-3-3 may also play an important role in the regulation of protein complex formation, and therefore in signal transduction. Other 14-3-3 isoforms have been shown to be phosphorylated. 14-3-3 τ is phosphorylated on Ser residues and on Ser/Tyr residues in vivo by the kinase activities of Bcr and Bcr-Abl, respectively (19Reuther G.W. Fu H. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Pendergast A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 ζ also binds to Bcr, but is not phosphorylated (19Reuther G.W. Fu H. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Pendergast A.M. Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 14-3-3 β, ζ, and τ are phosphorylated in vitro by a sphingosine-dependent kinase (36Megidish T. White T. Takio K. Titani K. Igarashi Y. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In all cases described above, the phosphorylation sites in 14-3-3 were not identified. In addition, some 14-3-3 forms are phosphorylated on Ser-64 by protein kinase C at a low stoichiometry (37Toker A. Sellers L.A. Amess B. Patel Y. Harris A. Aitken A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, 14-3-3 β and ζ are highly phosphorylated in brain on Ser-185 in an SPEK motif, which is a motif unique to these two isoforms (38Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Patel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5706-5709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the regulation of 14-3-3-mediated protein complex formation may be regulated by the ratio of homo- and heterodimers in cells, and by the phosphorylation of 14-3-3 targets as well as the phosphorylation of 14-3-3 itself. Therefore, the identification of the protein kinases that phosphorylate 14-3-3 proteins is important in the study of the role of 14-3-3 in signal transduction. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham.

GST was removed by digestion with thrombin (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature, and 14-3-3 was further purified by FPLC on a MonoQ column (Pharmacia). One mouse brain was homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm NaF, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g, the supernatant was incubated with antibodies against PSTAIRE motif, PCTAIRE-1, PCTAIRE-2, or cdk5. The immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (40Tsai L.-H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E.D. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forin vitro kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed several times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm cold ATP). The washed beads were incubated with kinase buffer containing 2 μg of histone H1 (as control) or 14-3-3 ζ, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were stopped by adding sample buffer, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Pig brains were obtained from Dalehead Foods (Cambridgeshire, UK) and homogenized at 4 °C in buffer A (20 mm MES (pH 6.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. 5 μl aliquots of column fractions or purified CKI were added to a solution of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (8–10 Ci/mmol) containing 1.5 μg of purified 14-3-3, to a final volume of 30 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer and analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and autoradiographed. The labeling of the 14-3-3 kinase with 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP was performed as described (41Varela I. Nimmo H.G. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 261-26543Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with some modifications. An aliquot containing the 14-3-3 kinase was incubated in 50 μl of buffer A (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 5 μCi of 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP (ICN) (with or without 300 μm 8-azido-ATP; Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature prior to irradiation with an ultraviolet lamp at 254 nm. Samples were then analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE after the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and autoradiographed. Phosphorylated 14-3-3 (10–20 μg) was run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE mini-gels. Gel were stained for 5–10 min and then destained for the minimum time. The stained bands were excised and subjected to trypsin (Worthington, TPCK-treated) digestion. The extracts were then dried in a SpeedVac vacuum centrifuge, and made up to the injection volume with water for on-line liquid chromatography MS. Electrospray MS of in gel digested phosphoprotein and solid phase sequencing on arylamine membrane were carried out as described (42Dubois T. Howell S. Amess B. Kerai P. Learmonth M. Madrazo J.

Adenovirus 5E1A/B transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells were grown and transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (35Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). Cells at 80% confluence were transfected with a total amount of 8 μg of DNA from 14-3-3 ζ alone or with Ha-Ras(V12) (35Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (1.5 mCi/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C. Cell lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged 14-3-3 ζ with 9E10 antibodies have been described (35Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). The brain-specific phosphorylation of 14-3-3 β and ζ at the SPEK motif (38Aitken A. Howell S. Jones D. Madrazo J. Patel Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5706-5709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) could be due to a proline-directed kinase such as cyclin-dependent kinase or mitogen activated kinase. Therefore, initial experiments were designed to phosphorylate 14-3-3 ζ by different proline-directed kinases as well as other kinases. Experiments were performed using purified protein kinases or by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies. None of them was able to significantly phosphorylate 14-3-3 ζ in vitro (TableI). We then attempted to purify the protein kinase from mammalian brain and we found that 14-3-3 ζ is phosphorylated in vitro on Thr-233 by a protein kinase (termed “T233 kinase”) present in mammalian brain (42Dubois T. Howell S. Amess B. Kerai P. Learmonth M. Madrazo J. Chaudhri M. Rittinger K. Scarabel M. Soneji Y. Aitken A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify this kinase as casein kinase Iα.Table IIn vitro phosphorylation of 14-3-3 ζ by different protein kinasesKinaseMethodPhosphorylationProline-directed kinases GSK3 α/β = TPK-Ip− cdk5 = TPK-IIIP− Cdc2p− PSTAIRE related proteinsIP− PCTAIRE 1IP− PCTAIRE 2IP− ERK1p− RK (p38)p−Non-proline-directed kinases c-Rafp− B-RafIP− Mosp− MEKKp− MAPKAPp− CK-IIp+/− p90S6 kinase (RSK)p+/− p70S6 kinasep− PKCp+/−Purified protein kinases (p) were used to phosphorylate in vitro recombinant 14-3-3 ζ.

No (−) or a weak (+/−) 14-3-3 phosphorylation was detected with all the kinases tested. All kinases were assayed with appropriate control substrates. Open table in a new tab Purified protein kinases (p) were used to phosphorylate in vitro recombinant 14-3-3 ζ. In some cases, protein kinases were immunoprecipitated (IP) from rat brain before doing an in vitro kinase assay with recombinant 14-3-3 ζ as a substrate. No (−) or a weak (+/−) 14-3-3 phosphorylation was detected with all the kinases tested. All kinases were assayed with appropriate control substrates. No kinase activity toward recombinant 14-3-3 ζ was detectable in crude extract of pig brain (Fig. 1 A,lane T), possibly due to the presence of inhibitors as already shown for several other kinases. The extract (lane T) was loaded on a SP-Sepharose column, and bound proteins were eluted using a salt gradient. Under these conditions, we recovered a kinase activity eluting in fractions 16–18 at 0.35 m NaCl, which phosphorylated 14-3-3 ζ (Fig. 1 A). The kinase activity from the SP-Sepharose was eluted from an Affi-Gel Blue column in fractions 32–42 between 0.6 and 0.8 m NaCl (Fig.1 B). Fractions containing the kinase activity were pooled and chromatographed on a Mono S column. The kinase eluted in fractions 12–14 at 0.55 m NaCl (Fig. 1 C) and was subjected to gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1 D). The absolute levels of kinase activity at each step of chromatography are not known, and no specific activity can be measured because of the high sensitivity of the kinase to salt concentration as shown in Fig. 1,B and C, before (lane b) and after (lane a) dialysis to remove salt. The chromatographic procedures did not lead to a complete purification of the T233 kinase, and a few protein bands remained. Nevertheless, one major protein of 38 kDa was visualized with silver staining (Fig.2 A). Photoaffinity labeling of the kinase using 8-azido-[γ-32P]ATP was performed to establish its molecular weight. This revealed the presence of one radiolabeled band around 40 kDa (Fig. 2 B). TheM r of the kinase after gel filtration was 30–35 kDa (Fig. 1 D). When gel filtration was performed at low (50 mm) NaCl, the kinase eluted from the column with a lower apparent M r, suggesting that some nonspecific interactions with the column occurred (data not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of the kinase activity eluting at an apparentM r of 30–35 kDa from the gel filtration column revealed a phosphorylated band of 40 kDa, corresponding possibly to the autophosphorylated form of the kinase (Fig. 1, B andD). We therefore concluded that the kinase has anM r of 38–40 kDa. The fractions containing the T233 kinase activity from the gel filtration column were then separated on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2 A). The 38-kDa protein band was digested in gel with trypsin, and the mass of each peptide was measured by electrospray mass spectrometry. Analysis of the peptide mass map using the “Peptidesearch” program identified the 38-kDa protein as casein kinase Iα (CKIα) (Fig.3 A). To be certain that the T233 kinase was CKI, and not a copurifying protein kinase, in vitro kinase assays were performed using purified mammalian CKI and recombinant yeast CKI (Fig. 3 B). Both kinases phosphorylated 14-3-3 ζ as well as the positive control proteins,i.e. casein and phosvitin. Moreover, the T233 kinase phosphorylated both the CKI substrates. The residue in 14-3-3 ζ phosphorylated by mammalian and yeast CKI was in both cases identified as Thr-233, since the mutant T233A was not phosphorylated. In human embryonic kidney 293 cells, only one tryptic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of 14-3-3 ζ was phosphorylated (Fig. 4 A). Sequencing of the phosphopeptide revealed that only Thr-233 is phosphorylated (Fig. 4 B). We have previously shown that in these cells only the unphosphorylated form of 14-3-3 ζ bound to Raf (35Rommel C. Radziwill G. Lovric J. Noeldeke J. Heinicke T. Jones D. Aitken A. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 609-619PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, together with the present results, we conclude thatin vivo, when phosphorylated on Thr-233, 14-3-3 ζ does not bind to the N-terminal regulatory domain of c-Raf. Among the mammalian 14-3-3 family, only 14-3-3 τ contains a potential phosphorylatable residue at the same position as 14-3-3 ζ (Table II). When different 14-3-3 isoforms were tested for their ability to be a CKI substratein vitro, only 14-3-3 τ in addition to 14-3-3 ζ was phosphorylated by recombinant yeast CKI (Fig.5 A). The same result was obtained with mammalian CKI (data not shown).Table IIAlignment of all mammalian 14-3-3 proteins around residue 233233βT S E N QεT S D M QςT A D N AγT S D Q QηT S D Q QτT S D S AζT S D T Q120SV40 T AgT A D S QAll mammalian 14-3-3 proteins are aligned around residue 233 phosphorylated in vitro by CKI and in vivo in 14-3-3 ζ.

Mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion of phosphorylated 14-3-3 τ revealed the phosphorylation of only one tryptic peptide and its sequencing showed the phosphorylation of Ser-233 (data not shown). Indeed, the mutant 14-3-3 τ S233A was not phosphorylated by purified mammalian CKI (Fig. 5 B). In conclusion, CKI phosphorylatesin vitro 14-3-3 τ on Ser-233. Proteins of the 14-3-3 family bind in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to several target proteins. This may involve a novel consensus sequence RSXSP XP, where SP is phosphoserine (34Muslin A.J.

However, chitinase expression in an adult insect gut has not been described. Here we report on the initial characterization and cloning of a novel chitinase gene that is expressed specifically in the midgut of adultAnopheles gambiae females. Upon feeding, chitinase is secreted into the gut lumen as an inactive pro-enzyme that is later activated by trypsin. Thus, temporal regulation of chitinase activity is tightly coupled to the temporal pattern of trypsin secretion. The enzyme may play a role in structuring the chitin-containing extracellular peritrophic matrix, whose formation is also induced by feeding. A chitinase cDNA was cloned from a library enriched for gut-specific sequences. The open reading frame encodes a 525-amino acid protein comprised of a putative catalytic domain at the N terminus, a putative chitin-binding domain at the C terminus, and a threonine/serine/proline-rich amino acid stretch in between them. Northern analysis indicates that this chitinase is expressed exclusively in the guts of adult females and not in adult carcasses or in any larval or pupal tissues. The present findings suggest the possibility of using this chitinase as an antigen for a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine.

Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) are endoglycosidases that cleaveN-acetylglucosamine residues in chitin at the C-1–C-4 positions. Chitinases have been found in chitin-containing organisms, such as insects and fungi, and in organisms that do not contain chitin, such as bacteria, plants, and mammals (1Flach J. Pilet P.E. Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1991; 48: 701-716Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 2Escott G.M. Adams D.J. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4770-4773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chitinases in non-chitin-containing organisms may be involved in the defense against chitin-containing pathogens and pests (1Flach J. Pilet P.E. Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1991; 48: 701-716Crossref Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In insects, chitin is the major component of the exoskeleton. During molting, chitinases degrade the chitin in the exoskeleton to facilitate molting. Chitinases in the molting fluid of the tobacco hornworm,Manduca sexta, have been characterized (3Koga D. Mai M.S. Dziadik-Rurner C. Kramer K.J. Insect Biochem. 1982; 12: 493-499Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Koga D. Jilka J. Kramer K.J.

Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A chitinase from the venom of the wasp Chelonus sp. near curimaculatushas also been cloned (7Krishnan A. Nair P.N. Jones D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20971-20976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear what function this chitinase may have. In addition to the exoskeleton, chitin is also an important component of the insect peritrophic matrix (PM). 1The abbreviations used are: PM, peritrophic matrix; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: PM, peritrophic matrix; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s). The PM is a sleeve-like extracellular layer that surrounds the food bolus in the gut of most arthropods (8Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar, 9Jacobs-Lorena M. Oo M.M. Beaty B.J. Marquardt W.C.

Biology of the Insect Midgut: The Peritrophic Matrix. Chapman & Hall, London1996: 86-108Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to chitin, the PM contains proteins and proteoglycans (8Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar, 9Jacobs-Lorena M. Oo M.M.

Billingsley P.F. Biology of the Insect Midgut: The Peritrophic Matrix. Chapman & Hall, London1996: 86-108Crossref Google Scholar). The function of the PM in insects is a matter of conjecture. It may provide a physical barrier to pathogens, facilitate digestion, and provide physical protection of gut epithelial cells from damage by food particles (8Peters W. Bradshaw S.D. Burggren W. Heller H.C. Ishii S. Langer H. Neuweiler G. Randall D.J. Zoophysiology: Peritrophic Membranes. 130. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1992Google Scholar, 9Jacobs-Lorena M. Oo M.M. Beaty B.J. Marquardt W.C.

Biology of the Insect Midgut: The Peritrophic Matrix. Chapman & Hall, London1996: 86-108Crossref Google Scholar). It is unknown how the formation and structure of any PM are regulated. Mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles are the sole vectors of human malaria. Malaria is caused by the protozoan Plasmodiumsp. Transmission is initiated when the mosquito ingests an infected blood meal. In the gut, Plasmodium gametocytes mate and then develop into ookinetes that cross both the PM and the gut epithelium. Increased PM thickness can impair Plasmodiumdevelopment in the mosquito (11Billingsley P.F. Rudin W. J. Parasitol. 1992; 78: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, feeding mosquitoes with the chitinase inhibitor allosamidin results in a thicker PM that starts forming earlier and persists longer (12Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The latter observation is consistent with the existence of a chitinase in the mosquito gut that modulates the physical properties of the PM. However, to date there has been no direct experimental evidence for this hypothesis. Here we demonstrate that upon feeding, adult A. gambiae females secrete a chitinase zymogen into the gut lumen that is subsequently activated by trypsin. Furthermore, we have isolated a cDNA clone that encodes a midgut-specific chitinase. A colony of A. gambiae (G3 strain) was maintained as described previously (13Lemos F.J. Cornel A.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Experiments were normally conducted with 4–5-day-old mosquitoes. Before feeding, mosquitoes were deprived of sugar for 18–24 h. Porcine γ-globulin (Sigma) was dissolved to 300 mg/ml in feeding buffer (120 mm NaCl and 20 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.0) and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. When indicated, soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) was also added. The protein-free meal consisting of 10% (v/v) latex beads (Sigma) was prepared and administered as described previously (14Moskalyk L.A. Oo M.-M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Mol. Biol. 1996; 5: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), except that the jacketed glass feeder was covered with Parafilm. A chitinase assay modified from that of Trudel and Asselin (15Trudel J. Asselin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) was used. Native substrate PAGE was performed using a Tris-glycine buffer system (pH 8.8). Glycol chitin (0.02%) was incorporated into 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide mini-gels (50 × 140 × 0.75 mm). Samples contained 10% glycerol and 0.001% bromphenol blue. Electrophoresis was performed at room temperature for 2 h at 15 mA. After electrophoresis, the gel was immersed in 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The gel was then stained for 15 min in 0.01% Calcofluor White M2R (Sigma; a fluorescent dye that binds chitin) and destained in water for 1 h. The activity band was visualized under an UV transilluminator and photographically documented with a Gel Doc 1000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). Two groups of about 100 female mosquitoes were fed with γ -globulin or γ-globulin plus 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Fifteen mosquitoes were collected from each group at different times after feeding. The guts were immediately dissected and homogenized in 30 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Five μl from each sample were loaded onto a native substrate polyacrylamide gel for the activity assay. Mosquitoes were fed with γ-globulin plus 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and immediately dissected on a dry glass slide, and the fluid from the gut lumen was collected with a fine glass pipette. Different amounts (0, 1, and 3 μl) of trypsin (1 mg/ml) were then added to a fixed amount (5 μl) of fluid. The volume of each sample was adjusted to 10 μl with H2O and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After incubation, the activity was assayed by substrate native PAGE as described above. Whole-gut extracts from mosquitoes dissected 5 h after feeding with γ-globulin containing 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor were also tested for activation by the same procedure. The PCR-Select Subtraction kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was used to generate a mini-library enriched for gut-specific sequences according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cDNA synthesized from 0.1 μg of carcass polyadenylated RNA was used as the driver, and the cDNA from 0.1 μg of gut polyadenylated RNA was used as the tester. The subtracted cDNAs were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Forty random clones were partially sequenced, and a BLAST search (16Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69631) Google Scholar) was performed to identify similarity to the sequences in the data bases. A cDNA insert from the subtraction library that had similarity to chitinases was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to screen theA. gambiae midgut λ-ZAP II cDNA library that was described by Lemos et al. (13Lemos F.J. Cornel A.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Inserts from two positive phages were sequenced. To obtain the sequence of the 5′ end of the cDNA, a polymerase chain reaction reaction was performed using whole library DNA as a template and a chitinase-specific oligonucleotide (5′-GCCGAAAACTCCACCGAAGC-3′) plus a T3 universal primer as primers. The polymerase chain reaction was performed using theTaqlong kit (Stratagene) for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The resulting fragment was subcloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence alignment was carried out using the ClusterV program (17Higgins D.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (5 μg each) from larval guts, larval carcasses, whole pupae, adult female guts, and adult carcasses was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with an α-32P-labeled probe derived from the 1.2-kilobase cDNA insert of a chitinase cDNA clone. The final wash of the filter was done at 65 °C and 0.1× SSC. The same blot was then stripped and rehybridized with an A. gambiae mitochondrial rRNA probe to serve as a loading control (13Lemos F.J.

The mosquitoes were fed with rabbit serum with or without adding allosamidin to 0.5 mm (18Sakuda S. Isogai A. Matsumoto S. Suzuki A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1986; 27: 2475-2478Crossref Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The PMs were dissected at different times after feeding and examined by light microscopy. Chitinase activity was measured by electrophoresis of gut extracts in native polyacrylamide gels containing the synthetic substrate glycol chitin. After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated at 37 °C to allow substrate hydrolysis by chitinases and then stained with a fluorescent dye that binds the substrate (Fig. 1). Brightly fluorescent areas represent regions with no active enzyme, whereas dark areas represent regions where enzyme activity degraded the substrate. The wells of the gel contain no substrate and are always dark (Fig. 1, top). Enzyme activity was distributed somewhat heterogenously near the top of the gel (Fig. 1). This may be because the enzyme interacts with the substrate (glycol chitin) during electrophoresis and/or because under native conditions the enzyme is associated with other molecules to form aggregates of large molecular mass. Fig. 1 illustrates the temporal profile of gut chitinase activity as a function of time after feeding on a protein meal (Fig. 1, upper panel). It also shows the effect that a trypsin inhibitor has on this profile (Fig. 1, lower panel). When mosquitoes were fed γ-globulin alone, chitinase activity was barely detectable at 5 h after feeding, but it was easily detectable at 10 h. However, when soybean trypsin inhibitor was included in the meal, chitinase activity was much lower at early times (5 and 10 h after feeding) and increased only at later times (20 and 32 h). This delay in the increase of chitinase activity suggested that trypsin may be required for chitinase activation. In the experiments described in the previous paragraph, chitinase activity was assayed in whole-gut homogenates. To determine whether chitinase is secreted into the gut lumen in response to food ingestion, the lumenal contents of guts dissected within 30 min after feeding were collected and assayed for chitinase activity (Fig.2 A). No activity was detected when the sample was analyzed without treatment with trypsin (Fig.2 A, lane 1). However, when the sample was treated with trypsin, significant activity was detected (Fig. 2 A,lanes 2 and 3). This result indicates that upon feeding, chitinase is released into the gut lumen in an inactive form and that trypsin can activate it. The activation of the chitinase by trypsin was also observed with whole-gut extracts collected 5 h after feeding a γ-globulin meal containing trypsin inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). There was no detectable chitinase activity in the sample (Fig. 2 B, also shown in Fig. 1), However, treatment of the sample with trypsin resulted in a significant increase of chitinase activity (Fig.2 B, lane 3). Together, these results indicated that chitinase is secreted into gut lumen in an inactive form and that trypsin is likely to be involved in the activation of the enzyme. A gut-enriched cDNA mini-library was constructed by subtractive cDNA cloning. About 40 individual clones from this library were partially sequenced. One of them had an insert of 120 bp that shares sequence similarity with chitinases from various sources. This cDNA fragment was then used as a probe to screen a gut cDNA library. Two clones were isolated (clone 181 and clone 182). These two cDNAs were incomplete and were missing a 5′ sequence. To determine the missing 5′ sequence, a cDNA fragment was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using total library DNA as a template. The overlapping sequence between this cDNA and clone 181 is identical, indicating that it is part of the same gene, named AgChi-1. Fig.3 presents the full AgChi-1cDNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence. The cDNA is 1725 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 525 amino acids. It includes 62 bp of 5′-untranslated sequences and 86 bp of 3′-untranslated sequences. Also, there is a predicted polyadenylation signal (AATAA) 29 bp upstream of a stretch of A residues. The size of this cDNA is close to the mRNA size estimated from Northern blots. A BLAST search with the deduced amino acid sequence revealed similarity with chitinases from a number of organisms, including arthropods, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Sequence alignment analysis identified a putative catalytic domain at the N terminus, a putative chitin-binding domain at the C terminus, and a serine/threonine/proline-rich stretch in between them. In the catalytic domain, all chitinases have a stretch of conserved amino acids (underlined in Fig.4 A). These include three aspartic acid residues and one glutamic acid residue, some or all of which have been suggested to be involved in the enzymatic hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds (19Henrissat B. Prot. Seq. Data Anal. 1990; 3: 523-526PubMed Google Scholar, 20Watanabe T. Kobori K. Miyashita K. Fujii T. Sakai H. Uchida M. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18567-18572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Watanabe T. Uchida M. Kobori K. Tanaka H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1994; 58: 2283-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This conserved stretch of amino acids also appears in AgChi-1, suggesting that this gene encodes a chitinase. The putative chitin-binding domain of insect chitinases was reported to be similar to each of the five chitin-binding domains of the PM protein peritrophin-44 (22Elvin C.M. Vuocolo T. Pearson R.D. East I.J. Riding G.A. Eisemann C.H. Tellam R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8925-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Six cysteine and three aromatic residues are conserved among them. AgChi-1 has all of these conserved residues (Fig.4 B). Whereas the putative chitin-binding domain of most insect chitinases is at the C terminus, that of Penaeus japonicus chitinase is at the N terminus (23Watanabe T. Kono M. Aide K. Nagasawa H. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1996; 5: 299-303PubMed Google Scholar). The serine/threonine/proline-rich stretch (residues 401–466;underlined in Fig. 3) has a highly biased amino acid composition. 45% of the amino acids in this region are serines or threonines, 20% are prolines, and 12% are glycines. The high proline and glycine content probably suppresses the formation of a secondary structure in this region of the protein, thus providing a flexible swivel between the chitin-binding domain and the catalytic domain. This swivel may allow the enzyme to catalyze chitin hydrolysis at multiple nearby sites after binding to chitin. The serine/threonine residues may be sites of O-linked glycosylation (6Kramer K.J. Corpuz L. Choi H. Muthukrishnan S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 23: 691-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The deduced AgChi-1 N-terminal sequence contains a highly hydrophobic amino acid stretch that is likely to function as a signal peptide (Fig.3). This indicates that the protein is secreted and is consistent with recovery of chitinase activity in the gut lumen after ingestion of a meal (Fig. 2). Using von Heijne's rules (24von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3692) Google Scholar), we predict that the signal peptide is cleaved after Ala-19. Activation of the gut chitinase by trypsin in our activity assay suggests the presence of a pro-peptide after the signal peptide. Two consecutive lysine residues were found 11 amino acids after the predicted signal peptide cleavage site (Fig. 3). These two lysine residues may be the trypsin cleavage sites for pro-enzyme activation. Pro-chitinase activation by trypsin was also observed in other species, such as the fungus Mucor mucedo(25Humphreys A.M. Gooday G.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1359-1366Google Scholar), the molting chitinase of Bombyx mori (26Koga D. Fujimoto H. Funakoshi T. Utsumi T. Ide A. Insect Biochem. 1989; 19: 123-128Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the chitinase from P. gallinaceum (27Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The tissue and developmental specificity of chitinase expression was determined by Northern analysis (Fig.5). AgChi-1 mRNA is only detectable in adult guts. No AgChi-1 mRNA was detected at any larval or pupal stage of development, suggesting that this chitinase does not play a role in molting. Moreover, the mRNA is not detected in the guts of larvae, indicating that AgChi-1 plays a specific role in the adult gut. After ingestion of a meal, the PM forms rapidly (within minutes) and gradually thickens and matures. By 7 or 24 h after ingestion of the meal, the PM can be easily dissected. However, as time progresses, the PM becomes more fragile. By 72 h, the PM has completely disappeared (in 55% of the mosquitoes) or become very small and brittle (Fig. 6 A). When allosamidin (a chitinase inhibitor) was included in the meal, degradation of the PM was substantially delayed such that at the 72-h time point, all guts had large and intact PMs (Fig. 6 B). These results suggest that the Anopheles gut chitinase is a regulator of PM formation and degradation. The substrate gel electrophoresis activity assay is sensitive because it uses fluorescence for detection of the substrate. High sensitivity is an advantage for these experiments, because it reduces the number of guts that need to be dissected. Moreover, electrophoretic fractionation of the enzyme before the activity assay separates the enzyme from other gut proteinases. Proteinases can influence chitinase activity either by activating the zymogen or by degrading the enzyme. For example, a chitinase zymogen from the fungus M. mucedo is activated when a crude extract is stored at −20 °C over a period of several days (25Humphreys A.M. Gooday G.W. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 1359-1366Google Scholar). The detection system used for the present experiments differs from that of Trudel and Asselin (15Trudel J. Asselin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) in that the substrate (glycol chitin) was incorporated directly into the separating gel instead of using an overlay substrate gel for enzyme detection. A disadvantage of incorporating the substrate into the gel is that it may cause retardation of enzyme migration and some smearing. However, it has the advantage of being faster and more sensitive, because it does not require the enzyme to migrate out of the separating gel and into the overlay substrate gel. We investigated the effect of pH during incubation of the gel after electrophoresis and found no significant difference in activity from pH 5 to pH 9 (data not shown). In the present experiments, the pH at the beginning of the incubation was pH 8.8 (the pH of the electrophoresis running buffer) and then gradually decreased to pH 5.0 during incubation in the acetate buffer (pH 5.0). Attempts to detect enzyme activity after boiling the sample in the presence of SDS and performing SDS-PAGE followed by renaturation in the presence of Triton X-100 (15Trudel J. Asselin A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 178: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) were not successful. In conclusion, the present substrate native PAGE activity assay is relatively simple and sensitive and represents the actual activity in the gut at the time of dissection. The evidence that the enzyme whose activity was detected in the gut is encoded by the AgChi-1 gene is circumstantial. The possibility that AgChi-1 encodes a chitinase is supported by the similarity of the predicted amino acid sequence to a number of known chitinases and, more importantly, by the fact that key amino acids required for function are conserved in AgChi-1. Furthermore, enzyme and mRNA are both found in the same tissue. Final proof of identity can be obtained by purification of the enzyme from Anopheles guts followed by microsequencing of the protein or by immunological methods. Experiments that address this issue are in progress. Upon feeding, mosquitoes secrete a PM composed of chitin, proteins, and proteoglycans. Chitin is of critical importance, because it provides structural support for the PM. Therefore, temporal modulation of chitinase activity in the guts (relative to food ingestion) is important to maintain a functional PM, because inappropriate levels of chitinase activity could interfere with PM formation. Temporal modulation could occur by at least two different mechanisms: 1) secretion of an active enzyme only late in the digestion cycle or 2) secretion of the enzyme as an inactive zymogen that is later activated. The present data support the latter hypothesis. InA. gambiae, chitinase is secreted as a zymogen that can be activated by trypsin (Fig. 2). In this mosquito, trypsin activity rises only slowly during the first 10 h after the blood meal and rises rapidly thereafter (13Lemos F.J. Cornel A.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similarly, chitinase activity is low during the first 10 h and rises rapidly thereafter (Fig. 1). These observations are consistent with a causal relationship between the increase of trypsin activity and chitinase activation. Moreover, it is likely that the temporal pattern of chitinase activation is physiologically significant. An inactive chitinase would allow the initial organization and formation of the chitin-containing PM without the interference of hydrolytic activity. Later, after the PM has formed, maturation of the PM would occur as a balance of PM secretion and degradation of the PM scaffold. Finally, toward the end of the digestion cycle, PM secretion would cease, and the chitinase would destroy the remaining PM structure (Fig. 6). Because chitin is an important structural component of the PM, it was at first surprising that food ingestion should trigger chitinase secretion. It seems likely that chitinase acts to modulate PM thickness and permeability. In support of this conjecture, we found that PMs were stronger and persisted longer in the guts when the mosquitoes were fed with chitinase inhibitor. This agrees with the observation made by Shahabuddin et al. (12Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Conversely, Regev et al. (28Regev A. Keller M. Strizhov N. Sneh B. Prudovsky E. Chet I. Ginzberg I. Koncz-Kalman Z. Koncz C. Schell J. Zilberstein A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3581-3586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that administration of chitinase to Spodoptera littoralis larvae causes perforation of the PM and in this way greatly facilitates the action of aBacillus thuringiensis δ-endotoxin. During digestion, enzyme molecules secreted by the gut epithelium must traverse the PM to reach the food bolus, and digestion products must cross the PM in the opposite direction to be absorbed by the epithelial cells. A thicker PM may have adverse effects on digestion and food absorption by hampering the traffic of these essential molecules across the PM. Previous work has demonstrated that to cross the PM, the Plasmodium ookinete secretes a pro-chitinase that is activated by the mosquito trypsin (29Shahabuddin M. Lemos F.J.A. Kaslow D.C. Jacobs-Lorena M. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 739-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the PM still represents a significant barrier for penetration byPlasmodium. For instance, experimental induction of a thicker PM by providing multiple blood meals also had a detrimental effect on parasite transmission (11Billingsley P.F. Rudin W. J. Parasitol. 1992; 78: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It is possible that the gut chitinase characterized here may facilitate Plasmodiumpenetration of the PM by generating a thinner, more porous PM. If antibodies directed against the AgChi-1 protein inhibit gut chitinase activity in vivo, then the recombinant protein may serve as an antigen for a transmission-blocking vaccine. Experiments to test the effectiveness of such antibodies in hindering transmission are in progress. We are grateful to Joseph Vinetz (National Institutes of Health) for providing a sample of glycol chitin, to Shohei Sakuda for providing the chitinase inhibitor allosamidin, and to Marten Edwards for his comments on the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2090401018,"The mammalian NRAMP gene family has two members, NRAMP1 and NRAMP2 that encode integral membrane proteins. Nramp1 is expressed exclusively in macrophages where it is found in the phagosomal membrane, andNRAMP1 mutations cause susceptibility to infection by abrogating the capacity of macrophages to control intracellular microbial replication. Nramp2 is highly similar to Nramp1, but is expressed in several tissues and cell types. The Nramp protein family is remarkably conserved throughout evolution, and recent data suggest that the mammalian Nramp2 and the yeast homologues Smf1 and Smf2 transport divalent cations. We tested whether structural similarity between the mammalian Nramp and the yeast Smf proteins results in functional complementation in yeast. Wild-type and mutant variants of the Nramp1 and Nramp2 proteins were expressed in a yeast mutant bearing null alleles at the SMF1 and SMF2 loci, and complementation of the phenotypes of this yeast mutant was investigated. Nramp2, but not Nramp1, was found to complement hypersensitivity to EGTA of the smf1/smf2 mutant under oxidative stress conditions (methyl viologen). We also observed that the smf1/smf2 double mutant is hypersensitive to growth at alkaline pH (pH 7.9) and that Nramp2 could complement this phenotype as well. Complementation by Nramp2 was specific and required a functional protein as independent mutations in residues highly conserved in all members of the Nramp family abrogated Nramp2 complementation. Since Mn2+ was the only divalent cation capable of completely suppressing both the EGTA and pH phenotypes, our results suggest that Nramp2 can transport Mn2+ in yeast.

Gauthier S. Skamene E. Malo D. Gros P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2923-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nramp1 protein is an integral membrane protein of 100 kDa that is extensively modified in mature macrophages byN-linked glycosylation (contributing approximately 50% of molecular mass) and phosphorylation (13Vidal S. Pinner E. Lepage P. Gauthier S. Gros P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3559-3568PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular localization by confocal microscopy indicated that Nramp1 is located in the late endosomal compartment (Lamp1-positive) of macrophages (14Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Upon phagocytosis, Nramp1 is recruited to the phagosomal membrane and remains associated with this structure during its maturation to phagolysosome (14Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Nramp1 may, in an unknown fashion, modulate the content of this vesicular compartment to affect microbial replication.We have identified a second NRAMP gene in mouse and humans,NRAMP2. The Nramp1 and Nramp2 proteins are highly similar (77% overall similarity), with identical hydropathy profiles and predicted secondary structures. As opposed to its phagocyte-specificNRAMP1 counterpart, both the human and mouseNRAMP2 mRNAs are expressed in several tissues and cell types analyzed (15Gruenheid S. Cellier M. Vidal S. Gros P. Genomics. 1995; 25: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Recent studies by electrophysiology have indicated that Nramp2 can function as a broad specificity divalent cation transport system (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F.

Recently, SMF1 was re-isolated by Supek et al. as an extragenic high copy suppressor of a phenotype of hypersensitivity to the chelating agent EGTA (20Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc.

These authors presented evidence suggesting that Smf1 may be a Mn2+ transporter, including the observations thatSMF1 inactivation causes hypersensitivity to EGTA, and that cells overexpressing Smf1 show increased accumulation of54Mn2+ (20Supek F.

In this study, we set out to determine if the sequence similarity noted between mammalian Nramp and yeast Smf proteins translates into functional homology. We have attempted to complement the phenotypic characteristics of a doublesmf1/smf2 yeast mutant by expressing in this strain the mammalian Nramp1 and Nramp2 proteins.DISCUSSIONAn important role for the NRAMP1 gene in host defenses against intracellular infections has been demonstrated in vivo in transgenic animals bearing either a null allele (11Vidal S.

UnlikeNRAMP1, NRAMP2 is widely expressed in most tissues tested but the subcellular localization of its protein product is unknown. While the substrate of Nramp1 in macrophages has yet to be identified, recent studies show that Nramp2 can function as a broad specificity divalent cation transporter in Xenopus laevisoocytes (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). This transport is pH-sensitive, electrogenic, and appears to be coupled to proton movement (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Finally, mice with mutatedNRAMP2 are deficient in intestinal iron uptake (17Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar).The NRAMP family is highly conserved in evolution and has three members in yeast, known as SMF1, SMF2, andSMF3 (reviewed by Cellier et al., 18). The sequence identity between the human and yeast proteins reaches 41% in the highly hydrophobic core consisting of the first ten N-terminal TM segments of the protein, with several of these domains highly conserved in human and yeast proteins. Interestingly, Smf1 was recently shown to be a Mn2+ transporter (20Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To monitor the extent of functional homology between the yeast and mammalian proteins, we attempted to complement a double smf1/smf2 null mutant (SMF1/2) by either Nramp1 or Nramp2 using two phenotypic markers. The first one is the hypersensitivity of SMF1/2 cells to EGTA, which is exacerbated under oxidative stress induced by methyl viologen. This phenotype is consistent with a key role of transition metals transported by Smf proteins as cofactors for detoxifying enzymes such as the superoxide dismutases Sod1 (Cu2+, Zn2+) and Sod2, (Mn2+) essential for survival under oxidative stress (27Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The second phenotype we analyzed was the observed inability of SMF1/2 to grow at pH 7.9. Although a common biochemical basis for the hypersensitivity to EGTA and alkaline pH in SMF1/2 can only be speculated upon (see below), both phenotypes can be suppressed by Mn2+, suggesting that both effects are specific and are related to the loss of SMF gene function in this mutant. We observed that expression of Nramp2 in SMF1/2 could correct both hypersensitivity phenotypes at a level comparable with that seen in SMF1 transformants, suggesting that structural similarity in this family underlies a common transport mechanism. In our experimental setting, Mn2+ was the only metal capable of efficiently suppressing both EGTA and alkaline pH sensitivity, and as SMF1 was shown to be a Mn2+ transporter, our results suggest that Nramp2 may also transport Mn2+ in yeast. The poor level of suppression of alkaline pH hypersensitivity with Fe2+ in our experimental conditions is somewhat surprising in view of the proposed role of Nramp2 in iron transport (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 17Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that at the alkaline pH (8.0) used to monitor functional complementation, a significant proportion of iron in the medium may be in the Fe3+ form, which may not be a substrate for Nramp2.Unlike Nramp2, Nramp1 did not complement the SMF1/2 hypersensitivity phenotypes. This different activity of the two mammalian proteins in these assays could be explained by either functional differences such as non-overlapping substrate specificity or by the inability of Nramp1 to function in the yeast cellular environment, including targeting to a different subcellular compartment. Nevertheless, the strong homology between Nramp1 and Nramp2 raises the possibility that Nramp1 may also transport divalent cations.The observation that SMF1/2 cells are hypersensitive to alkaline pH is intriguing and may suggest that transition metals are necessary for certain yeast enzymes that are essential for survival under alkaline conditions. For example, it is known that yeast mutated in the vacuolar H+-ATPase fail to acidify the vacuole and do not grow at alkaline pH (29Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A direct or indirect role of divalent cations such as Mn2+ in vacuolar acidification could underlie the alkaline sensitivity phenotype. Alternatively, Mn2+ transport by Smf1 and Nramp2 proteins may be coupled to proton movement, as recently suggested (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Suppression of the pH sensitivity phenotype by Mn2+ in control cells that lack either SMF1 orSMF2 would argue against such a possibility, unless the suppressor effect of Mn2+ in these cells involves another functionally related transporter, for example the SMF3 gene for which there is no known function.The complementation by Nramp2 of the SMF1/2 mutant was specific and was abrogated by 2 out of 3 mutations in a protein segment which is highly conserved in members of the Nramp family (Fig. 2 C). This 20-residue segment (positions 367–387), predicted to overlap part of TM8 and the intracellular loop delineated by TM8 and TM9, shares similarity with three sets of residues: 1) the sequence motif known as the “binding protein-dependent transport system inner membrane component signature” (transport signature, Ref. 8Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) ((E,Q)(S, T, A)2 (X)3 G (X)6 (L, I, V, M, Y, F, A) (X)4 (F, L, I, V) (P, K)), also known as the EAA box (31Dassa E. Hofnung M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2287-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar); 2) TM3 of the proteolipid subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase family (periodical distribution of Gly and other small residues, positions 366, 368, 369, 371, 373, 376, 379, and 380 in Nramp1 protein sequence, see Ref. 32Descoteaux S. Yu Y. Samuelson J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 3572-3575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and 3) the permeation pore of the shaker type K+ channels (TMT-(X)4-G-(D/Q)-(X)4-GF; positions 373–387, 33Wood M.W. VanDongen H.M. VanDongen A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4882-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In each of these families, the conserved residues map to a region shown to be essential to function (25Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 35Noumi T. Beltran C. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Two of the mutations introduced, Q384E and G394V, abolished Nramp2 function, indicating that these two residues are important for the transport activity common to Nramp2 and Smf1 proteins. Glutamine 384 is the first residue of the transport signature and in some eukaryotic and prokaryotic members of this family, a glutamate can be found at this position. Our results show that such a substitution cannot be tolerated in Nramp2 without loss of function. Likewise, the Gly-394 residue is absolutely conserved in all members of the Nramp family (Fig.2 C) and in the permeation path of K+ channels. The loss of function noted in the Nramp2 G394V mutant suggests that this flexible residue is essential for a structural or functional characteristic common to both of these gene families. The highly conserved Gln-395 does not appear essential for function as measured in our assay since introduction of an additional negative charge at that site is without effect on complementation.In conclusion, the observed complementation between mammalian Nramp2 and yeast Smf proteins suggests that this protein family is comprised of divalent cation transporters that have been structurally and functionally conserved during evolution. In addition, complementation by Nramp2 of the EGTA and alkaline pH hypersensitivity phenotypes of the SMF1/2 mutant provides a functional assay for the structure-function analyses of Nramp2 in yeast. Bcg/Lsh/Ity is a mouse locus that controls resistance to infection in vivo with Mycobacterium,Salmonella, and Leishmania (1Gros P. Skamene E. Forget A. J.

The pleiotropic effects of Bcg on infection with unrelated microorganisms suggest a key role in natural defenses of phagocytes. Positional cloning of the Bcg locus identified the NRAMP1 gene (Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (8Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar)). The NRAMP1 mRNA is expressed almost exclusively in phagocytic cells (8Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3097-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). All Bcg s inbred strains show a single G169D substitution in predicted TM4 of Nramp1 (8Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K.

Genomics. 1994; 23: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar); further experiments in transgenic animals have demonstrated thatNRAMP1 and Bcg/Lsh/Ity are indeed the same gene (11Vidal S.

Gauthier S. Skamene E. Malo D. Gros P. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2923-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Nramp1 protein is an integral membrane protein of 100 kDa that is extensively modified in mature macrophages byN-linked glycosylation (contributing approximately 50% of molecular mass) and phosphorylation (13Vidal S. Pinner E. Lepage P. Gauthier S. Gros P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3559-3568PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular localization by confocal microscopy indicated that Nramp1 is located in the late endosomal compartment (Lamp1-positive) of macrophages (14Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Upon phagocytosis, Nramp1 is recruited to the phagosomal membrane and remains associated with this structure during its maturation to phagolysosome (14Gruenheid S. Pinner E. Desjardins M. Gros P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Nramp1 may, in an unknown fashion, modulate the content of this vesicular compartment to affect microbial replication. We have identified a second NRAMP gene in mouse and humans,NRAMP2. The Nramp1 and Nramp2 proteins are highly similar (77% overall similarity), with identical hydropathy profiles and predicted secondary structures. As opposed to its phagocyte-specificNRAMP1 counterpart, both the human and mouseNRAMP2 mRNAs are expressed in several tissues and cell types analyzed (15Gruenheid S. Cellier M. Vidal S. Gros P. Genomics. 1995; 25: 514-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Recent studies by electrophysiology have indicated that Nramp2 can function as a broad specificity divalent cation transport system (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar), while mice with a mutant NRAMP2 gene are deficient in intestinal iron uptake (17Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C.

Distant NRAMPhomologues have also been identified in the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the plant Oriza sativa, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and even in bacteria such as Escherichia coli 2M.

Optimal amino acid sequence alignment reveals remarkable sequence identities of 39% (bacterium), 41% (yeast), 60% (plant), 67% (worm), and 70% (fly) with the mammalian proteins, over their common region of overlap. This family is defined by the presence of a highly conserved hydrophobic core encoding 10 TM segments, which includes several invariant charged residues and the transport signature (8Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P. Cell. 1993; 73: 469-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) on the cytosolic side of the membrane (TM8–9 interval, Ref. 18Cellier M. Prive G.

The two yeast homologues, SMF1 and SMF2, were cloned by their ability to suppress mif1, a Tsmutation which affects a Mn2+-dependent signal peptidase (PEP1) essential for import of cytosolic proteins into mitochondria (19West A.H. Clark D.J. Martin J. Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Horwich A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double smf1/smf2 mutant shows a slow growth phenotype and is impaired in import and processing of mitochondrial proteins (19West A.H. Clark D.J. Martin J. Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Horwich A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, SMF1 was re-isolated by Supek et al. as an extragenic high copy suppressor of a phenotype of hypersensitivity to the chelating agent EGTA (20Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These authors presented evidence suggesting that Smf1 may be a Mn2+ transporter, including the observations thatSMF1 inactivation causes hypersensitivity to EGTA, and that cells overexpressing Smf1 show increased accumulation of54Mn2+ (20Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Recent data have suggested that the yeast SMF2 gene may similarly encode a divalent cation transporter (21Liu X.F. Supek F. Nelson N. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11763-11769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to determine if the sequence similarity noted between mammalian Nramp and yeast Smf proteins translates into functional homology. We have attempted to complement the phenotypic characteristics of a doublesmf1/smf2 yeast mutant by expressing in this strain the mammalian Nramp1 and Nramp2 proteins. DISCUSSIONAn important role for the NRAMP1 gene in host defenses against intracellular infections has been demonstrated in vivo in transgenic animals bearing either a null allele (11Vidal S.

This transport is pH-sensitive, electrogenic, and appears to be coupled to proton movement (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J.

Two of the mutations introduced, Q384E and G394V, abolished Nramp2 function, indicating that these two residues are important for the transport activity common to Nramp2 and Smf1 proteins. Glutamine 384 is the first residue of the transport signature and in some eukaryotic and prokaryotic members of this family, a glutamate can be found at this position. Our results show that such a substitution cannot be tolerated in Nramp2 without loss of function. Likewise, the Gly-394 residue is absolutely conserved in all members of the Nramp family (Fig.2 C) and in the permeation path of K+ channels. The loss of function noted in the Nramp2 G394V mutant suggests that this flexible residue is essential for a structural or functional characteristic common to both of these gene families. The highly conserved Gln-395 does not appear essential for function as measured in our assay since introduction of an additional negative charge at that site is without effect on complementation.In conclusion, the observed complementation between mammalian Nramp2 and yeast Smf proteins suggests that this protein family is comprised of divalent cation transporters that have been structurally and functionally conserved during evolution. In addition, complementation by Nramp2 of the EGTA and alkaline pH hypersensitivity phenotypes of the SMF1/2 mutant provides a functional assay for the structure-function analyses of Nramp2 in yeast. An important role for the NRAMP1 gene in host defenses against intracellular infections has been demonstrated in vivo in transgenic animals bearing either a null allele (11Vidal S. Tremblay M.L.

Immun. 1996; 64: 2923-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at the NRAMP1/Bcglocus. The identification of professional phagocytes (macrophages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes) as the cell type expressing Nramp1 (8Vidal S.M. Malo D. Vogan K. Skamene E. Gros P.

Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 61: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), together with the subcellular localization of Nramp1 to the maturing phagosome in these cells, strongly suggest that Nramp1 controls intracellular microbial replication by altering the intravesicular composition of the microbe-containing phagosome. UnlikeNRAMP1, NRAMP2 is widely expressed in most tissues tested but the subcellular localization of its protein product is unknown. While the substrate of Nramp1 in macrophages has yet to be identified, recent studies show that Nramp2 can function as a broad specificity divalent cation transporter in Xenopus laevisoocytes (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). This transport is pH-sensitive, electrogenic, and appears to be coupled to proton movement (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Finally, mice with mutatedNRAMP2 are deficient in intestinal iron uptake (17Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The NRAMP family is highly conserved in evolution and has three members in yeast, known as SMF1, SMF2, andSMF3 (reviewed by Cellier et al., 18). The sequence identity between the human and yeast proteins reaches 41% in the highly hydrophobic core consisting of the first ten N-terminal TM segments of the protein, with several of these domains highly conserved in human and yeast proteins. Interestingly, Smf1 was recently shown to be a Mn2+ transporter (20Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To monitor the extent of functional homology between the yeast and mammalian proteins, we attempted to complement a double smf1/smf2 null mutant (SMF1/2) by either Nramp1 or Nramp2 using two phenotypic markers. The first one is the hypersensitivity of SMF1/2 cells to EGTA, which is exacerbated under oxidative stress induced by methyl viologen. This phenotype is consistent with a key role of transition metals transported by Smf proteins as cofactors for detoxifying enzymes such as the superoxide dismutases Sod1 (Cu2+, Zn2+) and Sod2, (Mn2+) essential for survival under oxidative stress (27Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5918-5920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bilinski T. Krawiec Z. Liczmanski A. Litwinska J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 130: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The second phenotype we analyzed was the observed inability of SMF1/2 to grow at pH 7.9. Although a common biochemical basis for the hypersensitivity to EGTA and alkaline pH in SMF1/2 can only be speculated upon (see below), both phenotypes can be suppressed by Mn2+, suggesting that both effects are specific and are related to the loss of SMF gene function in this mutant. We observed that expression of Nramp2 in SMF1/2 could correct both hypersensitivity phenotypes at a level comparable with that seen in SMF1 transformants, suggesting that structural similarity in this family underlies a common transport mechanism. In our experimental setting, Mn2+ was the only metal capable of efficiently suppressing both EGTA and alkaline pH sensitivity, and as SMF1 was shown to be a Mn2+ transporter, our results suggest that Nramp2 may also transport Mn2+ in yeast. The poor level of suppression of alkaline pH hypersensitivity with Fe2+ in our experimental conditions is somewhat surprising in view of the proposed role of Nramp2 in iron transport (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar, 17Fleming M.D. Trenor C.C. Su M.A. Foernzler D. Beier D.R. Dietrich W.F. Andrews N.C. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that at the alkaline pH (8.0) used to monitor functional complementation, a significant proportion of iron in the medium may be in the Fe3+ form, which may not be a substrate for Nramp2. Unlike Nramp2, Nramp1 did not complement the SMF1/2 hypersensitivity phenotypes. This different activity of the two mammalian proteins in these assays could be explained by either functional differences such as non-overlapping substrate specificity or by the inability of Nramp1 to function in the yeast cellular environment, including targeting to a different subcellular compartment. Nevertheless, the strong homology between Nramp1 and Nramp2 raises the possibility that Nramp1 may also transport divalent cations. The observation that SMF1/2 cells are hypersensitive to alkaline pH is intriguing and may suggest that transition metals are necessary for certain yeast enzymes that are essential for survival under alkaline conditions. For example, it is known that yeast mutated in the vacuolar H+-ATPase fail to acidify the vacuole and do not grow at alkaline pH (29Umemoto N. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24526-24532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A direct or indirect role of divalent cations such as Mn2+ in vacuolar acidification could underlie the alkaline sensitivity phenotype. Alternatively, Mn2+ transport by Smf1 and Nramp2 proteins may be coupled to proton movement, as recently suggested (16Gunshin H. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Gunshin Y. Romeor M.F. Boron W.F. Nussberger S. Gollan J. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Suppression of the pH sensitivity phenotype by Mn2+ in control cells that lack either SMF1 orSMF2 would argue against such a possibility, unless the suppressor effect of Mn2+ in these cells involves another functionally related transporter, for example the SMF3 gene for which there is no known function. The complementation by Nramp2 of the SMF1/2 mutant was specific and was abrogated by 2 out of 3 mutations in a protein segment which is highly conserved in members of the Nramp family (Fig. 2 C). This 20-residue segment (positions 367–387), predicted to overlap part of TM8 and the intracellular loop delineated by TM8 and TM9, shares similarity with three sets of residues: 1) the sequence motif known as the “binding protein-dependent transport system inner membrane component signature” (transport signature, Ref. 8Vidal S.M.

In each of these families, the conserved residues map to a region shown to be essential to function (25Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E.

Understanding the molecular basis underlying these diverse biological actions of BHA is thus of great importance. Here we demonstrate that BHA is capable of activating distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1). Activation of ERK2 by BHA was rapid and transient, whereas the JNK1 activation was relatively delayed and persistent. A major metabolite of BHA, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), also activated ERK2 but weakly stimulated JNK1 activity. Furthermore, tBHQ activation of ERK2 was late and prolonged, showing a kinetics different from that induced by BHA. ERK2 activation by both compounds required the involvement of an upstream signaling kinase MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), as evidenced by the inhibitory effect of a MEK inhibitor, PD98059. Pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, glutathione, or vitamin E attenuated ERK2 but not JNK1 activation by BHA and tBHQ. Modulation of intracellular H2O2levels by direct addition of catalase or pretreatment with a catalase inhibitor, aminotriazole, also affected BHA- and tBHQ-stimulated ERK2 activity but not JNK1, indicating the involvement of oxidative stress in the ERK2 activation by these two compounds. However, we did not observe any generation of H2O2 after exposure of cells to BHA or tBHQ using a H2O2-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. Instead, BHA and tBHQ substantially reduced the amount of intracellular H2O2. Furthermore, BHA and tBHQ activation of ERK2 was strongly inhibited by ascorbic acid and a peroxidase inhibitor, sodium azide, suggesting the potential role of phenoxyl radicals and/or their derivatives. Taken together, our results indicate that (i) BHA and its metabolite tBHQ differentially regulate MAPK pathways, and (ii) oxidative stress due to the generation of reactive intermediates, possibly phenoxyl radicals but not H2O2, is responsible for the ERK2 activation by BHA and tBHQ, whereas the JNK1 activation may require a distinct yet unknown mechanism.

Food Chem. Toxicol. 1986; 24: 1039-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to its action as an inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, this compound exhibits a wide range of biological activities. BHA protects animals against radiation and the acute toxicity of various xenobiotics and mutagens (3Kahl R. Toxicology. 1984; 33: 185-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 4Wattenberg L.W. Lam L.K. Nygaard O.F. Simig M.A. Radioprotectors and Anti-carcinogens. Academic Press, Inc., NY1983: 461-469Google Scholar). Dietary administration of BHA also leads to the protection against various carcinogens, presumably through the induction of many phase II detoxifying enzymes such as epoxide hydrolases (5Monroe D. Eaton D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1987; 90: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 6Cha Y.-N. Martz F. Beuding E.

Chem. 1983; 258: 12315-12319Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, a growing body of evidence indicates that BHA may also be a tumor initiator or a tumor promoter in some tissues of animals. For example, BHA induced papilloma and carcinoma formation in the forestomachs of rats, mice, and hamsters when fed continuously at high concentrations (10Ito N. Fukushima S. Hagiwara A. Shibata M. Ogiso T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1983; 70: 343-352PubMed Google Scholar, 11Clayson D.B. Iverson F. Nera E.A. Lok E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 441-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chronic dietary administration of BHA also enhances the development of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the rat kidney and urinary bladder (12Nera E.A. Iverson F. Lok E. Armstrong C.L. Karpinski K. Clayson D.B. Toxicology. 1988; 53: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Peters M.M.C. Rivera M.I. Jones T.W. Monks T.J. Lau S.S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1006-1011PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, BHA appears to have initiating activity in two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis assay and in two-stage transformation of BALB/3T3 cells (14Sakai A. Miyata N. Takahashi A. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 1985-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Most notably, BHA induced proliferative effects not only in rodent forestomachs but also in the esophagus of pigs and primates (15Wurtzen G. Olsen P. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1986; 24: 1229-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,16Iverson F. Truelove J. Nera E. Wong J. Clayson D.B. Cancer Lett. 1985; 26: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, this well known antioxidant exerts opposing biological effects. Although both anti-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects of BHA are well described, the precise mechanisms of how these effects are achieved remain obscure but probably are dose- and/or tissue-dependent. Studies on the metabolism of BHA revealed that several metabolic pathways may exist, including dimerization, conjugation, andO-demethylation (17Verhagen H. Shilderman P.A. Kleinjans J.C. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1991; 80: 109-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). One of the major metabolites of BHA, as shown in dogs (18Astill B.D. Mills J. Rassett R.L. Roundbash R.L. Terhaar C.J. Agric. Food Chem. 1962; 10: 315-318Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar), rats, and man (19Verhagen H. Furnee C. Schutte B. Hermans R.J.J. Bosman F.T. Blijhan G.H. Hoor F.Th. Henderson P. Kleinjans J.C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and in rat liver microsomes (20Rahimthula A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1983; 45: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is the demethylated product, tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), which also exhibits anti-carcinogenic properties in some animal models of cancer in a manner similar to that described for BHA. This includes modulation of the enzyme systems responsible for metabolic activation or deactivation of chemical carcinogens (21Wattenberg L.W. Coccia J.B. Lam L.K.T. Cancer Res. 1980; 40: 2820-2823PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, metabolic formation of tBHQ is thought to contribute to the anti-carcinogenic activities of BHA. However, tBHQ is also shown to be a carcinogen in many animal tissues. Although the reason why tBHQ is carcinogenic remains unknown, the oxidation of tHBQ to its corresponding quinone, tert-butylquinone, accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), presumes to play an important role (22Rossing D. Kahl R. Hildebrandt A.G. Toxicology. 1985; 34: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Kahl R. Weinke S. Kappus H.

Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since BHA did not show genotoxic activity in most tests for mutagenicity (25Rogers C.G. Boyes B.G. Matula T.I. Stapley R. Mutat. Res. 1992; 280: 17-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Schilderman P.A.E.L. Rhijinsburger E. Zwingmann I. Kleinjans J.C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), tBHQ-mediated generations oftert-butylquinone and ROS, which are known to cause DNA damage, is believed to be responsible for BHA-induced carcinogenesis. However, several studies suggested that such carcinogenic effects of BHA are tBHQ- or tert-butylquinone-independent and are epigenetic (19Verhagen H. Furnee C. Schutte B. Hermans R.J.J. Bosman F.T.

While the relevance of metabolism of BHA for its biological action has been the focus of many studies over the years, the signal transduction pathways that control the cellular responses to BHA and its metabolites have not been elucidated. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), characterized as proline-directed serine/threonine kinases (28Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar), are important cellular signaling components that convert various extracellular signals into intracellular responses through serial phosphorylation cascades (29Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Gen. & Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). At the present time, three distinct but parallel MAPK cascades have been identified in mammalian cells (30Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Each consists of a module of three kinases as follows: a MAPK kinase kinase, which phosphorylates and activates a MAPK kinase, which, in turn, phosphorylates and activates a MAPK. The best characterized MAPK pathway is a Ras-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERKs) in response to growth factors. In this pathway, tyrosine-phosphorylated transmembrane receptors associate with the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2 (31Skolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzer A. Vincentini L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers Jr., M.G. Backer G.M. Ullrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and target nucleotide exchange factor SOS to the membrane-bound small G-protein Ras (32Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Activated Ras recruits Raf-1 (a MAPK kinase kinase) to the membrane, leading the activation of Raf-1 (33Stokeo D.M. Caddwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Once activated, Raf-1 can phosphorylate and activate a dual specificity kinase MEK (a MAPK kinase), which, in turn, activates ERK (a MAPK). In addition to tyrosine kinase receptors, certain G-protein-coupled receptors and protein kinase C are also capable of activating ERK cascade (34Burgering B.M.T. Bos J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Another emerging MAPK group is c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is operated by a parallel signaling module, consisting of MEKK1/MKK4 (or SEK1, JNKK)/JNK (35Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1710) Google Scholar,36Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). However, JNK cascade, unlike ERK pathway, is only modestly activated by growth factors and phorbol esters and is instead strongly activated by stress signals such as UV light (37Chen Y.-R. Wang X.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, JNK is also termed as stress-activated protein kinase. Both ERK and JNK activation culminate in the phosphorylation of downstream cytosolic and nuclear substrates, including transcription factors, c-Myc, p62TCF/Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF2, ultimately leading to the changes in gene expression (44Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). Given the fact that MAPKs are activated by such a wide range of factors, these signaling cascades may serve as a common mechanism and integrate with other signaling pathways to control cellular responses to various extracellular stimuli. In this study, we examined ERK and JNK activation by BHA and its principal metabolite tBHQ in two cell lines, HeLa cells and human hepatoma Hep G2 cells, with particular interest in the relationship between these two chemicals and the possible mediators in modulating ERK and JNK cascades. We demonstrated that BHA strongly activated ERK2 and JNK1 in both cell lines, whereas tBHQ stimulated ERK2 only in Hep G2 cells and weakly activated JNK1 in both cell lines. ERK2 activation by both agents requires involvement of upstream signaling components as demonstrated by the inhibitory effects of a MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059. Further studies using different free radical scavengers and flow cytometry revealed that formation of non-oxygen free radicals, possibly phenoxyl free radicals, from parent molecules of BHA and tBHQ, represents a major mechanism for ERK2 activation but not for JNK1. Human HeLa cells and Hep G2 cells, obtained from American Type culture Collection (Rockville, MD) were maintained as monolayer cultures in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were normally starved overnight in serum-free medium without phenol red before treatment. Polyclonal antibody to ERK2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-JNK1 antiserum (Ab101) was described previously (38Chen Y.-R. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 631-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 43Yu R. Jiao J.J. Duh J.L. Tan T.-H. Kong A-N.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun-(1–79) expressing plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. M. Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA), and the GST-c-Jun fusion protein was purified from Escherichia coli lysates with the aid of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). PD95089, a specific inhibitor of MEK, was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. Fluorescence dyes 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Myelin basic protein, catalase, dismutase, NAC, reduced glutathione (GSH), α-tocopherol (vitamin E; V-E), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), 3-aminotriazole, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and BHA were obtained from Sigma. tBHQ was purchase from Aldrich. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. After treatment with BHA or tBHQ (both agents were dissolved in ethanol, the final concentration of ethanol in the culture medium was controlled to less than 0.1%), monolayer cells, grown in a 10-cm diameter plate, were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in 700 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.1), 50 mm sodium chloride, 30 mm inorganic sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm iodoacetic acid, 5 μm zinc chloride, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100. The lysate was homogenized by passing through a 23-gauge needle three times. After 15 min on ice, the homogenate was centrifuged at high speed for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube. ERK activity was determined by an immunocomplex kinase assay as described previously (43Yu R. Jiao J.J. Duh J.L. Tan T.-H. Kong A-N.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2954-2959PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, equal amounts of protein, as measured by Bio-Rad protein Assay (Bio-Rad, CA), were incubated with rabbit anti-ERK2 polyclonal antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was spun down at high speed for 1 min and washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 2 mm manganese chloride, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate). Kinase reaction was initiated by resuspending the immunoprecipitate in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 10 μg of myelin basic protein, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 20 μm ATP. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of 4 × Laemmli's buffer and heating to 95 °C for 5 min; samples were resolved in 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gel was stained with Coomassie Blue and then washed overnight and dried. The phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was visualized by autoradiography and quantified with a PhosphorImager (AMBIS, Inc., San Diego, CA). JNK1 activity was assayed according to the procedures described above for ERK2 assay, with the following changes. After immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-JNK1 antiserum, JNK1 activity was detected using 10 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein as substrate. Kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphorylated product was resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography and phosphorimage. Confluent, serum-starved HeLa cells and Hep G2 cells were treated with different agents and then incubated with 5 μm DCF-DA (dissolved in Me2SO) for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. After chilling on ice, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, scraped from the plate, and resuspended at 5 × 105 cells/ml in PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 5 μm DCF-DA. The fluorescence intensities of DCF-DA of more than 10,000 viable cells from each sample were analyzed by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer with excitation and emission settings of 488 and 525 nm, respectively. Prior to data collection, propidium iodide was added to the sample for gating out dead cells. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well into 96-well plates, with each well containing 100 μl of medium. After overnight recovery, cells were treated with a series of concentrations of BHA or tBHQ. Drugs were removed after 4 h of treatment, and cells were cultured in the fresh medium for an additional 24 h and then assayed for viability using CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, 20 μl of combined solution of a tetrazolium compound 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt, and an electron coupling reagent phenazine methosulfate was added to each well. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere, the absorbance at 490 nm was recorded using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. HeLa cells, which are derived from a human cervical squamous cell carcinoma, are used as a model system for the studies of MAPK in response to various factors. Hep G2, a human hepatoma cell line, has been widely used to study the role of metabolism of different compounds, because of the extensive metabolic capacity of this cell line. In the present experiment, we have examined the effects of BHA on ERK2 and JNK1 activities in these cell lines. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, BHA strongly stimulated ERK2 activity in a dose-dependent fashion in both cell lines after 25 min of treatment. In HeLa cells, ERK2 activation occurred when the concentration of BHA reached 250 μm. In Hep G2 cells, the stimulated ERK2 activity, however, appeared at a much lower concentration, around 50 μm. The maximal induction of ERK2 activity was observed at 500 μm in HeLa cells and 250 μm in Hep G2 cells. Further increasing concentrations of BHA to 750 μm dramatically reduced ERK2 activity to control level in Hep G2 cells or to the level slightly higher than control in HeLa cells. Similar to ERK2, JNK1 was also strongly activated in both cell lines after 90 min of treatment with BHA (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, activation of both kinases followed a similar dose-response pattern. Based on the dose-response data, we next studied the kinetics of ERK2 and JNK1 activation by BHA. In HeLa cells, 500 μm BHA activated ERK2 in a time-dependent fashion (Fig. 2 A). The induced ERK2 activity reached maximum within 15 min and disappeared after 60 min of treatment with BHA. Similar to that observed in HeLa cells, activation of ERK2 in Hep G2 cells by 250 μm BHA peaked at 15 min. Afterward, a rapid decrease in ERK2 activity ensued. Unlike ERK2 activation, JNK1 activation was delayed and seen at 15 min in HeLa cells or at 30 min in Hep G2 cells, instead of 5 min in ERK2 activation (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, after peaking at 2 h, JNK1 activity gradually declined to control levels in both cell lines, showing a sustained activation pattern. Different kinetics of ERK2 and JNK1 activation suggest that these two kinases are differentially regulated in response to BHA. When Western blotting analysis was performed with anti-ERK2 or anti-JNK1 antibodies, no changes in the protein levels of ERK2 or JNK1 occurred throughout the kinetic studies, indicating that the activation of ERK2 or JNK1 resulted from the phosphorylation of pre-existing kinase molecules instead of thede novo protein synthesis (data not shown). tBHQ is a major metabolite of BHA, as demonstrated in many animal species as well as in human (18Astill B.D. Mills J. Rassett R.L. Roundbash R.L. Terhaar C.J. Agric. Food Chem. 1962; 10: 315-318Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Verhagen H. Furnee C. Schutte B. Hermans R.J.J. Bosman F.T. Blijhan G.H. Hoor F.Th. Henderson P. Kleinjans J.C.S. Carcinogenesis. 1989; 10: 1947-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A number of previous studies implicated that this compound may mediate many biological activities of BHA, including anti-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects. Thus, it would be of particular interest to see whether tBHQ could mimic the effects of BHA with respect to the activation of MAPK. In Hep G2 cells, tBHQ stimulated ERK2 activation, which appeared at 50 μm and reached a maximum at 250–500 μm (Fig.3 A). Further increasing tBHQ concentration to 750 μm dramatically reduced the ERK2 activity. Thus, ERK2 activation by tBHQ exhibits a dose-dependent manner similar to that observed with BHA. However, time course analyses showed that tBHQ, unlike BHA, induced delayed and sustained ERK2 activation. The stimulated ERK2 activity appeared at 15 min, reached maximum at 30 min, and was persistent for more than 2 h. Furthermore, tBHQ seemed to be less potent than BHA in activation of ERK2. For example, a maximum of more than 10-fold induction was observed in the treatment with BHA (250 μm, 15 min), whereas the maximal ERK2 activation by tBHQ (500 μm, 30 min) was around 7-fold. The differences in kinetics and extent of ERK2 activation suggest that BHA and tBHQ differentially regulate this kinase cascade. This observation was further supported by the experiment in HeLa cells. In this experiment, HeLa cells were treated with either 500 μm tBHQ for different time periods or with different concentrations of tBHQ for 30 min, as shown in Fig. 3 B. No significant induction of ERK2 activity was observed, regardless of the dose and time of the treatments. However, under similar conditions, BHA strongly activated ERK2, with a maximum of more than 18-fold induction, as seen in Fig. 2 A. Differential regulation of ERK2 signaling pathway by BHA and tBHQ prompted us to examine whether these two compounds also differentially regulate another member of the MAPK family, JNK. To do so, we first studied the time course of JNK1 activation by tBHQ. Both HeLa cells and Hep G2 cells were treated with 500 μm tBHQ for different periods. As shown in Fig. 3 C, JNK1 activity was weakly stimulated by tBHQ, with a maximum of 2.2-fold induction in HeLa cells and 2.7-fold induction in Hep G2 cells. To exclude the possibility that JNK1 activity was measured at an unfavorable concentration, we then investigated the dose response of JNK1 activation by tBHQ. Similar to the results obtained in the kinetic studies (Fig. 3 B), no substantial JNK1 activation was observed (data not shown). Therefore, unlike BHA, tBHQ was a weak inducer of JNK1 activity. Activation of ERK2 is a consequence of serial phosphorylation of upstream kinases (28Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Among these kinases is MEK (a MAPK kinase), which activates ERK2 in response to various stimuli, such as growth factors (45Lange-Carter C.A. Pleiman C.M. Gardner A.M. Blumer K.J. Johnson G.L. Carol A. Science. 1993; 260: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) and oxidative stress (46Chen Q. Olashaw N. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28499-28502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), by phosphorylation of ERK2 on threonine and tyrosine residues in a consensus TEY motif. To determine whether BHA and tBHQ utilize a MEK-dependent pathway, we took advantage of the recently identified MEK inhibitor, PD98059 (47Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar, 48Servant M.J. Giasson E. Meloche S. J. Biol.

A kex2strain of S. cerevisiae was transformed with a C. albicans genomic DNA library and screened for the production of active α-factor. Positive clones were assayed for killer toxin activity, another Kex2-dependent phenotype. Plasmids that rescued both defects contained a sequence encoding a protein homologous to S. cerevisiae Kex2. Both alleles of the C. albicans KEX2 were inactivated by successive mutations. Null mutants continued to secrete active Sap2; however, the enzyme was abnormally processed and secreted at reduced levels. Unexpectedly, null mutants were incapable of forming hyphae, instead differentiating into aberrantly shaped cells. The ability to normally process Sap2 and form hyphae was restored upon transformation of null mutants with aKEX2-containing plasmid.

Candida albicans is an asexual, diploid yeast that normally colonizes the lumen of the alimentary tract and/or vagina of humans. Although usually commensal, it is increasingly important as an opportunistic pathogen, becoming invasive and causing significant morbidity in individuals who are immunocompromised (1Odds F.C.

The secretion of aspartyl proteinases (Saps) 1The abbreviations used are: Sap, C. albicans secreted aspartyl proteinase; YEPD, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose; YEPDA, yeast extract-peptone-dextrose-adenine; TGN, trans-Golgi network; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; 5-FOA, 5-fluoroorotic acid; kb, kilobase pair(s); bp, base pair(s). encoded by at least seven genes in C. albicans, is considered to be an important virulence attribute in the opportunistic setting (2De Bernardis F.

They resemble pepsin in structure, have broad substrate specificity, and are reproducibly induced by growth in media where protein is the sole nitrogen source (13Staib F.

SAP gene expression is correlated with the organism's yeast to hyphae transition as well as phenotypic switching. SAPs 1,2, and 3 are expressed only in yeast cells, whereas SAP4–6 expression is confined to hyphae (12Hube B. Monod M. Schofield D.A. Brown J.P. Gow N.A.R. Mol.

In the case of SAPs 4,5, and 6, only mRNA synthesis, and not Sap protein synthesis has been demonstrated in hyphae; Sap7 expression has never been detected in the laboratory at either the mRNA or protein level. Based on a comparison of the gene and mature protein sequences, it appears that all Sap enzymes are processed from a larger prepropeptide. The predicted amino-terminal portion of each Sap encodes a secretory hydrophobic leader sequence followed by a proregion, which probably maintains the protein in an inactive state. All of the Saps contain one or more consensus propeptide processing sites ending in the dipeptide Lys-Arg (16Monod M. Togni G. Hube B. Sanglard D. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These sites have been directly shown to be involved in the scission of Saps 1, 2, and 3 (17Morrison C.J. Hurst S.F. Bragg S.L. Kuykendall R.J. Diaz H. Pohl J. Reiss E. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 2030-2036Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18White T.C. Miyasaki S.H. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 6126-66133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of proproteins at the carboxyl-terminal side of Lys-Arg residues is characteristic of a family of related, subtilisin-type serine proteinases referred to as proprotein convertases (19Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Day R. Biochimie. 1994; 76: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). The prototype of these processing enzymes is the Kex2 proteinase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an enzyme involved in the activation of a secreted pheromone (α-mating factor) and a virally encoded killer toxin (20Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 37: 1075-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). A number of metazoan secretory products, including prohormones, serum proteins, and neuropeptides are converted into a biologically active form by related proprotein convertases. Assessment of the role of aspartyl proteinases in the virulenceC. albicans is complicated by the multiplicity of genes that encode the proteinases and the complexity and incongruence of their expression patterns in vitro and in vivo. Since these aspartyl proteinases are likely to be processed by a proprotein convertase-like activity, we sought to identify and genetically characterize the C. albicans KEX2-like proteinase. Given the existence of other secreted and cell surface proteins in C. albicans that contain similar Lys-Arg dipeptide proprotein cleavage sites (21Chambers R.S. Broughton M.J. Cannon R.D. Carne A.

Plate assays for proteinase production incorporated 1% agarose in the standard media and were enhanced by staining with 0.1% Amido Black in acetic acid/methanol/H2O (10:25:65), followed by destaining in acetic acid/methanol/water.

Mann C. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 157-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) used to construct a C. albicans strain WO-1 genomic library was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cloned C. albicans KEX2 gene (Fig. 1) was used to (a) generate deletion mutants that no longer complemented the kex2 defect in S. cerevisiae, (b) provide an episomal vehicle for introducing the intact gene back into C. albicans, and (c) prepare a construct for deleting, by homologous recombination, part of the gene in C. albicans. To construct functionally inactive deletion mutants of the C. albicans KEX2, a 5-kbBamHI/SalI fragment was subcloned into pBluescript; the resulting plasmid, pCK1, was then cut withHindIII to remove an internal 350-bp fragment, and ligated to itself to create pCK2. After digestion of pCK2 with BamHI and SalI, its insert was subcloned into similarly cut YCp19. For the purposes of introducing a new copy of KEX2 intoC. albicans, pCK1 was linearized with SalI and ligated to a SalI fragment of plasmid pRM10 (32Pla J. Perez-Diaz R.M. Navarro-Garcia F. Sanchez M. Nombela C. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to form pCK3. Standard procedures were used for cloning and subcloning of DNA fragments (28$$Google Scholar). Restriction/modification enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Deoxyribonucleotide stocks were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Recombinant plasmids were maintained in E. coli XL1 Blue (Stratagene). DNA sequence analysis of C. albicans KEX2 was determined by automated sequencing by the UCSF Biomedical Resource Center. Sequence comparisons against a non-redundant protein data base were performed by access to NCBI using the BLAST method (33Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70693) Google Scholar). The secretion of biologically active α-factor was used as a positive screen for complementation of the S. cerevisiae kex2mutation (20Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 37: 1075-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Sau3A partial digests (6–20 kb) of WO strainC. albicans DNA were subcloned into the BamHI site of YCp19 (31Stinchcomb D.T. Mann C. Davis R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 158: 157-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The resulting library was used to transformS. cerevisiae strain BFY106–4D; after 2 days of growth in synthetic media lacking uracil, the colonies were replica-plated over a lawn of S. cerevisiae strain RC634 (a MAT astrain supersensitive to α-factor) grown on YEPD agar, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, 0.03% methylene blue. Colonies producing a clear halo, due to pheromone-induced growth arrest, were re-streaked to yield individual colonies and tested again for the phenotype. Plasmids isolated from these colonies were used to transformE. coli XL1 Blue and reisolated, and individual plasmids were re-tested for their ability to restore α-factor secretion. As a secondary screen for complementation of the kex2 deficiency, the plasmids isolated above were assayed for their ability to restore killer factor secretion in kex2 KIL-K cells (20Julius D. Brake A. Blair L. Kunisawa R. Thorner J. Cell. 1984; 37: 1075-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The two C. albicans KEX2 alleles were sequentially disrupted by the ura-blaster method (34Alani E. Cao L. Kleckner N. Genetics. 1987; 166: 541-545Crossref Scopus (749) Google Scholar), as adapted for use in Candida (26Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 2-kb fragment resulting from the digestion of pCK1 withXhoI and SpeI (Fig. 1) was subcloned into the same sites of pBluescript. This plasmid was then digested withHindIII to release a 350-bp fragment, treated with the Klenow fragment of E. coli RNA polymerase I in the presence of all four deoxyrobonucleotides, then dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The HindIII fragment was replaced by a similarly blunt-ended SalI/BglII fragment of pMB7, which contains the C. albicans URA3 gene flanked by direct repeats of Salmonella hisG DNA (26Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in the process eliminating all HindIII sites. The plasmid was then cut with SpeI and XhoI, and the insert (KEXD) was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and electroelution. C. albicans strain CAI4 was grown in 100 ml of YEPDA (adenine at 20 μg/ml) to a density of 1–3 × 107 cells/ml and transformed with KEXD by electroporation (35Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Digests of DNA from Ura+ colonies were electrophoresed, and analyzed by Southern hybridization to assess the integrity of the KEX2 alleles; anXbaI/SpeI fragment of the the clonedKEX2 gene (Fig. 1) was randomly labeled with 32P and used as the probe. Colonies having the desired disruption were then grown in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid, to select for cells where the hisG repeats recombined, deleting the URA3 gene in the process; these ura3 cells were then transformed again with the same KEXD cassette. Culture supernatants were assayed for the presence of proteinase as described (15White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5215-5221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing, supernatants were concentrated by ultrafiltration, electrophoresed, then blotted onto PVDF membranes. Amino-terminal sequencing was performed by the UCSF Biomolecular Resource Center. Southern hybridizations of C. albicans genomic DNA with the cloned S. cerevisiae KEX2gene failed to detect a C. albicans KEX2 homologue. Taking advantage of the role of Kex2 in S. cerevisiae in the production of active α-factor in haploid mating type α cells and in the production of a virally encoded killer toxin, we proceeded to isolate the C. albicans gene by complementation of function. Four of 10,000 transformants selected on the basis of ability to grow in the absence of uracil produced a slight halo over a lawn ofsst1 cells (Fig. 2). Plasmids isolated from each of the four transformant clones contained a DNA insert of approximately 5 kb having the same restriction map. One of these plasmids (designated as pCK4) was further characterized by retesting in S. cerevisiae BFY106–4D and confirmed to complement the α-factor processing defect. As a control for the specificity of the observed phenotype, the plasmid was introduced into mating type a kex2 cells. In this case, no halo was observed, indicating that there was no unspecific growth-arresting phenotype associated with the C. albicans DNA sequence (Fig.2). When spotted on a lawn of S. cerevisiae sst1 cells,C. albicans did not produce a halo. When introduced into akex2, mating type α killer strain of S. cerevisiae, pCK4 also restored its ability to lyse neighboring sensitive cells (Fig. 2). Again, C. albicans did not demonstrate the same phenotype (Fig. 2 B). The 5-kb insert was subcloned into pBluescript, and sequence analysis from the BamHI site revealed an open reading frame, which, upon translation, yielded an amino acid sequence showing 70% identity over 37 residues with Ytp1p, a hypothetical transmembrane protein of S. cerevisiae. InS. cerevisiae, this gene is located between SIN4(TSF3) and KEX2 (36West Jr., R.W. Crivellone M.D. Ma J. Thomas S. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 169: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Sequencing from the 3′ end of the XhoI site (Fig. 1), a second open reading frame was encountered that encodes a predicted amino acid sequence homologous toS. cerevisiae KEX2, as well as related KEX2sequences in Yarrowia lipolytica, Kluyveromyces lactis, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and to the proconvertases of metazoan species. The predicted translation product (924 amino acids) of the cloned C. albicans gene (Fig.3) indicates that the encoded protein shares seven domains with its yeast counterparts: 1) an amino-terminal signal sequence terminating at Leu19, 2) an ensuing proregion with two Lys-Arg sites for probable autocatalytic cleavage, the latter ending at Arg129, 3) a catalytic domain characteristic of subtilisin-type serine proteases, with the active site Asp, His, Asn, and Ser residues in appropriate register, 4) a P domain that extends from Lys477 to Glu644, important in autocatalytic removal of the proregion (37Gluschankov P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), followed by 5) a region rich in serine and threonine residues containing a potential Lys-Arg cleavage site prior to Asp528, 6) a transmembrane domain extending from Tyr773 to Val792, and 7) at the carboxyl terminus, a highly charged cytoplasmic tail that contains the tetrapeptide YEFD, which in S. cerevisiae is important in ensuring retention in the Golgi (38Redding K. Brickner J.H. Marschall L.G. Nichoils J.W. Fuller R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 6: 6208-6217Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The predicted protein has five sites for potential N-linked glycosylation, these being located in the proregion, at the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ends of the catalytic domain, and in the Ser/Thr-rich region. ClustalW comparison (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55744) Google Scholar) of the C. albicans andS. cerevisiae KEX2 products indicates that the difference in length between the two proteins (924 versus 814 amino acids, respectively) is due to an insertion immediately following the second predicted Lys-Arg cleavage site, a longer Ser/Thr-rich domain, and a longer cytoplasmic tail. The predicted extensions in the C. albicans protein are also noted in Y. lipolytica Xrp6 (976 amino acids), but not in Kex1 of K. lactis (700 amino acids) or in Krp1 of S. pombe (709 amino acids). Similar analyses indicated that differences in size between S. cerevisiae, K. lactis, and S. pombe proteins are largely due to additions/deletions in these same regions, with the serine/threonine-rich domain demonstrating the most variability. Comparison of the C. albicans KEX2 product with that ofS. cerevisiae indicates that the most conserved domain is the catalytic one, where 65% identity and 74% similarity was observed. In the deletion construct KEXD described under “Experimental Procedures,” the active site serine was deleted (Figs. 1 and 3). To assure that the deletion of the internal HindIII fragment of KEX2inactivated its function, S. cerevisiae strain BFY106–4D was transformed with pCK2, a plasmid that contains C. albicans KEX2 without the HindIII fragment. Plasmid pCK2 did not restore the ability of α cells to make α-factor, killer toxin, or, by inference, active Kex2 (Fig. 2). Transformation of C. albicans CAI4 with the KEXD cassette yielded 10 Ura+ colonies, each of which were analyzed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 4); all contained the construct inserted in the genome by homologous recombination at one of the two KEX2 alleles; 1 of the 10 colonies had multiple tandem insertions. A strain with a single copy of the desired insertion, designated CNA1, was treated with 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) to select against the Ura+ phenotype. As a result, strain CNA2 was formed, representing the knockout of a single allele of KEX2 (Fig. 4). In the process, a single copy ofhisG was left behind at the deleted locus as confirmed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 4). The CNA2 strain, containing a single disrupted allele of KEX2 was then transformed with the same KEXD cassette. Approximately 200 Ura+ colonies were obtained in the second round of transformation. Roughly 1/20 of the transformants examined by Southern analysis contained two disruptedkex2 alleles, one with a single copy of hisG and the other with the hisG-URA3-hisGcassette (Fig. 4). One of these double knockout strains was designed CNA3 and was again treated with 5-FOA to generate the final null mutation strain CNA4, which is both kex2 and ura3(Fig. 4). Although the regulation of the SAP gene family has been widely studied in WO and 3153 cells, little is known about its regulation in other strains including the parent strain SC5314 or its Ura+derivative, CAI4, commonly used for mutational analysis in C. albicans (26Fonzi W.A. Irwin M.Y. Genetics. 1993; 134: 717-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When grown in proteinase-inducing liquid media under conditions that do not simultaneously stimulate hyphal development, C. albicans strains SC5314 and CAI4 both produced a single Sap isoenzyme, which is equivalent to Sap2 based on electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5) and Northern analyses (data not shown). In other C. albicansstrains, the expression of Saps 4–6 is inferred from the appearance of their respective mRNAs in hyphae grown under inducing conditions (12Hube B. Monod M. Schofield D.A. Brown J.P. Gow N.A.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 87-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 15White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5215-5221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, Sap 4, 5, and 6 polypeptides have never been specifically detected in any C. albicans strain. The antibody used in the present study cross-reacts with Saps 1–3, but it is not known whether it will react with other Saps; however, Coomassie-stained gels yielded a single band. We thus confined our analyses of C. albicans Sap secretion to Sap production in yeast forms of the organism. When seeded in proteinase-inducing medium at a similar density, the parent strains SC5314 and CAI4 and the knockout strains CNA1 and CNA3 grew at different rates, with CNA3 (kex2/kex2) growing the slowest. Analysis of secreted Saps in the culture medium by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed that at 24 h the wild type and heterozygous CNA1 strains produce a single Sap, Sap2, whereas homozygous kex2cells produce two antibody-reactive species, one with a faster electrophoretic mobility and another with a slower one than Sap2 (Fig.5). When the kex2/kex2 strain CNA4 was transformed with a plasmid containing C. albicans KEX2(pCK3), the antibody-reactive doublet was replaced by a single protein having the same electrophoretic mobility as Sap2; this effect was not seen in CNA4 cells transformed with pRM10 (32Pla J. Perez-Diaz R.M. Navarro-Garcia F. Sanchez M. Nombela C. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 165: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), a plasmid lackingKEX2 but having the same markers as pCK3 (Fig. 5). The homozygous knockout strain CNA4 produced less proteinase than the wild type and heterozygous parents, and this effect was only partially corrected by pCK3. After 2 days of growth, cultures of the wild type and mutant strains had each reached stationary phase. Analysis of proteinase secreted into the medium during this period was similar in result to that at 24 h, with the exception that the slower migrating band noted in the medium of Kex2 heterozygous cells at 24 h was not present after 4 days of growth. When kex2/kex2 cells were transformed with pCK3, but not pRM10, the capacity to produce a Sap consistent in electrophoretic mobility with properly processed Sap2 was restored; however, the double knockout strain still produced the faster migrating species (Fig. 5). Northern analysis of cells grown in media for 24 h indicated that all of the strains produced mRNA for Sap2, but not for Saps 1, 3, or 4–6 (data not shown). Sequencing of the Sap produced by strain CNA3 yielded the following amino-terminal sequence: RQAVP, with a preceding trace consistent with the sequence KTSK, confirming its identity as Sap2. When grown on plates for 24–48 h with bovine serum albumin as the only significant nitrogen source, kex2/kex2 cells reproducibly secreted less, or less active, proteinase than wild type or heterozygous cells, as determined by the size of the halos of hydrolyzed substrate surrounding the colonies (Fig.6). However, after 1 week of growth on solid medium, the zones of clearing surroundingkex2/kex2 cells approximated that of wild type cells. This pattern is consistent with the interpretation that the wild type cells reach stationary phase more rapidly than the double knockout strain. When left on albumin-containing media for over 10 days, the edge of the colonies ofkex2/kex2 cells was smoother in comparison to that of wild type cells. Microscopic examination revealed that the difference was a result of the failure of the homozygouskex2 strain to give rise to hyphae, although they retained the ability to form pseudohyphae and invade the agar substratum (Fig.6). When grown in RPMI 1640 or in YEPD plus serum at 37 °C, the wild type cells and heterozygous KEX2/kex2 cells both produced germ tubes within 2 h and became almost uniformly hyphal forms within 6 h (Fig. 7). Homozygous kex2/kex2 cells failed to produce hyphae under the same conditions, even after 24 h of induction; instead, the cells were enlarged, aberrantly shaped, often had multiple buds, tended to aggregate, and often had multiple nuclei. When grown in minimal media or in RPMI 1640 at 25 °C, all of the strains grew as yeast cells. Staining kex2/kex2 cells grown under hyphae-inducing conditions with calcofluor white indicated that chitin deposition, normally most intensely focused on site"

Numerous neuroregulatory activities of IL-2 have been suggested, but its expression in the normal central nervous system (CNS) is apparently very low and regionally restricted. We show by RNA and protein detection that IL-15, its specific receptor molecule, IL-15Rα, and the signal-transducing receptor subunits, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, are constitutively present in various regions of the developing and adult mouse brain. We further demonstrate, also at the single-cell level, that IL-15 and the components for IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβγ receptors are expressed by microglia. Tyrosine phosphorylation data are presented showing that IL-15 signaling in microglia involves Janus kinase 1 activity. At doses of 0.1–10 ng/ml, IL-15 affected functional properties of these cells, such as the production of nitric oxide, and supported their growth in culture, suggestive of a role as an autocrine growth factor.

IL-2 activities are not restricted to the immune system. Experimental and clinical findings show that IL-2 can evoke a variety of physiological responses and toxic alterations in the CNS (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Bearing in mind the functional similarity (although not identity) of IL-2 and IL-15, we recently proposed that a brain-intrinsic IL-15 could account for or relate to some of the neuromodulatory and neuroendocrine activities that have formerly been attributed to IL-2 (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar).IL-15 stimulates, like IL-2, the growth of activated T cells and promotes cytotoxic activity and B cell differentiation, but it is, in addition, a potent chemoattractant for T lymphocytes (1Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Waldmann T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). IL-15 was also found to displace IL-2 from its binding sites on immune cells, although both molecules do not share sequence homology (1Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Waldmann T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The striking similarity in their binding behavior and biological activities is structurally underscored by a predictably similar folding topology. This places IL-15 as a new member of the four-α-helix bundle cytokine family, to which IL-2 belongs (6Nicola N.A. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-7Google Scholar). It has been further proposed that IL-15 effects are mediated via components of the IL-2R system (1Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Waldmann T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).The conceptual model of IL-2R in hematopoietic cells depicts three single chain proteins binding IL-2 either alone or as di- and trimeric complexes associating with various enzymatic and modulatory components (7Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). IL-2Rα binds IL-2 with low affinity (k D∼ 10−8m). IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ build up the heterodimeric receptor of intermediate affinity (k D ∼ 10−9m). Upon trimerization, IL-2Rαβγ represents the high affinity IL-2 receptor (k D ∼ 10−11m). Both the IL-2R β and γ chains transmit IL-2 signals to the cytosol, while the inducible IL-2Rα has no known intracellular consequence and is regarded more as a regulator of IL-2 binding (7Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 8Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Taniguchi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 163-177PubMed Google Scholar). IL-2Rγ has been designated the “common γ chain,” γc, since it is a constituent of IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9 receptors also (7Theze J. Alzari P.M.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 1339-1348PubMed Google Scholar).To substantiate the suggested physiological contribution of the IL-15/IL-15R system to CNS functions, we analyzed the expression of IL-15 in the brain together with that of all the components required to compose functional di- and trimeric IL-15R complexes, including IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ.In addition, we addressed the question whether microglia could produce and respond to IL-15, since these cells are a major source and target of cytokine activities in the brain (13Merrill J.E. Benveniste E.N. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Microglia serve roles in tissue maturation and defense by virtue of their cytotoxic and phagocytotic abilities (14Banati R.B. Gehrmann J. Schubert P. Kreutzberg G.W. Glia. 1993; 7: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 15Davis E.J. Foster T.D. Thomas W.E. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 34: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar); probably exhibit supportive and repair functions, since they produce neurotrophic factors (16Elkabes S. DiCicco-Bloom E.M. Black I.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2508-2521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and assist in specific immune responses by taking the role of resident antigen-presenting cells (17Kreutzberg G.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3709) Google Scholar). Microglia rapidly respond to changes in brain tissue homeostasis, but their gradual activation and executive responses are under tight control (17Kreutzberg G.W. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 312-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3709) Google Scholar, 18Perry V.H. Macrophages and the Nervous System. R. G. Landes Company/CRC Press, Austin, TX1994Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, cytokines are thought to be crucially involved (13Merrill J.E. Benveniste E.N. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar).After demonstrating that microglia harbor the structural elements for IL-2 and IL-15 receptors, the next question was to ask whether IL-15 signaling involves members of the Janus kinase (JAK) family. This new group of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases plays a prominent role in the execution of cytokine effects in the immune system and is involved in signaling through IL-2R as well (19Briscoe J. Guschin D. Müller M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1033-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Our findings on a microglial production of the T cell chemoattractant, IL-15, and the widespread expression in the brain of the IL-2/IL-15 receptor system may also be relevant to the understanding of inflammatory processes, post-traumatic episodes, and the deleterious CNS side effects of immunotherapies (20Waldmann T.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21Whittington R. Faulds D. Drugs. 1993; 46: 446-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThis study demonstrates that mouse brain tissues as well as microglia in vitro express IL-15, the recently identified IL-2-like cytokine, together with its specific receptor subunit, IL-15Rα. Mouse brain and microglial cells were also found to harbor the signal-transducing subunits, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ, indispensable for assembling functional di- and trimeric IL-2 and IL-15 receptor complexes. In addition, microglial IL-15R is shown to be linked to JAK1, indicating the presence of the novel Janus kinase messenger system in these cells.The IL-15/IL-15R System Can Account for IL-2 Effects in the CNSWe recently proposed that IL-15 may be found relevant to CNS functions, most notably those that have been suggested for IL-2 (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The extensively studied cytokine IL-2 was shown to induce pronounced effects in neurons and glia of various brain regions. However, based on current evidence, there is weak anatomical match between IL-2 responsiveness/binding molecules and the expression of endogenous IL-2 in the brain, with IL-2 being hardly detectable by means of conventional immunostaining or in situ hybridization techniques (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 30Lapchak P.A. Araujo D.M. Quirion R. Beaudet A. Neuroscience. 1991; 44: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Very low brain tissue concentrations of IL-2 could relate to the sometimes very local action and extreme potency of IL-2 (31Kaplan D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 303-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, lymphocytic IL-2 was shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and may have access to IL-2R on brain cells upon massive peripheral induction (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar).IL-15, distinct by sequence but IL-2-like by activity, could well account for at least some IL-2-like effects in the CNS. We demonstrate that IL-15 and IL-15Rα transcripts are both expressed in the mouse brain throughout ontogeny. Sequencing of the cDNA products revealed identity to the immune system-derived counterparts. In addition, microglia are shown (also at the single-cell level) to serve as a cellular source for both mRNAs. These data and a recent report on IL-15 mRNA in fetal human cell cultures (32Lee Y.B. Satoh J.-I. Walker D.G. Kim S.U. Neuroreport. 1996; 7: 1062-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) together reveal IL-15 expression in CNS cells at the transcriptional level. Nevertheless, at least two mechanisms additionally control IL-15 production at post-transcriptional level (1Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Waldmann T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). First, multiple AUG start codons in the long 5′-untranslated region of human and mouse IL-15 mRNA effectively interfere with translation. Second, IL-15 contains an unusually long signal peptide with its experimental manipulation dramatically increasing IL-15 levels. It is worth emphasizing that our data also reveal IL-15 and IL-15Rα protein synthesis in vivo and in vitro, since we could extract these molecules from mouse brain tissue and microglial culture.Mouse Brain and Microglia Express IL-2R/IL-15R ComplexesThe principle of subunit sharing is a feature of many cytokine receptors (6Nicola N.A. Nicola N.A. Guidebook to Cytokines and Their Receptors. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-7Google Scholar), but in functional IL-15 receptors, it extends to the incorporation of both IL-2R signaling proteins, IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ (1Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Waldmann T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). PCR data, Northern blot, and in situ hybridization for IL-2Rβ expression have recently been reported for mouse and human brain, whereas IL-2Rγ has not yet been detected in normal brain cells or tissues, although this particular subunit is also an integral part of IL-4, IL-7, and IL-9 receptors (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar).We show that the normal CNS and, at a cellular level, microglia have the potential to form dimeric IL-2Rβγ as well as both trimeric IL-2Rαβγ and IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβγ complexes. This does not imply parallel IL-2 and IL-15 signaling per se. The relative expression levels of the proteins in a given cell may dictate trimerization favoring either IL-2 or IL-15 signaling (10Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Bertles J. Tometsko M. Loomis A. Giri J. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Valentine V. Shapiro D.N. Morris S.W. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29862-29869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 11Giri J.G. Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Park L.S. Grabstein K.H. Cosman D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). IL-2Rα was recently shown to be enhanced in microglial cells upon stimulation with LPS (33Sawada M. Suzumura A. Marunouchi T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1973-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This could suggest that under resting conditions (without stimulation) microglia may carry constitutive IL-15R (trimers), since we detected significant amounts of IL-15Rα transcripts and protein in untreated cultures. The ratio of both α subunits could itself be subject to variation during development or changes in CNS activity or homeostasis as it is similarly discussed for monocytes, T, and NK cells (7Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).JAK Kinases and Signaling through Microglial IL-2R/IL-15RThe present work shows that JAK1, the Janus-type protein-tyrosine kinase associated with IL-2Rβ in immune cells, is expressed in mouse CNS and microglia. Both JAK1 transcripts and protein were detected in extracts obtained from these cells in vitro. Stimulation of microglial cultures with IL-15 resulted in Tyr phosphorylation of JAK1, indicating that the microglial IL-15R is able to transmit a signal to the cytosol and that JAK1 has catalytic activity in this process.Members of the JAK family of protein-tyrosine kinases were recently shown to play a predominant role in cytokine receptor signaling and to physically and functionally interact with the IL-2R β and γ chains (19Briscoe J. Guschin D. Müller M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1033-1035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 34Russel S.M. Johnston J.A. Noguchi M. Kawamura M. Bacon C.M. Friedmann M. Berg M. McVicar D.W. Witthuhn B.A. Silvennoinen O. Goldman A.S. Schmalstieg F.C. Ihle J.N. O'Shea J.J. Leonard W.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1042-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). IL-2R/IL-15R stimulation in immune cells results in the phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3 and the subunits β and γ. This creates binding sites for signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins, such as STAT 3 and STAT 5, that upon phosphorylation and homo- or heterodimerization, translocate to the nucleus, where they act as activators of gene transcription (35Miyazaki T. Kawahara A. Fujii H. Nakagawa Y. Minami Y. Liu Z.J. Oishi I. Silvennoinen O. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Taniguchi T. Science. 1994; 266: 1045-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 36Johnston J.A. Bacon C.M. Finbloom D.S. Rees R.C. Kaplan D. Shibuya K. Ortaldo J.R. Gupta S. Chen Y.Q. Giri J.D. O'Shea J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8705-8709Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We also obtained preliminary evidence for IL-2Rγ protein expression in mouse brain and microglia as well as JAK3 message and protein in mouse brain (data not shown). Since JAK3 is believed to be present primarily in hematopoietic cells (37Nosaka T. van Deursen J.M. Tripp R.A. Thierfelder W.E. Witthuhn B.A. McMickle A.P. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N. Science. 1995; 270: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), microglia are the most likely candidate in the CNS. Further recruitment of cytosolic enzymes and adapters, such as p85 of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase, Shc, Grb2/Sos, Ras, and Raf, by IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ are thought to link the JAK/STAT pathway to extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) routes of signaling, which enables several ways of transcriptional activation (7Theze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar,38Satoh T. Minami Y. Kono T. Yamada K. Kawahara A. Taniguchi T. Kaziro Y. J. Biol.

This novel messenger system may prove to be of similarly basic importance for CNS cells as is now rapidly becoming apparent for immune cells.Physiological Functions and Clinical Implications of the Microglial IL-15/IL-15R SystemThe functional in vitro data, in conjunction with the demonstration of IL-15 synthesis and receptor expression, are suggestive of IL-15 being an auto/paracrine factor regulating microglial survival and function. Moreover, neural cells and brain structures found to be responsive to IL-2 will conceivably also respond to IL-15. While few regions, such as the hippocampal formation or the median eminence/arcuate nucleus, are enriched with both IL-2R and IL-2-like molecules (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), other areas may rely to a greater degree on IL-15.Microglia are known for their fast response to changes in tissue homeostasis (18Perry V.H. Macrophages and the Nervous System. R. G. Landes Company/CRC Press, Austin, TX1994Google Scholar, 42Nakajima K. Kohsaka S. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 17: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Activation of microglia following infection or trauma or during pathological alterations involves changes in their morphology, enhanced motility, expression of cell surface antigens, and increased phagocytotic and secretory activities (14Banati R.B. Gehrmann J. Schubert P. Kreutzberg G.W. Glia. 1993; 7: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 15Davis E.J. Foster T.D. Thomas W.E. Brain Res. Bull. 1994; 34: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although IL-15 did not affect microglial motility in the present experiments, it could assist in the recruitment of lymphoid cells into brain parenchyma. IL-15 is not only a growth factor but a chemoattractant for T lymphocytes, the latter feature not being shared by IL-2 (29Wilkinson P.C. Liew F.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1255-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 43McInnes I.B. al Mughales J. Field M. Leung B.P. Huang F.P. Dixon R. Sturrock R.D. Wilkinson P.C. Liew F.Y. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Microglial IL-15 may thus serve as a signal for T cell extravasation. In return, activated T cells, once in the brain, will release cytokines with established effects on macrophages, such as IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, or IL-2, shown to drive proliferation of activated microglia (33Sawada M. Suzumura A. Marunouchi T. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 1973-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reciprocal supply and shared use of cytokines by invading immune and resident brain cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, may crucially participate in the initiation and progression of CNS inflammation (13Merrill J.E. Benveniste E.N. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar,44Perry V.H. Andersson P.B. Gordon S. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 268-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar).NO is a neuromodulatory agent and is, for example, involved in IL-2-mediated release of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 45Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 3-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Released by microglia upon activation, NO is also considered a cytotoxic factor playing crucial roles in both microglia-mediated tissue defense and damage (46Merrill J.E. Ignarro L.J. Sherman M.P. Melinek J. Lane T.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2132-2141PubMed Google Scholar). We observed that IL-15 and IL-2 modulate microglial NO production, indicative of their involvement in the regulation of this microglial activity. Increasing concentrations of IL-15 attenuated LPS-induced NO production, while IL-2 had the opposite effect; thus, the sharing of receptor subunits does not imply identical physiological consequences (1Tagaya Y. Bamford R.N. DeFilippis A.P. Waldmann T.A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 11Giri J.G. Anderson D.M. Kumaki S. Park L.S. Grabstein K.H. Cosman D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Indeed, functional differences between IL-2 and IL-15 are known from immune cells. They may result from the actual availability of α receptor proteins, a yet unknown signaling contribution of the longer IL-15Rα cytoplasmic domain or the different ligand-receptor interactions, since the IL-15·IL-2Rβγ complex is less stable than the IL-2·IL-2Rβγ trimer (9de Jong J.L. Farner N.L. Widmer M.B. Giri J.G. Sondel P.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1339-1348PubMed Google Scholar).Finally, expression of IL-2R/IL-15R by neural cells may relate to CNS and neuroendocrine side effects associated with either the enhancement or suppression of IL-2Rβγ signaling during immunotherapies (20Waldmann T.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,21Whittington R. Faulds D. Drugs. 1993; 46: 446-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar).ConclusionThe rodent CNS expresses an IL-15/IL-15Rα system together with the IL-2R subunits β and γ that are shared for signaling by both IL-15 and IL-2. IL-15 and IL-15Rα/IL-2Rβγ are widely distributed across brain tissues. Endogenous IL-15 may thus relate to several CNS effects that have formerly been described for IL-2. Microglia are proposed to be an ubiquitous carrier of the IL-15/IL-15R system throughout the brain and to respond to IL-15, also in an autocrine manner. Microglial IL-15 could play a pivotal role in CNS inflammation by assisting the extravasation of T lymphocytes. The demonstration of IL-15-inducible JAK1 phosphorylation in microglia indicates the presence of functional JAK/STAT signaling pathways in these brain cells. Future studies on IL-2/IL-15 functions in the CNS will unravel how their receptor signaling is integrated in neural cell physiology.

IL-2 activities are not restricted to the immune system. Experimental and clinical findings show that IL-2 can evoke a variety of physiological responses and toxic alterations in the CNS (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Bearing in mind the functional similarity (although not identity) of IL-2 and IL-15, we recently proposed that a brain-intrinsic IL-15 could account for or relate to some of the neuromodulatory and neuroendocrine activities that have formerly been attributed to IL-2 (5Hanisch U.K. Quirion R. Brain Res. Rev. 1996; 21: 246-284Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). IL-15 stimulates, like IL-2, t"

K., Ramshaw, J. A. M., Kirkpatrick, A., Shah, C., and Brodsky, B. (1996)Biochemistry 35, 10262–10268). All Gly-X-Y guest triplets led to a decrease in melting temperature from the host (Gly-Pro-Hyp)8 peptide except for Gly-Pro-Arg. In this Gly-Pro-Hyp-rich environment, Gly-Pro-Arg was found to be as stabilizing as Gly-Pro-Hyp. Decreased stability of host-guest peptides containing Gly-Pro-Lys, Gly-Pro-homo-Arg, and Gly-Arg-Hyp compared with Gly-Pro-Arg indicated a stabilization that is optimal for Arg and specific to theY-position. Arg was found to have a similar stabilizing effect when residues other than Pro are in the X-position. Both Arg and Hyp stabilize the triple-helix preferentially in theY-position in a stereospecific manner and occupy largelyY-positions in collagen. However, contiguous Gly-Pro-Hyp units are highly stable and promote triple-helix folding, whereas incorporation of multiple Gly-Pro-Arg triplets was destabilizing and folded slowly due to charge repulsion. In collagen, Gly-Pro-Arg may contribute maximally to local triple-helix stability while also having the potential for electrostatic interactions in fibril formation and binding.

The triple-helix conformation is a major protein motif found in the collagen family and in a number of host-defense proteins (1Brodsky B. Ramshaw J.A.M. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The collagen triple-helix is composed of three polypeptide chains, each in a polyproline II-like helix, that are folded around each other in a supercoiled rod-like structure (2Rich A. Crick F.H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1961; 3: 483-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 3Ramachandran G.N. Ramachandran G.N. Treatise on Collagen. 1. Academic Press, New York1967: 103-183Google Scholar, 4Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). A consequence of this folding pattern is that only Gly is small enough to fit as every third residue in each polypeptide chain where the three chains pack in close proximity. This steric constraint generates the repeating sequence pattern (Gly-X-Y) n , where proline (Pro) is frequently found in the X-position while hydroxyproline (Hyp) 1Standard three-letter code is used to describe peptide sequences, with Hyp and homoArg representing hydroxyproline and homoarginine, respectively; notation for the peptides studied is given in Table I. is frequently found in the Y-position. Studies on collagens and peptides show that the sequence Gly-Pro-Hyp is the most stabilizing tripeptide unit for the triple-helix conformation (5Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H.

Imino acid residues favor triple-helix formation entropically because their φ and ψ angles are sterically constrained close to the values found in collagen chains.

Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A highly stereospecific effect of Hyp in the Y-position is indicated by the dramatic destabilization when Hyp is in the X- rather than the Y-position, when 4-Hyp is replaced by 3-Hyp, or when the hydroxyl group is placed in the opposite orientation with respect to the pyrrolidine ring (cis-Hyp) (9Burjanadze T.V.

Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic investigations indicated that the additional stabilization by Hyp is a result of hydrogen bonding (11Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 1-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar), and a recently solved crystal structure showed its pivotal role in a highly ordered, water-mediated hydrogen bonding network (4Bella J. Eaton M. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Science. 1994; 266: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar, 12Bella J. Brodsky B. Berman H.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 393-906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Because of its stabilizing nature, Gly-Pro-Hyp tripeptides were used as a basis for a host peptide sequence, within which a guest triplet is introduced into a common stabilizing framework (13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Host-guest peptides have previously been shown to be a valuable tool for understanding the propensity of different amino acids for α-helical (14O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1990; 250: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 15Wojcik J. Altmann K.H. Scheraga H.A. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 121-134Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and β-sheet structures (16Smith C.K. Withka J.M. Regan L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5510-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A stable triple-helix conformation was adopted by host-guest peptides of the design Ac(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-X-Y-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH2, and the stability varied with the specific Gly-X-Y triplet introduced in the guest position. Incorporation of the most common non-polar residues in collagen (Ala, Leu, Phe) in the X- or Y-positions of the guest triplet decreased the thermal stability relative to the host (Gly-Pro-Hyp)8 peptide (13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also been carried out on host-guest peptides incorporating individual charged residues or pairs of oppositely charged residues in the X- and Y-positions (27Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (in press)Google Scholar). An unexpected observation was that the Gly-Pro-Arg host-guest peptide showed a stability comparable to the Gly-Pro-Hyp-containing host peptide, a stability greater than seen for all other charged, as well as uncharged, triplets (13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 17Shah N.K. Sharma M. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5878-5883Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The surprisingly high stability of the host-guest peptide with a Gly-Pro-Arg guest triplet prompted further investigations to clarify the interactions of arginine in the triple-helical structure. Peptides related to the Gly-Pro-Arg host-guest peptide were designed to evaluate the critical features in the Arg side chain and to investigate whether the high stability is conferred by multiple Gly-Pro-Arg triplets. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 430A Synthesizer using the standard FastMoc (Applied Biosystems) method on Fmoc-RINK (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl-RINK) resin. Side chain protection groups used were t-butyl for Hyp, benzyloxycarbonyl for Lys, and pentamethylchroman-sulfonyl for Arg. The N and C termini were blocked by acetylation and amidation, respectively, to increase stability (18Venugopal M.C. Ramshaw J.A.M. Braswell E. Zhu D. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7948-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and eliminate charges at locations other than the guest triplet. A host-guest peptide containinghomoArg was synthesized from the peptide containing Gly-Pro-Lys guest triplet by reaction of the peptide (5% in water) with 0.5 m 1-guanyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazole nitrate (Aldrich) at pH 9.0 for 8 days at 20 °C (19Lindeberg E.G.G. Melin P. Larsson L.-E. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1976; 8: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reversed phase HPLC 3The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; T m , melting temperature; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. on a Shimadzu HPLC system using a YMC C-18 column (20 × 250 mm). Composition and identity of the peptides were confirmed by amino acid analysis, using a Waters HPLC system with ninhydrin detection, and by laser desorption mass spectrometry using a Brucker MALDI-TOF instrument. CD spectra were recorded in quartz cells of 1-mm path length on an Aviv model 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a Hewlett-Packard Peltier thermoelectric temperature controller. Peptides were dried in vacuo over P2O5 for 48 h prior to weighing to prepare solutions of 1 mg/ml. Generally, peptides were dissolved in PBS (10 mm sodium phosphate and 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.0) and were equilibrated at 4 °C for at least 48 h before CD measurements. Other buffers used were 0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, or 0.1 m acetic acid, pH 2.7. Thermal stability measurements were carried out as described previously (13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Transition curves were normalized and corrected for monomer and trimer contributions (5Engel J. Chen H.T. Prockop D.J. Klump H. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 601-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7948-7956Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Melting temperatures (T m ) were taken at a fraction folded of 0.5. Peptides (c = 1 mg/ml in PBS) were denatured at 70 °C for 15 min and were then rapidly cooled by quenching in an ice-salt bath at about −6 °C prior to transfer into a 1-mm CD cell precooled to 5 °C, as described previously (20Yang W. Battineni M.L. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6930-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Ellipticity at 225 nm was followed for 3 h. The CD spectrum of the Gly-Pro-Arg host-guest peptide (GPR) showed the characteristics of a triple-helix with a maximum at 225 nm at 2 °C (in PBS, pH 7.0), and heating resulted in a sharp transition with aT m of 45.5 °C (Fig.1; TableI). This T m value is the same as observed for the most stable (Gly-Pro-Hyp)8host peptide (GPO) under identical conditions (Table I). This indicates that in the Gly-Pro-Hyp-rich environment of the host peptide, Gly-Pro-Arg has a stabilizing influence as great as that of Gly-Pro-Hyp. The T m value of 45.5 °C observed for GPO and GPR peptides represents the maximum stability observed for the host-guest peptides studied thus far.Table IPeptide sequences and their melting temperatures T mPeptideSequenceT m°CGPOAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)8-Gly-Gly-NH245.51-aIn agreement within experimental error limits with that previously reported (13).GPRAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Pro-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH245.5GROAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Arg-Hyp-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH240.6GPKAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Pro-Lys-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH236.8GPhRAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Pro-homoArg -(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH242.8GAOAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Ala-Hyp-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH239.91-aIn agreement within experimental error limits with that previously reported (13).GARAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Ala-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH238.2GAKAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Ala-Lys-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Gly-NH230.8RRAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly-Pro-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)2-Gly-Gly-NH240.4RORAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)3-Gly-Pro-Arg-Gly-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Pro-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)2-Gly-Gly-NH242.2ROORAc(Gly-Pro-Hyp)2-Gly-Pro-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)2-Gly-Pro-Arg-(Gly-Pro-Hyp)2-Gly-Gly-NH242.8GPR8Ac(Gly-Pro-Arg)8-Gly-Gly-NH232.61-bMeasured in 2 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0.Measurements were performed in PBS, pH 7.0, except for peptide GPR8.1-a In agreement within experimental error limits with that previously reported (13Shah N.K.

Open table in a new tab Measurements were performed in PBS, pH 7.0, except for peptide GPR8. To investigate whether the stability is related to the presence of phosphate in PBS, the melting curve for GPR was also examined in acetic acid at pH 2.7 and Tris/HCl at pH 7.0. In both these systems, theT m value remained the same, indicating that the unexpectedly high T m for GPR occurs in different buffers and at acidic as well as neutral pH. Additional host-guest peptides were designed to dissect the contributions of charge, side chain functional group, and length of the side chain to the unusually high stability of the Gly-Pro-Arg peptide. Peptide GPK (Table I), which also has a positively charged side chain in theY-position, was examined under the same set of buffer conditions. This peptide had a T m of 36.8 °C, almost 8 °C lower than GPR (Fig. 1, Table I) and somewhat less than that of the Gly-Pro-Ala-containing host-guest peptide GPA (T m = 38.3 °C) (13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), indicating that a positive charge in the Y-position is not by itself sufficient to confer the maximal stability for this peptide set. To explore the influence of the side chain length of the arginine and thus the spatial specificity of the guanidino group relative to the peptide backbone, a peptide incorporating homoArg (GPhR) was studied (Table I). The side chain ofhomoArg has a guanidino group but is 1 CH2 unit longer than that of Arg. The T m of GPhR was 42.8 °C. The value is somewhat lower than seen for GPR, and it is possible that increased mobility of the lengthened side chain leads to a 3 °C decrease in stability. The T m of GPhR is 6 °C higher than GPK and 5 °C higher than GPA, indicating that the guanidino group in homoArg is still conferring a positive stabilizing influence on the triple-helix. Host-guest peptides discussed thus far are of the form Gly-Pro-Y. To investigate whether the proline preceding arginine is a determining factor in the high stability of GPR, a series of 3 additional host-guest peptides with Gly-Ala-Y guest triplets were examined. The T m values were 39.9 °C for GAO, 38.2 °C for GAR, and 30.8 °C for GAK (Fig. 1, Table I). These results follow the general trends seen for Gly-Pro-Y guest triplets, suggesting that the stabilizing effect of Arg in the Y-position also occurs when residues other than a proline are in the X-position. In the highly stable GPR peptide, Arg is present in the Y-position of the Gly-X-Y guest triplet. To investigate whether the stabilizing effect of Arg occurs in the X- as well as in theY-position, peptide GRO was examined (Table I). TheT m of GRO is 40.6 °C, about 5 °C lower than GPR (Fig. 1, Table I). This indicates that Arg is more stabilizing in the Y-position than in the X-position of the guest triplet, even though GRO contains the stabilizing Hyp residue. This contrasts with all other guest triplets studied so far, where placement of a non-polar or ionizable residue in theY-position is more destabilizing than in theX-position. For example, the host-guest peptide Gly-Pro-Leu is less stable than Gly-Leu-Hyp (13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and GPK is less stable than GKO (27Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (in press)Google Scholar). The preference of non-polar residues for theX-position has been explained in part on the basis of steric hindrance of the Y-position residue with the neighboring chain (13Shah N.K. Ramshaw J.A.M. Kirkpatrick A. Shah C. Brodsky B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10262-10268Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Bansal M. Ramachandran G.N. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1978; 11: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The only residue besides Arg which is more favorable in the Y-position than in the X-position is Hyp. The peptide (Hyp-Pro-Gly)10 with Hyp in theX-position is unstable, while (Pro-Hyp-Gly)10with Hyp in the Y-position has T m of 58 °C (10Inouye K. Kobayashi Y. Kyogoku Y. Kishida Y. Sakakibara S. Prockop D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 219: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This preference of arginine and hydroxyproline for theY-position suggests a similarity in their stabilizing effect. It has been shown that clustering of Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets magnifies its stabilizing effect (7Germann H.P. Heidemann E. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To further test the equivalence between Gly-Pro-Arg and Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets, the peptide (Gly-Pro-Arg)8 (GPR8) was compared with the host peptide (Gly-Pro-Hyp)8 (GPO). In contrast to the high triple-helix content and stability of GPO, GPR8 showed little sign of triple-helix in its CD spectrum after 48 h at 4 °C in PBS. However, after incubating GPR8 at 4 °C for 28 days, the ellipticity ([θ]225 = +1300 degrees·cm2·dmol−1) indicated the presence of about 30% triple-helix content. Increasing GPR8 concentration to 3 mg/ml resulted in an almost completely triple-helical structure after 28 days at 4 °C. In the presence of 2 m NaCl, the peptide reached a fully triple-helical conformation within 14 days, and this refolded sample had a T m of 32.6 °C (TableI). The inability of GPR8 to form a triple-helix in PBS at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and its salt dependence suggests that a high density of positive charge may hinder triple-helix formation. To better define such charge repulsion, two Gly-Pro-Arg triplets were integrated into the host-guest peptide set. The two Gly-Pro-Arg triplets were separated by either zero (RR), one (ROR), or two Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets (ROOR) (Table I). Peptide RR had a T m of 40.4 °C, a reduction of about 5 °C compared with GPR (Table I, Fig.2). This is likely due in part to charge repulsion between neighboring charged triplets. Separation of the two Gly-Pro-Arg triplets by either one or two Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets, in ROR or ROOR, respectively, increased the stability to near 42 °C (TableI, Fig. 2), suggesting that charge repulsion is eliminated with one or more intervening Gly-Pro-Hyp tripeptides. Regardless of their separation, the thermal stability of peptides with two Gly-Pro-Arg triplets stayed lower than that with single Gly-Pro-Arg triplet. Although this might result from the presence of two Gly-Pro-Arg triplets, it can also reflect a limitation of the peptide design, since the placement of the second Gly-Pro-Arg triplet at a different position with respect to the termini could affect its overall stability. In addition to its stabilizing influence, hydroxyproline residues have been shown to accelerate the folding of the triple-helix (23Chopra R.K. Ananthanarayanan V.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 4M. H. Li, J. Baum, and B. Brodsky, unpublished results. The folding of GPO was faster than for all other host-guest peptides studied and did not fit well to first, second, or third order kinetics. 5M. Ackerman, J. A. M. Ramshaw, B. Brodsky, unpublished results. Even though GPR has the same maximal stability as GPO, it shows a slower folding and fits second order kinetics (Fig. 3). The folding rates of GPR-related peptides were compared, and all fit second order kinetics, in the following order: GPR ≅ GPhR > GPK > RR ≅ ROR ≅ ROOR (Fig. 4), whereas the order of relative stabilities is: GPR > GPhR ≅ ROR = ROOR > RR > GPK. This indicates that there is no simple relationship between stability and folding, and different features must be involved in these two properties. The data suggest that charge repulsion delays folding, which would explain the slower folding of GPR, where the positively charged Arg from 3 chains must come together, compared with GPO. This is consistent with the slow folding rate seen for all three peptides with two Gly-Pro-Arg triplets and also supported by the extremely slow folding seen for GPR8 and the accelerated folding observed in the presence of high ionic strength (Fig. 3).Figure 4Potential of Arg for direct H-bond formation in peptide GPR. Schematic illustration of the locations of the H-bonds within the triple-helix. Regions of two of the three chains in the triple-helix are shown (Chains A and B) and the residues involved in H-bonding are indicated (Chain A, residues 3–28; Chain B, residues 33–58).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results indicate stabilization of the triple-helix when Arg is in theY-position of a Gly-X-Y triplet. The Arg stabilization must relate to the nature of the guanidino group of Arg and its interaction with the peptide backbone and/or with the water network in the triple-helix. Arg is unique in its hydrogen bonding capacity, with up to five potential bonding sites (24Richardson J.S. Richardson D. Fasman G.D. Prediction of Protein Structure and the Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, New York1989: 1-98Crossref Google Scholar). Computational modeling (SYBYL 6.2) shows that the guanidino group in the Gly-Pro-Arg sequence of the host-guest peptide can participate in direct hydrogen bonding to the peptide backbone carbonyl groups within the same chain or to the Arg carbonyl group of the neighboring chain (Fig.4), in agreement with previous reports (25Vitagliano L. Nemethy G. Zagari A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7354-7359Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When one NH is hydrogen-bonded to a backbone carbonyl, additional constraints are conferred on the remaining hydrogen bonding sites of the guanidino group, and these could participate in the ordered hydration network of the triple-helix. However, similar hydrogen bonding schemes are possible for peptides GPK, GPhR, and GRO, and in fact, their enthalpy values are as great or greater than that of peptide GPR (27Chan V.C. Kirkpatrick A. Ramshaw J.A.M. Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272 (in press)Google Scholar) (data not shown). When Arg is in theY-position, the limited mobility of its side chain compared with that of Lys and homoArg may restrict the hydrogen bonding to sites favorable for an optimal hydration network, similar to that seen for Hyp. The inclusion of triplets with Arg in the Y-position provides an alternative to hydroxyproline residues in generating highly stabilized regions of triple-helix. This may explain the high frequency of occurrence of Arg in collagens and the preponderance of Arg residues in the Y-position (26Dolz R. Heidemann E. Biopolymers. 1986; 25: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For example, Gly-X-Arg tripeptide sequences constitute 13% of all triplets in fibril-forming collagens. The highT m value observed for the host-guest peptide containing a single Gly-Pro-Arg triplet provides a potential strategy for stabilization of triple-helical structures without the need for hydroxylation of Pro residues. This strategy could have application to the production of collagen-like molecules in prokaryotic expression systems, which lack the enzymes for post-translational modification of Pro residues to Hyp (22Cappello J. Ferrari F. Mobley D.P. Plastics from Microbes. Hanser Publishers, New York1994: 35-92Google Scholar). The results on peptides indicate a limitation on inclusion of multiple Gly-Pro-Arg triplets, since proximal charged triplets can destabilize the triple-helix, but incorporation of selected Gly-X-Arg triplets could enhance stability. Collagen function requires formation of a stable triple-helical molecule at body temperature, molecular association to form fibrils or other higher order structures, and the binding to cells and other extracellular matrix components. Gly-Pro-Hyp triplets are known to provide high stability for the triple-helix but do not have the capability for specific interactions. The observation that under certain circumstances Gly-Pro-Arg can confer similar stability as Gly-Pro-Hyp provides a unique example of a tripeptide sequence which is contributing maximally to triple-helix stability and also has the potential for electrostatic interactions in fibril formation and binding. We wish to acknowledge Dr. Konrad Beck for many helpful comments and ideas in writing this manuscript."

The presence of the norvaline was confirmed by several analytical methods such as amino acid analysis, peptide mapping, electrospray mass spectrometry, and Edman protein sequencing. It appears that substitution is distributed across both the β- and di-α-globins in purified recombinant hemoglobin. The level of misincorporation correlated with the ratio of the free norvaline/leucine pool available in the cell culture. This suggests that the incorporation of norvaline for leucine occurs through misaminoacylation of tRNALeu, similar to the misincorporation of norleucine for methionine found in many recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli.

We used a variety of analytical tools such as amino acid analysis, peptide mapping, Edman sequencing, and a several mass spectrometry techniques. Our results demonstrate that the misincorporation of norvaline is affected by fermentation conditions. The extent to which misincorporation occurs strongly correlates with the ratio of free norvaline to leucine found in the total pool of lysed bacterial cells in fermentation broth. In purified recombinant hemoglobin, the misincorporation appears to occur specifically at leucine positions and is distributed across both the β- and di-α-globins. We hypothesize that norvaline misincorporation may occur in other heterologous proteins expressed in Escherichia coli under conditions where norvaline can be produced and accumulated during the expression phase. Recombinant hemoglobin (rHb1.1) expressed in E. coli is a human hemoglobin stabilized by the fusion of two α chains through a glycine linking the carboxyl terminus of the first α chain to the amino terminus of the second α chain (di-α-globin). At the amino termini of both the di-α- and the β-globin chains of rHb1.1, the wild type valine residues have been replaced with methionine residues. In addition, rHb1.1 also contains the Presbyterian mutation (Asn108 → Lys) in the β chain of the molecule which confers reduced oxygen affinity (17Hoffman S. Looker D.L. Roehrich J.M. Cozart P.E.

In contrast, typical E. coli proteins contain on average 8.4% of leucine (16Neidhardt F.C. Umbarger H.E. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1.

That distinction classifies hemoglobin as a leucine-rich protein, which under certain conditions appears to trigger norleucine and norvaline production in E. coli in a manner similar to that postulated by Bogosian (1Bogosian G.

The leucine codons at positions 110 and 141 in the β-globin were replaced by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the carboxyl-terminal region of β using two DNA primers in which the CUA codons were replaced by a sequence creating CUG codons. The primers were CBG111 (5′-GGTAAAGTACTGGTTTGCGTT-3′) and CBG112 (5′-AAAACAGAAGCTTCATTAGTGGTATTTGTGAGCCAGCGCGTTAGC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with restriction enzymesScaI and HindIII and ligated into the identically digested beta gene in plasmid pSGE720, replacing the original coding sequence including the rare codons for leucine. These leucine codon mutations removed SpeI and NheI restriction sites so clones were digested with these enzymes to eliminate any background carryover, and the digest was transformed into competent E. coli cells by the method of Hanahan (21Hanahan D. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 1. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 109-135Google Scholar). Correct codon replacement clones were identified by resistance to SpeI andNheI restriction digestion and confirmed by dideoxy DNA sequencing using the Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) kit and protocol. The strain resulting from the replacement of the two rare codons was SGE2770, containing plasmid pSGE761, identical to pSGE720 except for the A to G change in the two β leucine codons. The sequence of proteins and peptides was determined by automated Edman degradation chemistry using a Porton 2090 gas phase sequencer. Beckman peptide supports were used as recommended. Phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were identified by reversed phase chromatography on a modified Hewlett-Packard 1090L HPLC using a Hewlett-Packard AminoQuant column. Protein and peptides were subjected to gas phase hydrolysis at 165 °C for 1 h in the presence of HCl containing 1% phenol using a Savant AP100 AminoPrep Hydrolyzer. Amino acids were analyzed using pre-column derivatization with 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate (AQC). The standard AccQ-Tag method was used for derivatization of amino acids (22Strydom D.J. Cohen S.A. Angeletti R.H. Techniques in Protein Chemistry IV. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 299-306Crossref Google Scholar). AQC derivatives of amino acids were separated on a HP 1090IIM using a NovaPack C18 (2 × 150 mm) column. Solvent A was diluted AccQ-Tag Eluant A from Waters (1000 ml of water, 85 ml of concentrated Eluant A). Solvent B was 60% acetonitrile in HPLC grade water. Separation was performed using the following gradient conditions: 0 min, 0.0% B; 0.5 min, 2.0% B; 13.0 min, 7.0% B; 170 min, 10.0% B; 23.0 min, 21.0% B; 27.0 min, 22.0% B; 30.0 min, 22.0% B; 41.0 min, 44.0% B; 42.0 min, 100% B; and 46.) min, 100% B. Column temperature was 35 °C and flow rate was 0.250 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 254 nm and additionally by fluorescent detection with an excitation wavelength of 254 nm and an emission wavelength of 395 nm. A typical load was 2.5 μg of hydrolyzed protein in 2.5 μl. A modified OPA pre-column derivatization was used for quantitation of norvaline (23Fiorino A. Frigo G. Cucchetti E. J. Chromatogr. 1989; 476: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Fleming J. Terrell L. Taylor T. Miller C. Woodward C. Hewlett-Packard Application Note 228–212. Hewlett-Packard Co., 1992Google Scholar). Hydrolyzed protein and peptides were derivatized in-line with OPA and injected on an AminoQuant RP column at 35 °C. To improve resolution of Nva from surrounding amino acids, the elution gradient was modified as follows: 0 min, 5% B, 0.45 ml/min flow; 0.1 min, 5.0% B, 0.45 ml/min flow; 1.0 min, 15.0% B, 0.45 ml/min flow; 10 min, 30% B, 0.45 ml/min flow; 12 min, 35% B, 0.45 ml/min flow; 20.0 min, 36% B, 0.45 ml/min flow; 30 min, 70% B, 0.45 ml/min flow; 32 min, 100% B, 0.60 ml/min flow; and 35 min, 100% B, 0.60 ml/min flow. 1-ml samples of fermentation broth were collected and stored at −80 °C until analyzed. Prior to analysis, samples were thawed and lysed by sonication for 1 min on ice. Lysate was filtered through 3K Centricon membranes and analyzed for content of free amino acids using the modified OPA method described above. Fresh cell broth was spun down and the supernatant was immediately frozen at −20 °C. Thawed supernatant was analyzed for pyruvate by HPLC using an Aminex HPX-87H column (from Bio-Rad) employing isocratic elution with 0.004 nH2SO4 as recommended by the manufacturer. Recombinant hemoglobin was diluted to 2 mg/ml in HPLC-grade water. Where specified, globin was precipitated with 20 volumes of cold 0.6% HCl in acetone and solubilized in 2% (v/v) formic acid to a final concentration of 2 mg/ml. 100 μg of protein was injected onto a HP 1090IIM using a Zorbax CBC3 HPLC analytical column (0.46 × 25 cm) at 40 °C. Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was regulated at 1 ml/min. Gradient conditions were as follows: 35% solvent B for 5 min, then the percentage of B was increased to 49% over 45 min. Eluant was monitored at 215, 280, and 400 nm. Electrospray mass spectra were obtained using a Vestec electrospray source and a model 201 single quadrupole mass spectrometer with a 2000 atomic mass unit range. Samples were delivered to the source by direct infusion at 1.6 μl/min. Horse heart myoglobin at a concentration of 0.02 mg/ml was used daily to calibrate the instrument. Distribution of norvaline substitution was obtained using LC-MS Finnigan MAT SSQ 710C single quadrupole mass spectrometer with a Finnigan MAT electrospray ionization source. The quadrupole was calibrated on the day of analysis with an MRFA tetrapeptide/apomyoglobin solution using standard procedures. Mass spectrometer and source parameters have been optimized for LC-MS analysis and were as follows: electrospray ionization source voltage, 4500 V; electrospray ionization N2 sheath gas, 60 p.s.i.; heated capillary, 250 °C; scan range, 500–2000m/z in 2 s; split flow, 1:100. The HPLC system used in this study was a TSP 4100MS with an HP1050 autosampler and an ABI785A absorbance detector. Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease was used to map recombinant hemoglobin. V8 mapping of the entire hemoglobin molecule was performed without separating the globin chains. The protein was precipitated with acetone containing 0.6% (v/v) HCl and reduced and alkylated with vinylpyridine in specified experiments. After alkylation, the chains were desalted using a PD-10 disposable column (Sephadex G-25M), 2% (v/v) formic acid mobile phase. Dried globins (alkylated or nonalkylated) were reconstituted in 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4, containing 2 m urea. The conditions for this digest were 1:30 enzyme/substrate (w/w) with an overnight incubation at room temperature. The following day, additional V8 protease was added to bring the final enzyme/substrate ratio to 1:25 (w/w), and the incubation was continued for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The products of the V8 digestion were separated on a 4.6 × 250 mm Vydac C4 HPLC column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B was 70% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were eluted isocratically with 5% solvent B for 5 min, and then solvent B was increased to 70% over 65 min. The absorbance was monitored at 215 and 400 nm. Tryptic mapping was performed using Porozyme trypsin cartridges (25Lippincott J. Hess E. Apostol I. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Davis M.T. Lee T.D.

The peptides were eluted starting with 1% solvent B at 25 min, and then solvent B was increased to 50% over 65 min. Solvent A was 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The absorbance was monitored at 215 and 400 nm. Oxygen equilibrium was measured using a Hemox analyzer, and values ofp 50 and n max were calculated as described previously (17Hoffman S. Looker D.L. Roehrich J.M. Cozart P.E. Durfee S. Tedesco J.L.

In the case of sample B, we observed distinct shouldering in front of the main β-globin and di-α-globin peaks. These shoulders were not visible in the globin peaks of control sample A. AQC amino acid analysis of the isolated main β- and di-α-globins and isolated shouldering fractions (see Fig. 1 for fraction collection) were in general agreement with the expected composition (TableI). Amino acid analysis of the di-α-globin showed low recovery of the methionine (3.4versus expected 5 residues). This is due to approximately 40% methylation of the amino-terminal methionine in the di-α chain (27Apostol I. Aitken J. Levine J. Lippincott J. Davidson J.S. Abbott-Brown D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2616-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In the case of both shouldering fractions, recovery of methionine was discernibly increased relative to the respective main fraction, and in both shouldering fractions the methionine peak was atypically broad, possibly suggesting the presence of an unusual or modified amino acid in these fractions eluting closely to the methionine peak in our amino acid analysis. Later it was found that the AQC derivative of norvaline elutes very close to methionine causing overestimation of methionine content (see Fig. 4). LC-MS analysis of hemoglobin sample B showed a mass loss of 14 ± 1.2 Da for the shouldering fraction on the βversus the main fraction and a mass loss of 10 ± 6.6 Da for the shouldering fraction on the di-α versus the main fraction (Table II). It should be noted that the observed mass of the di-α chain (30,329.3 ± 3.5) was significantly higher than expected (30,323.9). We ascribe this discrepancy to methylation of 40% the di-α-globin amino-terminal methionine (27Apostol I. Aitken J. Levine J. Lippincott J. Davidson J.S. Abbott-Brown D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2616-2618Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), which translates to an expected 5.6 Da mass gain over the predicted mass for the di-α-globin.Table IAmino acid analysis of isolated fractions of the di-α- and the β-globinsAmino acidsResidues/moleculeDi-αβExpectedMain peakFront shoulderExpectedMain peakFront shoulderAsp2423.0823.741211.8912.14Ser2222.4722.5954.864.97Glu1010.2511.601110.9411.24Gly1515.9916.691313.5913.37His2020.1319.6499.428.95Arg66.696.8633.273.17Thr1817.1216.9177.146.60Ala4240.2840.451514.7714.92Pro1414.4614.3577.217.09Tyr66.866.1133.603.38Val2525.1124.741716.5016.75Met53.414.8121.812.83Lys2221.8622.221211.9511.73Ile000.45000Leu3635.8733.881817.4316.88Phe1414.4213.9788.187.99 Open table in a new tab Figure 4Chromatograms from AQC amino acid analyses of G peptide, pre-G peptide, and amino acid standards (125 pmol) spiked with an equimolar amount of norvaline.

Open table in a new tab The same fractions were used in amino acid analysis. A control sample A of rHb1.1 and sample B containing a new modification were mapped with V8 proteinase (Fig.2 A). Prior to the digestion both samples were alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine. V8 does not cleave at all available Glu sites and therefore generates a rather simple and consistent peptide set for rHb1.1 (Fig. 2 B). V8 mapping of sample B showed small differences when compared with control sample A (Fig. 2 A). A small difference peak was seen in front of the G peptide (carboxyl-terminal peptide from the β-globin), and another small difference peak is visible in front of the M peptide (internal peptide from the di-α-globin). Mass analysis (TableIII) of these difference peptides indicated that they each exhibited a mass loss of approximately 14 Da when compared with their respective neighboring peptides G and M. This mass loss was strikingly similar to the mass difference found between the leading shoulder fractions of the β- and di-α-globins and their respective main peaks (Table II and Fig. 1). These difference peptides were isolated and further characterized.Table IIIMass analysis of the peptides isolated from V8 mapping of hemoglobin sample BPeptide IDMass [Da]ExpectedObservedDifferenceA.

Open table in a new tab V8 peptide mapping of the nonalkylated globin showed improved separation of the M and N peptides and additionally revealed a pre-N peptide eluting at the back side of the M peptide which was not evident in the map of the alkylated globins (chromatogram not shown). Mass analysis is included in Table IIIB. Electrospray mass spectra of the pre-G difference peptide (which showed an asymmetric elution profile in the peptide map suggestive of more than one component) showed an envelope indicative of a single component with mass loss of 14 Da when compared with the G peptide (Table III). Edman protein sequencing confirmed that the pre-G peptide has the same amino-terminal sequence as the G peptide. However, during further sequencing we observed partial substitution of norvaline for leucine at positions 110, 114, and 141 (cycles 9, 14, and 40). Fig. 3 shows an example chromatogram detecting both Leu and Nva at position 110 in cycle 9. The level of norvaline substitution in the pre-G peptide varies at each position with about 25% at position 110, more than 50% at position 141, but significantly lower amounts of substitution at positions 114, and 106, and virtually none at the leucine in position 105. The pre-G difference peptide was analyzed for amino acid composition. Amino acid analysis clearly indicated a new unusual amino acid eluting between S-pyridylethylcysteine and methionine (Fig. 4). The G peptide does not contain any methionine (for which it could be mistaken), further suggesting the presence of a new modified or unusual amino acid. By comparison with the retention times of a standard amino acid mixture spiked with norvaline, it was established that the new peak in amino acid analysis corresponds to norvaline (Fig. 4). Elution of the norvaline next to methionine is consistent with the amino acid analysis of shoulders from the β- and di-α-globins. Electrospray mass spectra of pre-M the difference peptide showed an envelope indicative of a single component with mass loss of about 14 Da when compared with the M peptide (Table III). The nominal M peptide was too large to establish the source of the observed difference in mass by sequencing. Therefore, mapping with trypsin was used to identify smaller sub-peptide(s) containing the difference. Trypsin digest of the pre-M peak revealed one difference peptide when compared with a trypsin map of the original M peptide (Fig. 5). The difference peptide was isolated and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing. Again this difference peptide revealed a 13.7-Da mass loss when compared with the disappearing reference sub-peptide from trypsin digestion of the M peptide. This new difference peptide was sequenced and was found to be a 28-mer (Leu100-Lys127 in di-α notation) containing 7 leucines: LLSHCLLVTLAAHLPAEFTPAVHASLDK. We did not observe significant substitution at the first 2 leucines; however, at the subsequent 5 leucines, we found evidence of partial norvaline substitution for leucine. The level of substitution ranged from 15 to 25%. The isolated and re-purified trypsin difference sub-peptide from pre-M was analyzed for amino acid composition. Amino acid analysis was in good agreement with the expected composition of the 28-mer, with a loss of 0.9 leucine residues and an indication of a new amino acid nearly coeluting with methionine. By comparison with the retention times of standard amino acids, it was established that the new peak in the amino acid analysis elutes at the same position as norvaline and is poorly resolved from methionine (data not shown). Based on these results we conclude that the pre-M difference peptide (Leu100-Lys127) was from the modified M peptide from the first half of the di-α-globin in which leucines were substituted with different levels of norvaline yielding on average one substitution of norvaline for leucine per peptide. Similarly, the existence of a pre-N peak during mapping of the nonalkylated globins suggested that the same phenomena occurred on the second half of the di-α-globin. This may indicate that the corresponding repeating peptide (Leu242-Lys269) in the second part of the di-α-globin also contained partial substitution of leucine by norvaline, although we did not determine this experimentally. The pre-M (Arg31-Glu172) and pre-N (Arg173-Arg283) peptides in the sample B of rHb1.1 each constitute roughly 5% of the total of the respective M and N peptides. Our standard AQC amino acid analysis system did not serve well for the determination of the extent of norvaline for leucine substitution because of its poor resolution between norvaline and methionine. Therefore, we adopted another amino acid analysis method using OPA precolumn derivatization. In that system, norvaline is essentially base line resolved from the nearest amino acid, valine. Because the concentration of leucine is several orders of magnitude higher than norvaline, we used the UV signal for the quantitation of leucine and the fluorescent signal for the quantitation of norvaline. Fig.6 (bottom panel) shows a standard amino acid mixture spiked with norvaline monitored with a fluorescence detector.

https://openalex.org/W2016123750,"The parathyroid hormone (PTH)-2 receptor displays strong ligand selectivity in that it responds fully to PTH but not at all to PTH-related peptide (PTHrP). In contrast, the PTH-1 receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor) responds fully to both ligands. Previously it was shown that two divergent residues in PTH and PTHrP account for PTH-2 receptor selectivity; position 23 (Trp in PTH and Phe in PTHrP) determines binding selectivity and position 5 (Ile in PTH and His in PTHrP) determines signaling selectivity. To identify sites in the PTH-2 receptor involved in discriminating between His5 and Ile5, we constructed PTH-2 receptor/PTH-1 receptor chimeras, expressed them in COS-7 cells, and tested for cAMP responsiveness to [Trp23] PTHrP-(1–36), and to the nondiscriminating peptide [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) (the Phe23 → Trp modification enabled high affinity binding of each ligand to the PTH-2 receptor). The chimeras revealed that the membrane-spanning/loop region of the receptor determined His5/Ile5 signaling selectivity. Subsequent analysis of smaller cassette substitutions and then individual point mutations led to the identification of two single residues that function as major determinants of residue 5 signaling selectivity. These residues, Ile244 at the extracellular end of transmembrane helix 3, and Tyr318 at the COOH-terminal portion of extracellular loop 2, are replaced by Leu and Ile in the PTH-1 receptor, respectively. The results thus indicate a functional interaction between two residues in the core region of the PTH-2 receptor and residue 5 of the ligand.

The chimeras revealed that the membrane-spanning/loop region of the receptor determined His5/Ile5 signaling selectivity. Subsequent analysis of smaller cassette substitutions and then individual point mutations led to the identification of two single residues that function as major determinants of residue 5 signaling selectivity. These residues, Ile244 at the extracellular end of transmembrane helix 3, and Tyr318 at the COOH-terminal portion of extracellular loop 2, are replaced by Leu and Ile in the PTH-1 receptor, respectively. The results thus indicate a functional interaction between two residues in the core region of the PTH-2 receptor and residue 5 of the ligand. The parathyroid hormone (PTH 1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone; rPTH, rat PTH; PTHrP, PTH-related peptide; P1R, PTH-1 receptor; P2R, PTH-2 receptor; WT, wild-type.)-2 receptor, a recently identified PTH receptor subtype, responds fully to PTH but not at all to PTHrP (1Usdin T. Gruber C. Bonner T. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 15455-15458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). This ligand selectivity profile of the PTH-2 receptor is dramatically different from that of the PTH-1 receptor (PTH/PTHrP receptor) which elicits a robust increase in cAMP formation in response to either ligand. The amino acid sequences of the two receptors are 51% identical, and each is a member of the subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors that bind peptide hormones of intermediate size including calcitonin, secretin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal peptide, and several other peptides (2Segre G.V. Goldring S.R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 4: 309-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), in addition to PTH and PTHrP. These receptors are characterized by a relatively large amino-terminal extracellular domain of 100–200 amino acids, which contains six highly conserved cysteine residues, a “core” region with seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices and connecting loops, and a carboxyl-terminal tail of 150–200 amino acids. The molecular basis by which the peptide hormone receptors engage their respective receptors and trigger receptor activation is still largely unknown. This problem has been approached through strategies involving the construction of receptor chimeras and other types of receptor mutants (3Lee C. Gardella T. Abou-Samra A.-B. Nussbaum S. Segre G.

The data emerging from these studies suggest that multiple segments of the ligand and receptor contribute to the interaction. Recent studies with chimeric ligands acting on chimeric receptors suggest that the carboxyl-terminal portion of the ligand interacts with the amino-terminal extracellular domain, whereas the amino-terminal portion of the hormone interacts with the membrane-spanning/loop region of the receptor (8Bergwitz C. Gardella T. Flannery M. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H. Goldring S. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26469-26472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, as yet, there are only limited data on the specific amino acids, either in the ligand or in the receptor, that contribute to the interaction. In other receptor systems, the availability of receptor subtypes that exhibit distinct pharmacological profiles for different ligands has facilitated the identification of receptor residues involved in ligand recognition (13Schwartz T.W. Gether U. Schambye H.T. Hjorth S.A. Current Pharmaceutical Design. 1995; 1: 325-342Google Scholar). The pronounced difference in the ligand selectivity profiles of the PTH-1 and PTH-2 receptors suggested that these two receptors could be used in such an analysis, since the difference in selectivity can most easily be explained by structural differences in the receptors at sites (or a site) that are involved in ligand recognition or ligand-induced receptor activation. Further, it suggests that the two ligands differ at residues that interact with these divergent receptor residues. Recently, two such residues in PTH and PTHrP that can account for their altered selectivity for the PTH-2 receptor were identified: residue 23, Phe in PTHrP and Trp in PTH, modulates ligand binding (14Gardella T. Luck M. Jensen G. Usdin T. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); and residue 5, His in PTHrP and Ile in PTH, modulates ligand-induced receptor activation (14Gardella T.

Suva L.J. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4217-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, the weak binding of PTHrP to the PTH-2 receptor can be explained by the presence of Phe23, and the weak signaling activity at this receptor can be explained by the histidine at position 5. In the present paper we use a receptor chimera and mutagenesis approach to search for sites in the PTH-2 receptor that are involved in His5/Ile5 signaling selectivity. The results reveal two divergent amino acids in the membrane-spanning and extracellular loop portion of the receptor that contribute strongly to this effect. The preparation and initial characterization of [Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)amide and [Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)amide was described previously (14Gardella T. Luck M. Jensen G. Usdin T. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Herein, these two peptides are referred to as [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) and [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36), respectively. These PTHrP analogs, and other peptides used in the study, were prepared by the biopolymer synthesis facility at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA), as were the DNA oligonucleotides used in receptor mutagenesis experiments. The PTH analog [Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)amide was radioiodinated by the chloramine-T procedure, and the product was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (16Shigeno C.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, EGTA/trypsin, and concentrated antibiotic mixture (10,000 units/ml penicillin G and 10 mg/ml streptomycin) were from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal bovine serum was from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). DNA modifying reagents were from United States Biochemical Corp. (Cleveland, OH) or New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The cDNAs encoding the human PTH-1 (PTH/PTHrP) receptor (17Schipani E.

The 1E2 and 2E1 receptor chimeras were constructed by utilizing the unique, naturally occurring EcoRI site in the PTH-2 receptor plasmid that overlaps codons 139/140. A matchingEcoRI site was introduced into the human PTH-1 receptor by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis at codons 182/183 to generate the receptor plasmid pHK-FE. The mutagenic oligonucleotide used to make pHK-FE also changed Val183 and Asp185 to Phe and Glu, respectively, which correspond to the amino acid sequence of the PTH-2 receptor. The HK-FE and WT PTH-2 receptor plasmids were cleaved with BamHI, which cuts in the 5′ polylinker region, and EcoRI, and then the appropriateEcoRI-BamHI DNA fragments were gel-purified and religated to yield the desired chimeras. The chimera 1E2 has residues 1–182 of the P1R joined to residues 140–550 of the P2R, and chimera 2E1 has residues 1–142 of the P2R joined to residues 186–593 of the P1R. All other cassette and point mutations were introduced by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin G (20 units/ml), and streptomycin (20 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were transfected in 24-well plates using plasmid DNA (200 ng/well) that was purified by cesium chloride/ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation, except for the initial screening of the cassette mutants, in which phenol-extracted miniprep DNA was used. This miniprep DNA was quantified by ethidium bromide staining of agarose gels, and was transfected at a concentration of 100 ng/well. 48 h after transfection, the cell medium was replenished and the plates were shifted to a 33 °C humidified incubator for an additional 24–48 h, by which time the cell density reached 500,000 ± 100,000 cells/well. This shift to a lower temperature resulted in a general 10–50% increase in the number of receptors on the cell surface, as compared with cells maintained at 37 °C 2H. Jüppner and T. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4518-4527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were then used for binding and cAMP stimulation assays. Binding reactions were performed as described previously (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Each well (final volume = 300 μl) contained 26 fmol of125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)NH2(100,000 cpm) and various amounts (0.4–300 pmol) of unlabeled competitor ligand; peptides were diluted in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum). Incubations were at room temperature for 2 h, except for experiments performed for Scatchard analysis, which were performed at 4 °C for 6 h. At the end of the binding reactions the cells were rinsed 3 times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer, lysed with 0.5 ml of 5 m NaOH, and the entire lysate was counted. Nonspecific binding of tracer (NSB), determined in wells containing 1 μm[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)NH2, was 1–1.5% of total counts added. Maximum specific binding (B0) was calculated as the total radioactivity bound to cells in the absence of unlabeled ligand minus NSB. IC50 values (dose of competing ligand that resulted in 50% inhibition of125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)NH2binding) were determined from plots of log(B/B0 − B) versuslog[competitor]. Cell surface receptor numbers were estimated from Scatchard analyses of homologous competition binding studies that were performed with125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)NH2(26 fmol/well) and varying amounts (1.2–300 pmol) of the same unlabeled ligand. Calculations of the number of receptors per cell assumed a single class of binding sites and a transfection efficiency of 20% (6Gardella T. Luck M. Fan M. Lee C. J. Biol.

Transfected COS-7 cells were rinsed with 500 μl of binding buffer, and 200 μl of IBMX buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) and 100 μl of binding buffer or binding buffer with various amounts of peptide added. The plates were incubated for 60 min at room temperature; the buffer was then withdrawn and the cells were lysed by adding 0.5 ml of 50 mm HCl and freezing. The diluted lysate (1:30 in distilled H20) was analyzed for cAMP content by radioimmunoassay. For the initial screening of the mutants, we compared the cAMP response of each receptor to a maximum dose (1 μm) of [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) to its response to the nonselective analog [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) also at 1 μm. Dose-response analyses yielded EC50values (ligand dose resulting in 50% of maximum response (Emax) attained by that ligand), which were calculated from plots of log(E/E max − E)versus log[ligand], where E is the cAMP response measured at the corresponding dose of ligand (6Gardella T. Luck M. Fan M. Lee C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12820-12825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The difference in the ligand selectivities of the PTH-1 receptor and the PTH-2 receptor can be seen in the cAMP response profiles shown in Fig. 1, panels A andB. The PTH-1 receptor responded fully and equally to both [Ile5, Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) ([Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)amide) and [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) ([Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP-(1–36)amide), which has histidine at position 5. In contrast, the PTH-2 receptor responded fully to [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) but not at all to [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36). The ligand selectivity of the PTH-2 receptor is not due to a difference in binding affinities because the two analogs exhibited comparable potencies in their ability to inhibit the binding125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)amide (Fig. 1 F). The high apparent binding affinity that the two PTHrP analogs displayed for the PTH-2 receptor in these experiments is due primarily to the Phe23 → Trp modification; this substitution of a PTHrP residue by the corresponding PTH residue markedly enhances binding potency at the PTH-2 receptor without affecting cAMP signaling (14Gardella T. Luck M. Jensen G. Usdin T. Jüppner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19888-19893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A small improvement in binding potency was also seen for the His5 → Ile modification, however, this improvement was not receptor specific (Fig. 1, E andF) and was much smaller in magnitude than the effect of the substitution on PTH-2 receptor signaling. To localize the region of the PTH-2 receptor involved in His5/Ile5 signaling selectivity, we constructed a pair of chimeras in which the amino-terminal extracellular domains of the human PTH-1 and PTH-2 receptors were reciprocally interchanged and tested the chimeras in cAMP stimulation assays for responsiveness to [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) and to the nondiscriminating control peptide [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36). The 1E2 receptor chimera, which has the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the PTH-1 receptor connected (via an EcoRI site) to the mid- and carboxyl-terminal region of the PTH-2 receptor, discriminated between the two ligands (Fig. 1 C), whereas the reciprocal chimera 2E1 responded fully to each ligand (Fig. 1 D). These results indicated that the membrane-spanning and loop portion of the receptor determines His5/Ile5 signaling selectivity. To further localize the sites involved in residue 5 selectivity, we replaced most of the divergent residues in the membrane-spanning helices and extracellular connecting loops of the PTH-2 receptor with the corresponding residues of the PTH-1 receptor. As shown in Fig.2, these residues were replaced either by cassette substitution or, for two of the sites (Ala325 and Gly327), by single residue point mutation. All but 3 of the 21 mutant receptors were functional and adequately expressed on COS-7 cells, as judged by the cAMP response to [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) and the binding of radioiodinated [Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)amide (TableI). The three cassette mutants showing poor cAMP responsiveness and little or no PTH binding, P2R-Csst#2, P2R-Csst#7 and P2R-Csst#18, were possibly not expressed on the cell surface and were considered uninformative. Of the functional mutant receptors, three displayed increased responsiveness to [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36). These three cassettes are predicted to be located in the amino-terminal portion of extracellular loop 1 (P2R-Csst#5), the extracellular end of helix 3 (P2R-Csst#8), and at the COOH-terminal end of extracellular loop 2 (P2R-Csst#13) (Fig. 2). For each of these three receptor mutants the maximum binding of125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)amide was elevated by a factor of 1.8–3.2, in comparison to the binding observed for the WT PTH-2 receptor (Table I). This increase in maximum binding of radiolabeled PTH-(1–34) may indicate increased surface expression, enhanced PTH-(1–34) binding affinity, or both. It is unlikely, however, that such effects on surface expression or PTH-(1–34) binding affinity are the basis for the altered cAMP responsiveness to [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36), because other mutants, such as P2R-Csst#16 and GV-327, caused comparable increases in radioligand-binding capacity without changing [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) signaling selectivity (TableI). We therefore focused on the receptor regions defined by cassette mutations 5, 8, and 13.Table ILocalization of PTHrP-signaling determinants in the PTH-2 receptorReceptorMaximum binding 125I-PTH-(1–34)cAMPBasal[Ile5]PTHrPPTHrPPTHrP/[Ile5]PTHrP% P2R-WTpmol/well%P2R-WT100 ± 16.1 ± 0.655.6 ± 1.86.9 ± 0.81.8 ± 1.0P1R-WT538 ± 574.4 ± 1.1148.5 ± 32.3142.6 ± 35.295.3 ± 8.6P2R cassette mutation 139 ± 43.9 ± 1.151.5 ± 2.53.1 ± 0.8< bsl 211 ± 31.9 ± 0.41.6 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.5ND 366 ± 23.8 ± 0.448.8 ± 5.64.8 ± 0.62.4 ± 1.0 4122 ± 44.8 ± 0.439.4 ± 4.65.9 ± 0.63.8 ± 1.8 5317 ± 254.5 ± 0.480.9 ± 8.336.0 ± 4.040.5 ± 1.5 621 ± 53.5 ± 0.432.5 ± 8.95.5 ± 0.39.2 ± 2.7 70.0 ± 0.72.2 ± 0.62.5 ± 0.82.1 ± 0.5ND 8181 ± 95.3 ± 0.654.9 ± 6.369.2 ± 8.7126.9 ± 4.5 996 ± 99.6 ± 1.190.8 ± 20.122.9 ± 4.116.3 ± 1.0 1092 ± 64.8 ± 0.681.2 ± 3.74.5 ± 1.0< bsl 1193 ± 104.0 ± 0.472.9 ± 8.911.9 ± 0.311.6 ± 0.5 12130 ± 93.3 ± 0.799.1 ± 9.916.3 ± 1.413.5 ± 0.4 13221 ± 141.6 ± 0.464.9 ± 23.537.9 ± 13.357.3 ± 0.9 1491 ± 44.3 ± 0.459.6 ± 9.43.9 ± 0.5< bsl 15157 ± 711.5 ± 0.890.3 ± 9.530.4 ± 2.424.3 ± 0.9 16203 ± 104.4 ± 0.364.2 ± 7.97.7 ± 0.46.1 ± 0.6 17129 ± 123.4 ± 0.775.2 ± 11.75.4 ± 0.23.1 ± 0.7 1827 ± 21.7 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.31.8 ± 0.2ND 1995 ± 24.1 ± 0.351.9 ± 5.94.4 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.6 AS-32589 ± 34.0 ± 0.739.3 ± 3.13.6 ± 0.5< bsl GV-327191 ± 117.6 ± 1.470.6 ± 15.111.0 ± 2.05.2 ± 1.2P2R point mutation parent cassette RA-1995104 ± 257.5 ± 0.9111.2 ± 22.39.7 ± 0.12.8 ± 1.1 VL-2015114 ± 53.4 ± 0.657.5 ± 21.16.3 ± 1.55.3 ± 0.9 HY-202553 ± 25.0 ± 1.449.8 ± 9.34.2 ± 0.2< bsl AS-2035105 ± 56.6 ± 1.062.3 ± 16.57.4 ± 0.72.5 ± 1.5 HG-2045128 ± 34.6 ± 0.946.1 ± 3.27.4 ± 0.76.7 ± 0.4 IA-205578 ± 45.9 ± 0.462.2 ± 12.86.4 ± 0.21.5 ± 1.0 GT-206584 ± 73.7 ± 0.337.7 ± 5.64.6 ± 0.83.3 ± 1.9 VL-20754.6 ± 2.81.5 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.41.5 ± 0.6ND KD-20858.6 ± 2.71.3 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.5ND KR-237837 ± 45.3 ± 0.224.2 ± 4.44.5 ± 0.4< bsl IV-2388110 ± 44.3 ± 0.139.6 ± 6.55.0 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.9 VT-241875 ± 55.0 ± 0.882.4 ± 9.54.6 ± 0.2< bsl MF-242895 ± 75.4 ± 0.368.7 ± 10.96.0 ± 0.30.8 ± 0.4 IL-2448176 ± 36.0 ± 0.737.9 ± 9.040.3 ± 12.998.2 ± 22.2 IK-3141396 ± 64.8 ± 0.251.6 ± 8.54.3 ± 0.5< bsl YI-31813261 ± 176.8 ± 3.392.4 ± 6.466.3 ± 1.069.5 ± 3.9 AV-32113119 ± 65.2 ± 0.564.7 ± 6.79.8 ± 0.47.9 ± 0.8WT and mutant PTH receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells and evaluated for binding 125I-rPTH-(1–34) analog, and for intracellular cAMP levels, in the absence of added ligand (basal) or presence of [Trp23,Tyr36]hPTHrP-(1–36)NH2(PTHrP) or [Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36]hPTHrP(1–36)NH2([Ile5]PTHrP), each at a dose of 1 μm.

The lower half shows the effect of point mutations made within regions defined by cassettes 5, 8, and 13. The far right column shows the ratio of the net responses to the two analogs. Data are the means ± S.E. of two experiments, each performed in duplicate. For some mutants, PTHrP responsiveness was not determined because of probable defects in expression (ND), or because the response to PTHrP was less than the basal cAMP level (< bsl). Replacement of each divergent residue in cassette region 5 by the corresponding residue of the PTH-1 receptor failed to identify a single residue affecting the cAMP response to [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) (Fig.3 B and Table I). It is possible that two or more sites in this region cooperatively contribute to His5/Ile5 signaling selectivity; however, two of the mutations in this set, Val207 → Leu (valine 207 changed to leucine, VL-207) and Lys208 → Asp (KD-208) were poorly expressed, as indicated by their very low responses to [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) and minimal binding of125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)amide. Thus, the roles of these two residues could not be assessed. Within cassette region 8, one point mutation, Ile244 → Leu (IL-244), resulted in a strong increase in responsiveness to [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) (Fig. 3 B). Within cassette region 13, one other substitution Tyr318 → Ile (YI-318), also enhanced responsiveness to the PTHrP analog. Dose response analysis of these two mutant receptors demonstrated that each mutation by itself could account for a substantial component of the signaling selectivity inherent to the PTH-2 receptor (Fig.4). In fact, with the IL-244 receptor, the efficacy of [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) was equal to, if not slightly greater than, that of [Ile5,Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) (Fig. 4 Band Table II). The effect of the YI-318 mutation was not as pronounced, and with this mutant [Trp23]PTHrP-(1–36) functioned as a partial agonist (Fig. 4 C). These two point mutations did not affect the ability of either PTHrP analog to inhibit the binding of125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)amide (Fig. 4 D-F). Scatchard analyses indicated that the number of PTH-(1–34) binding sites on the surface of COS-7 cells transfected with either mutant receptor did not differ significantly from the number of binding sites on cells expressing the WT PTH-2 receptor (Table III).Figure 4Ligand selectivity properties of wild-type and mutant PTH-2 receptors. The indicated wild-type and mutant PTH-2 receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells and examined for ligand-dependent stimulation of intracellular cAMP (A-C) and competition binding (D-F) using the analogs [Trp23,Tyr36]PTHrP(1–36)NH2(▵) and [Ile5,Trp23,Tyr36] PTHrP-(1–36)NH2(•). Intracellular cAMP and competition binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding experiments used125I-[Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH-(1–34)NH2(100,000 cpm/well) as tracer.

Nascent AChR subunits were recently found to form complexes with the endoplasmic reticulum-resident molecular chaperone calnexin. To determine the contribution of this interaction to AChR assembly and surface expression, we have now used transient transfection of mouse AChR subunits and calnexin into non-muscle cells. Co-transfection of calnexin along with AChR subunits into COS and HEK 293 cells was found to enhance AChR subunit folding and assembly, and to decrease degradation rates of newly synthesized AChR α-subunits, resulting in elevated surface expression of assembled AChR. Moreover, inhibition of the interaction between endogenous calnexin and AChR by castanospermine resulted in decreased AChR subunit folding, assembly, and surface expression in muscle and HEK 293 cells. Together, these findings provide evidence that calnexin directly contributes to AChR biogenesis by promoting subunit folding and assembly.

Many of the transmembrane signaling molecules present in cell surface membranes are oligomeric proteins, and assembly of these proteins from constituent subunits is required for their functional expression.

Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). The nascent AChR subunits are cotranslationally inserted into the ER membrane in a characteristic orientation with four transmembrane stretches, and with both the long amino-terminal domain and the short carboxyl terminus situated in the lumen of the ER. In the ER the newly translated subunits undergo post-translational modifications, including N-linked glycosylation and disulfide bond formation, as well as a sequence of folding events culminating in the acquisition of an assembly-competent conformation (5Merlie J.P. Smith M.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 91: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the case of α-subunits, this conformational maturation results in the appearance of a specific epitope termed the main immunogenic region, which is recognized by conformation-specific antibodies to AChR, as well as the formation of high affinity binding sites for the neurotoxin α-bungarotoxin (Bgt) (1Merlie J.P. Cell. 1984; 36: 573-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 6Conti-Tronconi B.M. McLane K.E. Raftery M.A. Grando S.A. Protti M.P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 69-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These sites appear on α-subunits prior to their assembly with other subunits: in contrast, the binding sites for AChR agonists such as acetylcholine and carbamylcholine arise only after the assembly of α- with γ- or δ-subunits (7Blount P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 3: 349-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Since in the assembled AChR these agonist sites partially overlap with the neurotoxin-binding sites (4Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), the fraction of Bgt binding that is preventable by the presence of carbamylcholine can serve as a measure of AChR assembly (8Kreienkamp H.-J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Only the assembled pentameric AChRs exit the ER and reach the cell surface, whereas unassembled or misfolded subunits and partial assembly intermediates are retained and degraded intracellularly (9Blount P.

The expression of recombinant AChR subunits in heterologous cell lines has been used to address a number of fundamental questions relating to AChR assembly, such as the order in which the subunits are assembled (10Gu Y.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, this approach is hampered by the low levels of correctly assembled AChR at the surface of transfected cells. This may reflect the tendency of nascent subunits to misfold and aggregate, a problem frequently encountered in the expression of recombinant proteins in various transfection systems. Under normal conditions, newly synthesized membrane proteins are thought to be protected from misfolding by interactions with ER-resident molecular chaperones (17Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar, 18Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Calnexin, an ER constituent that is itself a transmembrane protein (19Wada I. Rindress D. Cameron P.H. Ou W.-J. Doherty II, J.J. Louvard D. Bell A.W. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Biol.

Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P. Jackson M. Williams D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and influenza hemagglutinin (23Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We have recently observed that calnexin forms transient complexes with newly synthesized AChR α-subunits in muscle cells, as well as in COS cells transiently transfected with this subunit (24Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Other transfected AChR subunits were also found to interact with calnexin in HEK 293 cells (25.Chang, W. (1995) Regulation of Acetylcholine Receptor: Phosphorylation, Assembly, and Clustering. Ph.D. thesis, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY.Google Scholar, 26Keller S.H. Lindstrom J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22871-22877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In muscle cells, the timing of this interaction appears to be precisely regulated, with binding occurring immediately upon subunit translation and dissociation taking place prior to AChR assembly (24Gelman M.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10709-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This time course is consistent with the possibility that calnexin assists AChR assembly by facilitating the folding of nascent subunits into an assembly-competent conformation. However, direct functional evidence that calnexin promotes maturation and assembly of AChR subunits in the ER has been lacking. In the present study we have examined the contribution of calnexin to AChR biogenesis in two ways: first, we took advantage of the inefficient folding and assembly of recombinant AChR subunits in transfected cells to determine if co-transfection of exogenous calnexin into these cells can increase AChR expression. Second, the ability of the glucose trimming inhibitor castanospermine (CAS) to block the interaction of endogenous calnexin with its substrates (28Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) was utilized to examine the effect of this block on AChR biogenesis. COS cells (African green monkey kidney cells) and HEK 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C2C12 mouse muscle cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and induced to differentiate by replacing this medium with DMEM, 2% horse serum. Muscle primary cultures were prepared from breast muscle of 12-day-old chick embryos as described previously (29Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plated on collagen-coated culture dishes at initial densities of 6 × 106 cells/100-mm culture dish, and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum and 2% chick embryo extract. 35S-Protein labeling mixture (specific activity 1175 Ci/mmol) and 125I-α-bungarotoxin (specific activity 13–15 μCi/μg) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. All other reagents were from Sigma. Anti-α-bungarotoxin antibody was raised in rabbits and affinity purified on α-bungarotoxin-Sepharose (29Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody mAb 35, which recognizes the main immunogenic region of AChR α-subunit (30Tzartos S.J. Rand D.E. Einarson B.L. Lindstrom J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 8635-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was isolated from the supernatant of hybridoma TIB 175 (American Type Culture Collection). The monoclonal antibody mAb 61, directed against mouse AChR α-subunit was provided by Dr. Jon Lindstrom (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Anti-chick AChR α-subunit antibody and anti-chick AChR δ-subunit antibody were raised in rabbits against the respective subunits purified on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from denervated chick leg muscle, and were shown to be noncross-reactive (29Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-calnexin antibody made against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly conserved stretch near the COOH terminus (amino acids 487–505) of calnexin was provided by Dr. J. J. M. Bergeron (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Anti-HA 12CA5 antibody was obtained from Dr. D. Bar-Sagi (SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY). Full-length cDNAs coding for mouse AChR subunits (cDNA for α-subunit was obtained from Dr. Jim Boulter, Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA; cDNAs for β-, γ-, and δ-subunits were provided by Dr. James Patrick, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) were subcloned into the pRC/cytomegalovirus expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), which contains an SV40 origin and is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. Calnexin cDNA was obtained from Dr. David Thomas (National Research Council of Canada, Montreal, Canada) and was subcloned into pBK/cytomegalovirus expression vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The HA Erk2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) expression vector under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter was provided by Dr. D. Bar-Sagi (SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY). Transfection of COS and HEK 293 cells for transient expression of AChR was carried out by DNA-calcium phosphate precipitation as described (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar). Briefly, 60-mm dishes of cells at 50–60% confluence were incubated for 16–20 h at 37 °C with 5–10 μg of the cDNA to be transfected in a mixture containing CaCl2 and HEPES-buffered saline solution. In cases when transfections were carried out with all four AChR subunits, the ratio of cDNAs encoding each subunit was α:β:γ:δ = 2:1:1:1. To rule out the possibility that any differences in transfection efficiencies contribute to the observed effects of co-transfected calnexin, the Escherichia coliβ-galactosidase was added to the transfection mixture and its expression was measured by colorimetric assay as described (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, New York1989Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated in methionine-free DMEM for 1 h, then labeled at 37 °C with a mixture of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (for specific activities see figure legends) in methionine-free DMEM. Chases were performed by washing cells once with DMEM, followed by incubation in DMEM supplemented with 5 mml-methionine. Incubations were terminated by two washes with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently cultures were harvested by scraping and extracted for 30 min at 4 °C in STE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA) containing 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × gin a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The clarified supernatants were incubated at 4 °C with the specified antiserum for 3 h, then with protein A-Sepharose beads (for anti-Bgt) or rabbit anti-rat antibody-coated protein A-Sepharose beads (for mAb 61, mAb 35) for a further 1 h. The precipitates were washed five times with STE-Triton X-100 and fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radioactive bands were visualized by radiofluorography and quantified by densitometry or PhosphorImaging. COS cells were transfected with all four AChR subunits or with HA-epitope-tagged MAP kinase in the absence or presence of calnexin cDNA. After 2 days cells were scraped into STE, 1% Triton X-100 buffer at 4 °C, and extracts were clarified as above. Aliquots of lysates from calnexin co-transfected and control cultures, normalized for the transfection efficiency, were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, which were incubated either with anti-calnexin or anti-HA antibody. The blots were processed using the enhanced chemiluminescence technique (Amersham). The amounts of cell surface and intracellular AChR were determined as described by Kreienkamp et al. (8Kreienkamp H.-J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For quantification of cell surface AChR, cultures were washed once with DMEM, then cells were detached in phosphate-buffered saline, 5 mm EDTA, resuspended in K+-Ringers buffer (140 mm KCl, 5.4 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.03 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated with 10 nm125I-α-Bgt for 2 h at 4 °C. At the end of the incubation the cells were washed three times with K+-Ringer's buffer, and binding was quantified by γ-counting. For determination of nonspecific binding, the cells were preincubated with the AChR ligand carbamylcholine (10 mm) for 20 min prior to the addition of125I-Bgt, and labeling was carried out in the presence of carbamylcholine. To measure total folded α-subunit, labeling was carried out as above, except that cells were incubated with125I-Bgt in saponin permeabilization buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% saponin). Total assembled AChR was estimated as the component of 125I-Bgt labeling that is prevented in the presence of 10 mm carbamylcholine. The unassembled folded AChR α-subunit was quantified as the component of125I-Bgt binding that is preserved in the presence of carbamylcholine, after subtraction of nonspecific binding estimated by the quantification of 125I-Bgt bound to nontransfected cultures. Fig.1 A compares AChR subunit synthesis, assembly, and surface expression in three cell types: C2C12 mouse muscle cells which normally express AChR upon differentiation, as well as COS and HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the four (αβγδ) mouse AChR subunits. To measure AChR α-subunit synthesis, equivalent amounts of each of these cell types were labeled for 1 h with [35S]cysteine/methionine mixture, then extracted and immunoprecipitated with mAb 61, an antibody directed against mouse AChR α-subunit. This approach showed substantial levels of AChR α-subunit synthesized in muscle cells (lane 2), and even higher levels in transfected COS cells and HEK 293 cells (lanes 3 and 4). In parallel experiments, assembled and surface AChR were quantified in these metabolically labeled cells using the highly specific AChR ligand α-Bgt. To measure total assembled AChR, cells were permeabilized with saponin prior to incubation with Bgt (8Kreienkamp H.-J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Under these conditions Bgt can bind to both assembled AChR and unassembled but correctly folded α-subunits. To ascertain that the radiolabeled band in anti-Bgt immunoprecipitates shown in the middle panel of Fig. 1 corresponds predominantly to assembled α-subunit, the amounts of125I-Bgt binding in the presence and absence of 10 mm carbamylcholine were compared. Since the carbamylcholine-binding sites are comprised of domains from sets of 2 subunits (α-γ and α-δ), carbamylcholine will bind (and consequently block Bgt binding) to assembled α-subunit but not to unassembled α-subunit (8Kreienkamp H.-J. Maeda R.K. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Neuron. 1995; 14: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The contribution of these unassembled subunits to the total binding was not significant (<5%, data not shown). It should be noted that in contrast to the α-subunit which is clearly identifiable as a 40-kDa band, the other 3 subunits are difficult to resolve in [35S]methionine-labeled immunoprecipitates of assembled AChR, presumably due to their migration as diffuse bands, susceptibility to proteolysis, and the relatively high backgrounds in this region of the gel (15Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In replicate cultures, cell surface AChR was measured by the binding of Bgt to intact cells. After incubation with Bgt, cells were extracted and AChR-Bgt complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-Bgt antibody. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, in C2C12 muscle cells during a 3-h chase period a significant proportion of the labeled α-subunit was assembled into AChR pentamers (lane 5), and reached the cell surface (lane 8). In contrast, in each of the transfected cell lines during the same interval only a small fraction of the total α-subunit synthesized underwent assembly with other subunits (lanes 6 and 7) and appeared at the plasma membrane (lanes 9 and 10). These results are quantified in Fig. 1 B, which shows that the transfected HEK 293 and COS cells each display a substantially lower efficiency of AChR assembly and surface expression relative to the muscle cell line. To determine if the low levels of AChR assembly in transfected cells overexpressing the individual subunits reflect the exhaustion of endogenous calnexin, we measured the effect of co-transfecting calnexin cDNA on AChR assembly and surface expression. In the experiments shown in Fig.2 A, COS and HEK 293 cells were transfected with all four AChR subunits with or without calnexin, and 2 days later assembly was measured by the binding of 125I-Bgt to saponin-permeabilized cells, while surface AChR was quantified by125I-Bgt binding to intact cells. As can be seen, the levels of both assembled and surface AChR were markedly higher in cultures co-transfected with calnexin, consistent with the possibility that AChR assembly in the transfected cells was limited by the availability of this molecular chaperone. In contrast, co-transfection with calnexin did not cause the translocation of unassembled α-subunit to the plasma membrane, since no appreciable surface Bgt binding was detected when calnexin was co-transfected into either COS or HEK 293 cells expressing α-subunit alone (Fig. 2 A, first two bars in each panel). The overall levels of calnexin, as measured by Western blotting, were higher in calnexin-transfected cultures (Fig.2 C, top panel) (typically by 20–30%). Since the proportion of transfected cells in these experiments was between 5 and 10%, as determined by the β-galactosidase staining of fixed cultures (not shown), the levels of transfected calnexin in the transfected cells were estimated to significantly exceed (by 4–10-fold) those of endogenous calnexin. Together these results indicate that the increase in Bgt binding reflects specific stimulation of AChR biogenesis by co-transfected calnexin. The effects of calnexin co-transfection on AChR assembly and surface expression were also examined by a second method: immunoprecipitation of Bgt-AChR complexes from [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled COS cells that had been transfected with all four AChR subunits with or without calnexin. As can be seen in Fig. 2 B, the amounts of both total (intracellular + surface) assembled AChR and surface AChR were increased in the cultures co-transfected with calnexin (lanes 4 and 6 versus lanes 3 and 5). Interestingly, the overall levels of radiolabeled AChR α-subunit accumulated during the 1-h labeling period were also higher in cells co-transfected with calnexin as compared with cultures transfected with AChR subunits but not with calnexin (Fig. 2 B, comparelanes 1 and 2). The increased accumulation of α-subunit in calnexin co-transfected cells was also evident from the Western blot (Fig. 2 C, middle panel). In contrast, the levels of a transfected cytoplasmic protein, MAP kinase, were not altered by co-transfection with calnexin (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel), consistent with the known localization of calnexin to the ER and the restriction of its chaperone functions to secretory and membrane proteins. It is noteworthy that the enhancement by co-transfected calnexin of AChR assembly and surface expression appeared to be greater than the increase in α-subunit levels in these cultures (Fig. 2 B). Thus, calnexin may contribute to AChR expression in two ways: by stabilizing newly synthesized AChR subunits in the ER, and by mediating the assembly of these subunits into pentameric AChR expressed on the cell surface. Calnexin has been proposed to mediate the folding of nascent AChR subunits prior to their assembly into multisubunit complexes based on the timing of its interaction with α-subunit in cultured muscle cells (24Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To directly investigate the contribution of calnexin to the conformational maturation of AChR α-subunit, we have measured the ability of conformationally mature α-subunits to bind Bgt. As can be seen in Fig. 3, calnexin co-transfection leads to an increase in intracellular125I-Bgt binding to α-subunit expressed both in COS and HEK 293 cells. Thus elevation of calnexin levels appears to facilitate the folding of nascent AChR α-subunits in the transfected cells. In the transfection experiments summarized above we have observed that calnexin has stimulatory effects on the folding and assembly of AChR α-subunit, as well as on the accumulation of newly made α-subunits in the ER. As net accumulation represents the difference between biosynthesis and degradation, we next determined the effect of co-transfected calnexin on the degradation rate of α-subunit. For this purpose, COS cells were transfected with all four AChR subunits in the absence or presence of calnexin, and after 2 days these cultures were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine and chased for the specified periods in the absence of radioactive amino acids. At the end of the chase periods, cells were extracted and immunoprecipitated with mAb 61. The intensities of the bands corresponding to the radiolabeled α-subunit were quantified by scanning densitometry of autoradiographs. To compare α-subunit degradation rates in the absence and presence of co-transfected calnexin, the values at each time point were expressed as the proportion of the radiolabeled α-subunit immunoprecipitated immediately after the pulse. In a representative experiment shown in Fig.4, the disappearance of α-subunit in COS cells showed first-order kinetics with a half-time of approximately 1.5 h. This value is in good agreement with the catabolic half-life of mouse AChR α-subunit previously measured in COS cells (11Chavez R.A. Maloof J. Beeson D. Newsom-Davis J. Hall Z.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23028-23034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in quail fibroblasts (15Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2613-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 32Blount P. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1072-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of co-transfected calnexin α-subunit degradation rate was diminished significantly (half-time of approximately 4 h), indicating that interaction with calnexin can stabilize nascent AChR subunits in the ER. This decrease in AChR α-subunit degradation is likely to account for the enhanced accumulation of α-subunit observed in calnexin co-transfected cells (see Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and 2; Fig. 2 C, middle panel). Moreover, co-transfected calnexin had a similar stabilizing effect on cultures transfected with α-subunit alone (not shown). In the experiments described thus far, co-transfection with calnexin was seen to enhance AChR biogenesis in cells that are inefficient in the assembly and surface expression of these receptors. We next examined the contribution of calnexin to AChR expression in primary cultures of embryonic chick myotubes, a cell system that assembles AChR with high efficiency (29Ross A.F. Rapuano M. Schmidt J.H. Prives J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14640-14647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments we utilized the glucosidase inhibitor CAS, that was recently shown to interfere with the binding of calnexin to nascent glycoproteins (28Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). C"

The Fas receptor is composed of several discrete domains, including three cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain responsible for transmitting an apoptotic signal. While the mechanism of Fas-mediated cell death has become elucidated, the requirements for Fas ligand binding to the receptor have not been fully defined.

Interestingly, TNFR I CRD1 could partially substitute for the Fas CRD1. The importance of this domain was underscored by the analysis of a Fas extracellular mutation (C66R), which resulted in a complete loss of ligand binding. This mutation was cloned from a human patient suffering from Canale-Smith syndrome, which is characterized by autoimmunity resembling that observed in the lpr andlpr cg mice.

The TNF receptor family is defined by the presence of between two and six cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) in their extracellular regions (16Smith C.A. Farah T. Goodwin R.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 959-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). The CRDs are thought to fold independently and are stabilized by extensive intrachain disulfide bonding. The Fas receptor and TNFR I also share significant homology within their intracellular domains. An 80-amino acid region called the death domain is required for the apoptosis-promoting activities of these receptors (17Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H.M. Goeddel D.V.

The death domain is a novel protein-protein association motif found in many proteins, such as the Drosophila pro-apoptotic protein Reaper and the mammalian pro-apoptotic proteins FADD, TRADD, and RIP (8Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). These last three death domain proteins are recruited to the Fas receptor or TNFR I and mediate the initiation of an apoptotic program requiring activation of interleukin-1β converting enzyme-like proteases (19Enari M.

Receptor-ligand interactions are believed to occur predominantly via the CRDs in the extracellular regions of these receptors. However, there is little information regarding sequences of the Fas receptor required for engagement of its ligand. Structure-function and x-ray crystallographic structure analyses of TNFR I have demonstrated that all four CRDs contribute to TNF binding (22Marsters S.A. Frutkin A.D. Simpson N.J. Fendly B.M.

However, several family members such as cytopathic avian receptor 1 (CAR1) and death receptor 4 (DR4) possess as few as two CRDs, yet are still able to bind ligand (26Brojatsch J. Naughton J. Rolls M.M. Zingler K. Young J.A.T. Cell. 1996; 87: 845-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 27Pan G. O'Rourke K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Gentz R. Ebner R. Ni J. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1560) Google Scholar). Thus, these receptors have the capacity to engage their respective ligands in a distinct manner. To define Fas ligand-receptor interactions, a series of chimeras between the human Fas receptor and TNFR I extracellular domains were constructed and fused to the Fc region of human IgG1. The Fas receptor contains three CRDs, whereas TNFR I has four CRDs. A sequence analysis of the TNF receptor family indicated that the three CRDs of the Fas receptor are most homologous to the first three CRDs of TNFR I (28Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The only significant difference exists within CRD1. The human Fas receptor contains two disulfide bonds compared with three for the human TNFR I CRD1. The Fc-receptor fusion proteins permitted the production of mammalian cell-derived soluble recombinant forms that could be easily purified and analyzed for ligand binding (22Marsters S.A.

The results indicated that all three CRDs of the Fas receptor are required for ligand binding, as mutations in each CRD led to a complete loss in ligand binding. Interestingly, CRD1 from TNFR I was able to partially substitute for the homologous domain of Fas, yielding a chimeric receptor that recognized the Fas ligand with full efficacy but reduced potency. The vector pCDSLIg1 was a kind gift from Brian Seed. The human IgG1 Fc domain genomic coding sequence was excised using BamHI and XbaI and ligated into these sites in pCDNA3 (Invitrogen), generating the new plasmid pCDNA3-Fc. The coding sequence for the extracellular domains of the wild-type human Fas receptor and TNFR I was generated using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The following primers were used for the PCRs: A, 5′-CCGGATCCGCGTTAGATCTTGATCCTTCCTC-3′); B, 5′-CCGGTACCCCACCATGGGCCTCTCCACCGTG-3′; C, 5′-CCGGTACCCCACCATGCTGGGCATCTGGA-3′; and D, 5′-CCGGATCCGCGGTGCCTGAGTCCTCAGT-3′. Each reaction contained 1 ng/ml template (pCDNA3-hFasR or pCMV5-hTNFRI), 1 ng/ml of each primer for pairs A + C (Fc-FasR) or B + D (Fc-TNFR I), 200 μm dNTPs, 1 ×Taq polymerase buffer, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR reactions were performed as follows: cycles 1–10 (denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min; annealing, 45 °C for 1 min; and extension, 72 °C for 1 min), cycles 11–30 (denaturation, 94 °C for 1 min; annealing, 65 °C for 1 min; and extension, 72 °C for 1 min), and incubation at 72 °C for 8 min after the last cycle. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and BamHI and ligated intoKpnI- and BamHI-digested pCDNA3-Fc to yield the plasmids pCDNA3-Fc-wtFasR and pCDNA3-Fc-wtTNFR I. Constructs encoding chimeric Fc-FasR mutants were prepared using a hybrid PCR-based approach. The N-term Swap mutant was generated as follows. The first round of PCRs was performed in parallel using primer pair B + E (5′-CAAGTTCTGACTATCTCTCTTCTCCCT-3′) with pCMV5-hTNFR I as a template and primer pair A + F (5′-AGAGATAGTCAGAACTTGGAAGGCCTG-3′) with pCDNA3-hFasR as a template as described above for the preparation of the pCDNA3-Fc-wtFasR construct, except that for cycles 11–30 annealing was performed at 60 °C. The products were then isolated, denatured, annealed, and extended using 1 unit of Klenow (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 × Klenow buffer, and 250 μm dNTPs for 30 min at 37 °C. The extended product was used as a template for a second round of PCR using primers A + B as described above. The PCR fragment was isolated and digested withKpnI and BamHI and ligated into KpnI- and BamHI-digested pCDNA3-Fc to yield the plasmid pCDNA3-Fc-N-term Swap. The CRD1, CRD2, and CRD3 chimeric mutants were prepared as described for pCDNA3-Fc-N-term Swap except that the following primers and templates were used for the first round of PCRs: CRD1 chimeric mutant, primer pair B + G (5′-TTGGCAGGGCCTGCAGTCCGTATCCTG-3′) with pCMV5-hTNFR I as a template and primer pair A + H (5′-GACTGCAGGCCCTGCCAAGAAGGGAAG-3′) with pCDNA3-hFasR as a template; CRD2 chimeric mutant, primer pair C + I (5′-TCCTTTCGGCATTTGGAGCAGCTGAGGCAGTGTCTGAGGTGGTTTTCTGAAGCGGTGAAGGAGCCGCTCTCACACTCCACGCAGTCTGGTTCATC-3′) with pCDNA3-hFasR as a template and primer pair A + J (5′-TCCAAATGCCGAAAGGAAATGGGTCAGGTGGAGATCTCTTCTTGCACAGTGGACCGGGACACCGTGTGTGGCTGTAAACCAAACTTTTTTTGTAACTC-3′) with pCDNA3-hFasR as a template; and CRD3 chimeric mutant, primer pair C + K (5′-CTTCCTGCATCTGCACTTGGTATTCTG-3′) with pCDNA3-hFasR as a template and primer pair L (5′-AAGTGCAGATGCAGGAAGAACCAGTACCGG-3′) + M (5′-CCGGATCCGCGTTAGATCTTGATCCTTCCTCTTTGCACACGGTGTTCTGTTTCTC-3′) with pCMV5-hTNFR I as a template. The PCR fragments from the first round of PCRs were used as described above for the second round of PCRs, except in the case of the CRD3 chimeric mutant in which primers A + C were used. The PCR products were digested withKpnI and BamHI and ligated into KpnI- and BamHI-digested pCDNA3-Fc to yield the plasmids pCDNA3-Fc-CRD1, -CRD2, and -CRD3. The pCDNA3-Fc-FasR ΔCRD1 mutant construct was prepared as described above for pCDNA3-Fc-wtFasR, using the StuI fragment from pCDNA3-hFasR as the template and the primers A + N (5′-CCGGTACCCCACCATGCTGGGCATCTGGACCCTCCTACCTCTGGTTCTACGTCTGTTGCTCCCTGCCAAGAAGGGAAG-3′). The pCDNA3-Fc-FasR C66R mutant construct was prepared similarly to the pCDNA3-Fc-wtFasR construct, except that pCDNA3-hFasR C66R was used as the PCR template. The pCDNA3-hFasR C66R mutant was prepared as follows. RNA was isolated from a Canale-Smith syndrome patient's activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and cDNA was prepared as described previously (30Drappa J. Vaishnaw A.K. Sullivan K.E. Chu J.L. Elkon K.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1643-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The cDNA was subjected to PCR amplification using the Fas-specific primers O1 (5′-CCGAATTCGGAGTTGGGGAAGCTCTRTTCACTT-3′) and O4 (5′-CGACTCGAGCACTCTAGACCAAGCTTTGG-3′) under the following conditions: 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 30 s, and extention at 72 °C for 90 s. All reagents were used at the above concentrations. The PCR yielded a single 1.05-kilobase product that was purified and digested with EcoRI and XhoI. The fragment was subcloned into EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pCDNA3 and sequenced in its entirety. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). Exponentially growing 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum with Pen-Strep and Fungizone (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected at 50% confluence in 10-cm plates with 15 μg of each pCDNA3-Fc-receptor construct and 5 μg of pADVantage (Promega) using the calcium phosphate method. After the precipitate was removed, the cells were incubated for another 18–24 h in fresh medium. The cells were then incubated under serum-free conditions for an additional 24–48 h. The supernatants from the transfected cells were harvested and spun at 600 × g for 10 min to remove any debris and then filtered through a 0.45-μm filter. Supernatants were then incubated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The matrix was transferred to a gravity flow column and washed several times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mmNaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 1 mm EDTA) and finally phosphate-buffered saline. Fusion proteins were eluted from the matrix using 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with 1m Tris, pH 8.0. Fractions with protein were identified, pooled, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. Fusion proteins were quantitated by measuring theirA 280 and assuming that 1.0 OD = 0.8 mg/ml protein. All fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE to confirm their integrity and purity. Soluble human Fas ligand was prepared as described previously. 2Orlinick, J., Elkon, K., and Chao, M. V.,J. Biol. Chem., in press. Briefly, CHO-K1 cells were stably transfected with a mammalian expression vector that drives the synthesis of a secreted, biologically active form of the human Fas ligand containing residues 103–281. Supernatant containing the soluble Fas ligand was prepared by culturing the CHO-K1 line in CHO-SFMII serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) in spinner culture for 72 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The cell-free supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm filter and used directly for experiments. The ability to induce cell death was assayed using mouse A20B cells. The LD50 was achieved using 10-fold diluted crude supernatants. Binding of the Fc-receptor fusion proteins to soluble human Fas ligand was assessed as follows. CHO-K1 supernatant containing soluble Fas ligand was diluted with an equal volume of Nonidet P-40 Buffer to a final volume of 500 μl. Fcfusion protein was added to a final concentration of 0.5 or 2.5 μg/ml and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The concentrations were determined empirically by performing a dose-response analysis using the wild-type Fc-FasR fusion protein. As a control, an anti-human Fas ligand monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen; clone G-247) was added to a concentration of 1 μg/ml. To each reaction, 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for another 30 min at 4 °C. The matrix was isolated by centrifugation and washed with 6 × 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 buffer at room temperature. Any bound soluble ligand was dissociated from the Fc fusion protein by boiling the matrix in 1 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the dissociated material was analyzed by Western blot after transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin, incubated with the anti-human Fas ligand monoclonal antibody at 0.5 μg/ml for 1 h, washed with Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20, and incubated with an anti-mouse (Fc-specific)-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. The Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20-washed membrane was exposed using ECL reagents (Pierce). The ability of the various Fc-receptor fusion proteins to neutralize the cytotoxic activity of soluble human Fas ligand was performed using A20 FasR+ cells as the target (32Onel K.B. Tucek-Szabo C.L. Ashany D. Lacy E. Nikolic-Zugic N. Elkon K.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2940-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A20 cells were grown exponentially in RPMI 1640 + 10% fetal calf serum (heat-inactivated) with Pen-Strep and Fungizone. The cells were diluted to 5 × 105/ml, and 50 μl was added to each well in a 96-well plate. Soluble human Fas ligand (50 μl of CHO-K1 supernatant) with or without Fc-receptor fusion protein at a known concentration was incubated with the A20 cells. Cells were cultured for 18 h in the presence of ligand, and viability was determined using the MTT assay. The viability of the A20 cells cultured with ligand and no Fc-fusion protein was <10% that of untreated cells. The ability of the Fc-fusion proteins to rescue the A20 cells from soluble Fas ligand was determined and expressed as the “% Rescue,” with the maximum viability set at 100%. Each condition was set up in duplicate, and the results were averaged. To begin to define the requirements of Fas receptor binding to its ligand, a series of extracellular domain chimeras were constructed between the Fas receptor and TNFR I. The choice of TNFR I was prompted by the close homology between CRD1, CRD2, and CRD3 of the Fas receptor and TNFR I (28Chao M.V. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To facilitate the binding analysis, the chimeric constructs were prepared by fusing the extracellular domains to the hinge region of the human IgG1 Fc region. This allowed for the isolation of the parental and mutant extracellular receptor sequences in native form from mammalian cells (22Marsters S.A. Frutkin A.D. Simpson N.J. Fendly B.M. Ashkenazi A. J.

Each of the coding sequences for the three CRDs or the short sequence N-terminal to CRD1 from the human Fas receptor was exchanged with the corresponding sequence from the human TNFR I by PCR (Fig.1). This yielded the following mutants: CRD1, CRD2, CRD3, and N-term Swap. The cDNAs encoding the extracellular domains of the wild-type human Fas receptor or TNFR I or the mutant forms of the Fas receptor in a human IgG1Fc expression vector were transiently transfected into 293T cells. Transfected cells were cultured under serum-free conditions, and Fc-fusion proteins were purified by protein A-Sepharose chromatography. The fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 2). Each recombinant protein was efficiently expressed and could be detected with the predicted molecular mass. Analysis under nonreducing conditions demonstrated that each protein shifted in apparent molecular mass by a factor of two, as expected for Fc-fusion proteins (data not shown).Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of Fc-receptor fusion proteins. The fusion proteins depicted in Fig. 1 were expressed in 293T cells after transient transfection and purified from serum-free supernatants using protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Each fusion protein (5 μg) was analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The fixed gel was stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue. wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of each chimeric fusion protein to bind the human Fas ligand was assessed using a soluble version of the ligand. Biologically active soluble ligand containing residues 103–281 was produced from stably transfected CHO-K1 cells.2 Purified Fc-fusion proteins were incubated with supernatant containing soluble Fas ligand and recovered by incubation with protein A-Sepharose. To determine whether the ligand bound to the Fc fusion proteins, the protein A-Sepharose-precipitated material was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-human Fas ligand specific monoclonal antibody (Fig.3 A). The monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of the ligand were observed. Concentrations of 0.5 and 2.5 μg/ml were chosen after dose-response analysis using the wild-type Fc-Fas receptor: ∼50% binding was observed at 0.5 μg/ml, whereas full binding was observed at 2.5 μg/ml. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by the lack of Fas ligand binding to the wild-type Fc-TNFR I. The results demonstrated that whereas the N-terminal Swap mutant bound the ligand as well as the wild-type Fc-Fas receptor, the CRD2 and CRD3 mutants showed no binding to ligand. Interestingly, although the CRD1 mutant did not bind ligand at 0.5 μg/ml, at the higher concentration of 2.5 μg/ml, ligand binding could be detected (Fig. 3 A). The CRD1 chimera was the only Fas mutant examined that exhibited this behavior. As a control, an anti-human Fas ligand monoclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate ligand from the CHO-K1 supernatant to demonstrate the total amount of ligand used in the assay. The immunoglobulin heavy-chain band can be seen at 55 kDa. Since the CRD1 mutant was generated by exchanging CRD1 and the short sequence N-terminal to it from the Fas receptor with that from TNFR I, the observed residual binding to ligand could be explained by one of several possibilities. First, the sequence exchanged by the CRD1 mutant may not be absolutely necessary for ligand binding. Alternatively, the sequence exchanged is required for ligand binding, but the homologous region from TNFR I can substitute for the loss of Fas receptor sequence. To address this issue, two additional Fc-receptor mutants were prepared: ΔCRD1 and C66R (Fig. 1). The ΔCRD1 deletes CRD1 and the short sequence N-terminal to it, leaving only CRD2 and CRD3 of the Fas receptor extracellular domain. The C66R mutation was identified during analysis of a patient with Canale-Smith syndrome, which is a human counterpart of the lpr-based disorder in mice (30Drappa J. Vaishnaw A.K. Sullivan K.E. Chu J.L. Elkon K.B. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 1643-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequencing of the Fas receptor cDNA from this individual's peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated the presence of a single mutation in the extracellular domain, resulting in TGC changed to CGC at codon 66 (Cys to Arg). As this cysteine is involved in one of two disulfide bonds that stabilize the structure of the Fas receptor CRD1, this mutation would be expected to distort this domain. Both ΔCRD1 and C66R constructs were appropriately expressed as Fc-fusion proteins as described above (see Fig. 2). These two mutant fusion proteins were assayed for their ability to bind the soluble human Fas ligand (Fig.4 A). The results demonstrated that neither of these mutants displayed the ability to bind the ligand even at a saturating concentration. Therefore, these findings support a role for the Fas CRD1 as critical in Fas ligand binding. Furthermore, the homologous domain from TNFR I appears to be capable of partially rescuing this loss in ligand binding activity by specifically complementing the loss of Fas receptor CRD1 sequence. As a means of quantitating the differences in Fas ligand binding potency among the Fc-receptor proteins, a Fas ligand-induced cell death bioassay was employed. Each fusion protein was assessed for its ability to protect A20 FasR+ cells from apoptosis induced by soluble human Fas ligand. A20 cells undergo rapid Fas-dependent cell death in the presence of agonist (32Onel K.B. Tucek-Szabo C.L. Ashany D. Lacy E. Nikolic-Zugic N. Elkon K.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2940-2947Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After an 18-h incubation with the Fas ligand and increasing concentrations of each Fc-fusion protein, A20 cell viability was determined by MTT assay. The wild-type and N-term Swap Fc-Fas receptor proteins were equipotent in protecting A20 cells from ligand-induced cell death with an IC50 = 0.5 μg/ml (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with the inability of the TNFR I, CRD2, CRD3, C66R, and ΔCRD1 Fc-fusion proteins to bind to the soluble Fas ligand, A20 cells were not protected from apoptosis (Figs. 3 B and 4 B). Finally, the CRD1 Fas mutant demonstrated full efficacy in this assay but with a significantly reduced potency (IC50 = 7 μg/ml). These findings were entirely consistent with the results from the ligand binding assays. The engagement of the Fas receptor by its ligand initiates an irreversible set of events culminating in apoptosis. In this study we have begun to define the requirements of the Fas receptor for binding to its ligand. We have utilized the homology found within the extracellular domains of all TNF receptor family members to generate a series of chimeric receptor bodies between the human Fas receptor and TNFR I (Fig. 1). One advantage of this approach is that the folding of the resulting mutant fusion proteins should not be significantly altered with respect to the wild-type protein due to the modular structure of the CRD sequence (23Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). A second advantage is that the specificity of the Fas receptor-ligand interaction can be clearly defined relative to TNFR I, i.e. which domains from the Fas receptor uniquely contribute specificity to Fas ligand binding. We have also taken advantage of fusion proteins with a deleted (ΔCRD1 mutant) or disrupted (C66R mutant) CRD1 to extend the binding study. The analysis of the binding and bioactivities of mutant Fc-fusion proteins indicated that all three CRDs of the human Fas receptor are required for ligand binding. Although exchanging the short sequences N-terminal to CRD1 had little effect, exchanges of CRD2 or CRD3 of the Fas receptor for the homologous domain found in TNFR I resulted in a complete loss of binding to the Fas ligand. Interestingly, exchanging the TNFR I CRD1 for the Fas receptor CRD1 led to a 14-fold diminution in ligand binding potency (Figs. 3,A and B). That CRD1 is absolutely necessary for binding to the Fas ligand is supported by the analysis of the ΔCRD1 and C66R mutant fusion proteins (Figs. 4, A andB). The removal of CRD1 or a single amino acid change that disrupts one of two disulfide links in this domain resulted in an inability to bind the Fas ligand. These findings, along with the observation that the CRD1 chimera can interact with the Fas ligand, indicates that much of the observed specificity of the Fas receptor for its ligand relative to TNFR I is dictated by sequences represented by CRD2 and CRD3 and to a lesser extent CRD1. Another conclusion from this study is that no single CRD or pair of CRDs is sufficient for Fas ligand binding. This is particularly relevant given recent findings of multiple splice variants of the human Fas receptor mRNA (33Cascino I. Fiucci G. Papoff G. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2706-2713PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cheng J. Zhou T. Liu C. Shapiro J.P. Brauer M.J. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Mountz J.D. Science. 1994; 263: 1759-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Cascino et al. (33Cascino I. Fiucci G. Papoff G. Ruberti G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 2706-2713PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that some of these splice variants, which encode soluble Fas receptor truncated within the extracellular domain, could play an important physiological role by binding to Fas ligand, thereby competing with the full-length Fas receptor. This represents an unlikely scenario, since Fas ligand binding requires all three Fas receptor CRDs. However, a splice variant encoding a soluble Fas receptor lacking the transmembrane domain may be a very important physiological or pathophysiological modulator of the Fas receptor-ligand system, as the encoded protein should contain three intact CRDs. Notably, some human Canale-Smith syndrome patients are heterozygous for mutations at the Fas locus that result in truncated soluble forms of the Fas extracellular domain (35Fisher G.H. Rosenberg F.J. Straus S.E. Dale J.K. Middelton L.A. Lin A.Y. Strober W. Lenardo M.J. Puck J.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 935-946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 36Rieux-Laucat F. Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Roberts I.A. Debatin K.M. Fischer A. de Villarty J.P. Science. 1995; 268: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). The observed autoimmune phenotype could thus result from reduced expression of the normal receptor due to reduced copy number or from a direct effect of the truncated form on the wild-type receptor. The results presented here exclude the possibility that the soluble mutant protein acts to compete with the normal receptor for ligand. The findings of this study add to previous studies of other TNF receptor family members. For TNFR I, ligand binding involves contacts to all four CRDs. CRD4, however, does not appear to be absolutely required, as deletion of this domain from TNFR I led to a 10-fold reduced affinity for TNF-α or TNF-β (22Marsters S.A. Frutkin A.D. Simpson N.J. Fendly B.M. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5747-5750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the x-ray structure of soluble TNFR I bound to TNF-β, in which CRDs 1, 2, and 3 make extensive contacts with the ligand (23Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). CRD4 of TNFR I appeared to be more disordered, and ligand contacts could not be determined with certainty (23Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (984) Google Scholar). In contrast, experiments with the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) have indicated that CRDs 3 and 4 from p75NTR are required for NGF binding, with deletion of CRDs 1 and 2 having little or no effect (37Welcher A.A. Bitler C.M. Radeke M.J. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Disruption of either CRD3 or CRD4 by insertion mutagenesis led to a loss of NGF binding (38Yan H. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12099-12104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data imply that CRDs 1 and 2 from p75NTR do not appear to be required for NGF binding, but both CRD3 and CRD4 are necessary and sufficient. Thus, for each TNF receptor family member, a different requirement exists for ligand binding that involves use of alternative cysteine-rich repeats. This is highlighted by the variability in the number of CRDs among receptor family members, ranging from as few as two (e.g. DR4 and CAR1) to as many as six CRDs (e.g. CD30). Recently, serine-scanning mutagenesis was performed on the extracellular domain of the human Fas receptor that revealed several contact residues for binding Fas ligand (31Starling G.C. Bajorath J. Emswiler J. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Kiener P.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1487-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our study indicates that Fas receptor binding to its ligand requires all three cysteine-rich repeats, and this interaction is distinct from a closely related receptor, TNFR I. Furthermore, CRD1 from TNFR I can partially substitute for the homologous region in the Fas receptor. Additional structural analysis may allow for the production of a modified Fas receptor with a higher affinity for ligand, from which more potent Fas receptor-ligand antagonists could be developed. We thank Avi Ashkenazi for helpful advice."

In mammalian cells, transmembrane flux of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs is mediated by both equilibrative and Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters (4Belt J.A. Marina N.M. Phelps D.A.

Consequently the distribution and functional characteristics of these transporters play important roles in determining the absorption, disposition, and elimination of nucleoside drugs (5Griffith D.A.

Nucleoside transporters present in tumor cells and in the vicinity of purinergic receptors may also represent important gene targets for drug therapy (3Lerman B.B. Belardinelli L.

The equilibrative nucleoside transporters mediate passive downhill transport of nucleosides and function bidirectionally in accordance with the concentration gradient of the substrate. Equilibrative nucleoside transporters exhibit a broad substrate selectivity for both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and appear to be ubiquitous in mammalian cells. They have been further classified into two subtypes (es and ei) according to their sensitivity to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine (5Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters mediate active uphill transport of nucleosides into cells by coupling to the inwardly directed Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane. These transporters have been demonstrated in a variety of tissues including intestinal and renal epithelia, hepatocytes, choroid plexus, and cultured leukemia cells (9Che M. Ortiz D.F. Arias I.M. J.

Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters exhibit distinct transport selectivity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides and have been classified into several subtypes based on their substrate selectivity. The N1 (or cif) Na+-dependent nucleoside transport system is purine-selective; the N2 (or cit) system is pyrimidine-selective; and the N3 (or cib) system is broadly selective (or nonselective). Uridine and adenosine are transported by all known Na+-dependent nucleoside transport systems. The unique features of Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters such as their ability to mediate uphill nucleoside transport, their distinct transport selectivity for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, and their presence in many critical organs suggest that they may play special physiological and pharmacological roles in mammalian cells. Recently, a purine-selective (N1 subtype) nucleoside transporter, SPNT, and a pyrimidine-selective (N2 subtype) transporter, rCNT1, were cloned from rat by expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes (9Che M.

The cloned N1 (659 amino acids) and N2 (648 amino acids) transporters share 64% identity and are both predicted to possess 14 putative transmembrane domains. These two cloned transporters are shown to be involved in the cellular uptake of nucleoside drugs including adenosine, cladribine, azidothymidine, and 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine (9Che M. Ortiz D.F.

Despite the extensive studies on the kinetic properties of these transporters and their interactions with nucleoside drugs, little is known about the structural elements and molecular mechanisms that underlie the functional properties of Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters. In this study, we focus on delineating the structural domains involved in substrate binding and the molecular determinants responsible for the distinct substrate selectivity of N1 and N2 nucleoside transporters. By constructing a series of chimeric N1/N2 transporters and analyzing their transport selectivity for purine or pyrimidine nucleosides, structural elements contributing to substrate binding and selectivity are revealed. Knowledge about the substrate-binding domains of Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters and the determinants of their substrate selectivity should benefit the design of nucleoside drugs with improved membrane permeability and the development of nucleoside transporter inhibitors with improved potency and specificity. The cDNAs of wild-type N1 and N2 transporters were isolated by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction from mRNA prepared from rat IEC-6 cells and rat intestine, respectively. The cDNAs were then subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) under the control of T7 promoter. The predicted amino acid sequence of N2 is identical to the published sequence of rCNT1. The predicted amino acid sequence of N1 is identical to the published sequence of SPNT except for an Ala to Gly substitution at residue 419. The A419G substitution was also observed by other workers and was attributed to polymorphism in rats (16Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Ritzel M.W. Gati W.P. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1529-1535PubMed Google Scholar). The Genetics Computer Group software (Wisconsin Package, version 8) was used to align the nucleotides and the deduced amino acid sequences of N1 and N2. Chimeras were constructed by using both native restriction enzyme sites and engineered sites introduced through site-directed mutagenesis (Sculptor™ in vitro mutagenesis system, Amersham Corp.). Junctions were made within homologous regions, generally in stretches of identical amino acid sequences between the wild-type transporters. No foreign amino acid was introduced in any chimera construct. The sequence of each chimera was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing in the Biochemical Resource Center at the University of California at San Francisco. cRNA of each chimera was synthesized and injected into defolliculated oocytes as described previously (18Wang J. Su S.F. Dresser M.J. Schaner M.E. Washington C.B. Giacomini K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Uptake was measured on groups of 10 oocytes 48–56 h post-injection at 25 °C in 150 μl of transport buffer (2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing either 100 mm NaCl or 100 mm choline chloride and the respective 3H-labeled nucleoside (Moravek Biochemicals). The kinetic parameter (apparent K m values) were determined by nonlinear least square fits of substrate/velocity profiles to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Kaleidagraph (version 3.0, Synergy Software). Because of the intrinsic variability in the expression level of the transporters between batches of oocytes, the data are generally expressed as the means ± S.E. from a representative experiment performed in the same batch of oocytes. However, experiments were repeated at least twice in separated batches of oocytes. The cDNAs of rat N1 transporter (SPNT) and rat N2 transporter (rCNT1) were cloned by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The 14 putative transmembrane domains of N1 and N2 were assigned according to the published model of rCNT1 (10Huang Q.Q. Yao S.Y. Ritzel M.W. Paterson A.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17757-17760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A series of chimeras were constructed and expressed in X. laevis oocytes. Because uridine and adenosine are transported by all known Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters, chimeras were first screened with the common substrate [3H]uridine for activity. Purine or pyrimidine selectivity was then tested with both [3H]inosine (a model purine nucleoside) and [3H]thymidine (a model pyrimidine nucleoside). Inhibition studies with naturally occurring nucleosides were performed to further confirm purine or pyrimidine selectivity. The structures of wild-type N1 and N2 transporters and representative chimeric transporters are shown in Fig. 1. The first chimera produced (Fig. 1), Chimera T8–14, consisting of TM1–7 1The abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane domain(s); aa, amino acids. of N2 and TM8–14 of N1 maintained the transport selectivity of N1 (data not shown), suggesting that domains responsible for substrate discrimination reside in the C-terminal half of the transporter. Subsequent smaller replacements narrowed down this region to TM8–9. Replacing TM8–9 of N2 with that of N1 generated Chimera T8–9; replacing only TM8 generated Chimera T8; and replacing only TM9 generated Chimera T9 (Fig.1). The uptake of [3H]inosine and [3H]thymidine in oocytes injected with the cRNA of N1, N2, Chimera T8–9, and Chimera T8 is shown in Fig.2 (A–D). The effect of various naturally occurring purine and pyrimidine nucleosides on [3H]uridine uptake in the injected oocytes is shown in Fig. 3 (A–D). All of these chimeras were functional, suggesting that all were expressed, folded, and inserted into the oocyte plasma membrane.Figure 3Effects of naturally occurring nucleosides on [3H]uridine uptake mediated by wild-type N1 (A), wild-type N2 (B), Chimera T8–9 (C), and Chimera T8 (D). Oocytes were injected with water or 20 ng of cRNA. [3H]Uridine uptake was determined in Na+-containing buffer in the absence of inhibitors in cRNA- and H2O-injected oocytes (controls) or the presence of 1 mm of various nucleoside inhibitors in cRNA-injected oocytes. Each value represents the mean ± S.E. of data obtained in 8–10 oocytes from one representative experiment of several experiments of similar results (i.e. the same inhibition pattern for each transporter). The inhibitors are the common substrates uridine (U) and adenosine (A), the model pyrimidine nucleosides, cytidine (C) and thymidine (T), and the model purine nucleosides, guanosine (G) and inosine (I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Wild-type N1 transports inosine but not thymidine (Fig. 2 A). The N1-mediated Na+-dependent uridine uptake is fully inhibited (i.e. to the uptake level in the water-injected oocytes) by the common substrates, uridine and adenosine, as well as by the model purine nucleosides, inosine and guanosine. The model pyrimidine nucleosides, cytidine and thymidine, only partially inhibit the uptake (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, wild-type N2 transports thymidine but not inosine (Fig. 2 B). N2-mediated Na+-dependent uridine uptake is fully inhibitable by the model pyrimidine nucleosides and the common substrates but not by the model purine nucleosides (Fig.3 B). Chimera T8–9 exhibited both a substrate selectivity and an inhibition profile similar to those of the wild-type N1 (Fig.2 C and 3C), suggesting that TM8–9 contain domains responsible for the distinct purine selectivity. Interestingly, the requirement of Na+ in the transport process seemed less stringent in oocytes expressing Chimera T8–9 (Fig. 2 C). Replacement of Na+ with choline only partially inhibited inosine uptake. The reason for this observation is unknown. Chimera T8 exhibited a broad substrate selectivity, transporting both inosine and thymidine (Fig. 2 D). The transport activity was fully inhibited by all of the naturally occurring purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (Fig. 3 D). Broadly selective Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters have been described and classified as N3 subtype nucleoside transporters (12Wu X. Yuan G. Brett C.M. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8813-8818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Redlak M.J. Zehner Z.E. Betcher S.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), but to date no typical N3 transporter has been cloned. It would be interesting to compare the sequence of Chimera T8 to that of the native N3 transporter when its sequence becomes available. Chimera T9 was a low activity transporter with a novel substrate selectivity. When expressed in oocytes, Chimera T9 induced a 4–5-fold increase in Na+-dependent uridine uptake (0.72 ± 0.11 pmol/oocyte/30 min for cRNA-injectedversus 0.15 ± 0.02 pmol/oocyte/30 min for water-injected; mean ± S.E.) without a significant increase in the uptake of inosine or thymidine. However, the Na+-dependent uridine uptake was inhibited to the basal level by all nucleosides at 1 mm including inosine and thymidine (data not shown), suggesting that all nucleosides can serve as inhibitors to this process. To exclude the possibility that the introduction of any N1 sequence into N2 would alter its substrate selectivity, a chimera (Chimera T11) in which the TM11 and the preceding intracellular loop of N2 were replaced with those of N1 was generated. Chimera T11 maintained the substrate selectivity of N2 (data not shown), suggesting that replacing regions other than TM8–9 does not affect the substrate selectivity of N2. In summary, these data suggest that TM8–9 confer the minimal domain requirement for the distinct substrate selectivity of N1 and N2 nucleoside transporters and may form at least part of a substrate-binding site in these transporters. Further changes within TM8–9 may alter the fitness of the binding pocket, thereby generating nucleoside transporters with novel properties that are not observed with either wild-type transporter (e.g. Chimera T8 and Chimera T9). However, it is also possible that TM8–9 themselves may not be directly involved in the binding and/or selectivity but may influence the transport selectivity through indirect interactions with other sites in the transporter protein. Sequence alignment revealed that 11 amino acids differ in the 63 amino acids spanning the TM8–9 of rat N1 and N2. Nine of the same substitutions are also conserved in the human N1 and N2 transporters. The importance of these residues in determining the substrate selectivity of N1 and N2 transporters needs to be investigated by mutation studies. Our effort to construct functional reciprocal chimeras with regions containing TM8–9 of N2 transplanted into N1 was not successful. Two constructs exhibited no transport activity when expressed in oocytes. In structure-function studies with chimeric proteins, the function of chimeras is often lost due to reasons that may include protein misfolding, functional impairment, or improper plasma membrane targeting (21Caron M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 409Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 22Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Zhang X. Collins K.I. Greenberger L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5441-5448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to investigate why these reciprocal constructs are not functional. The apparent transport affinities (K m ) of wild-type N1 and N2 and Chimeras T8–9 and T8 toward their substrates are measured and compared (Table I). Chimera T8, which displayed a broad N3 transport selectivity, exhibited apparent K m values for uridine, inosine, and thymidine similar to those of the wild-type N1 and N2 transporters (Table I). Interestingly, Chimera T8–9, which maintained the transport selectivity of the wild-type N1, exhibited increased apparent transport affinities for both uridine (K m = 3.6 μm) and inosine (K m = 6.3 μm) as compared with those of wild-type N1 (34 μm for uridine and 15 μm for inosine) (Table I). In transport kinetic analysis, the Michaelis constantK m reflects not only substrate affinity for the binding site but is also influenced by rate constants of substrate translocation and dissociation that occur subsequent to recognition (22Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed affinity changes of Chimera T8–9 may reflect changes in any of these three processes. The apparent maximal rate of transport (V max) reflects the efficiency by which each substrate is translocated and is greatly influenced by the expression level (22Buck K.J. Amara S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12584-12588Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Consequently, direct comparison ofV max between independent experiments is not meaningful. However, under identical expression conditions, the observed single point transport activity for uridine usually followed the order of N2 > Chimera T8 > Chimera T8–9 ≥ N1.Table IApparent Km values of wild-type and chimeric transportersApparent K mUridineInosineThymidineμmWild-type N134 ± 1715 ± 1.6—Wild-type N222 ± 7.9—4.9 ± 1.7Chimera T8–93.6 ± 0.66.3 ± 2.4—Chimera T820 ± 2.724 ± 3.614 ± 4.9The initial velocities of uptake of each nucleoside were determined at 6–8 concentration points ranging from 1 to 200 μm.

In the present study, we identified a discrete region (TM8–9) as the structural determinant for the distinct transport selectivity of the N1 and N2 Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters. TM8–9 may form at least part of a substrate-binding site in these nucleoside transporters. Furthermore, we presented examples (Chimera T8 and Chimera T9) of engineering transporters with novel substrate selectivity from known transporters. Because the three-dimensional structures of membrane proteins remain difficult to achieve and the structure-function relations of Na+-cotransporters are largely unknown (24Kaplan J.H.

The molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate these diverse effects are unclear. One emerging hypothesis suggests that TRs could mediate these diverse effects via cooperation with different transcription factors/receptors. Indeed, we have recently shown that the human TR subtype β1 (h-TRβ1) interacts with the tumor suppressor p53. p53 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and tumor development. To assess the physiological relevance of the interaction of h-TRβ1 with p53, the present study addressed the question as to whether the functions of h-TRβ1 could be modulated by p53. We first compared the h-TRβ1-mediated transcriptional activity in two pairs of isogenic cell lines, RKO/RKO E6 and MCF-7/MCF-7 E6. RKO and MCF-7 cells are colon and breast carcinoma cell lines, respectively, that contain p53 but lack TRβ1. The isogenic RKO E6 and MCF-7 E6 cells are stable clones expressing high levels of papillomavirus type 16 E6 protein. In these cells, the level of p53 protein was lower than the parental cells. The impairment of p53 functions in these E6-containing cells led to an activation of TRβ1-mediated transcriptional activity. Furthermore, in a growth hormone-producing cell line in which the expression of the growth hormone gene is positively regulated by TRs, overexpression of the wild-type p53 led to repression in the expression of the growth hormone gene. Thus, TRs could cross-talk with p53 in its signaling pathways to regulate gene regulatory functions. The present findings further strengthen the hypothesis that mediation of the pleiotropic effects of T3 requires the cooperation of TRs with a large network of transcription factors.

These effects are mediated by the interaction of T3 with the thyroid hormone nuclear receptors (TRs). Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) belong to the steroid hormone/retinoic acid receptor superfamily and function as ligand-dependent transcription factors. Two TR genes, α and β, encode two receptor variants through alternative splicing of each of the primary transcripts. The gene regulating activity of TRs depends not only on T3 but also on the specific DNA sequences in the promoter regions of T3responsive genes, known as the thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) (1Cheng S.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that the gene regulating activity of TR is further modulated via interaction with other cellular proteins including several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (1Cheng S.Y.

Despite recent progress, the molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate the T3 biological activities are still unclear. One of the central issues is how the diverse effects of T3 are achieved. We hypothesized that the diverse effects of T3could be mediated by interaction of TRs with other transcription factors/cellular factors in the signaling pathways of TRs. Thus, the hormone signal mediated by TRs could be modulated by the TR-interacting transcription factors depending on the cellular context. Recently, we searched for such transcription factors and found that the tumor suppressor p53 physically interacts with human TR subtype β1 (h-TRβ1) (8Yap N. Yu C.-l. Cheng S.-y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). p53 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. It activates transcription by binding to specific DNA sequences known as p53 response elements (9Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2285) Google Scholar, 10Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1895) Google Scholar). However, it can also repress expression of genes that lack p53 response elements (11Santhanam U. Ray A. Sehgal P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7605-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Donehower L.A. Bradley A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 23: 181-205Google Scholar, 13Pietenpol J.A. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 365: 17-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, p53 interacts avidly with a variety of cellular proteins and viral proteins leading to modifications of the biochemical activities and/or functions of these associated proteins (13Pietenpol J.A. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 365: 17-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the physical interaction of h-TRβ1 with p53 leads to the inhibition of the binding of h-TRβ1 to TREs in a concentration-dependent manner (8Yap N. Yu C.-l. Cheng S.-y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Using exogenous genes transfected into TR-deficient cells, we found that T3-dependent h-TRβ1-mediated transactivation activity is inhibited by p53 (8Yap N. Yu C.-l. Cheng S.-y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the functional relevance of this interaction has not been defined (8Yap N. Yu C.-l. Cheng S.-y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The present study adopted two independent systems to address the question of whether the interaction of p53 with TRs led to functional consequences. In one system, we used two pairs of isogenic cell lines in which the expression of endogenous p53 differed so that the effect of p53 on the transcriptional activity of h-TRβ1 can be compared within a pair. In another system, we utilized a clonal growth hormone-producing cell line, GC cells, in which the expression of the growth hormone is under the control of TRs (14Yaffe B.M. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6284-6291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dobner P.R. Kawasaki E.S. Yu L.Y. Bancroft F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The effect of p53 on the function of TRs can be conveniently assessed by the alterations in the expression of the growth hormone gene. Using these two systems, we found that the function of TRs was modulated by p53, indicating that p53 interacted with the TR-mediated signaling pathways.

After culturing RKO and MCF-7 cells (1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) in regular growth medium for 24 h, the medium was changed to Opti-MEM I serum-free medium for 1 h before infection. Cells were infected with either Adh-TRβ1 or the control Ad-null (10 plaque-forming units/cell) by rocking gently for 2 h at 37 °C. An equal volume of DMEM medium containing 20% thyroid hormone-depleted fetal bovine serum was added, and the cells were further incubated for 24 h. Cell lysates were prepared by repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and the expression of h-TRβ1 in cell lysates was analyzed by Western blotting as described (21Zhu X.-G. McPhie P. Lin K.-H. Cheng S.-Y. J.

Ad-hTRβ1 or the control Ad-null-infected RKO/RKO E6 and MCF-7/MCF-7 E6 cells as described above were scraped and washed, and the nuclei were isolated as described previously (23Ting Y.-T. Bhat M. Wong R. Cheng S.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The washed nuclei were incubated with 0.5 nmol of [125I]T3 in the absence or presence of 1 μmol of unlabeled T3 for 30 min at 37 °C. The nuclei were washed, and the radioactivity was determined as described (23Ting Y.-T. Bhat M. Wong R. Cheng S.-y. J. Biol.

RKO/RKO E6 and MCF-7/MCF-7 E6 cells (1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were cultured for 24 h, and the medium was replaced by Opti-MEM I serum-free medium for 1 h before transfection. Cells were transfected by lipofectamine method with CAT reporter plasmid containing Pal TRE (pTK28 m-CAT; 2 μg). The total DNA used was 4 μg, which was normalized by the addition of pBluescript. Forty-five minutes after transfection, Adh-TRβ1 or the control Ad-null (10 plaque-forming units/cell), was added to respective dishes. After 2 h, an equal volume of DMEM medium containing 20% thyroid hormone-depleted serum was added. Four hours later, cells were incubated with or without T3 (100 nm) for an additional 24 h. Cells were lysed, and the CAT activity was determined as described previously (23Ting Y.-T. Bhat M. Wong R. Cheng S.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Northern blotting was used to evaluate the effect of p53 on the synthesis of GH mRNA. Rat pituitary GC cells (1.5 × 106/10-cm dish) were grown in DMEM containing thyroid hormone-depleted calf serum for 48 h before infection. Cells were infected with Ad-p53 or the control Ad-null at 10 plaque-forming units/cell as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for 24 h, total RNA was prepared and purified by QIA shredders and RNeasy Total RNA kit (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. The RNA was analyzed on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde (40%) at a constant voltage (80 V) for 2 h. The RNA bands were visualized and photographed. The RNA was transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were probed with 32P-labeled GH cDNA. After autoradiogaphy and quantitation of the GH mRNA bands by PhosphoImager, the blots were stripped by incubating in 0.1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at 95 °C for 30 min and reprobed with32P-labeled β-actin cDNA. The intensities of the β-actin mRNA bands were quantified by PhosphoImager. Western blotting was used to analyze the expression of p53 in GC cells after infection with Ad-p53. GC cells (1.5 × 106/10-cm dish) were infected as described above. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% sodium deoxycholic acid, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5). The lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was carried out as described above using anti-p53 antibodies OP03 and OP43 and anti-β-actin antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). RKO and MCF-7 cells provided a useful tool to evaluate the functional consequences of the interaction of h-TRβ1 with p53. These two cell lines contain the wild-type p53 but lack endogenous h-TRβ1. Furthermore, each of these two cell lines has an isogenic counterpart (RKO E6 and MCF-7 E6), which was derived from stable incorporation of the human papillomavirus type 16 E6 gene into genomes (24Zhan Q. Fan S. Smith M.L. Bae I. Yu K. Alamo I. O'Connor P.M. Fornace A.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). E6 gene product stimulates degradation of p53 through a ubiquitin pathway, thereby abrogating p53 functions (18Fan S. Smith M.L. Rivet 2nd, D.J. Duba D. Zhan Q. Kohn K.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. O'Connor P.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kessis T.D. Slebos R.J. Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Plunkett B.S. Han S.M. Lorincz A.T. Hedrick L. Cho K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3988-3992Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Fig.1 confirms that RKO E6 cells had no detectable p53 as compared with RKO stable transfectants with vector only (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). It is known that DNA damage induced by γ-irradiation results in an accumulation of p53 (26Zhan Q. Carrier F. Fornace A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4242-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). We therefore γ-irradiated RKO cells to indicate that p53 detected in lane 1 was indeed functional. As expected, in γ-irradiated RKO cells, the expression of p53 was increased ∼5-fold (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). The protein band with lower molecular weight could be due to a different degree of phosphorylation of p53 (27Milczarek G.J. Martinez J. Bowden G.T. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), which was also observed by others (19Katayose D. Gudas J. Nguyen H. Srivastava S. Cowan K.H. Seth P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 889-897PubMed Google Scholar,28Debbas M. White E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In contrast, no p53 was visible by γ-irradiation of RKO E6 cells (lane 4), indicating impairment of p53 function in E6-containing cells. Similar observations were also found for MCF-7 E6 cells (data not shown). This functional impairment is consistent with that reported previously for RKO E6 and MCF-7 E6 (18Fan S. Smith M.L. Rivet 2nd, D.J. Duba D. Zhan Q. Kohn K.W. Fornace Jr., A.J. O'Connor P.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1649-1654PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kessis T.D. Slebos R.J. Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Plunkett B.S.

We therefore took advantage of these functional characteristics to demonstrate the differential effect of p53 on TR transcriptional activity in these isogenic pairs of cell lines. Because RKO and MCF-7 cells lack h-TRβ1, recombinant adenovirus containing h-TRβ1 cDNA (20Hayashi Y. Mangoura D. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar) was used to mediate the expression of h-TRβ1 in these cells. Consistent with that reported by Hayashiet al. (20Hayashi Y. Mangoura D. Refetoff S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar), we found that more than 90% of cells expressed h-TRβ1 as determined by immunofluorescence staining (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the expression of h-TRβ1 proteins in RKO and MCF-7 cells by Western blotting. Lane 2shows the expression of h-TRβ1 protein (M r = 55,000) in RKO cells infected with Adh-TRβ1, whereas no h-TRβ1 was detected when cells were infected with the control adenovirus lacking the cDNA for h-TRβ1 (Ad-null; Fig. 2, lane 1). A similar level of expression of h-TRβ1 was also detected in E6-containing RKO cells (lane 4), whereas no h-TRβ1 was seen in Ad-null-infected RKO E6 cells (Fig. 2, lane 3). h-TRβ1 was also expressed in MCF-7 and MCF-7 E6 cells, which were infected similarly with Adh-TRβ1 (lanes 6 and8, respectively) but not with Ad-null (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 7). The band with lower molecular weight probably represented the degradation product of h-TRβ1 (23Ting Y.-T. Bhat M. Wong R. Cheng S.-y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These results indicated that h-TRβ1 was expressed in these two cell lines via adenovirus infection and that the expression of h-TRβ1 was not affected by the presence of E6 protein. To confirm that the expressed h-TRβ1 in these cells was functional, we isolated nuclei from cells infected with Adh-TRβ1 or Ad-null and compared their [125I]T3 binding activity. We found that the nuclei isolated from the Ad-null-infected MCF-7, MCF-7 E6, RKO, and RKO E6 cells had no detectable [125I]T3 binding activity, whereas the nuclei isolated from the Adh-TRβ1-infected MCF-7, MCF-7 E6, RKO, and RKO E6 cells bound to [125I]T3 in the range of 67–92 fmol/mg nuclear protein. Using exogenous genes transfected into cells, we have previously shown that the transactivation activity of h-TRβ1 was repressed by p53 (8Yap N. Yu C.-l. Cheng S.-y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further investigated whether impairment of p53 functions due to depletion of the endogenous p53 level via E6-enhanced degradation would result in increases in h-TRβ1-mediated transcriptional activity. The isogenic pairs of MCF-7 and RKO cells were transfected with TRE-containing reporters followed by infection with Adh-TRβ1. Bars 2 and 4 of Fig.3 compare the fold of T3-induced transcriptional activity mediated by Pal TRE in MCF-7 and MCF-7 E6 cells, respectively. It is clear that the transcriptional activity of h-TRβ1 in MCF-7 E6 cells that had reduced p53 was enhanced by ∼4-fold. This enhancement was not due to the increased expression of h-TRβ1 in the E6-containing MCF-7 cells, because the expression of h-TRβ1 was identical in MCF-7 and MCF-7 E6 cells (see the expression level of h-TRβ1 in Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 8). These results indicate that lowering the level of p53 relieved the repression effect by p53 on the transcriptional activity of h-TRβ1. A significantly higher transcriptional activity was also detected in RKO E6 cells as compared with RKO cells (Fig. 3, bars 6 and 8). However, the magnitude in the relief of repression was not as high as that seen in MCF-7 cells. This could reflect the fact that a higher level of h-TRβ1 was expressed in MCF-7 cells than was expressed in RKO cells (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 8 versus 2 and4). Fig. 3, (bars 1, 3, 5, and 7) indicates the transcriptional activities in the absence of TRs. To further establish the functional relevance of the interaction of TRβ1 with p53, we used growth hormone-producing cell lines that were derived from the somatotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. In growth hormone-producing cells, the synthesis of GH is stimulated by T3 (14Yaffe B.M. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6284-6291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dobner P.R. Kawasaki E.S. Yu L.Y. Bancroft F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which is mediated by the interaction of TRs with the positive thyroid hormone response elements located in the promoter region of the GH gene (16Brent G.A.

Samuels H.H. Brent G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19636-19644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth hormone-producing cells have long been conveniently used as a model cell line to study the mechanism of thyroid hormone action (14Yaffe B.M. Samuels H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6284-6291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dobner P.R. Kawasaki E.S. Yu L.Y. Bancroft F.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Using Western blotting, we found that GC cells lacked detectable endogenous p53 in cells treated with or without T3 (Fig. 4,lanes 2–5). Therefore, this cell line provided a tool to examine the effect of p53 on the function of TR by examining the expression of GH mRNA. We used Ad-p53 to mediate the expression of p53 in GC cells (Fig. 4,lane 6) (19Katayose D. Gudas J. Nguyen H. Srivastava S. Cowan K.H. Seth P. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 889-897PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in lane 7, the expression of p53 was not regulated by T3. For controls, we used GC cells similarly infected, but with the Ad-null in the absence or presence of T3 (lanes 4 and 5,respectively), and no p53 was detected in either condition. The expression of β-actin was also measured, and similar levels of β-actin were seen in uninfected (lanes 2 and3), Ad-null infected (lanes 4 and 5), and Ad-p53 infected cells (lanes 6 and 7), indicating that under the experimental conditions used, expression of p53 did not affect cell viability. The T3-induced expression of GH gene in GC cells was determined by mRNA levels using Northern blotting. As shown in Fig.5, GC cells infected by the control Ad-null virus had the same degree of T3-induced GH mRNA expression as the cells that had not been infected with a virus (∼5.5 fold), indicating that the Ad-null virus had no effect on the induction of GH gene expression by T3. However, in GC cells that expressed p53, the induction of GH mRNA by T3 was reduced by ∼50%. These results clearly demonstrate that the expression of p53 led to the repression of the stimulatory function of TR on the synthesis of GH mRNA. By two independent systems, the present study demonstrated that p53 cross-talked with TR in the T3-dependent signaling pathways. In one system, the T3-dependent transcriptional activity of TRs was enhanced by depletion of the endogenous p53 level in both MCF-7 and RKO cells. In another system, the intrinsic function of TRs in T3-dependent stimulation of the GH gene was repressed by the enhanced expression of p53 in GC cells. These results indicate that p53 is a negative regulator of TR functions. Recently, many TR-interacting proteins have been identified (1Cheng S.Y. J. Biomed.

Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass CK. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar), SMRT/TRAC (3Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 6Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and SHP (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) have been shown to be repressors of TRs. The repression action of p53 demonstrated in this study differs in at least three ways from that proposed for N-CoR (2Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass CK. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar) and SMRT/TRAC (3Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar, 6Sande S. Privalsky M.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). First, the repression action of p53 is T3-dependent, whereas the repression action of N-CoR and SMRT/TRAC only occurs in the absence of T3. Second, the binding site of p53 is located in the DNA binding domain of TRs (8Yap N. Yu C.-l. Cheng S.-y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas the binding site for N-CoR and SMRT/TRAC was shown to be in the D domain (2Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass CK. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Third, the mode of repression by p53 is mediated by inhibiting the binding of TRs to TREs as a result of its binding to the DNA binding domain of TRs (8Yap N. Yu C.-l. Cheng S.-y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4273-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas the repression action of N-CoR and SMRT/TRAC was proposed to act by locking the TRs in a conformation that is incapable of binding to a co-activator, thereby preventing TRs from functioning as a gene activator (2Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass CK. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations, the repression action of p53 on TRs is most likely independent of that of N-CoR and SMRT/TRAC. The repression action of p53 on TRs, however, is reminiscent of a recently identified TR-interacting protein, SHP (2Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass CK. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). SHP is an orphan nuclear receptor that lacks a DNA binding domain that, in addition to TR, heterodimerizes with several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Like p53, SHP prevents the receptors from binding to their hormone response elements and inhibits hormone-dependent transactivation by the receptors with which it interacts (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). SHP was suggested to act as a negative regulator of receptor functions. Even though the repression effect by SHP on endogenous TR target genes has yet to be demonstrated to clearly establish its negatively regulatory role, the findings that TR functions could potentially be negatively regulated by two transcription factors, p53 and SHP, raise an interesting possibility that multiple regulators acting in a similar mode may serve to regulate TR functions in a tissue-specific or development-dependent manner. This notion is supported by the different expression patterns of SHP and p53. SHP is abundantly expressed only in liver, at a much lower level in heart and pancreas, and none in other tissues (5Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), whereas p53 is expressed in most of the tissues. Together with the different degrees of expression of these two negative regulators at different stages of development, the combinatorial diversities achieved via interaction of TR with p53 and/or SHP could be one of the molecular mechanisms by which TRs mediate the diverse actions of T3. The demonstration that p53 could functionally participate in the T3-dependent signaling pathway has important implications for the understanding of the biology of normal and cancer cells. For example, TRs are known to stimulate cell growth by shortening the duration of the G1 phase (29DeSesi C.R. Surks M.I. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30DeSesi C.R. Fels E.C. Surks M.I. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 293-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 31DeSesi C.R. Fels E.C. Surks M.I. Endocrinology. 1986; 116: 2026-2069Google Scholar), whereas p53 has an antiproliferative effect and arrests the progression of cells at the G1 phase (32Maxwell S.A. Roth J.A. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1994; 5: 23-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that p53 could modulate the growth stimulatory effect of T3. Furthermore, it has been shown that T3enhances the x-ray-induced neoplastic transformation in vitro (33Guernesey D. Fisher P.B. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1990; 1: 389-408PubMed Google Scholar). Because mutation of p53 plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, the role of TRs in neoplastic transformation potentially could be modulated by p53. Therefore, our findings have opened a new area in the study of the action of TRs. Furthermore, the identification of p53 as one of the TR-associated proteins further supports the hypothesis that the mediation of the pleiotropic effects of T3 requires the cooperation of TRs with a large network of transcription factors and receptors. At present, it is not known whether the function of p53 is also modulated by other members of the receptor superfamily. However, Yuet al. recently found that the transactivation activity of the glucocorticoid receptor detected by a reporter system is also repressed by p53 (34Yu C-l. Yap N. Chen D. Cheng S.-y. Cancer Lett. 1997; 116: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that the functions of endogenous p53 could also be modulated by members of the steroid hormone receptors. These findings raise the possibility that p53 cross-talks to a large network of nuclear receptor superfamily to regulate cellular functions. We thank Dr. S.

Reported in this study is the first characterization of the underivatized cofactor in native lysyl oxidase by resonance Raman (RR) spectrometry. The spectrum is characterized by a unique set of vibrational modes in the 1200 to 1700 cm−1 region. We show that the RR spectrum of lysyl oxidase closely matches that of a synthetic LTQ model compound, 4-n-butylamino-5-ethyl-1,2-benzoquinone, in aqueous solutions but differs significantly from those of other topa quinone-containing amine oxidases under similar conditions. Furthermore, we have observed the same 18O shift of the C=O stretch in both the lysyl oxidase enzyme and the LTQ cofactor model compound. The RR spectra of different model compounds and their D shifts give additional evidence for the protonation state of LTQ cofactor in the enzyme. The overall similarity of these spectra and their shifts shows that the lysyl oxidase cofactor and the model LTQ compound have the same structure and properties. These data provide strong and independent support for the new cofactor structure, unambiguously ruling out the possibility that the structure originally reported had been derived from a spurious side reaction during the derivatization of the protein and isolation of the active site peptide.

Among the well-known quinocofactors, topa quinone (TPQ, 1The abbreviations used are: TPQ, 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine (topa) quinone; CAO, copper amine oxidases; LTQ, lysine tyrosylquinone; RR: resonance Raman.

One of the mammalian CAOs, lysyl oxidase, plays an important role in the development of connective tissues through its catalysis of the post-translational oxidative modification of the ε-amino group of the lysine side chains to form inter- and intrachain protein cross-links (2Kagan H.M.

Recently, the active site cofactor in lysyl oxidase was identified as lysine tyrosylquinone (LTQ, StructureFs1), derived from the cross-linking of a modified tyrosine residue to the ε-group of a lysyl side chain (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The identification of this cofactor involved the isolation of an active site cofactor-containing peptide from phenylhydrazine-derivatized lysyl oxidase and the subsequent structural characterization of this peptide by Edman sequencing, mass spectrometric, and resonance Raman spectrometric studies (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As described (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), [14C]phenylhydrazine was used to inactivate and stabilize the enzyme, as well as to provide a radioactive label that could be monitored during the peptide purification. A model system containing the phenylhydrazine adduct of 4-ethyl-1,2-benzoquinone was found to be unreactive toward propylamine (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although this result made it unlikely that a lysyl residue-cross-linked cofactor would be generated by fortuitous side reactions during the course of phenylhydrazine inhibition and active-site peptide isolation, the final proof of the cofactor structure has awaited a structural analysis of the underivatized cofactor in native lysyl oxidase. In this study, we show that the resonance Raman spectra of underivatized lysyl oxidase are in excellent agreement with those of the synthetic LTQ model compound used in the initial elucidation of the cofactor structure. This finding provides strong evidence for an amino substituent at C-2 of the quinone ring in native lysyl oxidase. Furthermore, the resonance Raman study on different LTQ compounds supports the view that LTQ is a neutralortho-quinone structure under physiologic conditions. 2S. X. Wang, M. Mure, and J. P. Klinman, manuscript in preparation. Lysyl oxidase was purified from calf aorta by a modification of previously described methods (5Kagan H.M. Sullivan K.A. Olsson T.A. Cronlund A.L. Biochem. J. 1979; 177: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 6Williams M.A. Kagan H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 430-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The precipitated enzyme was obtained after dialyzing the purified enzyme (eluted from gel filtration column in 6 m urea buffer) against 16 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. Yeast amine oxidase was expressed and purified as described (7Cai D. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7647-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and pea seedling amine oxidase was provided by D. M. Dooley and D. E. Brown. The LTQ model compounds used in this study were prepared as described by Wanget al. 2 For mass spectrometric analyses, 2-hydroxy-5-ethyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 4-butylamino-5-ethyl-1,2-benzoquinone were employed as the model compounds for TPQ and LTQ, respectively. 3 mg of each described compound was first dissolved in 20 μl of acetonitrile and then diluted with 100 μl of H218O (97.1 atom %, Isotec Inc.). The quinone solution was incubated overnight (approximately 15 h) at 25 °C before it was lyophilized and submitted for mass spectrometric analysis. High-resolution mass spectra were obtained by electron impact ionization (70 eV) on a JEOL JMX-DX 300 instrument. Raman spectra were obtained on a McPherson 2061 spectrograph (0.67 m, 1800-groove grating) using Kaiser Optical holographic super-notch filters and a Princeton Instruments liquid N2-cooled (LN-1100PB) CCD detector with 514.5 nm and 488.0 nm excitations from a Coherent Innova 90-6 Ar+ laser. The samples were placed in glass capillaries and measured at room temperature in a 90° scattering geometry for model compounds and a back scattering geometry for precipitated enzyme. Peak frequencies were calibrated relative to an indene standard and are accurate to ±1 cm−1. Spectra of isotopically substituted samples were obtained under identical instrumental conditions such that frequency shifts are accurate to ±0.5 cm−1 (8Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 226: 431-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For 18O-isotope exchange, the precipitated lysyl oxidase was centrifuged and supernatant was removed. The enzyme was then suspended in 4 volumes of 16 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) that was prepared by the addition of concentrated potassium phosphate to H218O (97 atom %, Icon). This cycle was repeated two more times to yield 16 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8) and 89 atom % 18O. The UV-Vis spectrum of the LTQ cofactor in native lysyl oxidase shows a characteristic absorption maximum at approximately 510 nm, which is 20 to 30 nm red-shifted relative to other TPQ-containing CAOs (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The synthetic LTQ model compound (NHR-LTQ, StructureFs3) displays a λmax of 504 nm which is an excellent match to that of the native enzyme (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Using excitation within this absorption band, resonance Raman spectra can be obtained whose peak frequencies represent the vibrational modes of the LTQ chromophore itself. As shown in Fig. 1, the RR spectrum of the LTQ cofactor in the resting state of lysyl oxidase is significantly different from the RR spectrum of the TPQ cofactor in other amine oxidases. The lysyl oxidase spectrum is dominated by peaks at 1386 cm−1 and 1529 cm−1, whereas the TPQ-containing amine oxidases have their most intense feature 10–15 cm−1 higher than 1386 cm−1 and no feature corresponding to the peak at 1529 cm−1. The difference in state between lysyl oxidase (precipitate) and the amine oxidases (solution) does not appear to be a factor, as no changes in RR vibrational frequencies are observed for amine oxidase in crystals or in ammonium sulfate precipitates.Figure 1Resonance Raman spectra of lysyl oxidase and amine oxidases.

In the crystal structure of pea seedling amine oxidase, the TPQ ring has a flipped conformation in the resting enzyme with the C-5 carbonyl hydrogen-bonded by the side chains of Tyr286 and Asn386 (9Kumar V. Dooley D.M. Freeman H.C. Guss J.M. Harvey I. McGuirl M.A. Wilce M.C. Zubak V.M. Structure. 1996; 4: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In contrast, the TPQ cofactor in yeast amine oxidase is in the active conformation with the C-5 carbonyl pointing toward the substrate binding pocket. 3R. Li, J. P. Klinman, and F. S. Mathews, manuscript in preparation. Since the different TPQ environments in amine oxidases are not affecting the electronic structure of the cofactor (as shown in Fig. 1), the distinctly altered frequencies and intensities in the RR spectrum of lysyl oxidase are indicative of a change in the chemical structure of the LTQ cofactor rather than a change of environment. In contrast to the data for the TPQ enzymes (Fig. 1), the RR spectrum of the lysyl oxidase enzyme shows striking similarities to the NHR-LTQ (Structure Fs3) model compound (Fig. 2). Although the spectra of Structure Fs3 were obtained with 488 nm excitation, identical RR spectra were also observed with 514 nm excitation (data not shown). The spectra of the LTQ model indicate intense peaks at 1676, 1536, and 1392 cm−1 and weaker peaks at 1635, 1590, 1340, 1286, and 1255 cm−1 (Fig. 2 A). In H218O, the peak at 1676 cm−1undergoes a −23 cm−1 shift whereas the peak at 1635 cm−1 loses its intensity (Fig. 2 B). The frequency of 1676 cm−1 is within the 1640 to 1695 cm−1 range observed for the C=O stretch in a large number of substituted benzoquinones (11$$Google Scholar) and is attributed to the quinone carbonyl group. Based on a simple two-body system, the observed shift of −23 cm−1 for this peak in H218O suggests the existence of a singly exchanged carbonyl group in the LTQ model compound (11$$Google Scholar). This assignment is supported by the mass spectrum of NHR-LTQ which shows only a 2 mass unit increase in H218O, indicating that only one of the two carbonyl groups has reacted. Studies have shown that the C-5 carbonyl (C=O) of this model compound is susceptible to nucleophilic attack to form stable phenylhydrazine adducts (3Wang S.X. Mure M. Medzihradszky K.F. Burlingame A.L. Brown D.E. Dooley D.M. Smith A.J. Kagan H.M. Klinman J.P. Science. 1996; 273: 1078-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar)2 and thus is potentially capable of exchange with solvent oxygen. The intense peak at 1676 cm−1 is therefore assigned to the C=O stretch of the C-5 carbonyl. There are no other changes of the spectrum in H218O except that the C=O bend at 502 cm−1 shifts by −3 cm−1 (data not shown). The spectra of the native lysyl oxidase in solution are difficult to acquire due to sample fluorescence caused by the high concentration of urea required to solubilize the enzyme. Removal of urea produces a hydrated enzyme precipitate from which we have succeeded in obtaining the RR spectra of native lysyl oxidase in both H216O and H218O (Fig.2, C and D). Overall, the spectral frequencies, intensities, and the 18O shifts are remarkably similar to those of the LTQ model (summarized in TableI). This indicates that the cofactor in lysyl oxidase enzyme has a similar quinone structure to model compound (Structure Fs3) and that the n-butylamino group at the C-2 position and ethyl group at the C-1 position accurately model the respective vibrational contributions of the ε-NH2 side chain of lysine and the β-CH2 group of tyrosine residue in the cross-linked cofactor. Analogous to Structure Fs3, the 1683 cm−1 peak undergoes a −27 cm−1 shift in H218O whereas the peak at 1635 cm−1 loses its intensity. The 1683 cm−1 peak is similarly assigned to the C=O stretch of the C-5 carbonyl group in the cofactor (Structure Fs1). As will be discussed later, the RR spectra of other TPQ-containing CAOs also show an exchangeable carbonyl group at similar frequency (12Moënne-Loccoz P. Nakamura N. Steinebach V. Duine J.A. Mure M.

Open table in a new tab Boldface indicates the most intense peaks. ↓ means decrease in intensity. During the identification and the characterization of the LTQ cofactor, we synthesized several other organic model compounds,2including 4-(di-n-butylamino)-5-ethyl-1,2-benzoquinone (NR2-LTQ, Structure Fs4). The λmax of this compound is 20 to 30 nm red-shifted compared with that of the monosubstituted LTQ model compound (Structure Fs3) or to that of lysyl oxidase itself.2 Based on the pK a analysis of these quinone model compounds and their UV-Vis properties, we have proposed that, at physiological pH, the LTQ cofactor exists as the neutral NH-containing ortho-quinone structure (as shown in Structures 1 and 3) rather than the protonated quaternary amine or deprotonated imine.2 In support of the pK a assignment,2 we have found that the RR spectrum of NHR-LTQ is altered only at pH values <2 (data not shown). The resonance Raman spectra of the mono- and disubstituted LTQ model compounds are compared in Fig. 3. Overall, the Raman spectrum of NR2-LTQ, Structure Fs4, has a pattern similar to that of NHR-LTQ, Structure Fs3, with intense peaks at 1676 and 1390 cm−1 (Fig. 3 A). The 1676 cm−1 peak of Structure Fs4 can be assigned to the C=O stretch of the C-5 carbonyl group by analogy to Structure Fs3. This C=O stretch is an isolated vibrational mode whose frequency is unaffected by substitution at the C-2 position. While the peaks below 1400 cm−1 show close resemblance in Structures 3 and 4, the peaks between 1400 and 1650 cm−1 are very different (Fig.3, A and C), which could reflect the nature of the substituent at the C-2 position. The 1400 to 1600 cm−1 region also shows the greatest sensitivity to deuterium exchange in NHR-LTQ (Fig. 3 B). Almost every peak in the spectrum shifts, and the shifts are complete within the few minutes that are needed for dissolution in D2O and data collection. Most noticeably, the peak at 1536 cm−1 disappears and is replaced by a new peak at 1453 cm−1. It is likely that the 1536 cm−1 peak in H2O has actually been replaced by a Fermi resonance doublet at −83 and +13 cm−1 in D2O; similarly the 1340 cm−1 peak in H2O appears to produce a Fermi doublet at +13 and −4 cm−1 in D2O. In contrast, the addition of D2O to NR2-LTQ has essentially no effect on its RR spectrum (Fig. 3 D). Based on these facts, we conclude that the D shifts observed in Fig.3 B are due to the D-exchange of the hydrogen on the C-2 NH and not the C-3 hydrogen. This is supported by the 1H NMR spectroscopy of NHR-LTQ which shows no incorporation of D at the C-3 position even after 3–7 days of incubation in D2O.2 Incubation of the lysyl oxidase enzyme for 1 h in D2O causes a similar loss of intensity at 1529 cm−1 (data not shown), indicative of NH exchange in the C-2 substituent. Thus, the D-isotope effects observed in the RR spectrum provide direct evidence for the proposed cofactor structure and the existence of the N-H hydrogen in that structure. Although lysyl oxidase is considered a member of the CAO family and catalyzes similar redox reactions, it differs greatly from other TPQ-containing amine oxidases. Besides the lack of the TPQ consensus sequence and its reduced size, the most fundamental difference lies in its unique cofactor structure. From the studies herein, we conclude that the LTQ cofactor (Structure Fs1) has a neutral ortho-benzoquinone structure, whereas the active TPQ cofactor (Structure Fs2) exists as anortho-/para-quinone resonance hybrid with significant charge localized on the C-4 oxygen. However, the exchangeable C=O stretch assigned to the C-5 carbonyl of LTQ cofactor at 1683 cm−1 has essentially the same energy as the analogous carbonyl vibrations at 1677–1683 cm−1 in the TPQ cofactors (Fig. 1). The fact that the reactive carbonyl group has the same bond strength in the ortho- andpara-quinone forms of the cofactor is consistent with the similar chemical reactivities of this position in LTQ and TPQ toward nucleophiles. On the other hand, the C=O stretch of the C-2 carbonyl in TPQ has been identified at 1575 cm−1 in phenylethylamine oxidase from its −21 cm−1 shift with 18O at the C-2 position (13Nakamura N. Matsuzaki R. Choi Y.-H. Tanizawa K. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4718-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An analogous peak is present at 1579–1588 cm−1 in other TPQ-containing CAOs, including yeast amine oxidase and pea seedling amine oxidase (Fig. 1), as well as E. coli amine oxidase (12Moënne-Loccoz P. Nakamura N. Steinebach V. Duine J.A. Mure M. Klinman J.P. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7020-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), histamine oxidase (13Nakamura N. Matsuzaki R. Choi Y.-H. Tanizawa K. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4718-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and bovine serum amine oxidase (4Nakamura N. Moënne-Loccoz P. Tanizawa K. Mure M. Suzuki S. Klinman J.P. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11479-11486Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but is missing from the RR spectrum of lysyl oxidase (Fig. 1). A possible assignment for the C=O stretch of the C-4 carbonyl in lysyl oxidase is the peak at 1599 cm−1. Further evidence for the chemical difference of the two carbonyl groups in each cofactor comes from the observation of only one exchangeable oxygen in the mass spectrum of both NHR-LTQ and TPQ (12Moënne-Loccoz P. Nakamura N. Steinebach V. Duine J.A. Mure M. Klinman J.P. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7020-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) model compounds. A unique feature in the RR spectrum of lysyl oxidase is the intense peak at 1529 cm−1, which corresponds to the peak at 1536 cm−1 in the model compound (Fig. 2). Its strong deuterium dependence in both lysyl oxidase and the LTQ model suggests that it is due to the lysyl side chain (the NH group) at the C-2 position. The high frequency of this band implies double bond character. Thus, it could involve C=C stretching combined with C-N stretching or C-N-H bending at C-2. The other intense peak at 1386 cm−1 in lysyl oxidase is at lower energy than the intense peak at 1396–1401 cm−1 in other amine oxidases (Fig. 1). In phenylethylamine oxidase, the 1396 cm−1 peak has some contribution from C2=O stretching (13Nakamura N. Matsuzaki R. Choi Y.-H. Tanizawa K. Sanders-Loehr J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4718-4724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sharp drop in the intensity of the ∼1390 cm−1 peak in both lysyl oxidase (data not shown) and the LTQ model (Fig. 3 B) in D2O indicates that the amino group at C-2 is a contributor to the 1386 cm−1 mode in lysyl oxidase. A significant difference between LTQ and TPQ is that the C-3 hydrogen of TPQ readily exchanges with D2O in both E. coliamine oxidase enzyme and a TPQ model compound (12Moënne-Loccoz P. Nakamura N. Steinebach V. Duine J.A. Mure M. Klinman J.P. Sanders-Loehr J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7020-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas no such exchange has been observed for NHR-LTQ. The C-3 hydrogen exchange in TPQ is promoted by the anionic character of the cofactor and provides evidence for a resonance delocalization between the C-2 and C-4 oxygens as shown in Structure Fs2. The lack of exchange in LTQ is indicative of a more localized orthoquinone structure. In summary, the resonance Raman spectrum of the underivatized lysyl oxidase closely matches that of a synthetic analog of the cofactor (NHR-LTQ) and shows the same 18O shift as the latter. The C=O stretch at 1683 cm−1 (1676 cm−1 in the model) is identified as that of the C-5 carbonyl in the cofactor; this is the position shown to undergo derivatization with exogenous nucleophiles.2 The intense peak at 1536 cm−1and its shift in D2O provide direct evidence for the existence of the N-H hydrogen in the lysyl side chain, indicating that under physiologic pH conditions LTQ exists as a neutralortho-quinone structure. This contrasts with TPQ that exists as a resonance- stabilized hybrid with a net (−1) negative charge. The properties of LTQ may confer unique chemical reactivity to this cofactor2 and explain the evolution of a quinocofactor structure that is distinct from the other copper amine oxidases.

Hall Z.W. An Introduction to Molecular Neurobiology. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 281-312Google Scholar). Myelin is essential for the rapid conduction of action potentials in vertebrates, and human diseases that compromise the integrity of the sheath (e.g.peripheral neuropathies in the PNS and multiple sclerosis in the central nervous system) are generally debilitating (2$$Google Scholar). The elaboration of myelin requires a substantial biosynthetic up-regulation of plasma membrane lipids and proteins, several of which are unique to the myelin sheath (3Lemke G. Trends Neurosci. 1986; 9: 266-270Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the PNS, the most abundant of these is protein zero (P0), a 31-kilodalton, immunoglobulin-related, transmembrane glycoprotein that accounts for greater than 50% of the protein in mammalian PNS myelin (4Greenfield S.

The mRNA encoding this protein is estimated to account for nearly 8% of the poly(A) RNA in actively myelinating Schwann cells (5Stahl N. Harry J. Popko B. Brain Res. Mol.

Expression of P0 mRNA peaks during the period of active peripheral myelination (the first 3 postnatal weeks in rodents) and is maintained at lower steady-state levels into adulthood (5Stahl N. Harry J. Popko B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 13Lemke G. Axel R. Cell. 1985; 40: 501-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). During Schwann cell development, the P0 gene is coordinately induced together with genes encoding other myelin-specific proteins, such as myelin basic protein, PMP-22, and myelin-associated glycoprotein (14Lemke G. Neuron. 1988; 1: 535-543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to these proteins, however, P0 is not expressed by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system. The pronounced up-regulation of P0 biosynthesis observed at the onset of overt myelination appears to be triggered by a signal associated with the surface of axons (15Politis M.J. Sternberger N. Ederle K. Spencer P.S. J. Neurosci. 1982; 2: 1252-1266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lemke G. Chao M. Development. 1988; 102: 499-504PubMed Google Scholar). This signal may be transduced intracellularly through elevation of cyclic AMP: in cultured Schwann cells, cAMP-elevating agents such as forskolin potentiate P0 gene expression and strongly potentiate expression of less abundantly expressed myelin-specific genes (16Lemke G. Chao M. Development. 1988; 102: 499-504PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morgan L. Jessen K.R. Mirsky R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). P0 regulation during Schwann cell development reflects a combination of transcriptional and translational controls, although the former appears to predominate. Cell culture and transgenic mouse studies have demonstrated that major features of this regulation are controlled by a 1.1-kilobase pair region flanking the transcription start site of the P0 gene. When linked to heterologous reporter genes, this 1.1-kilobase pair DNA fragment drives Schwann cell-specific, forskolin-inducible transcription upon transient transfection into cultured Schwann cells (18Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and has been shown to target a number of transgenes exclusively to myelinating Schwann cells, on an appropriate developmental schedule, in transgenic mice (19Messing A.

Lemke G. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 3533-3539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-DNA region therefore contains many if not most of the elements required for tissue-specific and developmentally accurate P0 expression. To determine the cis-acting regulatory elements and transcription factors that control this expression, we examined protein/DNA interactions and promoter function of the P0 5′-regulatory region in rat Schwann cells. An array of protected regions was detected on the proximal promoter, and among these a region of cell type-specific differences between P0-expressing and nonexpressing cell lines was noted. Mutational analysis of sequences within DNase I-protected regions revealed multiple functional elements, each of which is responsible for a different level of transcription. The core promoter is defined as the two proximal elements located within the protections at positions −48 to −59 and −66 to −79, which bind nuclear factors Sp1 and NF-Y, respectively. The P0 gene, 5′-regulatory sequences, and the P0CAT plasmids pPCATXA6 and pPCATHA16 have been previously described (18Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The 5′ truncation plasmids from −915 to +45 were generated from the pPCATXA6 plasmid by Bal31 digestion, and the 5′ termini were confirmed by sequencing. The P0-luciferase plasmid, −915P0LUC, was generated by cloning the −915 to +45 P0 promoter fragment (obtained by digesting pPCATHA16 (Ref. 18Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) with XbaI andHindIII) into the NheI and HindIII sites of the promoterless luciferase reporter vector, pGL2-B (Promega). Rat Schwann cell cultures were prepared and maintained in media with forskolin and glial growth factor as described previously (21Porter S. Clark M.B. Glaser L. Bunge R.P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3070-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Schwann cells were prepared from 3–4-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat sciatic nerves. Cells were treated by anti-thy 1 and complement lysis to remove contaminating fibroblasts. Schwann cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin; 2 μmforskolin; and either 13 μg/ml semipurified bovine pituitary extract containing glial growth factor or 10 ng/ml recombinant neuregulin (kind gift of Dr. Kuo-Fen Lee). Bovine pituitary extracts were prepared by methods previously described (22Brockes J.P. Lemke G.E. Balzer Jr., D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8374-8377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rat cell line B103 (23Schubert D. Heinemann S. Carlisle W. Tarikas H. Kimes B. Patrick J. Steinbach J.H. Culp W. Brandt B.L. Nature. 1974; 249: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) is a P0-positive transformed line with Schwann cell properties (24Perantoni A.O. Rice J.M. Reed C.D. Watatani M. Wenk M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6317-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). B103, HeLa, and the fibroblast cell line Rat2 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. DNase I footprinting assays were performed using −915P0LUC plasmid to generate radiolabeled probes of the proximal P0 promoter (−550 to +45) using published protocols (25$$Google Scholar). The P0 promoter was first digested withHindIII and used to produce footprints most proximal to the transcription start site (proximal probes). The proximal, noncoding strand probe was made by end labeling with kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and the proximal, coding strand probe was made by fill in, using Klenow and [α-32P]dATP. The DNA was then digested with BglII, and the 600-bp fragment was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The distal P0 probes were generated by digestion with BglII to generate the 5′-end of the probe and radiolabeling as above and then digestion with HindIII and purification by gel electrophoresis. Nuclear extracts from cultured cell lines were produced by standard methods (26Goldhamer D.J. Brunk B.P. Faerman A. King A. Shani M. Emerson Jr., C.P. Development. 1995; 121: 637-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat Schwann cell cultures were induced to high levels of P0 expression with 20 μm forskolin for 2 days before extracts were made. The footprinting assay was performed by incubating radiolabeled probe with nuclear extracts for 10 min and digesting for 1 min on ice with DNase I. Appropriate dilutions of DNase I were predetermined for both probe alone and probe with various nuclear extracts. The reaction products were separated on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gels using wedge spacers. The results were visualized by autoradiography. In vivo DMS footprinting assays were performed in Schwann cell cultures treated for 2 days with 20 μm forskolin utilizing the ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction method as described previously (27Brown A.M. Wright K.L. Ting J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26328-26333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7601-7605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, the procedure was as follows. Schwann cell cultures were treated with dimethyl sulfate (DMS), in parallel with untreated cultures, and the methylated genomic DNA was isolated and purified of protein. The untreated DNA was DMS-treatedin vitro, and both samples were piperidine-cleaved. These DNA fragments were amplified by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction and radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using sets of three nested P0-specific primers. DMS-treated samples were electrophoresed on 6% sequencing gels. The primers for the coding strand were as follows: primer 1, 5′-CTGGGGTAGGGGCAAGGG; primer 2, 5′-GTGGAGAGAGCGGGGGACAAG; primer 3, 5′-GGGGTGGAGAGAGCGGGGGACAAGGAAC. The primers for the noncoding strand were as follows: primer 1, 5′-ACAATGCCCCTTCTGCTC; primer 2, 5′-CTGCCACCCTCCCCACCAC; primer 3, 5′-CCACCCTCCCCACCACCTCTC. Specific substitution and deletion mutations were generated in the −915P0LUC plasmid using two mutagenic oligonucleotides of the coding strand sequence, T4 DNA polymerase and the Transformer mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). The specific sequence changes are described in Fig. 4 A. Although the mutations in these plasmids were generated by a single round of synthesis and not by polymerase chain reaction, we observed that in more than one case two different mutagenized colonies targeted by the same mutagenic oligo yielded significantly different luciferase activities. Consequently, 500-bp fragments containing only the desired mutation were excised from all of the mutated plasmids and cloned into the corresponding site in −915P0LUC to eliminate the possibility of secondary mutations. Transfection with CAT plasmids was performed using a standard calcium phosphate procedure (18Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 29Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). Schwann cells were grown in medium with serum (2 μm forskolin and 13 μg/ml glial growth factor) and transfected in media alone, and after transfection, cells were incubated in medium with 2 μm forskolin and without glial growth factor. Ten-μg P0CAT 5′ deletion plasmids were co-transfected with 2 μg of RSV-luciferase plasmid as a measure of transfection efficiency. Cell extracts were made, and samples with equivalent luciferase activity were assayed for CAT activity using [14C]chloramphenicol and thin layer chromatography as described previously (18Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 30Gorman C.M. Moffatt L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Results are shown relative to the activity of the full-length plasmid, pPCATXA6. Transfection of cell lines with luciferase reporter plasmids was performed by the polyethylenimine (Fluka) complex formation method as described previously (31Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5526) Google Scholar). In brief, DNA and polyethylenimine complexes were formed in 0.15 m NaCl for 30 min and applied to cell cultures grown to approximately 50% confluency. Complexes and cells were incubated for 3–4 h, the medium was removed, and fresh medium was applied. P0-luciferase plasmids were co-transfected with RSV/β-galactosidase plasmid used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Before transfection, Schwann cells were grown in medium containing 2 μm forskolin and 10 ng/ml recombinant neuregulin, and after transfection cells were incubated in medium with 10 μm forskolin and without recombinant neuregulin. Schwann cell lysates were made approximately 25 h later, and B103 cell lysates were prepared 42–44 h later. Luciferase assays and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (18Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), or alternatively the Dual Light assay for both tests was used (Tropix, Inc.). Light units were normalized to β-galactosidase units, and the results with the mutant plasmids were expressed relative to −915P0LUC, which was set to 100. Shown are the results of five experiments, each performed in duplicate. Nuclear extracts used for band shift were prepared as for DNase I footprinting experiments or by the rapid method as described previously (32Brown A.M. Linhoff M.W. Stein B. Wright K.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Basta P.V. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2926-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EMSAs were performed by mixing 4 μg of nuclear extracts with 1 ng of radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe in the following buffer (2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 20 μm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 μm KCl, 10 μm MgCl2, 10 μmZnSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% Ficoll, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors were used at an 80-fold molar excess relative to the labeled probe. Antibody supershift reactions were held on ice for 1 h to allow antibody and protein to interact before incubation with probe. Reactions were incubated on ice for 30 min and electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer, and the gels were dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. The sequences of the P0 EMSA probes are as follows: probe 3, 5′-GTCACTGGCTCAGGACAGCCCCCTCATGCT; probe 4, 5′-CAGGCTGCAATTGGTCACTGGCTCAG; probe 5, 5′-CACCTCTCAATTGCACATGCC; probe 6, 5′-GCTCCATGCCCCTGCCACCC; probe 7, 5′-GGTATGTGTCCCCCCACCCCCC; probe 8, 5′-CTCTGTGTAAGGGGTGG, probe 11, 5′-TTGGGAGTGCTCTGAAAG; probe 13, 5′-GCAGGGAGATGGAAAAAGTTG; probe 4 + 5, 5′-CCTCTCAATTGCACATGCCAGGCTGCAATTGGTCACTGGC. Sequences of the control probes were as follows: the Sp1 site, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC; the Krox-20 site, 5′-CTCTGTACGCGGGGGCGGTTA; the NF-Y site from the major histocompatibility complex class II invariant chain Y box, 5′-AATTCTGGGCAGCCAATGGGATCGTG; the C/EBP from the interleukin-6 promoter, 5′-AGCTTGACATTGCACAATCTCA; and the Ig octamer site, 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA. The antibody supershift experiments were performed with α-NF-YA from Dr. Jenny Ting, α-Krox-20 from Dr. Patrick Charnay, and α-Sp1 and α-AP-2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. We first examined sequence conservation between the aligned 5′-flanking regions of the human, rat, and mouse P0 genes. These regions, including exon 1 and extending into intron 1, were pairwise aligned mouse to human and rat to human. Sequence homologies were determined by calculating the percentage of nucleotide identity within a 40-bp window whose 3′-end was located at the position relative to the transcription start site that is shown on the x axis of Fig.1 A. Comparisons were made by repositioning the 40-bp window both upstream and downstream from the transcription start site in increments of five nucleotides and then recalculating the percentage of nucleotide identity. The results of these comparisons reveal a strikingly high level of sequence identity between both the rat and human and the mouse and human genes, from position −350 to the transcription start site, and in the region of the first exon (Fig. 1 A). The rat to human and mouse to human comparisons coincide remarkably along the entire region analyzed, including at the sharp decrease in sequence identity from position −350 to −400. In addition, two other peaks of sequence conservation are observed, one at positions −480 to −500 and a second less pronounced peak around −700. The regions from −800 to −900 and from +200 to +400 (first intron) are below the levels of significant similarity for a 40-bp window and are not considered to be evolutionarily conserved. Given that nearly the entire proximal 5′-regulatory region is strongly conserved among mammalian P0 genes, it is difficult to identify potential discrete transcription factor binding sites using sequence conservation alone. However, the sequence of the atypical TATAA element, TTTTAA (−28 to −23), is conserved in both comparisons; previous work has suggested that this sequence does indeed function as a TATAA element (18Lemke G. Lamar E. Patterson J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 73-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When the three CAAT boxes at bp −78, −98, and −145 are compared, the sequences at bp −78 and at bp −145 are entirely conserved. It should be noted that the high sequence conservation observed over the entire proximal P0 promoter, a conservation as high as that for the coding sequences in exon 1, is unusual. To correlate the regions of high sequence identity with transcriptional function, 5′ truncation mutants were made of the P0promoter from position −915 to −113 and linked to the CAT reporter gene. The 3′-end of the series was fixed at position +45, within the P0 5′-untranslated region. The regulatory activity of the 5′ deletion mutants was analyzed by transient transfection and CAT assay in primary cultures of rat Schwann cells. The results are shown in Fig. 1 B. The x axis of Fig. 1 denotes the 5′-end of the P0 promoter sequence in each deletion plasmid, and the y axis denotes percentage of CAT activity relative to the full-length plasmid (−915/+45), which was set to 100%. Note that the x axis of Fig. 1 B(transcriptional activity) is aligned with the x axis of Fig. 1 A (sequence conservation). Sequential 5′ deletions from −915 to −400 resulted in a progressive, although modest, decrease in promoter activity up to the −400 region. At position −400, about 60% of the promoter activity remained. Within the −400 to −200 region, however, each deletion resulted in a substantial loss of CAT activity, indicating that important regulatory elements were progressively deleted (Fig. 1 B). Deletions from −200 to −100 reduced activity to near background levels. The presence of negative regulatory elements, as indicated by an increase in reporter activity upon deletion, was not observed. The relative promoter activities of the 5′ deletion mutants correlate well with the amount of sequence identity within the P0 promoter (Fig. 1, compareA and B), in that the region between −350 and −300 where sequence conservation rises to >80% is the same region in which 5′ deletions begin to remove strong regulatory elements. A 3′ deletion series starting at position +45, (whose 5′-end was fixed at +915) revealed a modest diminution of activity until the deletions extended through the putative TATAA element at −23 to −28, at which point all transcriptional activity was lost (data not shown). Given the results of the deletion survey, we performed in vitro binding studies on the proximal P0 promoter from −550 to +45 to delineate sites of protein/DNA interaction. In these experiments, nuclear extracts were prepared from two P0-expressing cell lines: 1) primary cultures of rat Schwann cells grown in 20 μm forskolin and 2) B103 cells, a P0-positive transformed rat cell line. Extracts were also prepared from two nonexpressing cell lines, Rat-2 fibroblasts and HeLa cells. Extracts from B103 cells produced a number of distinct protections on the proximal 600-bp coding strand probe (Fig. 2 A shows several of these). Protected regions labeled 7, 9, and10 were consistently strong and distinct; however, some sites, such as sites 8 and 6, were weak in comparison. Similar contacts were observed in nuclear extracts from cultures of rat Schwann cells (Fig. 2 B), and labeling the noncoding strand of the proximal probe revealed protected regions that confirmed the boundaries of the protections observed with the coding strand probe (Fig. 2 B). Footprint analysis using the distal probes detected (in addition to protection labeled 10) three additional protections on the promoter from −393 to −493, which were designated 11, 12, and 13 (summarized in Fig. 3). Hypersensitive bands were noted flanking regions 5, 9, 10, and 11 (Fig. 2,arrows). Thus, 13 sites of protein/DNA contact on the proximal promoter from the start site to −500 were delineated. Neighboring protections, such as sites 7 and 8, and overlapping sites, such as sites 3–5, may be the result of binding by one protein or by multiple proteins.Figure 3Summary of protein/DNA contacts on the 600-bp P0 promoter. The P0 promoter sequence is shown, and the regions protected by both HeLa and Schwann cell nuclear extracts are indicated by light gray boxes above thesequence. Sequences protected only in HeLa cell extracts are indicated by dark gray boxes above the sequence, and Schwann cell-specific protections are indicated by boxesin black below the sequence. The transcription start site is indicated as reported in Ref. 28Wright K.L. Ting J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein/DNA contacts were compared using nuclear extracts from P0-expressing and nonexpressing cell lines. Extracts from the fibroblast cell line Rat2 produced similar protections over several regions (Fig. 2 B). However, the protections created by Rat2 extracts appeared to be considerably weaker than the Schwann cell and B103 protections on site 4 and, even more so, on site 5. HeLa cell extracts were used as an additional nonexpressing cell type in footprint experiments utilizing both the distal and proximal end probes. Distinct differences in the boundaries for protections 3–5 were again observed with these extracts (Fig. 2 C). Site 3 in B103 extracts is only weakly protected, while in HeLa it is quite strong. Also, a boundary is not evident between sites 3 and 4 with HeLa extracts, but it is present with B103 cell extracts. Similarly, a boundary of unprotected sequence appears between sites 4 and 5 with HeLa extracts but not with B103 extracts, and the protection of site 5 itself is again much weaker with HeLa extracts. These results show that while several sites of protein/DNA contact observed on the P0 proximal promoter are the same for extracts prepared from expressing and nonexpressing cells, cell-specific differences in binding intensity and boundaries are detected, particularly at sites 3–5. A summary of protected sites created by expressing and nonexpressing cell types is included in graphic form in Fig. 3. The importance of the DNase I-protected sequences was confirmed in a series of in vivo footprinting experiments using primary cultures of rat Schwann cells. The in vivo assay has the advantage of detecting protein/DNA contacts on the promoter in the nucleus of living cells that are actively expressing the gene. The DMS treatment allows subsequent cleavage by piperidine at guanine, and sometimes adenine, residues. The region from −250 to +45 was analyzed, and the protections observed in vitro within this region overlapped with the protected sequence noted by genomic footprinting. A selected example of the protections observed in vivo on sites 3–5 is shown (Fig. 2). The two G residues in 5′-CAATTGG (site 4) are strongly reduced, and two G residues in the 3′-end of site 5 are also protected on the coding strand (Fig. 2 D). In addition, the run of five G residues of site 3 is strongly protected on the noncoding strand (Fi"

Variant β-lactamases that conferred elevated levels of resistance to the cephalosporin ceftazidime were identified in a set of β-lactamase derivatives previously generated by pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis in which a variable 5-amino acid cassette was introduced randomly in the target protein. This mutagenesis procedure was also modified to allow the direct selection of variant β-lactamases with pentapeptide insertions that conferred extended substrate specificities. All insertions associated with enhanced resistance to ceftazidime were targetted to the 19-amino acid Ω-loop region, which forms part of the catalytic pocket of the β-lactamase enzyme. However, pentapeptide insertions in the C- and N-terminal halves of this region had different effects on the ability of the enzyme to hydrolyze ampicillin in vivo. Larger insertions that increased the length of the Ω-loop by up to 2-fold also retained catalytic activity toward ampicillin and/or ceftazidime in vivo. In accord with previous substitution mutation studies, these results emphasize the extreme flexibility of the Ω-loop with regards the primary structure requirements for ceftazidime hydrolysis by β-lactamase.

The potential of pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis in mimicking evolution events that result from the insertion and excision of transposons in nature is discussed. Even prior to the clinical introduction of the first β-lactam antibiotic, penicillin, infectious bacteria resistant to the activity of this antibiotic were identified (1Frère J.-M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This resistance subsequently proved to be due to the expression in these bacteria of one of four classes (A, B, C, and D) of β-lactamase enzyme that efficiently hydrolyzes the antibiotic substrate (2Ambler R.P. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the introduction of later generation β-lactam antibiotics was followed inexorably by the appearance of resistant strains expressing mutated β-lactamase enzymes with correspondingly altered substrate specificities (1Frère J.-M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To date over 50 naturally occurring class A TEM β-lactamase variants have been isolated. 1G. Jacoby and K. Bush, World Wide Web site,http://www.lahey.hitchcock.org/pages/lhc/studies/webt.htm. Among the variant β-lactamases that have emerged are derivatives that cleave third generation cephalosporin antibiotics, e.g.ceftazidime, which the wild-type protein recognizes poorly (3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Natural mutations that give rise to these variants are confined to amino acids at positions 104, 164, and 237–240, which are close to or which form part of the catalytic pocket of TEM-1 β-lactamase (5Jacoby G.A.

Pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis is a method by which a variable five amino acid cassette is introduced at random into a target protein (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F.

In this study, pentapeptide insertions were constructed in the active pocket Ω-loop of the TEM β-lactamase, which extended the activity spectrum of the enzyme to include the third generation cephalosporin, ceftazidime. The extreme tolerance of the Ω-loop to alteration was emphasized further by the construction of β-lactamase derivatives in which the length of this region was increased up to 2-fold but which retained catalytic activity toward ceftazidime and/or ampicillin in vivo. Escherichia colicultures were grown in L medium at 37 °C unless otherwise stated. The following antibiotics were added to L medium when required (Sigma): 10–5500 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.075–1.5 μg/ml ceftazidime, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 5 μg/ml tetracycline.

Plasmid DNA was prepared and manipulated essentially as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The maximum antibiotic concentrations allowing growth were determined by making 104 dilutions of overnight cultures grown in L broth containing tetracycline at 30 °C and spotting 2-μl volumes of these dilutions on L plates containing the appropriate concentration of ampicillin or ceftazidime. Results were read after incubation at 30 °C for 48 h. Nucleotide sequencing of insertion sites in pBR322::15-bp 2The abbreviation used is: bp, base pair(s).constructs was performed with a set of custom-madebla-specific primers using dye terminator chemistry after which samples were run on an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, Cheshire, UK). Pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis is a technique whereby 5-amino acid insertions are introduced at random in a target protein (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, a donor strain containing the target plasmid and pHT385, a conjugative Tn4430Ω5 delivery vector, is mated with a plasmid-free recipient strain. By plating the mating mix simultaneously on antibiotics selecting for the recipient, the target plasmid, and Tn4430Ω5, transconjugants containing pHT385::target plasmid cointegrates are isolated. This cointegrate resolves rapidly in vivo, regenerating pHT385 and the target plasmid into which a copy of Tn4430Ω5 has been inserted. Tn4430Ω5 contains KpnI sites located 5 bp from both ends of the transposon and duplicates 5 bp of target site sequence during transposition. By digesting the target plasmid::Tn4430Ω5 hybrid with KpnI and religating the digested DNA, the bulk of the transposon is deleted to generate a target plasmid derivative containing a 15-bp insertion. If the insertion is in a protein-encoding sequence, this will result in a 5-amino acid insertion in the target protein. For conjugation experiments, single colonies of donor and recipient grown on selective media were resuspended separately in 100 μl of L broth, and 2.5-μl volumes of these cell suspensions were mixed on an L plate. Following incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, the conjugation mix was resuspended in 300 μl of L broth, and 50-μl volumes were spread on L plates containing streptomycin, tetracycline, and kanamycin to select for transconjugants that appeared following overnight incubation at 37 °C. The levels of variant β-lactamase proteins present in exponentially growing cultures were assessed by immunoblot analysis. Lysates of cells grown at 30 °C with tetracycline selection were prepared as described by Palzkill et al. (10Palzkill T. Le Q.-Q. Venkatachalam K.V. LaRocco M. Ocera H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins in the cell lysate were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel at 16 V/cm for 75 min at room temperature. Proteins in the gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting, and β-lactamase protein was visualized by immunoblotting with β-lactamase antiserum, a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, and AttoPhos (JBL Scientific, San Luis Obispo, CA). Immunoblots were scanned with a Fluorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Chesham, Buckinghamshire, UK) and band intensity was quantified using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Pentapeptide insertions in the β-lactamase protein are named by the amino acid residue to the N-terminal side of the insertion followed by the sequence of the insertion itself. Amino acid numbering corresponds to that recommended elsewhere (22Ambler R.P. Coulson F.W. Frère J.-M. Ghuysen J.-M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Substitution mutations of certain residues extend the resistance spectrum of the TEM-1 β-lactamase enzyme to include third generation cephalosporins, which wild-type β-lactamase hydrolyzes poorly (10Palzkill T. Le Q.-Q. Venkatachalam K.V. LaRocco M. Ocera H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Petrosino J.F. Palzkill T. J.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3179-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using the pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis technique, a set of pentapeptide insertions was constructed previously in the β-lactamase protein encoded by the bla gene of pBR322 (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). By determining the maximum concentrations that allowed growth at 30 °C on the cephalosporin antibiotic ceftazidime, the effect of these insertions on β-lactamase substrate specificity was assessed. The wild-type β-lactamase protein expressed by pBR322 conferred resistance to 0.075 μg/ml of ceftazidime under the conditions used in this study. The 163GVPLD and 164WGTPR variants had elevated ceftazidime resistance levels of 0.5 and 1.25 μg/ml, respectively (TableI). Resistance levels provided by these mutated β-lactamase proteins were reduced at higher temperatures. Strains expressing β-lactamases with pentapeptide insertions at 21 other locations were as sensitive to ceftazidime at all temperatures tested as was a strain containing the wild-type protein. These 21 variants conferred different levels of ampicillin resistance (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Significantly, the insertions that resulted in increased resistance to ceftazidime abolished detectable ampicillin resistance (Ref. 14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar and Table I) and are located one amino acid apart in the active site Ω-loop (Fig. 1). This result demonstrates that, in addition to substitution mutations, insertion mutations in the Ω-loop can profoundly alter the resistance spectrum of the β-lactamase protein.Table IResistance levels in vivo of TEM-1 β-lactamase derivatives containing pentapeptide insertions in the Ω-loopInsertion position and sequenceMaximum concentration allowing growth at 30 °CAmpicillinResistance relative to wild typeCeftazidimeResistance relative to wild typeμg/mlμg/mlNone (wild type)550010.0751163GVPLD<100.57163RGTPD<101.2517164WGTPR1-aVariants containing 11- (WGTRGAIGTPR), 15- (WGTRGARYLP-IGTPR), 17- (WGTRGARYLRKAIGTPR), or 19-amino acid (WGTRGARYLRKAFAIGTPR) insertions at this position had similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles as variants with pentapeptide insertions.<101.2517170GVPLN1-bVariants containing 11- (GVPGERSVPLN), 15- (GVPGELDIYRSVPLN), 17- (GVPGELDIYVRRSVPLN), or 19-amino acid (GVPGELD- IYVRPSRSVPLN) insertions at this position had similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles as variants with pentapeptide insertions.15000.270.57170EGYPN7500.141.013171GYPNE12500.231.2517174GVPLP2500.050.75101-a Variants containing 11- (WGTRGAIGTPR), 15- (WGTRGARYLP-IGTPR), 17- (WGTRGARYLRKAIGTPR), or 19-amino acid (WGTRGARYLRKAFAIGTPR) insertions at this position had similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles as variants with pentapeptide insertions.1-b Variants containing 11- (GVPGERSVPLN), 15- (GVPGELDIYRSVPLN), 17- (GVPGELDIYVRRSVPLN), or 19-amino acid (GVPGELD- IYVRPSRSVPLN) insertions at this position had similar antibiotic susceptibility profiles as variants with pentapeptide insertions. Open table in a new tab The utility of pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis in engineering β-lactamase derivatives with altered substrate profiles was demonstrated further by modifying the mutagenesis procedure to facilitate the direct selection of variant enzymes that conferred elevated levels of resistance to ceftazidime. Because the number of positions at which mutations extend β-lactamase substrate specificity may be relatively few (3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), a pool of plasmids containing a large number of independent 15-bp insertions in bla was generated as follows. Plasmid pBR322 was transformed into a strain containing the Tn4430Ω5 donor plasmid, pHT385. More than 300 colonies from this transformation were pooled into 1 ml of L broth, and dilutions of this cell suspension were used as donor material in mating trials with the streptomycin-resistant recipient, DS941. Transconjugants in which a pHT385::pBR322 cointegrate was transferred to DS941 were isolated by plating the mating mix on streptomycin, kanamycin, and tetracycline. Plates containing >1000 transconjugant colonies were selected, and plasmid DNA was isolated from a pool of these colonies. Because resolution of the pHT385::pBR322 cointegrate is efficient in vivo(14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Cao Y. Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Mahillon J. Lereclus D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1515-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this plasmid preparation consisted primarily of pBR322 derivatives containing Tn4430Ω5 insertions. As has been shown previously, these Tn4430Ω5 insertions are distributed randomly in the target plasmid (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Cao Y. Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The plasmid preparation was digested with KpnI and religated to generate a bank of pBR322 derivatives in which the bulk of Tn4430Ω5 was deleted but leaving 15-bp insertions. Derivatives in which 15-bp insertions in bla resulted in elevated levels of resistance to ceftazidime were isolated from this bank by transforming the ligation mixture into strain DH5α and selecting at 30 °C on tetracycline and also on ceftazidime at a concentration of 0.25 μg/ml. This level of ceftazidime is three times higher than the level of resistance conferred by the wild-type β-lactamase protein (TableI). Using this procedure involving pooled plasmid DNA generated from a large pool of donors, ceftazidime-resistant colonies were isolated in 9 of 30 independent experiments. One ceftazidime-resistant candidate from each of the nine successful trials was characterized further (Table I). All of the pentapeptide insertions in these derivatives were targetted to the active site Ω-loop of the β-lactamase protein. Seven unique insertions distributed throughout the Ω-loop were identified among the nine variant β-lactamase proteins (Fig. 1). Insertions at different positions within the same codon resulted in β-lactamase derivatives with different pentapeptide insertions at both position 163 and position 170. The pair of ceftazidime-resistant mutations (163GVPLD and 164WGTPR) described in the preceding section that were isolated indirectly from the collection of pentapeptide insertions previously constructed in the β-lactamase protein (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) reoccurred in the direct selection trials. The resistance levels conferred by the new variant β-lactamase enzymes were determined on both ampicillin and ceftazidime (Table I). Ceftazidime resistance levels among the pentapeptide-containing variants ranged from 7 to 17 times the level of resistance associated with the wild-type protein. These resistance levels are comparable with those conferred by substitution mutations in the Ω-loop (10Palzkill T. Le Q.-Q. Venkatachalam K.V. LaRocco M. Ocera H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Petrosino J.F. Palzkill T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insertions in the N-terminal segment of the Ω-loop abolished activity toward ampicillin. In contrast, all four insertions in the C-terminal segment of this region retained different but significant levels of ampicillin resistance. These results indicate that insertions at multiple positions in the Ω-loop can extend the activity of the β-lactamase protein to include a cephalosporin substrate. In addition, the results also suggest that, whereas all insertions in the Ω-loop reduce the ability to hydrolyze ampicillin, insertions in the C-terminal segment of the loop have a less deleterious effect than insertions in the N-terminal segment. All 15-bp insertions generated by pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis include a KpnI site (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The effect on the β-lactamase substrate profile of Ω-loop insertions larger than five amino acids was assessed by introducing a 42-bp in-frame double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide into theKpnI site in the bla alleles specifying the 164WGTPR and 170GVPLN mutated proteins that have lost and retain activity toward ampicillin, respectively. This resulted in variant proteins containing a total of 19 amino acids introduced at positions 164 and 170. The cloned oligonucleotides included a series of contiguous unique hexanucleotide recognition sites for restriction endonucleases that generate blunt ends. By digesting plasmid DNA containing the 42-bp insertions with appropriate combinations of these restriction enzymes and religating the digested DNA, sets of shorter derivatives specifying β-lactamase proteins with a total of 11, 15, or 17 amino acids at positions 164 or 170 were produced. None of the ≥11-amino acid insertions at positions 164 and 170 significantly altered the levels of resistance toward ceftazidime and ampicillin in comparison with the parental derivatives containing pentapeptide insertions at these positions. These results indicate that β-lactamase derivatives in which the length of the Ω-loop has been increased by up to 2-fold retain catalytic activity toward ampicillin and/or ceftazidime. The levels of variant β-lactamases present during exponential phase growth were assessed by immunoblotting analysis (Fig.2). Derivatives with pentapeptide insertions in the N-terminal segment of the Ω-loop that no longer hydrolyzed ampicillin were detected reproducibly in lower amounts than the wild-type protein. In contrast, variants with pentapeptide insertions in the C-terminal half of this region that still conferred ampicillin resistance were present at levels indistinguishable from that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2 A). These results agree with previous studies that have demonstrated a correlation between wild-type expression levels and the ability to hydrolyze ampicillin in β-lactamases with Ω-loop substitution mutations (10Palzkill T. Le Q.-Q. Venkatachalam K.V. LaRocco M. Ocera H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,11Petrosino J.F. Palzkill T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of increasing the size of the Ω-loop insertion on β-lactamase levels was also examined (Fig. 2 B). Derivatives containing 11-, 15-, or 19-amino acid insertions at position 170 were present at approximately 20% of the wild-type amounts. A 17-amino acid insertion at this position reduced protein levels to approximately 10% of the wild-type concentration. In contrast, insertions of ≥11 amino acids at position 164 reduced β-lactamase concentrations to undetectable levels, although these proteins still conferred ceftazidime resistance (Table I). Therefore, insertions at position 164 may induce greater instability of the β-lactamase enzyme than insertions at position 170. This appears to parallel the higher level of ceftazidime resistance conferred by the former (Table I). Alternatively, the folding properties of derivatives with insertions of ≥11 amino acids may be altered such that the recognition of the protein by the antibody is affected. The Ω-loop of TEM-1 β-lactamase contains residues required both for enzyme catalysis and for maintaining the correct topology of the active site (6Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.-M. Samama J.-P.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3179-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrated that the Ω-loop is even more amenable to mutations that extend β-lactamase substrate specificity than previously foreseen. First, pentapeptide insertions at a number of different positions in this region increased by as much as 17 times the level of ceftazidime resistance conferred by the protein compared with the wild type. These resistance levels are comparable with those detected in extensive site-directed mutagenesis studies of the Ω-loop (10Palzkill T. Le Q.-Q. Venkatachalam K.V. LaRocco M. Ocera H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Petrosino J.F. Palzkill T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, larger insertions that increased the length of the Ω-loop as much as 2-fold also retained significant catalytic activity in vivo. These results emphasize further the remarkable flexibility of the Ω-loop with respect to the primary sequence requirements for ceftazidime hydrolysis, as has been noted previously in substitution mutation studies (10Palzkill T. Le Q.-Q. Venkatachalam K.V. LaRocco M. Ocera H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Petrosino J.F. Palzkill T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a tripeptide duplication in the catalytic region of a class C β-lactamase natural variant has recently been shown also to extend substrate specificity to include cephalosporins (25Nukaga M.

Mutations of Arg-164 that disrupt these interactions alter the stability and conformation of the Ω-loop such that residues both involved in deacylation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate and in the catalytic helical domain are displaced, thereby allowing access of larger substrates (3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 12Maveyraud L. Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Swarén P. Masson J.-M. Delaire M. Mourey L. Promé J.-C.

The altered resistance spectra associated with the relatively large insertion mutations described in this study may be due to perturbations of the active site topology analogous to those induced by Arg-164 and Glu-166 substitution mutations. How can insertions as large as 19 amino acids have an effect on substrate specificity similar to that of comparatively subtle substitution mutations? If the bulk of the inserted amino acids protrude from the main body of the protein, the tertiary organization of the Ω-loop may be disrupted only as severely as in proteins harboring substitution mutations. Whereas pentapeptide insertions in both the N- and C-terminal segments of the Ω-loop conferred ceftazidime resistance, enzymes containing insertions in the latter region maintained significant levels of hydrolytic activity toward ampicillin, but variants with insertions in the former region did not (Table I). This may reflect the closer proximity of N-terminal insertions to the important Arg-164 and Glu-166 residues. More detailed kinetic and structural studies of selected derivatives with Ω-loop insertions will address these questions further. DNA rearrangements caused by transposable elements are often regarded as playing an important evolutionary role by promoting, for example, gene duplications and gene fusions. The excision of transposons (which in pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis is artificially mimicked in vitro by the KpnI deletion of Tn4430) may be responsible for amino acid insertions observed when related protein sequences are aligned (29$$Google Scholar, 30Shapiro J.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The excision of transposable bacteriophage Mu has also been suggested as a mechanism by which adaptive mutations occur (4Maenhout-Michel G. Shapiro J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5229-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Foster P.L. Cairns J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5240-5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis may provide an experimental system for reproducing a naturally occurring mechanism of protein variation and for generating proteins with novel catalytic properties. In this regard, a key result is that two of the 23 β-lactamase pentapeptide insertions generated in a recent study (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) were shown here to alter enzyme substrate specificity by conferring increased levels of resistance to ceftazidime even though no selection for this phenotype was applied at any stage of the mutagenesis procedure (Table I). The utility of pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis was emphasized further by adapting the procedure to allow the direct selection of β-lactamase derivatives with expanded substrate specificities. These derivatives contained insertions at a number of positions just within a 19-amino acid region. Because the thermosensitivity (14Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1866-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and intracellular levels (Fig. 2) of the various mutated β-lactamases also suggest that pentapeptide insertions may affect protein folding and stability, it is tempting to propose that nonspecific destabilization caused by short peptide insertions might modify enzyme function, e.g. substrate specificity, by locally increasing the conformational flexibility of the protein,e.g. in the catalytic site. Secondary mutations might then occur to stabilize the protein in its novel function. Pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis has also been used to identify regions of the XerD site-specific recombinase implicated in recombination activity in vivo, in contacting the substrate target DNA, and in communicating with the partner recombinase, XerC (15Cao Y. Hallet B. Sherratt D.J. Hayes F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The utility of pentapeptide scanning mutagenesis as a simple means of manipulating enzyme activity is under further investigation.

SecB, the sole chaperone dedicated to export, has affinity for SecA, the peripheral membrane ATPase of the export apparatus. SecB binds precursor polypeptides in the cytoplasm before they assume their native, stably folded structures (3Kumamoto C.A. Gannon P.M. J. Biol.

Driessen A.J.M. Arch. Microbiol. 1996; 165: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to being the only chaperone dedicated to protein localization, SecB also differs from other members of the chaperone family in that it is a tetramer and functions independently of nucleotide triphosphate hydrolysis. However, one fundamental feature common to all chaperones is the remarkable ability to selectively bind nonnative polypeptides. The ability of SecB to recognize proteins as nonnative is governed in part by a kinetic partitioning (see Fig. 1) (6Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The formation of a complex between SecB and a protein that possesses nonnative structure will depend on the rate of folding of the polypeptide relative to its rate of association with SecB. Since SecB has no affinity for native, stably folded polypeptides (12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 14Randall L.L. Topping T.B.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1-10Crossref Google Scholar), only those proteins that fold slowly are favored to bind SecB and enter the export pathway. All physiologic ligands of SecB are synthesized as precursor species that contain amino-terminal stretches of aminoacyl residues designated leader or signal sequences. Investigations carried out both in vivo and in vitro indicate that the physiologic function of the leader in binding to SecB is to slow folding of the precursor by interfering with the folding reaction that lies on the pathway to the native state (18Park S. Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. Science. 1988; 239: 1033-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Retardation of folding exerted by the leader sequence thus provides the cell with an exquisite mechanism whereby SecB can engage the polypeptide before it folds into its native form. Studies of the interaction between purified proteins have shown that SecB can also bind the mature protein, which does not carry a leader, if folding is slowed by other means. For example, at 25 °C rapid folding of wild-type mature maltose-binding protein precludes formation of a detectable complex with SecB; however, if the folding reaction is slowed by decreasing the temperature from 25 to 5 °C, SecB binds the mature protein (12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, three species of maltose-binding protein have been shown to contain single aminoacyl substitutions in the mature portion of the protein (MalE Y283D, MalE A276G, and MalE W10A) that slow folding sufficiently so that SecB can bind even when the temperature of the folding reaction is 20–25 °C (12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is clear from these examples that kinetic partitioning can be poised to favor association with SecB by changing the rate constant for folding of the polypeptide (k f) (refer to Fig.1). However, it is also possible that binding to SecB could be given a kinetic advantage over the pathway for folding by modulating the properties of SecB and thereby affecting the rate constants for association (k on) and/or dissociation (k off). Binding studies with short peptide ligands indicate that the SecB tetramer contains multiple subsites for binding of flexible unstructured polypeptides carrying a net positive charge (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Saturation of these subsites induces a conformational change in SecB, exposing a hydrophobic patch that is thought to serve as an additional binding site for polypeptide ligands (Ref. 22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; see Fig. 6 and 7). Here we test the idea that binding to SecB could be given a kinetic advantage over the pathway for folding by exposing the putative hydrophobic binding site on SecB.

The purification of the matured form of wild-type maltose-binding protein has been described previously (23Liu G. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14790-14793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SecB was purified as described by Topping and Randall (24Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 730-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 47,600 m−1 cm−1 for SecB tetramer and 78,972 m−1 cm−1(25Miller III, D.M. Olson J.S. Pflugrath J.W. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13665-13672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for the mature form of wild-type maltose-binding protein. Proteinase K was prepared from a stock frozen in small portions at 2.5 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, that was thawed and diluted immediately before use. SecB was digested at 2.8 mg/ml with 0.04 mg/ml proteinase K as follows: 27 μl of proteinase K at 0.05 mg/ml in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6–7.7, was added to 11 μl of SecB at 9.6 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm KC2H3O2, pH 7.8, and incubated on ice for 20 min. The digestion was stopped by adding 38 μl of 1 mm PMSF. The PMSF, stored as a stock at 0.1m in ethanol, was diluted into 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, on ice just before use. After adding the protease inhibitor, the concentration of the KC2H3O2 was 21 mm. Since it has been observed that SecB loses structure during prolonged exposure to low ionic strength (26Fasman G.D. Park K. Randall L.L. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), we also prepared proteinase K-cleaved SecB that was restored to high ionic strength by including KC2H3O2 in the 1 mm PMSF stock used to terminate digestion. We demonstrate here that the activity of proteolyzed SecB stored in low salt (21 mm KC2H3O2) is comparable to that of proteolyzed SecB stored in high salt (150 mm KC2H3O2). Typically, 5–10 digestion reactions were carried out and pooled for subsequent use. The concentration of SecB after proteinase K digestion was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a mock digestion containing proteinase K and PMSF as the buffer blank. SecB (36 μm monomer, each monomer contains 4 cysteine residues) was incubated with MIANS (150 μm) in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, for 22 h at 4 °C in the dark. The alkylation of SecB with MIANS was terminated by adding 0.75 mm dithiothreitol. The labeled SecB in 16.7 ml total volume was then dialyzed three times against 1.7 liters of 10 mm HEPES, 150 mmKC2H3O2, pH 7.6, for longer than 8 h each time to remove excess reagent. The concentration of SecB monomer after labeling with MIANS was 28 μm as determined by amino acid composition analysis. The stoichiometry of incorporation was 1 mol of MIANS:1 mol of SecB monomer as determined using an extinction coefficient at 322 nm of 20,000 m−1cm−1 for MIANS (27Mills J.S. Walsh M.P. Nemcek K. Johnson J.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The details of this assay have been reported previously (12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-B-Biol.

Fluorescence measurements were made using a Shimadzu RF-540 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The excitation and emission wavelengths used were 280 nm (for maximal absorption by tryptophan, bandwidth 2 nm) and 344 nm (bandwidth 5 nm), respectively. Wild-type mature maltose-binding protein was unfolded by incubation in 2 m GuHCl buffered with 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.6–7.7, for 2 h at room temperature. Refolding of the denatured protein was initiated by rapid dilution into 2.7 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6–7.7) contained in a cuvette that was held in the spectrophotometer such that the final concentration of maltose-binding protein was 25 nm and the final concentration of GuHCl was 0.05 m. When SecB (unmodified, SecB141, or MIANS-SecB) was present, it was added to the solution in the cuvette before the addition of the maltose-binding protein. The molar ratio of the SecB tetramer to maltose-binding protein is indicated for each experiment. The curves are drawn to aid the eye. The binding of ANS to SecB was monitored as described previously (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The fluorescent compound ANS, which binds to hydrophobic clusters of aminoacyl residues, was previously used to identify a hydrophobic binding site on SecB that is exposed upon binding of peptide ligands to the SecB tetramer (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Interaction of ANS with the hydrophobic patch on SecB is detected by an increase in the fluorescence intensity of ANS and a shift in the emission maximum from ∼520 to 472 nm. A 1.0 mg/ml solution of a lysine polymer comprising 10 residues (Lys10) that was previously shown to be long enough to bind SecB with high affinity (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was added in 2 μl increments to a cuvette containing 0.15 μm intact SecB tetramer or proteolyzed SecB tetramer (digested at 1.1 mg/ml with 0.05 mg/ml proteinase K) and 15 μm ANS in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, held at 5 °C in the spectrophotometer. The final concentration of KC2H3O2 was 16 mm. The intensity of ANS fluorescence with excitation at 370 nm and emission at 472 nm was measured after each addition of Lys10. The curve is drawn to aid the eye. Calorimetric titrations to obtain dissociation constants were carried out using the OMEGA titration calorimeter from MicroCal, Inc. (Northampton, MA) and the Origin software supplied with the instrument. The system has been described in detail in Wiseman et al. (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2426) Google Scholar). The SecB tetramer (unmodified, SecB141, or MIANS-SecB) was held in the cell at 5 μm in 1.345 ml of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm KC2H3O2, 0.1m GuHCl, 0.45 mm EGTA, and was titrated with galactose-binding protein that was unfolded in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 150 mm KC2H3O2, and 1.0 m GuHCl and diluted into the buffer for calorimetry immediately before loading the syringe for injection. Complete binding isotherms were generated at 7 °C by a sequence of 17 injections, each of 18 μl spaced at 11 min intervals. The best fit of the data for a model of one binding site was obtained using a least squares deconvolution algorithm based on the Marquardt method. The absolute binding constants determined in these experiments are subject to some uncertainty because the ligand can refold during the course of the titration. Therefore we report relative affinities that are valid since the identical titration schemes were used. It has clearly been established that kinetic partitioning can be poised to favor association with SecB by changing the rate constant for folding of the ligand (k f) (12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Diamond D.L. Strobel S. Chun S.Y. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that binding to SecB can be given a kinetic advantage over the pathway for folding by modulating the properties of SecB. Ligands such as short basic peptides or polymers ofl-lysine, which have lower affinity for SecB than do the physiologic polypeptide ligands, induce SecB to undergo a conformational change that exposes a hydrophobic site proposed to function in ligand binding (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We asked whether exposure of the hydrophobic patch on SecB induced by incubation with polymers ofl-lysine would allow us to detect a complex between SecB and maltose-binding protein under conditions in which rapid folding of the polypeptide would otherwise preclude formation of a kinetically stable complex. We reasoned that exposure of the hydrophobic patch might serve to increase the binding area on SecB and therefore increase the rate constant for association such that binding to SecB would have a kinetic advantage over the pathway for folding. The interaction between SecB and maltose-binding protein can be monitored in vitro by assessing the ability of SecB to block the refolding of denatured maltose-binding protein as established previously (12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 15Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-B-Biol. Sci. 1993; 339: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,19Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 21Diamond D.L. Strobel S. Chun S.Y. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Since maltose-binding protein contains 8 tryptophan residues, the refolding of maltose-binding protein can be followed by the change in intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan. The magnitude of the blockage of folding caused by SecB is calculated from a comparison of the change in fluorescence in the presence of SecB with the same parameter determined in the absence of SecB. As shown previously (21Diamond D.L. Strobel S. Chun S.Y. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), at 21 °C SecB slows the rate of folding of mature maltose-binding protein (data not shown), but the final amplitude achieved is the same; thus, there is not a blockage of folding (Fig.2, ○). Upon addition of a homopolymer of l-lysine of molecular weight 42,000 (poly-l-lysine), SecB is poised to block folding of maltose-binding protein at 21 °C (Fig. 2, •). This observation demonstrates that kinetic partitioning can also be poised to favor association with SecB by modulating the properties of the chaperone. That the poly-l-lysine has its effect directly by binding to SecB is supported by several lines of evidence. First, poly-l-lysine has been shown to interact at the physiological peptide binding site on SecB (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Second, poly-l-lysine does not potentiate SecB by nonspecific electrostatic effects. This is demonstrated by the finding that the addition of an equal mass of a lysine oligomer comprising 4 residues that was previously shown to be too short to bind SecB with high affinity (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) does not potentiate SecB for blockage of folding under the conditions described here (data not shown). Finally, the ability of SecB to block the folding of mature maltose-binding protein at 21 °C is not explained by an effect of poly-l-lysine on the rate constant for folding of the ligand, since when maltose-binding protein is refolded in the presence of poly-l-lysine, the rate of the folding reaction that renders maltose-binding protein incapable of binding SecB is unchanged (data not shown). Having established that we could use poly-l-lysine to potentiate unmodified SecB, we asked whether we could use this lysine polymer to restore activity to species of SecB that had been altered so that they had decreased ability to bind maltose-binding protein. We first evaluated the activity of two defective species of SecB under conditions in which slow folding of maltose-binding protein favors interaction with unmodified SecB in the absence of poly-l-lysine. As shown previously (12Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 19Liu G. Topping T.B. Randall L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9213-9217Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), at 5 °C, where the refolding of mature maltose-binding protein is sufficiently slow, unmodified, intact SecB is able to exert a complete blockage of folding when present in excess and a partial block at lower molar ratios (Fig. 3, •). A truncated form of SecB (SecB141) that has lost 14 aminoacyl residues from the C terminus as a result of proteinase K cleavage at Leu-141 (29Smith V.F. Schwartz B.L. Randall L.L. Smith R.D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was somewhat less active in blocking folding under these conditions (Fig. 3, ▴ and ▾). In contrast to the situation for SecB141, a species of SecB that was alkylated with the sulfhydryl-specific reagent MIANS (MIANS-SecB, 1 mol of MIANS/mol of SecB monomer) was incapable of completely blocking the folding of mature maltose-binding protein at 5 °C. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the folding of mature maltose-binding protein was retarded by the presence of MIANS-SecB at a 1.25-molar excess over maltose-binding protein, whereas the presence of unmodified SecB at the same molar ratio completely eliminates the change in fluorescence that reflects the folding of maltose-binding protein (Fig. 4 B). Thus the loss of 14 residues from the C terminus of SecB only slightly reduces the affinity of SecB141 for the ligand maltose-binding protein, whereas sulfhydryl modification reduces the affinity of MIANS-SecB to an extent such that it is no longer able to exert a blockage in folding. The relative affinities of the various species of SecB for a physiologic ligand, galactose-binding protein, was determined directly using titration calorimetry. The affinity of SecB141 was similar to that of intact SecB with at most a 2-fold decrease, whereas the affinity of MIANS-SecB was approximately 5–10-fold lower.Figure 4Effect of SecB on the rate of folding.Data shown are kinetic fluorescence traces of wild-type mature maltose-binding protein during folding at 5 °C in the absence (solid line) or presence (dotted line) of SecB. When SecB was present, the molar ratio was 1.25 SecB tetramer:1 maltose-binding protein monomer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Poly-l-lysine potentiated both SecB141 and MIANS-SecB at 21 °C, where rapid folding of maltose-binding protein otherwise favors folding of the polypeptide over binding to SecB. Poly-l-lysine was shown to potentiate the activity of SecB141 to almost the same extent as intact SecB (Fig. 2, compare • with ▴ and ▾). Thus, loss of 14 amino acids at the C terminus does not interfere with the ability of poly-l-lysine to potentiate SecB141. The defect caused by the MIANS modification could also be corrected by incubation with poly-l-lysine (Fig.5). Whereas in the absence of poly-l-lysine MIANS-SecB at a 5-molar excess over maltose-binding protein decreased the rate of folding, inclusion of poly-l-lysine potentiated the MIANS-SecB so that the increase in fluorescence due to folding was completely eliminated. Consistent with the idea that potentiation is achieved by exposure of the hydrophobic patch, we demonstrated that SecB141 was able to undergo the conformational change exposing the patch, as detected by binding of ANS (Fig. 6). These findings suggest that exposure of the hydrophobic patch on SecB compensates for the loss of activity of SecB. We were unable to directly demonstrate exposure of the hydrophobic patch on MIANS-SecB, since the assay used to detect the patch involves binding of ANS, which has an absorption spectrum overlapping with that of MIANS. A model rationalizing the ability of SecB to selectively bind nonnative proteins in the absence of any consensus in sequence or structure is illustrated in Fig. 7. The binding of a natural ligand to SecB involves interaction of regions of the polypeptide ligand with two different types of binding sites on SecB (Ref. 22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; Fig. 7 B). Simultaneous occupancy of multiple subsites of one type, which bind flexible stretches of ligand, causes a conformational change, exposing a second type of site, a hydrophobic patch proposed to function in binding of hydrophobic regions of the nonnative protein ligand. This model is based on the observation that the SecB tetramer binds peptide ligands and as a result undergoes a conformational change to expose a hydrophobic patch that was detected by binding of the fluorescent probe ANS (Ref. 22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; Fig. 7 A). The binding of a natural, long polypeptide ligand would thus involve interaction with the sites occupied by the peptide ligands as well as with the hydrophobic patch. Exposure of the patch would be triggered by simultaneous occupancy of multiple subsites by flexible stretches of a nonnative polypeptide, which would be distinguished from a native, folded protein by the availability of several such stretches. High affinity binding selective for the nonnative state would result from these multiple interactions, each having low specificity. The association between SecB and its nonnative ligands, although being of high affinity (K d ∼ 10−8m) has been shown to be in an equilibrium in which both binding and release are rapid (13Randall L.L. Hardy S.J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 65-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 30Fekkes P. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The unfolded protein continuously samples the free state and, with each cycle of dissociation, will partition between folding and rebinding. Thus, whether the polypeptide folds or forms a kinetically stable complex with SecB is based on a kinetic partitioning in which the relevant rate constants are the rate constant for folding and the rate constant for association with SecB. Previous work in our laboratory using forms of maltose-binding protein that are altered in their folding properties revealed different effects of SecB on the folding of these polypeptides at 21 °C (21Diamond D.L. Strobel S. Chun S.Y. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). While SecB only slightly decreased the rate of folding of wild-type maltose-binding protein, it drastically reduced the rate of folding of MalE A276G and completely blocked folding of MalE W10A. These differences in the effects of SecB can be explained in terms of kinetic partitioning and are attributed to differences in the rate constant for the folding reaction of the polypeptides (rate constants at 25 °C: wild type, 1.7 s−1; MalE A276G, 0.24 s−1; MalE W10A, 0.04 s−1), since it is folding that is in competition with binding to SecB. Thus, the 7-fold decrease in the rate of folding of MalE A276G with respect to the rate of folding of wild-type maltose-binding protein allowed SecB to slow the appearance of the folded protein, whereas the 40-fold decrease in folding of MalE W10A poised partitioning to favor binding over folding to the extent that the observed effect was a blockage of folding. Here we have shown that poly-l-lysine can potentiate SecB to block folding of wild-type MalE at 21 °C. This potentiation can also be explained in terms of a kinetic partitioning. In this case, addition of poly-l-lysine does not alter the rate constant of folding of the polypeptide ligands, but rather we propose that it has its effect directly on SecB by increasing the rate constant for association. As shown previously (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), interaction of poly-l-lysine with SecB results in exposure of a hydrophobic patch, and if as proposed this patch is part of the ligand binding site, the rate constant for association would thereby increase, since the probability that productive collisions occur between SecB and maltose-binding protein is directly proportional to the reactive surface area of the two proteins. Poly-l-lysine was effective not only in potentiating unmodified SecB to capture polypeptides that would otherwise fold too rapidly but also in restoring activity to two species of SecB that had been modified to decrease their ability to bind maltose-binding protein. Cleavage of 14 aminoacyl residues from the C terminus of SecB to yield SecB141 caused a slight defect, whereas sulfhydryl modification (MIANS-SecB) caused a more severe defect in binding of maltose-binding protein. It was shown that when incubated with poly-l-lysine, SecB141 underwent a conformational change, exposing a hydrophobic patch, thus supporting the idea that potentiation is achieved by exposure of the patch. Poly-l-lysine also potentiated MIANS-SecB at 21 °C under conditions in which the ligand folds too rapidly to otherwise allow detection of a complex between unmodified SecB and maltose-binding protein. The complex between SecB and poly-l-lysine has a dissociation constant in the range of micromolar (22Randall L.L. Science. 1992; 257: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), whereas the complex with maltose-binding protein has a K d in the range of 10−8m. Since binding to all ligands by SecB is likely to be near collision-limited, as was shown to be the case for bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (30Fekkes P. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10078-10085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the difference in affinity between poly-l-lysine and maltose-binding protein is likely to reflect a difference in dissociation rate that can be rationalized by proposing that poly-l-lysine occupies the subsites for flexible stretches, whereas maltose-binding protein is also bound at the hydrophobic site, and thus the probability of dissociation is lower. There are at least two ways in which one can envision the potentiation by poly-l-lysine. One possibility is that the patch becomes exposed when poly-l-lysine binds, but upon dissociation, relaxation to the closed state is slow enough that maltose-binding protein can collide with SecB before the conformation returns to the prebound state. Alternatively, maltose-binding protein might bind the SecB·poly-l-lysine complex, initially via the exposed patch, if it were not occupied by the poly-l-lysine and once tethered, displace the poly-l-lysine from the subsites for flexible stretches in a stepwise fashion. Whether the binding occurs when SecB is free or when poly-l-lysine is bound, we propose that exposure of a hydrophobic patch on SecB increases the surface area for binding and thereby increases the probability of productive collisions and thus the rate constant for association. In this way, association of SecB with the polypeptide ligand has a kinetic advantage over the pathway for folding. It seems unlikely that in the presence of poly-l-lysine, the dissociation rate constant would be affected to the same extent as is the association rate constant, since the binding of maltose-binding protein itself exposes the hydrophobic patch. However, even if the dissociation rate constant were lower, as long as dissociation is rapid enough to allow refolding to occur over the time course of the experiment, only the association rate constant is crucial to the partitioning between folding and rebinding to SecB. In the unlikely event that the presence of poly-l-lysine has an extreme effect on k off resulting in an essentially irreversible interaction between maltose-binding protein and SecB, a blockage of folding would be observed.

https://openalex.org/W2075593102,"Ca2+ oscillations can be induced in mammalian eggs and somatic cells by microinjection of a cytosolic sperm protein factor. The nature of the sperm factor-induced Ca2+ signaling was investigated by adding sperm protein extracts to homogenates of sea urchin eggs, which contain multiple classes of Ca2+ release mechanisms. We show that the sperm factor mobilizes Ca2+ from non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores in egg homogenates after a distinct latency. This latency is abolished by preincubation of sperm extracts with egg cytosol. The preincubation step is highly temperature-dependent and generates a high molecular weight, protein-based Ca2+-releasing agent that can also mobilize Ca2+ from purified egg microsomes. This Ca2+ release appears to be mediated via both inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors, since homologous desensitization of these two release mechanisms by their respective agonists inhibits further release by the sperm factor. However, sperm factor-induced Ca2+ release by these channels is independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate or cADPR since antagonists of either of these two messengers did not block the Ca2+release effected by the sperm factor.

The sperm protein factor may cause Ca2+ release via an enzymatic step that generates a protein-based Ca2+-releasing agent. At fertilization in mammals and some marine invertebrates, the sperm activates the egg by inducing a series of Ca2+oscillations involving release from intracellular stores (1Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 2Swann K. Ozil J.P. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 183-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In eggs, the propagation of Ca2+ waves is thought to be mediated by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release operating via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) 1The abbreviations used are: InsP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; RyR, ryanodine receptor; cADPR, cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose.-sensitive Ca2+ channels (1Miyazaki S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6671-6677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The sequence of events leading to the initiation of Ca2+ oscillations is unclear (6Whitaker M. Swann K. Development. 1993; 117: 1-12Google Scholar). One hypothesis for signaling at fertilization proposes that sperm-egg fusion allows the diffusion of a soluble cytosolic sperm factor into the egg cytoplasm which leads to the activation of Ca2+release (7Swann K. Development. 1990; 110: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Swann K. Lai F.A. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the finding that sperm-egg membrane fusion occurs before Ca2+ release in the eggs of sea urchins and mice (9McCulloh D.H. Chambers E.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 137-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Lawrence Y. Whitaker M. Swann K. Development. 1997; 124: 233-241PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, injecting cytosolic sperm extracts into mouse, hamster, bovine, human, and nemertean worm eggs cause Ca2+ oscillations similar to those seen at fertilization in each species (7Swann K. Development. 1990; 110: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Swann K. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Homa S.T. Swann K.

Biol. 1997; 186: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Injecting intact sperm also leads to Ca2+ oscillations in human and nemertean worm eggs (16Tesarik J. Sousa M. Testart J. Human Reprod. 1994; 9: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 17Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 1996; 176: 243-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The factor that causes these Ca2+ oscillations is only found in sperm, is only effective when injected into the egg, and has been shown to be a high molecular weight protein (7Swann K. Development. 1990; 110: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Homa S.T. Swann K. Human Reprod. 1994; 9: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Wu H. He C.L. Fissore R.A. Mol.

Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity has been correlated with a soluble protein made up from 33-kDa subunits, which is concentrated inside the sperm head around the site where it fuses with the egg (18Parrington J. Swann K. Shevchenko V.I. Sesay A.K. Lai F.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how this protein might mediate Ca2+changes in eggs. In mouse eggs, the sperm factor-induced Ca2+ oscillations are maintained for short periods in Ca2+-free media, suggesting that the sperm factor initiates release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores (11Swann K. Cell Calcium. 1994; 15: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, there has been no direct demonstration that the sperm factor can trigger Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Nor is it known if the sperm factor could activate both the InsP3- and ryanodine-sensitive mechanisms that are implicated in some eggs at fertilization (3Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.J. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6671-6677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that sperm factor-induced Ca2+ signaling is based on its ability to mobilize Ca2+ from internal stores by directly adding boar sperm extracts to sea urchin egg homogenates, which can accumulate Ca2+ in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system and release Ca2+ via multiple Ca2+ release channels. Sperm extracts were prepared from the cytosol of boar sperm as described previously (7Swann K. Development. 1990; 110: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This involved washing boar sperm into a KCl-based buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), lysing sperm by two cycles of freeze-thawing and then spinning lysates at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant from the high speed spin was then concentrated on Centricon C-30 membranes (Amicon Ltd, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom (UK)). In some experiments, the supernatant was rediluted and concentrated several times to isolate the fraction of boar sperm cytosol that contained proteins greater than 30 kDa. The protein concentration of these extracts was 10–35 mg/ml, depending upon the batch of preparation. They were frozen and kept at −70 °C until the day of use. Each particular set of experiments (e.g. dose-response relationships, desensitization experiments) was carried out with the same batch of extract. Homogenates (2.5%) of unfertilizedLytechinus pictus eggs (Marinus, Inc., Long Beach, CA) were prepared as described previously (19Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and Ca2+ loading was achieved by incubation at 17 °C for 3 h in an intracellular medium consisting of 250 mm potassium gluconate, 250 mm N-methylglucamine, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 10 unit/ml creatine phosphokinase, 1 μg/ml oligomycin, 1 μg/ml antimycin, 1 mm sodium azide, 3 μm fluo-3. Free Ca2+ concentration was measured by monitoring fluorescence intensity at excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 535 nm, respectively. Fluorimetry was performed at 17 °C using 500 μl of homogenate in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorimeter. Additions were made in 5-μl volumes, except where stated otherwise, and all chemicals were added in intracellular medium containing 10 μm EGTA and continuously stirred. Basal concentrations of Ca2+ were typically between 100 and 150 nm. Sequestered Ca2+ was determined by monitoring decrease in fluo-3 fluorescence during microsomal loading and by measuring Ca2+ release in response to ionomycin (5 μm) and was constant between experiments. For each experiment, standard Ca2+ calibration was performed by adding known amounts of Ca2+ (range of 0–8 nmol) to homogenates and monitoring fluorescence changes. Xenopus egg homogenates were prepared and used by a modified protocol of the above as described previously (4Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Microsomes were purified from 50% egg homogenates by the Percoll density centrifugation method described previously (20Clapper D.L. Walseth T.F. Dargie P.J. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9561-9568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a fractionating buffer was prepared by diluting Percoll stock to 25% in a modified intracellular medium (333 mm N-methylglucamine, 333 mmpotassium acetate, 27 mm HEPES, 1.3 mmMgCl2, pH titrated to 7.2 with acetic acid). This was then supplemented with 0.5 mm ATP, 2 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 4 mm phosphocreatine, 10 μmEGTA. 1 ml of 50% egg homogenate was layered on 9 ml of this solution and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C. The top fraction (1 ml) was collected and represented the supernatant fraction. The Ca2+-storing, InsP3, and cADPR-sensitive microsomes formed a distinct tight band halfway down the tube. 1 ml of this was collected using a disposable syringe to puncture the vessel wall. The fractions were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. Sperm factor extracts were incubated with sea urchin egg cytosol supernatant or microsomal fractions prepared on Percoll gradients as described above, in a 1:2 ratio, respectively, at 24 °C, except where stated otherwise. Aliquots of the resulting mixtures were added by pipette to sea urchin egg homogenates or microsomal fractions to examine their Ca2+ releasing activities. In some cases, the resulting mixtures were further fractionated using a series of 3-, 10-, and 100-kDa cut-off filters (Amicon), in which the mixture was placed on top of the filtration columns and microcentrifuged for 10–30 min at 4 °C. Both resulting filtrate and retentate fractions from each of these columns were tested for their Ca2+ releasing activities. Sperm factor extracts or fractions derived from incubation and filtration protocols were treated with by dilution into buffer containing trypsin (100 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature, before reconcentration back to the original volume (7Swann K. Development. 1990; 110: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the resulting mixture were then tested for activity in the egg homogenates and microsomal fractions. 8-NH2-cADPR and fluo-3 were from Molecular Probes; fluo-3 was from Calbiochem (Molecular Probes); all other chemicals were from Sigma. Chemicon cut-off filters were obtained from Amicon, Beverly, MA. Diluted sea urchin egg homogenates (2.5% v/v) containing the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3, and mitochondrial inhibitors were allowed to sequester Ca2+ in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system over 3 h at 17 °C. After a stable base line of fluorescence had been attained, aliquots of soluble cytoplasmic (>30 kDa) extracts from boar sperm were added to the cuvette. Fig. 1 A(i) shows that a delayed and transient increase in the fluorescence signal occurred after sperm extract addition, indicating that the sperm extracts contained a Ca2+ mobilizing activity. The latencies of Ca2+ release were at least 100 s, and after this release the Ca2+ was resequestered (Fig. 1 A, i). A protein component rather than a small molecular weight component was likely to be responsible for this effect since sperm extracts preincubated with trypsin at room temperature abolished the sperm extract-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 1 A, ii), but the same homogenate still responded with a characteristically rapid Ca2+ release to InsP3 or cADPR (data not shown), known low molecular weight Ca2+ mobilizing messengers active in this system (19Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Galione A. Lee H.C. Busa W.B. Science. 1991; 253: 1143-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that sperm extract also induced Ca2+ release fromXenopus egg homogenates (4Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M.

The release mechanism activated by the sperm factor underwent a desensitization process since subsequent application of sperm factor following Ca2+ resequestration failed to induce a significant second Ca2+ increase (Fig. 1 C). Sperm extract-induced Ca2+ release was dependent on the amount of sperm factor added, with the magnitude of Ca2+ release increasing and latency decreasing at higher concentrations (Fig. 1, Dand E). The latent period suggested that sperm factor-induced Ca2+release is indirect and that a biochemical reaction is initiated by the sperm factor perhaps requiring cofactors in the homogenate either as substrates or components of the signaling pathway. We examined the effect of sperm extract on Ca2+ release from different dilutions of egg homogenates since these would contain varying concentrations of cofactors that might be necessary for sperm extract-induced Ca2+ release. At higher homogenate concentrations (e.g. 50% v/v), the latency for sperm extract-induced Ca2+ release for the same volume of sperm extract addition was reduced (Fig.2 A), when compared with that in the standard 2.5% (v/v) assay system in Fig. 1. These data suggest that egg homogenate components play a facilitatory role in the sperm factor-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanism. Preincubation of sperm extract with egg cytosol (homogenate supernatant) before addition to 2.5% homogenates substantially reduced the latency and greatly increased the magnitude of response to sperm extract (Fig.2 B). In contrast, preincubation with purified particulate/microsomal fractions did not have any effect, suggesting that the egg components responsible for the facilitatory role are likely to be soluble (Fig. 2 C). The enhancement of the sperm factors' Ca2+ mobilizing actions was time-dependent and significantly reduced by incubations of sperm extracts and egg cytosol at 4 °C (Fig. 2 D). TheQ 10 of the reaction was investigated by incubating 10 μl of sperm factor with 20 μl of egg supernatant for 15 min at 17 °C or at 7 °C. The mixture was then added to sea urchin egg homogenates (2.5% v/v) and Ca2+ release monitored at 17 °C. The latency to release was 319 ± 28 s (n = 3; S.E.) and 690 ± 49 s (n = 3; S.E.) at 17 °C and 7 °C, respectively. These data suggest a Q 10 of ∼2.2 for the latency and imply that an enzymatic reaction is rate-limiting between the sperm factor and soluble egg components (22Gutfreund H. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1996Google Scholar). TheQ 10 is similar to that of 2.3 for the latent period at fertilization in sea urchin eggs (23Allen R.D. Griffen J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1958; 15: 163-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Dale B.D. deFelice L.J. Taglietti V. Nature. 1978; 275: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Addition of boar sperm extract did not cause Ca2+ release from purified microsomal preparations (Fig. 2 F), despite the fact that these preparations responded to InsP3 and cADPR (data not shown). However, when boar sperm extract was preincubated with egg cytosolic fractions for 30 min (as above) and then added to microsomes immediate Ca2+ release occurred, while egg cytosolic fractions were not able themselves to cause Ca2+release (Fig. 2 F). These data suggested that the preincubation of boar sperm extract with an egg cytosolic protein leads to the formation of an active principle that can directly trigger Ca2+ release via channels in the endoplasmic reticulum or microsomal fractions. The active principle in egg cytosol was in excess of 100 kDa since rapid Ca2+ releasing activity generated by incubation of sperm extract with supernatant fractions was apparent only with retentate from 100 kDa cut-off filters rather than the filtrate (Fig. 2 E). This argued against the idea that the sperm factor exerts its effects by generating small molecular intracellular messengers such as InsP3 or cADPR. Furthermore, it is unlikely that sperm extract interacts with large molecules to produce these low molecular weight intermediates which could trigger Ca2+ release since size filtration (100-kDa cut-off filter) of the sperm extract preincubated with egg cytosol for up to 60 min resulted in the active fraction being retained by the filter (>100 kDa) and did not appear in the filtrate (<100 kDa) (Fig.2 E). That an additional protein is required for sperm extract action is supported by the finding that transient treatment of egg cytosol with agarose-trypsin beads abolished the enhancing effect of egg cytosol on sperm factor-induced Ca2+ release (Fig.2 E). A role for protein kinases in the the preincubation reaction did not seem likely, because the preincubation reaction still gave rise to a rapid Ca2+-releasing agent when it was carried out in the presence of a 10 μm concentration of the potent protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, or the absence of any added ATP (data not shown). We examined which Ca2+ release channels mediated sperm extract-induced Ca2+ release. Ca2+ release in sea urchin egg homogenates by InsP3 and cADPR can be fully inactivated by prior stimulation with a maximal concentration of each respective agonist (25Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 108-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows the effect of prior desensitization to InsP3 on the cytosol-preactivated, sperm factor-induced Ca2+ release, and Fig. 3 B shows the same for cADPR-inactivated homogenates. Sperm extract-induced Ca2+ release still occurred in homogenates refractory to either of these agents. However, if both InsP3 and cADPR mechanisms are inactivated in the same homogenate, the sperm factor-induced Ca2+ release was abolished (Fig.3 C). In addition, prior exposure of the homogenates to cytosol-preactivated sperm factor desensitized the microsomes to both InsP3 and cADPR (Fig. 3 D). Previous studies indicate that InsP3 and cADPR are located on substantially overlapping Ca2+ pools and that lack of response to one agent probably reflects a desensitization of the Ca2+release mechanism rather than pool depletion (19Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 26Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Additionally, a distinct Ca2+ pool that is sensitive to nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate does not increase in size after mobilization of Ca2+ by the other two agents (25Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 108-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is thus thought that after desensitization of cADPR- and InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ release mechanisms, the pool expressing these channels is still able to sequester Ca2+. These data therefore suggest that sperm extract can trigger Ca2+ release by activating both InsP3Rs and RyRs. The effects of sperm factor resemble those of the sulfhydryl reagent thimerosal, which can stimulate both InsP3Rs and RyRs (27Kaplin A.I. Ferris C.D. Volgmaier S.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28972-28978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Abramson J.J. Zable A.C. Favero T.C. Salama G. J. Biol.

Lai F.A. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To confirm that the sperm factor induces Ca2+ release by activating multiple Ca2+ release mechanisms present on internal stores, we tested the effects of the sperm factor on homogenates pretreated with thapsigargin (10 μm). Thapsigargin is a potent microsomal Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor and functionally removes Ca2+ stores and renders sea urchin egg microsomes insensitive to InsP3 and cADPR (25Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 108-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Genazzani A.A. Galione A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 A shows that the sperm factor-induced Ca2+ release in egg homogenates was abolished by pretreatment with thapsigargin. However, a combination of heparin plus 8-NH2-cADPR, which competitively blocks both InsP3Rs and RyRs to activation by InsP3 and cADPR, respectively (3Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Walseth T.J. Science. 1993; 261: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), did not affect egg cytosol-preincubated, sperm factor-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 4 B). Our data support the view that the sperm extract modulates Ca2+ release via InsP3Rs and RyRs by a novel mechanism that is independent of low molecular weight messengers such as InsP3 or cADPR. These features of the sperm factor do not correlate with the 23-kDa tr-kit sperm protein, which has been suggested to generate InsP3-induced Ca2+release in mouse eggs (29Sette C. Bevilacqua A. Mangia F. Geremia R. Rossi P. Development. 1997; 124: 2267-2274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active component causing Ca2+ oscillations in the sperm extract fraction used is correlated with a high molecular mass complex composed of 33-kDa subunits which has been named oscillin and has 53% amino acid sequence homology with an Escherichia coli enzyme glucosamine-6-phosphate isomerase (18Parrington J. Swann K. Shevchenko V.I. Sesay A.K. Lai F.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It is not clear how this class of enzyme might be linked to Ca2+ release channel activation. However, the features of the sperm factor-induced Ca2+ mobilization in egg homogenates suggest a novel signaling mechanism and further studies should reveal any possible connection with this class of enzymes. In view of the ability of the sperm factor to trigger distinct Ca2+ oscillations in somatic cells (30Currie K.P.M. Swann K. Galione A. Scott R.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1415-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 31Berrie C.P. Cuthbertson K.R.S. Parrington J. Lai F.A. Swann K. Biochem. J. 1996; 311: 369-372Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it is possible that it may also reveal a novel component of cellular Ca2+ oscillators. We thank Drs. W. Eckberg and R. Empson for comments on the manuscript."

Of the signaling responses regulated by the four subfamilies of G proteins, the responses regulated by the G12 family of G proteins are beginning to be understood only recently (1Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we have shown that the GTPase-deficient activated mutants of Gα12 (Gα12QL) and Gα13 (Gα13QL) differentially stimulate the Na+/H+ exchange in COS-1 cells (2Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by Gα12 is protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent whereas the stimulation by Gα13 is PKC-independent. It has also been shown that whereas Na+/H+exchange is stimulated by Gα12 in COS cells, it is inhibited in HEK293 and CCL 39 cells (3Lin X. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Hooley R. Lin C.-Y. Orlowski J. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22604-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Studies from several laboratories including ours have established that these G proteins are also involved in regulating several other responses (1Dhanasekaran N. Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Whereas Gα12 and Gα13 are equally effective in activating most of these signaling responses they differ in their effect on Na+/H+ exchange. Thus, it appears that whereas Gα12 and Gα13 activate a similar set of responses, in different cell types or at different physiological contexts in the same cell type, they may regulate distinct sets of responses. Strong support for this argument comes from the recent Gα13 gene knock-out studies carried out by Offermanns et al. (4Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), which suggest that Gα12and Gα13 regulate distinct, non-complementary signaling pathways during mammalian embryogenesis. Defining the molecular basis for the differential signaling by Gα12 and Gα13 will prove critical to the understanding of the unique and critical responses regulated by these two G proteins, respectively. Therefore, we examined whether the differential regulation of Na+/H+ exchange by Gα12 and Gα13 can be used to define the molecular basis for the functional differences between them. Na+/H+ exchange is mediated by a distinct family of transmembrane proteins known as Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs). Both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms are involved in the stimulation of NHEs (5Fliegel L. Frohlich O. Biochem.

In addition, the α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins as well as small GTPases have been shown to regulate the activities of NHEs (2Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Wadsworth S.J.

Dermott J.M. Cell. Signalling. 1996; 8: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although the studies by Hooleyet al. (9Hooley R. Yu C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol.

We present here our studies indicating that the signaling pathway leading to the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by the activated mutant of Gα12 is distinctly different from that of Gα13 and that it proceeds through a pathway that is dependent on Ras and sensitive to phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis-mediated activation of PKC.

The pH recovery was monitored for a period of 10 min, and the rate of recovery (dpH i /dt) was calculated as pH units/min. Our previous studies have shown that Gα12 stimulates JNK and Na+/H+ exchange activities in COS-1 cells. In these cells, the activation of Na+/H+exchange by Gα12 is dependent on PKC whereas the activation of JNK is dependent on the presence of the small GTPase, Ras (2Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S.

It has also been shown that Gα12 activation of JNK involves other small GTPases such as Rac, CDC42, and the Ser/Thr kinase MEKK (15Collins L.R. Minden A. Karin M. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17349-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Since JNK has been suggested to be a candidate kinase involved in the regulation of cell volume (17Galcheva-Gargova Z. Derijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and the regulatory increase in cell volume is in some cases critically regulated by Na+/H+ exchange (18Grinstein S. Foskett J.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the stimulation of Na+/H+exchange by Gα12 is mediated by JNK. COS-1 cells were cotransfected with plasmid vectors containing the cDNA inserts encoding a kinase-deficient mutant of JNK1 (KR-JNK1) and Gα12QL. The transfectants were analyzed for Na+/H+ exchange activity. Similar cotransfection studies were carried out with Gα13QL for comparison. As indicated in Fig. 1, the expression of constitutively activated, GTPase-deficient Gα12 or Gα13 stimulated the Na+/H+ exchange as indicated by the recovery rate of cell pH from an acid load. The coexpression of KR-JNK had no effect on Gα12QL-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange whereas it had a strong inhibitory effect on Gα13QL-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange. JNK1 is activated through phosphorylation by an upstream Ser/Thr kinase known as Jun N-terminal kinasekinase. When the dominant negative mutant of JNKK (KR-JNKK) was cotransfected along with Gα12QL or Gα13QL, only the activity stimulated by Gα13QL was inhibited whereas that stimulated by Gα12QL remained unaffected (Fig. 1). The sensitivity of Gα13QL to JNKK and JNK is not surprising in light of the recent observations by Hooley et al. (9Hooley R. Yu C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), demonstrating that MEKK, an upstream kinase of JNKK-JNK, is involved in the stimulation of NHE1 by Gα13QL. However, the finding that Gα12QL stimulation of Na+/H+exchange is not mediated by the JNKK-JNK-signaling module is novel and significant since it strongly suggests that Gα12QL stimulates Na+/H+ exchange through a distinct JNK-independent signaling pathway. Activation of the MEKK-JNKK-JNK signaling module (JNK module) is primarily mediated by Rac and CDC42, members of the Rho family of GTPases (12Coso O.A. Chiariello M. Yu J.-C. Teramoto H. Xu N.

Furthermore, it has been shown that the activated mutant of Gα12 can interact with both Ras- and Rac-dependent signaling pathways in NIH3T3 cells in the activation of the cell-proliferative response (20Mitsui H. Takuwa N. Kurokawa K. Exton J.H. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4904-4910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, Gα12QL has been shown to interact with Rho (21Buhl A.M. Lassignal-Johnson N. Dhanasekaran N. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24631-24634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that Gα13QL stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange has been shown to be dependent upon CDC42 as well as Rho (9Hooley R. Yu C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Hence we sought to examine whether the JNK-independent stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by Gα12QL is through a distinct small GTPase(s) different from the one being recruited by Gα13QL. COS cells were cotransfected with the dominant negative, competitively inhibitory mutants of Ras, Rac, or CDC42 together with Gα12QL or Gα13QL. As shown in Fig. 2, the coexpression of the dominant negative Ras completely inhibited Na+/H+ exchange stimulated by Gα12QL whereas the coexpression of dominant negative Rac or CDC42 did not. In contrast, the coexpression of dominant negative Rac or CDC42 inhibited the Gα13QL-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange activity whereas the dominant negative Ras failed to have any effect. It is worth noting that the expression of the activated mutants of both Rac (RacV12) and CDC42 (CDC42V12) by themselves has been shown to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange in a JNK module-dependent manner in CCL39 cells (9Hooley R. Yu C.-Y. Symons M. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6152-6158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results suggest that Gα12QL stimulates Na+/H+ exchange through a Ras-dependent but JNK-independent mechanism whereas Gα13QL stimulates Na+/H+ exchange through a Rac/CDC42- and JNK-dependent signaling pathway. In this context, it is significant to note that although Gα12QL and Gα13QL display differential sensitivity to KR-JNK/KR-JNKK in the regulation of Na+/H+ response, they show equal sensitivity to these dominant negative kinases in the regulation of JNK activity (data not shown). Thus it appears that the signaling by Gα12bifurcates at the level of Ras, one leading to the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange and the other to the activation of JNK. If the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange by Gα12QL is mediated by Ras, then Ras itself should be able to activate the Na+/H+ exchange. Also, the exchange activated by Ras should be sensitive to PKC, since Gα12QL stimulation of Na+/H+exchange is PKC-dependent. Although the ability of Ras and its downstream effector kinases such as Raf and ERK has been shown to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange (6Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 8Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4721-4724Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), the role of PKC in Ras-mediated Na+/H+ exchange is not yet defined. Hence, we investigated the ability of Ras to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange in the presence or absence of the endogenous PKC activity. COS-1 cells were transfected with the activated mutant of Ras (Ras V12). In a duplicate set of transfectants, the endogenous PKC was depleted by the chronic treatment with PMA (500 ng/ml) for 24 h. Gα12QL and Gα13QL transfectants were also subjected to similar treatment procedures. The Na+/H+ activities of the transfectants were determined. As indicated in Fig. 3, expression of RasV12 leads to an increased Na+/H+ exchange activity of COS cells, similar to those of Gα12QL and Gα13QL. More significantly, the expression of RasV12 failed to stimulate Na+/H+ exchange when PKC was depleted in these cells similar to Gα12QL (Fig. 3). Consistent with our previous observations, depletion of PKC activity did not have any inhibitory effect on the Gα13QL-stimulated Na+/H+ exchange (2Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results strongly point to Gα12QL stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange being mediated by Ras through a PKC-sensitive signaling pathway. It is significant that the rate of Na+/H+ exchange activated by Ras is higher than the rates with Gα12 or Gα13. This may be indicative that Ras can stimulate Na+/H+exchange by more than one pathway including the ERK pathway. The observation that the Ras-stimulated Na+/H+exchange is only partially inhibited by the chronic PMA treatment is also consistent with this view. Since Ras can activate the ERK signaling module and ERK has been shown to be involved in the stimulation of Na+/H+exchanger (5Fliegel L. Frohlich O. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 8Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 269: 4721-4724Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), it can be argued that the observed reduction in Na+/H+ exchange is through the modulation of ERK activity by PKC. To examine whether the PKC sensitivity is a function of an altered ERK activity, we determined both the Ras-stimulated ERK2 (using the cotransfection of an HA epitope-tagged ERK2 vector) as well as the endogenous ERK2 activities of these transfectants following PKC depletion. As shown in Fig.4, A and B, the depletion of endogenous PKC did not inhibit either of the ERK2 activities. On the contrary, the depletion of PKC has resulted in a small increase in the activation of ERK2 (Fig. 4, A andB), which is consistent with the observation that the chronic PMA treatment of different cell lines leads to the depletion of a growth-inhibitory isoform of PKC (22Bjorkoy G. Overvatn A. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Johansen T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21299-21306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The most significant conclusion from these experiments is that the reduction of Na+/H+ exchange observed in Ras and Gα12 transfectants can only be attributed to the depletion of endogenous PKC. These results, together with the observation that Gα12QL expression does not stimulate ERK2 activity in COS cells (Fig. 4 A (16Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)), suggest that Gα12QL-stimulated, Ras-mediated, and PKC-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange does not involve ERK activation. Several studies have indicated a role for PKC in Ras signaling although its implication in Ras-mediated Na+/H+ exchange is a novel one. The presence of multiple isoforms of PKC that have different effects on Ras signaling has added immense complexity in resolving the relationship between PKC and Ras in any specific signaling pathway (23Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 24Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 25Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar). The PMA sensitivity of the Gα12QL-Ras-mediated Na+/H+exchange response evidently suggests that a diacylglycerol-sensitive PKC isoform is involved. Diacylglycerols (DAGs) are produced by the action of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) that hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol to inositol phosphates and DAGs. Since Gα12QL expression in COS cells does not lead to any increase in inositol phosphate levels or in PI-PLC activity, it is unlikely that PI-PLC is involved in Gα12QL-Ras stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange. DAGs can also be produced by alternate signaling pathways involving phospholipases such as phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC), phospholipase D (PLD), or phospholipase A2 (25Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (4226) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ras has been known to modulate the activities of both PC-PLC (26Cai H. Erhardt P. Troppmair J. Diaz-Meco M.T. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Moscat J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7645-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and PC-PLD (27Carnero A. Cuadrado A. del Peso L. Lacal J.C. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1387-1395PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we used tricyclodecan-9-yl xanthogenate, commonly known as D609, an inhibitor of PC-PLC and PC-PLD (28Kiss Z. Tomono M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. de Widt J. Hilkmann H. van Bitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11011-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), to discern whether Gα12-Ras coupling to PKC (in stimulating the Na+/H+ exchange) involves any of these phospholipases. As shown in Fig. 5, when the cells expressing Gα12QL or RasV12 were treated with D609 (10 μg/ml) for 1 h, the Na+/H+ stimulation was completely inhibited. In a striking contrast, the Na+/H+ activity stimulated by Gα13QL was unaffected, demonstrating that the signaling pathway involving Ras and PC-PLC or PC-PLD is specific to Gα12. The observations that the predominant form of PMA-sensitive PKC expressed in COS cells is PKCα and that PKCα is also responsive to DAGs derived from PC (30Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-tappe I. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Rapp U. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 732-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) suggest that the Gα12-Ras-phosphatidylcholine phospholipase signaling nexus presumably involves PKCα in stimulating Na+/H+ exchange in COS-1 cells. At present, we are unable to distinguish between PLC and PLD in this pathway because of the recently observed lack of specificity of D609 to either of these lipases (28Kiss Z. Tomono M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29van Dijk M.C.M. Muriana F.J.G. de Widt J. Hilkmann H. van Bitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11011-11016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the transient expression system as well as the dynamic interconversion of various lipid intermediates in this pathway precluded us from identifying the D609-sensitive phospholipase activated by Gα12 through Ras. Nevertheless, the identification that a D609-sensitive phospholipase is involved in Gα12 signaling is a significant one, and this property clearly distinguishes Gα12 from Gα13. At present, the mechanism by which Gα12 selectively stimulates a specific Ras signaling pathway without having a stimulatory effect on an ERK pathway is not fully understood. Similarly, it is still unclear how the JNK activated by Gα12QL is not coupled to the stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange whereas the JNK activated by Gα13QL is coupled. It is likely that response-specific hard wiring of the Gα12-signaling pathway and/or the ability of Gα12 to generate parallel signals that can block other signaling “noises” may play a major role in insulating the Gα12-Ras-PC-PLC/PC-PLD pathway from being affected by the random drifts of Ras into other signaling pathways. Perhaps, the “parallel signals” emanating from Gα12 may also suppress the JNK-dependent activation of Na+/H+ exchange. Such a mechanism would be analogous to the observations reported by Barber and colleagues (3Lin X. Voyno-Yasenetskaya T.A. Hooley R. Lin C.-Y. Orlowski J. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22604-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) in which the expression of Gα12QL inhibited the Na+/H+ exchange activated by Gα13QL. In addition, the recent observation that Gα12 and Gα13 activate JNK while concomitantly causing an inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase and ERK activities through independent mechanisms (16Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Faure M.P. Ahn N.G. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21081-21087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) points to the multiplex signaling capabilities of these α-subunits. In this context, it should be pointed out that the Na+/H+ exchange activities measured here do not define the activity of a single type of the NHEs. Hence, it is possible that these α-subunits may be involved in the regulation of different NHEs. At present, the need for the presence of two different mechanisms regulated by two closely related but distinct Gα-subunits in a single cell type is not known. It is likely that the presence of different NHEs at different locations of the cell (e.g.apical versus basolateral surfaces) or the physiological need to activate specific NHEs at different physiological contexts (fore.g. regulatory volume increase versus regulatory volume decrease) may require the presence of independent signaling pathways. It is significant to note here that Gα12 stimulation is mediated by Ras through the PC-phospholipase/PKC network whereas Gα13 stimulation of Na+/H+exchanger is mediated by the Rac/CDC42-JNK signaling module. Based on these observations, it can be predicted that Gα12 is primarily involved in Ras-dependent responses such as mitogenic pathways whereas Gα13, which avidly interacts with Rac/CDC42, may be more involved in the regulation of Rac-dependent responses. In this context, it is worth noting that the fibroblasts derived from Gα13 −/− mouse embryos did not show any decrease in ligand-induced DNA synthesis or cell proliferation although both the alleles of wild-type Gα12 were present (4Offermanns S. Mancino V. Revel J.-P. Simon M.I. Science. 1997; 275: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). However, these cells were found to be less responsive to thrombin-stimulated chemokinesis involving cell motility. Since CDC42 and Rac are critically involved in cytoskeletal responses such as filopodia and lamellipodia formation, it is likely that Gα13 deficiency leads to a functional uncoupling between the cell surface receptors and Rac and CDC42. Although the mechanisms by which Gα12 and Gα13 transmit their signals to the respective low molecular weight GTPases are presently not known, it is likely that they interact with Ras- or Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors or guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. Identifying the molecules that couple Gα12 and Gα13 to the Ras and Rho family of GTPases may finally define the functional and evolutionary significance of both the similar and divergent signaling pathways regulated by these two G proteins."

Unlike Oct-1, which is constitutively expressed in many cell types, Oct-2 expression is restricted primarily to B lymphocytes and can be induced in precursor B cells by stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). However, the precise factors that mediate this induction mechanism remain unknown. In the present study, we monitored Oct-2 expression in cells arrested for the activation of NF-κB, an LPS-responsive member of the Rel transcription factor family. Despite stimulation with LPS, disruption of the NF-κB signaling pathway in precursor B cells led to the loss of inducible Oct-2 DNA binding activity in vitro and the suppression of Oct-2-directed transcription in vivo. This biochemical defect correlated with a specific block to Oct-2 gene expression at the level of transcription, whereas the expression of Oct-1 was unaffected. The finding that Oct-2 is under NF-κB control highlights an important cross-talk mechanism involving two distinct transcription factor families that regulate B lymphocyte function.

The finding that Oct-2 is under NF-κB control highlights an important cross-talk mechanism involving two distinct transcription factor families that regulate B lymphocyte function. The genetic program that mediates B cell development is governed by the concerted action of both ubiquitous and lymphoid-specific transcription factors. One integral component of this regulatory network is Oct-2, an inducible member of the POU family of proteins. This B cell-specific factor binds to an 8-base pair sequence, termed the octamer motif (consensus sequence ATGCAAAT), which is present in the Ig heavy chain enhancer and in the promoters flanking all Ig variable region gene segments (1Kemler I. Schaffner W. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, these sites are also recognized by another POU family member, termed Oct-1, which is constitutively expressed in many cell types (2Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Finney M. Ruvkun G. Horvitz H. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1513-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that Oct-1 and Oct-2 associate independently with the coactivator protein OBF-1 and direct comparable levels of transcription from Ig promoters in reporter gene assays (3Luo Y. Fujii H. Gerster T. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 231-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 4Gstaiger M. Knoepful L. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Hovens C.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Consistent with this evidence for functional redundancy, targeted disruption of the gene encoding Oct-2 has no significant effect on Ig gene expression in vivo (6Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J.V. Ye Z.-Y. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). However, the mitogenic response of mature B lymphocytes lacking Oct-2 is severely impaired, indicating that Oct-2 plays an essential role in B cell activation that cannot be replaced by Oct-1. Like Oct-2, members of the NF-κB/Rel family of proteins have been implicated in the control of Ig gene expression and B cell activation. These inducible transcription factors form homo- or heterodimers that are normally sequestered as latent complexes in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins (7Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 8Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar). In response to B cell activation signals, IκB is rapidly degraded and NF-κB accumulates in the nuclear compartment (7Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar).

B and mature B cells, these nuclear NF-κB complexes contain either c-Rel or RelA as the principle transactivating subunit (9Liou H.-C. Sha W.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5349-5359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Shaffer A.L. Peng A. Schlissel M.S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 131-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that an intact NF-κB signaling pathway is required for the assembly and expression of Igκ light chain genes in pre-B cell lines (11Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These findings are fully consistent with the direct role that NF-κB plays in regulating its cognate site within the κ intronic enhancer (12Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 236: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). However, indirect mechanisms involving the action of NF-κB-responsive transcription factors at other sites in the Igκ locus cannot be excluded. To address this issue, we performed a biochemical survey of transcription factors that target most of the known regulatory elements within the Igκ locus (13O'Brien D.P. Oltz E.M. Van Ness B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on Oct-2 because this particular transcription factor is induced by agents that also activate the nuclear expression of NF-κB (6Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J.V. Ye Z.-Y. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 14Miller C.L. Feldhaus A.L. Rooney L.D. Sibley C.H. Singh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have found that disruption of the NF-κB signaling pathway in pre-B cells imposes a specific block to Oct-2 gene transcription, whereas expression of Oct-1 and OBF-1 is unaffected. The finding that Oct-2 is under NF-κB control has potential implications for the overlapping defects in B cell activation observed when either NF-κB or Oct-2 expression is disrupted in vivo (6Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J.V. Ye Z.-Y. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 15Sha W.C. Liou H.-C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D.

Moreover, our results provide an attractive mechanistic explanation for the constitutive expression of Oct-2 in mature B lymphocytes, which characteristically express high levels of nuclear NF-κB (14Miller C.L. Feldhaus A.L. Rooney L.D. Sibley C.H. Singh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).

In brief, 38B9 pre-B cells (2 × 107) were transfected with luciferase reporters (2 μg) and a control vector encoding the placental alkaline phosphatase protein (PEP.PAP, 2 μg) (11Scherer D.C.

Transfected cells were cultured in the presence or the absence of LPS (10 μg/ml) for 20–24 h. Protein extracts were assayed for luciferase activity using an enhanced luciferase assay kit (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1913-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and a 1.1-kilobasePstI fragment derived from the rat glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (11Scherer D.C.

Hybridization probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using a commercially available kit (NEN Life Science Products). In recent studies with Abelson-transformed pre-B cells, we demonstrated that an intact NF-κB signaling pathway is required for the induction of Igκ transcription by LPS (11Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the Igκ locus contains regulatory motifs for other LPS-inducible proteins that might be under NF-κB control, including Oct-2 (13O'Brien D.P. Oltz E.M. Van Ness B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3477-3487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Miller C.L. Feldhaus A.L. Rooney L.D. Sibley C.H. Singh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, NF-κB and Oct-2 are both induced in pre-B cells by LPS (14Miller C.L. Feldhaus A.L. Rooney L.D. Sibley C.H. Singh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-κB is required for Oct-2-directed transcription, we employed a mutated form of IκBα that functions as a constitutive repressor of NF-κB activity (20Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the inhibitory effects of this mutant, termed IκBΔN, are restricted to its cognate signal transduction pathway (11Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pre-B cells stably expressing IκBΔN were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing a basal promoter from the chicken lysozyme gene (pCL) linked to either wild type (pCLED) or mutated (pCLEd) octamer motifs. Prior studies have demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of pCLED correlates directly with functional Oct-2 levels (17Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Ullmer C. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, neither pCL nor pCLEd was responsive to LPS when introduced into control transfectants lacking ectopic IκBΔN, whereas the wild type pCLED reporter was significantly induced in these cells. Despite the presence of LPS, the Oct-2-dependent transcriptional response of pCLED was suppressed in IκBΔN-expressing cells. These data suggest that an intact NF-κB signaling pathway is required for the induction of Oct-2-directed transcription in pre-B cells. To extend these results to a more physiologically relevant gene, we next examined the inhibitory effects of IκBΔN on CD36 expression. Prior studies have demonstrated that transcription of this B cell-specific gene is critically dependent on the action of Oct-2 (21König H. Pfisterer P. Corcoran L.M. Wirth T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1598-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As revealed by Northern blot analyses (Fig.2), steady-state levels of CD36 transcripts were substantially elevated in two different pre-B cell lines following LPS treatment (lanes 1, 2,7, and 8). Similar results were obtained using cells stably transfected with wild type IκBα (lanes 3and 4), which is rapidly inactivated by LPS treatment (11Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, induction of the CD36 gene was completely blocked in the IκBΔN background (lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10). These data establish that NF-κB is required not only for induction of Oct-2-directed transcription from a synthetic promoter but also from an endogenous transcription unit known to be under Oct-2 control. In pre-B cells, elevated levels of nuclear Oct-2 DNA binding activity are detected within 8 h after LPS stimulation (14Miller C.L. Feldhaus A.L. Rooney L.D. Sibley C.H. Singh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To determine whether NF-κB is required to generate this inducible activity, pre-B cells expressing either wild type IκBα or IκBΔN were stimulated with LPS for 12 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared for gel retardation studies with a consensus κB probe. As expected, LPS efficiently induced the expression of nuclear NF-κB complexes in control cells lacking ectopic IκB and in transfectants expressing wild type IκBα (Fig. 3, top panel). Based on prior DNA-protein cross-linking studies (11Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the predominant NF-κB species induced in these cells contain either c-Rel or RelA as the transactivating subunit. Parallel experiments performed with a consensus octamer motif as the radiolabeled probe revealed a similar pattern of inducible DNA binding for Oct-2, whereas the constitutive DNA binding activity of Oct-1 was unaffected (Fig. 3,bottom panel). The presence of Oct-1 and Oct-2 in the two nucleoprotein complexes observed in these experiments was confirmed by antibody supershift analyses (lanes 11 and 12 and data not shown). Unlike wild type IκBα, IκBΔN exerted potent inhibitory effects on the DNA binding activities of both NF-κB and Oct-2 (lanes 6 and 10). These effects could not be attributed to clonal variation because the same pattern of repression was observed in multiple clones derived from three independent pre-B cell lines (Ref. 11Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Bendall H.H. Zhang G.M. Ballard D.W. Oltz E.M. Immunity. 1996; 5: 563-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar and data not shown). These findings strongly suggest that the induction of Oct-2 DNA binding activity by LPS requires deployment of NF-κB to the nuclear compartment. In contrast to NF-κB, which is activated by a post-translational mechanism (7Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 8Baeuerle P. Baltimore D. Science. 1988; 242: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar), Oct-2 is regulated primarily at the level of transcription (14Miller C.L. Feldhaus A.L. Rooney L.D. Sibley C.H. Singh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the transcription factors that regulate Oct-2 gene expression have not been defined. To determine whether NF-κB stimulates transcription from the Oct-2 gene, we monitored the amount of Oct-2 mRNA in control and NF-κB-arrested pre-B cells. As shown in Fig. 4, LPS induced high levels of Oct-2 messages in transfectants lacking ectopic IκB (lanes 2 and 8) and in transfectants expressing wild type IκBα (lane 4). In contrast, the induction of Oct-2 transcripts by LPS was completely blocked in cells arrested for NF-κB expression (lanes 6 and 10). These inhibitory effects were highly specific for Oct-2, because IκBΔN failed to perturb the expression of Oct-1 (Fig. 3) and OBF-1 (Fig. 4). We conclude that induction of the Oct-2 gene in these pre-B cell lines is contingent upon the activation of NF-κB. In summary, we have found that NF-κB is required for transcriptional activation of the Oct-2 gene in transformed pre-B lymphocytes. Similar results were obtained with conditionally transformed pre-B cells, thus providing further evidence that this transcription factor relationship is physiologically relevant (data not shown; see Ref. 22Chen Y.-Y. Wang L.C. Huang M.S. Rosenberg N. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 688-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The finding that NF-κB and Oct-2 are functionally coupled has several important implications. First, although effects of NF-κB on Oct-2 mRNA stability cannot be excluded, the data presented in this report suggest that the Oct-2 promoter contains one or more functional NF-κB binding sites. Consistent with this, recent studies have identified κB sites within the transcriptional control elements that regulate Oct-2 gene expression. 2H. Singh, personal communication. Second, a hallmark feature of mature B cells is their constitutive expression of both Oct-2 and NF-κB. The contingent mechanism described here may account for this unique pattern of transcription factor activity. Third, prior studies with mice deficient for either Oct-2 (6Corcoran L.M. Karvelas M. Nossal G.J.V. Ye Z.-Y. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 570-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) or specific subunits of NF-κB (15Sha W.C. Liou H.-C. Tuomanen E.I. Baltimore D.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1965-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) exhibit similar defects in B cell activation. In light of our results, the proliferative defects manifest in NF-κB-deficient B cells may reflect, at least in part, the concomitant loss of inducible Oct-2 activity. We thank T.

Normally, SAA is expressed at an undetectable level, but infection, tissue injury, or even a prolonged high fat diet can highly induce the synthesis of this protein (1Kushner I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 389: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar, 2Liao F. Andalibi A. Qiao J.H. Allayee H. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin.

SAA synthesized in various cell types (liver being the major source), circulates as constituents of high density lipoprotein (HDL). Whereas HDL of a normal healthy individual may contain negligible amount of SAA, under inflammatory conditions, concentration of SAA in HDL can rise significantly and at the peak of inflammation may constitute up to 80% of total HDL protein. Recent studies have suggested that SAA may alter lipid metabolism because: (i) SAA has the ability to displace apoA1 protein from HDL (4Coetzee G.A. Strachan A.F. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C.

Puchois P. Fruchart J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).SAA is a well conserved protein among various species. In mammals, SAA comprises multiple isoforms and is coded by multiple genes. Increase of SAA biosynthesis is due primarily to its increased transcription (9Lowell C.A. Potter D.A. Stearman R.S. Morrow J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8442-8452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional induction, several reports have indicated that mRNA stability also contributes to the enhanced expression of SAA in mouse (10Rienhoff H.Y. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3710-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and human (11Jiang S.L. Lozanski G. Samols D. Kushner I. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 825-831PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lozanski G. Jiang S.L. Samols D. Kushner I. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 534-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that C/EBP and NF-κB are involved in regulating SAA gene expression in human (13Betts J.C. Chesire J.K. Akira S. Kishimoto T. Woo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25624-25631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mouse (14Huang J.H. Liao W.S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4475-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), rat (15Li X. Liao W.S.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and rabbit (16Ray A. Ray B.K. Gene Expr. 1993; 3: 151-162PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ray A. Hannink M. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7365-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Recently, a new promoter called SAA-activating sequence (SAS) is identified to control expression of a rabbit SAA gene in some nonhepatic cells (19Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By promoter function analysis, we previously showed that SAS promoter element can regulate LPS-mediated SAA gene induction in monocyte/macrophage cells (20Ray B.K. Ray A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4662-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This study, however, did not reveal whether the SAS-binding factor (SAF) is directly involved in potentiating SAA transcription. In the present study, we have used a cloned cDNA of SAF transcription factor 2B. K. Ray and A. Ray, manuscript in preparation.2B. K. Ray and A. Ray, manuscript in preparation. and have shown that transient overexpression of SAF can activate a rabbit SAA2 gene promoter in monocyte/macrophage cells. We also present evidence for heteromeric complex formation between SAF and Sp1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooperative interaction between SAF and Sp1 synergistically activates SAA gene expression through the SAS element.DISCUSSIONSAA, a member of the acute phase protein group is gaining more attention in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis because recent studies have suggested that SAA, by displacing apoA1 from HDL, is capable of affecting lipoprotein metabolism (4Coetzee G.A. Strachan A.F. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, SAA is found to be a constituent of the atherosclerotic lesions (29Meek R.L. Urieli-Shoval S. Benditt E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), which is composed of macrophage-derived foam cells. In an effort to control the SAA production as a therapeutic measure against pathophysiological inflammatory conditions, we undertook this investigation. The mechanism of SAA gene induction was studied, particularly in monocyte/macrophage cells, which play a key role in atherogenesis. In this report we have shown that SAF, a zinc finger transcription factor is involved in the regulation of SAA induction in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells. Also, we provide evidence for physical and functional interactions between the transcription factors SAF and Sp1 that have a synergistic transactivating ability on SAS promoter.SAS promoter containing −280 to −226 base pairs sequences of SAA gene is induced in response to LPS treatment of THP-1 cells. SAF has been found to interact with this element, and this protein was detected in both hepatic and several nonhepatic cells (19Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Ray B.K. Ray A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4662-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand whether such interaction of SAF with SAS element results in transcriptional induction, we have studied the transactivation potential of a cloned SAF gene on a reporter gene carrying a SAS element. Increasing reporter CAT activity as more of the SAF cDNA is included in the cotransfection assay (Fig. 1) confirmed that SAA gene induction through SAS promoter is indeed regulated by SAF. Consistent with the ability of SAF to induce expression via the SAS element, an increase of the DNA binding ability of SAF in response to LPS-treatment was seen (Figs. 2 and 3). Although control THP-1 cells contain a low level of SAF, our results indicate that such a low level of SAF may not be sufficient to promote SAA gene expression.We have also assessed the functional consequence of SAF and Sp1 interaction on SAA gene induction. SAF is a zinc finger transcription factor containing six zinc finger motifs. Although SAF and Sp1 both contain zinc finger domains, SAF is structurally different from Sp1 and from three of its family members, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. Sp1 alone does not interact very efficiently with the SAS promoter but forms a stable heteromeric SAF-Sp1 complex with SAS DNA. In fact, in vitroDNA-binding studies suggested that SAF-Sp1 heteromeric complex is more favorably formed than the SAF- or Sp1-specific complex (Figs. 4 and 5). We also noticed that SAF-Sp1 heteromer has a higher affinity for the SAS element than the SAF alone (Fig. 2). The fact that complex a, which is composed of SAF-Sp1 heteromer, is readily competed by the SAS oligonucleotide, suggests that this complex has high affinity for SAS promoter sequence. In the competition assay, preincubation of nuclear extract with unlabeled SAS oligonucleotide allows virtually irreversible binding of only high affinity factors to the SAS oligonucleotide, thus making these factors unavailable for binding to radiolabeled SAS oligonucleotide, which is subsequently added in the assay mixture. Rapid sequestration of complex a by the competitor SAS oligonucleotide thus indicates high affinity binding for the involved factors. Because the level of SAA gene activation with combined SAF and Sp1 is much higher than that seen by these factors alone, this suggested that SAF-Sp1 heteromer is a superior transactivator of SAA than SAF or Sp1 alone. Accumulative evidence indicates that the cell-specific high level expression of a gene is achieved through the combined actions of a group of transcription factors. In fact, previous studies showed that under some inflammatory conditions NF-κB and C/EBP synergistically transactivate SAA expression (18Ray A. Hannink M. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7365-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Sp1 was recently shown to potentiate the transactivation role of GATA-1, a major erythroid transcription factor (30Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Sp1 potentiates SAF activity is not yet known. It is tempting to speculate that the SAF-Sp1 heteromeric complex establishes a stable contact with basal transcription initiation complex with the help of Sp1 when interacting with the SAS element via SAF. Indeed, the glutamine-rich activation domains of Sp1 were found to bind to a glutamine-rich domain of TAFII 110, which is a major protein component of basal transcription initiation complex (31Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 32Hoey T. Weinzieri R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and such interaction helps to mediate transcription activation possibly via conformational or covalent modification of the basal transcription complex (reviewed in Ref. 33Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). SAF-Sp1 interaction may play a critical role in this process where SAF via interacting with the SAS promoter of SAA gene recruits Sp1 to the vicinity of basal transcription complex formed at the TATA box and facilitates Sp1 interaction to TAFII 110.In summary, our data show that SAF activates SAA gene induction in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells. The in vivo biological consequence of the fact that SAF can functionally cooperate with Sp1, a ubiquitously present transcription factor, and synergistically transactivate SAA promoter remains to be determined.

Recently, a new promoter called SAA-activating sequence (SAS) is identified to control expression of a rabbit SAA gene in some nonhepatic cells (19Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). By promoter function analysis, we previously showed that SAS promoter element can regulate LPS-mediated SAA gene induction in monocyte/macrophage cells (20Ray B.K. Ray A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4662-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This study, however, did not reveal whether the SAS-binding factor (SAF) is directly involved in potentiating SAA transcription. In the present study, we have used a cloned cDNA of SAF transcription factor 2B. K. Ray and A. Ray, manuscript in preparation.2B. K. Ray and A. Ray, manuscript in preparation. and have shown that transient overexpression of SAF can activate a rabbit SAA2 gene promoter in monocyte/macrophage cells. We also present evidence for heteromeric complex formation between SAF and Sp1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooperative interaction between SAF and Sp1 synergistically activates SAA gene expression through the SAS element. DISCUSSIONSAA, a member of the acute phase protein group is gaining more attention in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis because recent studies have suggested that SAA, by displacing apoA1 from HDL, is capable of affecting lipoprotein metabolism (4Coetzee G.A. Strachan A.F. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Hoppe H.C. Jeenah M.S. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9644-9651Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, SAA is found to be a constituent of the atherosclerotic lesions (29Meek R.L. Urieli-Shoval S. Benditt E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), which is composed of macrophage-derived foam cells. In an effort to control the SAA production as a therapeutic measure against pathophysiological inflammatory conditions, we undertook this investigation. The mechanism of SAA gene induction was studied, particularly in monocyte/macrophage cells, which play a key role in atherogenesis. In this report we have shown that SAF, a zinc finger transcription factor is involved in the regulation of SAA induction in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells. Also, we provide evidence for physical and functional interactions between the transcription factors SAF and Sp1 that have a synergistic transactivating ability on SAS promoter.SAS promoter containing −280 to −226 base pairs sequences of SAA gene is induced in response to LPS treatment of THP-1 cells. SAF has been found to interact with this element, and this protein was detected in both hepatic and several nonhepatic cells (19Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Ray B.K. Ray A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4662-4668Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand whether such interaction of SAF with SAS element results in transcriptional induction, we have studied the transactivation potential of a cloned SAF gene on a reporter gene carrying a SAS element. Increasing reporter CAT activity as more of the SAF cDNA is included in the cotransfection assay (Fig. 1) confirmed that SAA gene induction through SAS promoter is indeed regulated by SAF. Consistent with the ability of SAF to induce expression via the SAS element, an increase of the DNA binding ability of SAF in response to LPS-treatment was seen (Figs. 2 and 3). Although control THP-1 cells contain a low level of SAF, our results indicate that such a low level of SAF may not be sufficient to promote SAA gene expression.We have also assessed the functional consequence of SAF and Sp1 interaction on SAA gene induction. SAF is a zinc finger transcription factor containing six zinc finger motifs. Although SAF and Sp1 both contain zinc finger domains, SAF is structurally different from Sp1 and from three of its family members, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. Sp1 alone does not interact very efficiently with the SAS promoter but forms a stable heteromeric SAF-Sp1 complex with SAS DNA. In fact, in vitroDNA-binding studies suggested that SAF-Sp1 heteromeric complex is more favorably formed than the SAF- or Sp1-specific complex (Figs. 4 and 5). We also noticed that SAF-Sp1 heteromer has a higher affinity for the SAS element than the SAF alone (Fig. 2). The fact that complex a, which is composed of SAF-Sp1 heteromer, is readily competed by the SAS oligonucleotide, suggests that this complex has high affinity for SAS promoter sequence. In the competition assay, preincubation of nuclear extract with unlabeled SAS oligonucleotide allows virtually irreversible binding of only high affinity factors to the SAS oligonucleotide, thus making these factors unavailable for binding to radiolabeled SAS oligonucleotide, which is subsequently added in the assay mixture. Rapid sequestration of complex a by the competitor SAS oligonucleotide thus indicates high affinity binding for the involved factors. Because the level of SAA gene activation with combined SAF and Sp1 is much higher than that seen by these factors alone, this suggested that SAF-Sp1 heteromer is a superior transactivator of SAA than SAF or Sp1 alone. Accumulative evidence indicates that the cell-specific high level expression of a gene is achieved through the combined actions of a group of transcription factors. In fact, previous studies showed that under some inflammatory conditions NF-κB and C/EBP synergistically transactivate SAA expression (18Ray A. Hannink M. Ray B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7365-7374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Sp1 was recently shown to potentiate the transactivation role of GATA-1, a major erythroid transcription factor (30Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Sp1 potentiates SAF activity is not yet known. It is tempting to speculate that the SAF-Sp1 heteromeric complex establishes a stable contact with basal transcription initiation complex with the help of Sp1 when interacting with the SAS element via SAF. Indeed, the glutamine-rich activation domains of Sp1 were found to bind to a glutamine-rich domain of TAFII 110, which is a major protein component of basal transcription initiation complex (31Gill G. Pascal E. Tseng Z. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 32Hoey T. Weinzieri R.O.J. Gill G. Chen J.-L. Dynlacht B.D. Tjian R. Cell. 1993; 72: 247-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), and such interaction helps to mediate transcription activation possibly via conformational or covalent modification of the basal transcription complex (reviewed in Ref. 33Goodrich J.A. Cutler G. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 84: 825-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). SAF-Sp1 interaction may play a critical role in this process where SAF via interacting with the SAS promoter of SAA gene recruits Sp1 to the vicinity of basal transcription complex formed at the TATA box and facilitates Sp1 interaction to TAFII 110.In summary, our data show that SAF activates SAA gene induction in THP-1 monocyte/macrophage cells. The in vivo biological consequence of the fact that SAF can functionally cooperate with Sp1, a ubiquitously present transcription factor, and synergistically transactivate SAA promoter remains to be determined.

During resumption of development the charging level of transfer RNAs increases, concomitant with the activation of protein synthesis. The total level of charging rises dramatically from an average of 4% to 50% within a period of 24 h of development. The restriction ofin vitro translation of the quiescent embryo extract can be partially released by the addition of chargedaminoacyl-tRNA, which apparently starts the flow of ribosomes into polyribosome structures. Complete reactivation of translation by aminoacyl-tRNA occurs when mRNA from preformed mRNA-ribosome complexes, like the polyribosomes extracted from developing embryos or poly(U)-programmed ribosomes, are offered to quiescent embryo extracts. With respect to the mechanism of in vivo recharging of tRNAs, we observed that the level of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases increase during development. Methionyl-tRNA synthetase rises more than 10-fold. In the case of valyl-tRNA synthetase, the activation is lower and shown to be due to the de novo synthesis of its mRNA and the corresponding protein product as well. We conclude that protein synthesis and thereby the gradual animation of cryptobiotic Artemia embryos is determined to a large extent by the rate by which aminoacyl-tRNAs are replenished during development at both the initiation andelongation level.

Multicellular organisms like the crustacean Artemia can survive long periods of environmental stress by entering a cryptobiotic stage (see Refs. 1Clegg J.S. Conte F.P. Persoone G. Sorgeloos P.

In both cases, the rate of protein synthesis is reduced to a low level and its reactivation is a prerequisite for the cells to re-enter the cell cycle (5Golub A. Clegg J.S. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Thomas G. Gordon J. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1979; 3: 307-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For a better understanding of the processes that determine cell growth and division, it is important to know how protein synthesis can be regulated. Upon re-immersion of the quiescent dehydrated Artemia embryo in sea water, development quickly resumes. After a defined period of pre-emergence development, a free-swimming nauplius with distinct morphological features emerges from its shell. At the start of this period, protein synthesis and transcription resume quickly, both occurring in the absence of DNA synthesis or cell division (1Clegg J.S. Conte F.P. Persoone G. Sorgeloos P. Roels O. Jaspers E. The Brine Shrimp Artemia. 2. Universa Press, Wetteren, Belgium1980: 11-54Google Scholar, 7Möller W. Amons R. Janssen G. Lenstra J.A. Maassen J.A. Decleir W. Moens L. Slegers H.

After 30 years of research on the re-activation of translation inArtemia, it is clear that quiescent and developing embryos contain approximately equal amounts of ribosomes (8Kenmochi N. Takahashi Y. Ogata K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), mRNA (9Grosfeld H. Littauer U.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), initiation factors (10Macrae T.H. Roychowdhury M. Houston K.J. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), elongation factors (11.Janssen, G. M. C. (1994) Elongation Factor 1 from Artemia; Structure, Function and Its Regulation during Protein Synthesis. Ph.D. thesis, Leiden University, The Netherlands.Google Scholar), and termination factors (12Reddington M.A. Fong A.P. Tate W.P. Dev. Biol. 1978; 63: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which are all equally active in in vitrotranslation assays. At the onset of development, a slow but definite shift from 80 S ribosomes to polysomes can be observed (5Golub A. Clegg J.S. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Hultin T. Morris J.E. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, extracts from quiescent embryos are inactive in translation of their endogenous mRNAs (14Moreno A. Mendez R. De Haro C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This paradox has led several investigators to search for specific inhibitors and activators of translation in extracts from non-developing and developing embryos, respectively (15Lee-Huang S. Sierra J.M. Naranjo R. Filipowicz W. Ochoa S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Until now, none of these approaches has provided a definite answer. Since ribosomes, factors, and mRNAs appear to be normal in the quiescent embryo, we have explored the level of charged tRNA during development. Although the amount of tRNA as such does not change significantly during development (16Bagshaw J.C. Finamore F.J. Novelli G.D. Dev. Biol. 1970; 23: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the degree of tRNA aminoacylation has until now received little attention. The results of such studies are presented here. Dried Artemia embryos (San Francisco Bay Brand Inc., San Francisco, CA) were washed with 2% NaOCl as described (17Janssen G.M.C. Maassen J.A. Möller W. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 51-68Google Scholar) and either used directly (quiescent embryos) or cultured for the time indicated in aerated artificial sea water at 27 °C (developing embryos). Under these conditions, approximately 80% of the embryos emerge from their shells within 20 h. Dried embryos (25 g) were cultured for the time indicated and washed with distilled water and 50 mm NaAc, pH 4.5, 150 mm NaCl. The volume was adjusted to 75 ml with the same buffer, 50 ml of phenol (saturated with the same buffer) was added, and this mixture was homogenized three times for 45 s with a Polytron homogenizer. Upon centrifugation for 12 min at 3000 × g in a Beckman JA 10 rotor, the aqueous (upper) phase was extracted two more times with the same amount of acidic phenol. RNA from the final upper phase was precipitated with ethanol (18$$Google Scholar). The dried pellet was dissolved in 15 ml of 10 mm NaAc, pH 4.5, and lithium chloride was added to a concentration of 0.8 m, followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 9000 × g in a Sorvall SS 34 rotor. The tRNA present in the supernatant was reprecipitated with ethanol and then dissolved in 5 mm NaAc, pH 4.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Complete separation of tRNA from rRNA was achieved by gel filtration on a Superose 12 FPLC column in the same buffer. The tRNA eluting at the position of tRNA from brewers' yeast (Boehringer Mannheim) was pooled and reprecipitated with ethanol. The dried pellets were dissolved in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.5, and A 260 was measured. Samples containing 200 μg (3.7 A 260 units) of tRNA were adjusted to pH 8 by addition of ammonium carbonate, pH 8, to 100 mm and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C to achieve the complete deacylation of aminoacyl-tRNA (19Tockman J. Vold B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Released amino acids were separated from tRNA by ultrafiltration (Microcon-3, Amicon), modified by dimethylaminoazobenzene sulfonyl chloride treatment, separated by reverse phase chromatography on a C18 high performance liquid chromatography column (100RP18e, Merck) and quantified at 436 nm by comparison to known amounts of amino acids (20Knecht R. Chang J. Wittmann-Liebold B. Salnikow J. Erdmann V.A. Advanced Methods in Protein Microsequence Analysis. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1986: 56-61Crossref Google Scholar). When the tRNA samples were incubated at pH 4.5 instead of 8, no significant amount of amino acid was found in the ultrafiltrate, indicating that our tRNA preparations are essentially devoid of contaminating free amino acids. Cell-free extracts from quiescent and developing Artemia embryos were prepared precisely as described in Ref. 14Moreno A. Mendez R. De Haro C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar. These extracts, referred to as “embryo lysate,” were used as such only for the in vitrotranslation experiments of Fig. 1. In the other experiments, the endogenous amino acid and nucleotide pools were removed from these extracts by passage of 2 ml of embryo lysate through a G-25 column (20 ml), previously equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 6 mm DTE, 1The abbreviations used are: DTE, dithioerythritol; ValRS, valyl-tRNA synthetase; poly(U), poly(uridylic acid). and 10% glycerol. Void-volume fractions, termed S30 extract, were pooled and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The 100,000 × gsupernatant (S100) and 0.5 m KCl-washed (poly)ribosomal fraction as used in Fig. 4 were obtained from S30 extracts as described (17Janssen G.M.C. Maassen J.A. Möller W. Spedding G.

A, in vitro protein synthesis on endogenous mRNAs by S30 extracts (30 μg of protein per 7 μl) of quiescent (○) and 20-h developing (•) embryos with the separate substrates, amino acids (35 μm each, except 10 μm[3H]Val) and uncharged tRNA (2.5 μg). B, the same as in A except that fully charged aminoacyl-tRNA (2.5 μg; labeled with [3H]Val) was used instead of the separate substrates. C, the same as in A except that S100 (17.5 μg of protein) was used instead of S30, together with the purified ribosomes (15 μg of protein) from developing embryos.D, the same as in C except that fully charged aminoacyl-tRNA (2.5 μg; labeled with [3H]Val) was used instead of the separate substrates. Since during S100 preparation the protein concentration decreased from ∼30 mg/ml in S30 to ∼17.5 mg/ml in S100, the amount of S100 protein was reduced proportionally. Assays were optimized with respect to the amount of ribosomes required. Initial rates were calculated from the data of the first 15 min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Aminoacyl-tRNA from developing embryos was first deacylated as described above and separated from released amino acids by gel filtration on Superose 12. Next, 1 mg of the deacylated tRNA was recharged by an incubation for 12 min at 27 °C in 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm Mg2Cl, 150 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTE, 3 mm ATP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 25 units of creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mm each amino acid, and in the presence of 400 μg of S100 protein from developing embryos and 200 μCi of [3H]Val. The aminoacyl-tRNAs were re-extracted with phenol as described (17Janssen G.M.C. Maassen J.A. Möller W. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 51-68Google Scholar) and purified by gel filtration on Superose 12. Judged from the [3H]Val incorporation of 1.09 nmol of Val/20.8 nmol of tRNA, each tRNA species was assumed to be fully charged with its cognate amino acid. The rate of in vitrotranslation was measured in an assay (40 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1.25 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm DTE, 0.2 mm both GTP and ATP, 500 units/ml RNasin (Promega), 10 mm phosphocreatine, 25 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Boehringer Mannheim), 3 μCi ofl-[3,4-3H]Val (specific radioactivity 10 Ci/mmol; Amersham), unlabeled l-amino acids (35 μm each, except Val), and extract as indicated in the legends for Figs. 1 and 4 (14Moreno A. Mendez R. De Haro C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed at 27 °C, and at indicated times, 7-μl aliquots were withdrawn, immediately added to 150 μl of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and heated for 15 min at 95 °C. The precipitate was collected on a glass fiber filter (GF/C; Whatman) and washed with three 2-ml aliquots of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The filter was dried at 95 °C (30 min) and its radioactivity measured in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. Conditions for globin synthesis were the same, except for the following. Globin mRNA (2.5 μg; Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to micrococcal nuclease-treated extracts (see below), and the complete reaction mixture (40 μl) was processed to determine the incorporation of [3H]Val into protein. Incorporation was found to be time-dependent and globin mRNA concentration-dependent with an optimum at 2.5 μg of globin mRNA. Poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis was adapted from (21Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Moldave K. RNA and Protein Synthesis. Academic Press, New York1981: 435-454Crossref Google Scholar). To remove the endogenous mRNA pool completely, S30 extracts (30 μl) were first treated for 15 min at 20 °C with 1 unit of micrococcal nuclease (Pharmacia) in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. The nuclease was then inactivated by the addition of EGTA to a final concentration of 3 mm. Poly(Phe) synthesis was performed in a reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mmpotassium acetate, 1.25 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm spermidine, 0.2 mm DTE, 0.2 mmboth GTP and ATP, 500 units/ml RNasin (Promega), 10 mmphosphocreatine, 25 units/ml creatine phosphokinase (Boehringer), 5A 260 units of poly(U)-programmed 80 S ribosomes from Artemia quiescent embryos (21Iwasaki K. Kaziro Y. Moldave K. RNA and Protein Synthesis. Academic Press, New York1981: 435-454Crossref Google Scholar), and nuclease-treated extract (20 μg of protein). The labeled compound was eitherArtemia [3H]Phe-tRNA (40 pmol; 850 cpm/pmol), previously labeled with l-[2,3,4,5,6-3H]Phe using extract from developing embryos as a source of phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase and reisolated as described (17Janssen G.M.C. Maassen J.A. Möller W. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 51-68Google Scholar), or 3 μCi ofl-[2,3,4,5,6-3H]Phe (specific radioactivity 10 Ci/mmol, Amersham) together with deacylated tRNA from developingArtemia embryos (40 pmol). Reactions were performed at 27 °C, and 7-μl aliquots were withdrawn at specified times and processed as described above. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity was measured as described (22Brandsma M. Kerjan P. Dijk J. Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Kellermann O. Viel C. Waller J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The amount of ValRS in extracts was analyzed by Western blotting, using an antiserum against Artemia ValRS (22Brandsma M. Kerjan P. Dijk J. Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). The amount of ValRS mRNA was determined by Northern blotting, using a ValRS-specific cDNA probe, prepared by polymerase chain reaction and standard cloning techniques (18$$Google Scholar). Elongation factor-1α-dependent binding of [3H]Phe-tRNA to poly(U)-programmed 80 S ribosomes was performed as a control in the same extracts as described (17Janssen G.M.C. Maassen J.A. Möller W. Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis. Oxford University Press, New York1990: 51-68Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Lowry et al. (25Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of in vitro translation of endogenous mRNAs is low in quiescent embryo extracts, but increases strongly throughout pre-emergence development (Fig.1 A). In Fig. 1 B, the time courses of [3H]Val incorporation into protein by extracts prepared from quiescent and 20-h developing embryos are compared. The latter exhibits a fairly steep incorporation throughout the whole incubation period, which is in excellent agreement with the results of De Haro's group, where [35S]Met was used as a label (14Moreno A. Mendez R. De Haro C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The incorporation of [3H]Phe and [3H]Leu into protein proceeds at a comparable rate. Concerning the nature of the process of reactivation of protein synthesis in Artemia, translational repressors and activators have been postulated to be present in quiescent and developing embryos, respectively (15Lee-Huang S. Sierra J.M. Naranjo R. Filipowicz W. Ochoa S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, when we mixed extracts prepared from quiescent and 20-h developing embryos in different ratios, we did not observe any effect of the extract from quiescent embryos on the translational activity of that of the developing embryos, nor the reverse. In fact, the extract prepared from quiescent embryos behaves as a buffer (Fig. 1 C). Thus, our results do not indicate the presence of a strong translational repressor in the quiescent nor an activator in the developing embryo, but rather suggest a shortage of one or several active translational components, which gradually get replenished during development of the quiescent embryo. We used direct amino acid analysis on purified aminoacyl-tRNA to determine the degree of in vivo aminoacylation. The purification procedure includes homogenization of embryos in phenol at pH 4.5 to prevent deacylation, isolation of total RNA, followed by precipitation with lithium chloride to remove the major part of rRNA (26Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2084) Google Scholar), and final purification of tRNA by gel filtration (see also Ref. 19Tockman J. Vold B.S. J. Bacteriol. 1977; 130: 1091-1097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with the method of periodate oxidation, the major advantage of this procedure is that the charging degree of all 20 different tRNA species can be assessed in a single experiment. Neither the total yield of tRNA nor the ratio of tRNA to rRNA changed significantly during development. The average yield of 4.4 ± 0.8 mg (n = 6) tRNA/25 g of dried embryos is in the expected order when considering the EF-1α content of 22 mg/25 g of embryos (27Janssen G.M.C. van Damme H.T.F. Kriek J. Amons R. Möller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31410-31417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and assuming equal molar amounts of EF-1α and tRNA present in Artemia (28Moldave K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1109-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Moreover, the amino acid acceptance of tRNA prepared from quiescent and 20-h developing embryos was the same for valine, leucine, lysine, phenylalanine, and glycine, when using nauplius S100 as a source of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. In the case of valine, both tRNA pools could be charged to a maximum of 2.7% of the total tRNA pool by purified ValRS from Artemia (22Brandsma M. Kerjan P. Dijk J. Janssen G.M.C. Möller W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Under the assumption that tRNAVal represents 5% of the total tRNA pool, this indicates that at least half of the valine-accepting ends are intact, both in quiescent and developing embryos. We conclude that neither the total amount of tRNA nor its processing is significantly elevated during development. As seen from Fig. 2, there is a dramatic increase in the charging degree of each of the 20 tRNA-species during the first 20 h of development, from an average of 4 ± 4% (n = 3) in quiescent to 52 ± 3% (n = 2) in 20-h developing embryos. The mutual relationship between the charging degree of tRNA and the rate of translation is obvious, especially when taking into account that more than half of the 20 different tRNA species are not charged at all in the quiescent embryo (detection limit 2% charging). However, not all tRNAs appear to be recharged in concert. After 1 h, tRNAGlu already shows 40% charging, whereas tRNATrp after this time hardly carries any amino acid (Fig.2). Therefore, some aminoacyl-tRNA species may clearly contribute more to the repression of overall protein synthesis in quiescent embryo lysates than others. On the whole, the results of Figs. 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate a positive correlation between the capacity for protein synthesis and the degree of tRNA aminoacylation, and therefore support a model in which the arrest of translation in quiescentArtemia embryos is based on a shortage of its natural substrate, aminoacyl-tRNA. Whether the observed paucity of aminoacyl-tRNA actually restricts elongation can be determined experimentally by using the poly(U)-directed poly(phenylalanine) synthesis assay. The flow of [3H]phenylalanine into poly ([3H]phenylalanine) may be represented by two subsequent reactions (Reaction 1).[3H]Phe+tRNA⇄Phe-tRNA synthetase[3H]Phe-tRNA⇄elongation factorspoly([3H]Phe+tRNA)Reaction 1 When the substrates [3H]Phe and uncharged tRNA are added separately, the rate of poly(Phe) synthesis is expected to depend on the amounts of elongation factors and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase present in the extracts. In this case, the activity of the quiescent embryo extract is found to be about 2.5-fold lower than that of the developing embryo extract (Fig.3 A). However, when charged [3H]Phe-tRNA is used instead of [3H]Phe and tRNA, the difference in poly(Phe) synthesis between quiescent and developing embryo extracts disappears completely (Fig. 3 B). The results of Fig. 3 B indicate that elongation factors 1 and 2 are equally active in quiescent and developing embryos. We conclude that a shortage of charged phenylalanyl-tRNA limits the elongation phase of protein synthesis in extracts of quiescent embryos, at least under the direction of a synthetic messenger. The extent to which total cell-free protein synthesis of endogenous mRNA is limited by the shortage of aminoacyl-tRNAs was assessed as follows. In the presence of the two separate substrates, amino acids and total tRNA, the rate of protein synthesis in the quiescent embryo extract is about 16 times lower as that observed in the developing embryo, i.e. the relative rate is 6.4 ± 1.3% (mean ± S.D., n = 3) (Fig.4 A). Addition of the full complement of aminoacyl-tRNAs, however, markedly enhanced in vitro protein synthesis of the quiescent embryo from a relative rate of 6.4 ± 1.3% to a relative rate of 23.6 ± 1.2% (Fig. 4 B). This proves that a paucity of charged aminoacyl-tRNA significantly limits protein synthesis in extracts of the quiescent embryo. Since protein synthesis could not be further stimulated by up to 20 μm aminoacyl-tRNAs, a second restriction in translation of available mRNAs appears to be present in the quiescent embryo. Note that the level of mRNAs is comparable in both types of embryo extracts (9Grosfeld H. Littauer U.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a first attempt, we fractionated the quiescent and developing embryo extracts into the cytosolic (S100), polyribosomal, and ribosomal wash fraction. Interestingly, the purified polyribosomal fraction of developing embryos was quite effective in stimulating protein synthesis of the quiescent embryo extract (S30), while the other fractions, including the ribosomes from quiescent embryos, were not. In fact, the polyribosomes from developing embryos activate protein synthesis of the quiescent embryo S100 to a relative rate 23.4 ± 1.6% of that of the developing embryo S100 (Fig.4 C). Ultimately, the further addition of fully charged aminoacyl-tRNAs completely restored protein synthesis in the extract of the quiescent embryo to the level of the developed embryo (Fig.4 D). Moreover, the ribosomal wash fractions, which contained large amounts of initiation factors (10Macrae T.H. Roychowdhury M. Houston K.J. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were without effect, thus indicating that they were not rate-limiting. As shown previously by others, initiation factor eIF-2 was found to remain constant in amount and activity during development (10Macrae T.H. Roychowdhury M. Houston K.J. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A substantial effect of charged tRNAs was also seen on the translation of globin mRNA by the quiescent embryo extract. Addition of the full complement of aminoacyl-tRNAs to RNase-treated extracts of the quiescent embryo raises the synthesis of globin from a relative rate of 34 ± 8% to a relative rate of 76 ± 10%. Absolute values, however, were an order of magnitude less than those observed with polyribosomes in the two types of extract. This was also the case with translation of poly(A)+ mRNAs extracted from the developing embryo, indicating that “naked” mRNA is a poor substrate for translation by the quiescent and the developing embryo extract as well. We conclude, therefore, that during the development ofArtemia embryos, protein synthesis is activated by the recharging of aminoacyl-tRNAs, but due to the virtual absence of polyribosomes in the quiescent embryo (1Clegg J.S. Conte F.P. Persoone G. Sorgeloos P. Roels O. Jaspers E. The Brine Shrimp Artemia. 2. Universa Press, Wetteren, Belgium1980: 11-54Google Scholar, 5Golub A. Clegg J.S. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Hultin T. Morris J.E. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the rate of protein synthesis remains lower than in the developing embryo. Upon rehydration of the quiescent embryos, tRNA may be recharged by its cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase as present at this stage. However, the low degree of charging of most of the tRNAs even after 1 h of development (Fig. 2) indicates a severe limitation in the supply of aminoacyl-tRNAs. Apparently, the aminoacylation reaction is limited by one or more of its reacting components.aa+tRNA+ATP⇄aminoacyl­tRNA synthetaseaa­tRNA+AMP+PPiREACTION2The tRNA pool of the quiescent embryo itself appears to be comparable to that of the developing embryo (this study and Ref. 16Bagshaw J.C. Finamore F.J. Novelli G.D. Dev. Biol. 1970; 23: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The level of endogenous amino acids rises only about 2-fold (Ref. 1Clegg J.S. Conte F.P. Persoone G. Sorgeloos P. Roels O. Jaspers E. The Brine Shrimp Artemia. 2. Universa Press, Wetteren, Belgium1980: 11-54Google Scholar and our own observations), while the ATP concentration is cited to increase 7-fold during development (29Finnamore Clegg Padilla G.M. Whitson G.L. Cameron I.L. The Cell Cycle. Academic Press, New York1969: 249-278Crossref Google Scholar). However, the shortage of ATP by itself is not responsible for the inhibition of translation, since we found that the addition of ATP up to 1 mm does not restore protein synthesis in quiescent embryo extracts. Therefore, we investigated instead the behavior of three selected aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, all of which were found to rise during the first 20 h of development, i.e. valyl- and lysyl-tRNA synthetase by a factor of about 2, while methionyl-tRNA synthetase increased more than 10-fold (Table I). Elongation factor-1α activity, which was measured as a control, remained constant.Table IAminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activities in extracts of quiescent and developing embryosAminoacyl-tRNA synthetase specific forSpecific activity1-aSpecific activities were calculated from the linear region of concentration-dependent plots obtained with extracts of quiescent and 20-h developing embryo, incubated for 10 min at 25 °C in the presence of 3.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA and 3H-labeled amino acid.

Open table in a new tab It is generally agreed that the rate-limiting steps in protein synthesis lies at the level of initiation (30Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). The same situation does not necessarily prevail to reactivate protein synthesis after a period of quiescence like in the brine shrimp Artemia. For instance, efforts to prove deficiencies in the initiation factors of quiescent embryos have been rather unconvincing (31Sierra J.M. Meier D. Ochoa S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2693-2697Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and levels of the initiation factor eIF-2 are found to be the same before and after development (10Macrae T.H. Roychowdhury M. Houston K.J. Woodley C.L. Wahba A.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 100: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Most characteristic of quiescent embryos, however, is the inactive form of its mRNAs and the slow reappearance of polysomes during development (9Grosfeld H. Littauer U.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Hultin T. Morris J.E. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, this by itself does not explain that the encapsulated embryo exhibits no protein synthesis unless resumption of development ensues. In this context, we have proven the absence of an inhibitor, although adequate levels of mRNAs are present in such extracts (9Grosfeld H. Littauer U.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). How protein synthesis is reactivated during development of Artemia has therefore remained a long-standing question (8Kenmochi N. Takahashi Y. Ogata K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 9Grosfeld H. Littauer U.Z. Eur. J.

Sierra J.M. Naranjo R. Filipowicz W. Ochoa S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that during the development of quiescent embryos into metabolically active embryos there is a dramatic increase in the level of tRNA aminoacylation. We also establish that the difference in protein synthesis capacity between extracts from quiescent and developing embryos can be completely abolished by solely adding fully charged aminoacyl-tRNA, together with the mixture of polyribosomes of developing embryos as an external source of translatable mRNA. Furthermore, we show by poly(U)-directed poly(Phe) synthesis that only the shortage of charged aminoacyl-tRNA restricts the elongation step of the quiescent embryo. In our opinion, our data prove for the first time that a shortage of charged aminoacyl-tRNA in combination with a low level of preformed polyribosomes is the cause of the extreme low rate of protein synthesis in extracts of the quiescent embryo. The question which immediately comes to mind is what regulates the charging of tRNAs in vivo during Artemiadevelopment? Rather than addressing here how the charging level of tRNAs have become low in the quiescent embryo, we focus on their reactivation after release from quiescence. Because we have shown that at least some of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, especially methionyl-tRNA synthetase, display an elevated activity in developing embryo lysates, they are prime candidates for the control of protein synthesis in Artemia. This immediately places the initiator tRNA in the limelight, and the shortage of charged initiator tRNAMet could explain the low fraction of ribosomes, present as polysomes in quiescent embryos (5Golub A. Clegg J.S. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Grosfeld H. Littauer U.Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Hultin T. Morris J.E. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In fact, we have found that the polyribosomal fraction from developing embryos contains about 3 times more poly(A)+ RNA than that of quiescent embryos, in agreement with the observed shift from monosomes to polysomes at the onset of development (5Golub A. Clegg J.S. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 644-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 13Hultin T. Morris J.E. Dev. Biol. 1968; 17: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that the observed activation of the quiescent embryo extract by the (poly)ribosomal fraction from developing embryos is largely due to the added (poly)ribosomal mRNAs rather than the endogenous mRNA. Together, these observations confirm that the mRNA from developing embryos is already loaded with ribosomes and translated as such by the quiescent embryo extract. Once the mRNA is initiated, the ribosomes elongate with a rate comparable to that in the developing embryo provided the restriction of charging of elongating tRNAs is released. It is known that phosphorylation is important in the regulation of the initiation step of protein synthesis (30Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), but so far the evidence for phosphorylation playing an important role in synthetase function has been less conclusive, at least for vertebrates (32Clemens M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 172-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We prefer to think that a deficiency in the absolute amount of these enzymes may be responsible for the low synthetase activity in quiescent embryo extracts, as is also the case in Bombyx mori (33Chang P.K. Dignam J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20898-20906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, at least for ValRS, we have found by Western blotting that the amount of the protein increases significantly during development with retention of its intrinsic specificity. Since Northern blot analysis also reveal that the level of ValRS mRNA markedly increases during development, the de novo synthesis of the ValRS enzyme may be attributed to enhanced transcription of the ValRS gene. It should be stressed that although the synthetase levels in quiescent embryos so far are substantial, apparently they are not high enough to recharge the pool of deacylated tRNAs within a period of minutes, as in rapidly growing Escherichia coli and the re-activated spores ofBacillus megaterium (34Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetase levels can never become zero in the quiescent embryo; they should be low enough to prevent full charging, but high enough to enable their own synthesis, because otherwise protein synthesis would be irreversibly arrested. Careful studies on the transcriptional regulation of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases during development are therefore indicated. The aminoacylation of tRNA appears to function as a sensor that regulates the biosynthesis of amino acids via transcription factor GCN4 in yeast (35Lanker S. Bushman J.L. Hinnebusch A.G. Trachsel H. Meuller P.P. Cell. 1992; 70: 647-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and also the transcription of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes in Gram-positive bacteria (36Henkin T.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 37Putzer H. Laalami S. Brakhage A.A. Condon C Grunberg-Manago M. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated here that protein synthesis itself is controlled at the level of tRNA charging during the natural development of a eukaryote. Interestingly, in bacterial spores, the level of tRNA charging is also very low and increases rapidly upon germination (34Setlow P. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 118: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, tRNAs specific for valine, arginine, and histidine are among the most significantly charged tRNAs in these spores, as also seems to be the case inArtemia embryos. Furthermore, studies on E. coliand mouse ascites tumor cells show that protein synthesis decreases when the charging degree of tRNAs is lowered on purpose (38Rojiani M.V. Jakubowski H. Goldman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1511-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 39Ogilvie A. Huschka U. Kersten W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 565: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation of tRNAs therefore appears to play a general regulatory role in escaping routes from dormancy and may also be important for instance in germination of plant seeds and perhaps also in the revival of G0-arrested vertebrate cells. Since the present day adaptor molecule, tRNA, is believed to have been of prime importance in the genesis of protein synthesis and life itself (40Crick F.H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 38: 367-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar), the regulation of protein synthesis may even have started at the level of tRNA aminoacylation, while fine tuning of mRNA expression at the level of ribosome-induced initiation and elongation events occurred later on in evolution.

Most of them are symports coupling the utilization of the proton gradient, built up by the H+-ATPase of the plasma membrane, to the uptake of different kinds of molecules (1Van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Purine-cytosine permease from S. cerevisiae is one of these plasma membrane carriers (3Weber E. Rodriguez C. Chevallier M.R. Jund R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Schmidt R. Manolson M.F. Chevallier M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6276-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In vivo, this permease seems to mediate the co-transport of proton and purine bases (adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine) or a pyrimidine base (cytosine) (5Polak A. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 32: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6Chevallier M.R. Jund R. Lacroute F. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 629-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the energy source of this active transport being the proton electrochemical gradient built up by the H+-ATPase (7Goffeau A. Slayman C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 639: 197-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 8Serrano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). By measuring simultaneously hypoxanthine uptake and H+and K+ fluxes, it has been proposed that purine translocation through the S. cerevisiae plasma membrane is an electroneutral base/H+ symport with a K+antiport (9Reichert U. Forêt M. FEBS Lett. 1977; 83: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, it has been proposed in other experiments carried out on a S. cerevisiae strain (lacking cytosine deaminase and overexpressing the purine-cytosine permease) in ATP-depletion conditions, that the pump works as an electrogenic proton symport (10Hopkins P. Chevallier M.R. Jund R. Eddy A.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 49: 173-177Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) with a H+/base stoichiometry close to 1 (11Hopkins P. Shaw R. Acik L. Oliver S. Eddy A.A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).In addition, studies have been carried on S. cerevisiaepurine-cytosine permease proficient strains carrying plasmid-encoded multiple copies of either wild type or mutated FCY2 gene, encoding the purine-cytosine permease. We have analyzed the effects of pH on in vivo uptake and in vitro equilibrium binding of nucleobases, and have shown a key role played by a protonable group of the permease for the solute binding step of the translocation process (12Brèthes D. Napias C. Torchut E. Chevallier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Mechanistic studies of solute uptake in whole cells cannot be analyzed in close detail for the following reasons: (a) inside the cell, the solute can be rapidly metabolized obscuring the characteristics of the uptake; (b) since the ionic content of the cytoplasm cannot be controlled, no specific study of the influence of ionic fluxes on solute transport can be performed. However, it is possible to analyze the transport in a well defined medium with an in vitro system obtained by membrane fusion between plasma membrane fractions and proteoliposomes containing a so-called “energy-producing system.” Such a system that generates a proton-motive force has been widely used for the study of various transport systems in bacteria (13Driessen A.J.M. De Vrij W. Konings W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7555-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and of some carriers of yeast plasma membrane (for a review, see Ref. 1Van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In this study, we have used this technique to analyze the energetics of the transport catalyzed by the purine-cytosine permease of the plasma membrane of S. cerevisiae. Cytosine uptake has been analyzed in artificial vesicles obtained by fusion between proteoliposomes containing beef heart cytochrome c oxidase and plasma membrane-enriched fractions of a S. cerevisiae strain overexpressing the permease. Several properties of the transport system, which were difficult to assess in whole cells, have been characterized with these hybrid vesicles. With this system, it is demonstrated that the purine-cytosine permease is a secondary active transport driven only by the ΔpH component of the proton-motive force. In addition, it is shown that the rate of uptake increases when the internal pH is more alkaline, and that the carrier is able to fully exchange cytosine at the steady state of accumulation. The influence of the phospholipid environment on the uptake is also investigated.DISCUSSIONIn this report, cytosine transport was analyzed in artificial energizable vesicles obtained by fusion of plasma membrane-enriched fractions of S. cerevisiae containing the purine-cytosine permease and proteoliposomes containing cytochrome coxidase. CL-PMV displayed an internal volume value very similar to that already obtained by other methods (19Van Leeuwen C.C.M. Postma E. Van den Broek P.J.A. Van Steveninck J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12146-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Opekarová M. Caspari T. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Geros H. Cassio F. Leao C. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The cytochromec oxidase embedded in CL-PMV displayed specific activity, total inhibition by cyanide, and activation upon FCCP addition similar to that observed with isolated beef heart mitochondria (17Yu C. Yu L. King T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1383-1392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FCCP stimulation of oxygen consumption indicated that CL-PMV were not very leaky for protons. The equilibrium binding parameters values (K d (app) and B max) measured for cytosine were almost the same for CL-PMV as those measured with plasma membrane-enriched fractions. However, because of a dramatic decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity at pH values below 5.5, the experiments presented here were done at pH 5.7 or 6.2. These pH conditions, which were not the optimum for purine-cytosine permease activity, were acceptable since nucleobase uptake on intact cells and equilibrium binding on plasma membrane fractions were still accurately measured at these pH (12Brèthes D. Napias C. Torchut E. Chevallier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Upon energy supply, CL-PMV containing purine-cytosine permease were able to actively transport nucleobases in a solute/H+symport process (Fig. 2 and Table I). The apparent Michaelis constant of cytosine uptake measured for CL-PMV (Fig. 3) was not dramatically different to that of intact cells: they were 13.0 ± 3.3 and 1.9 ± 0.1 μm, respectively. The uptake catalytic constant (calculated from B max andV max values given in this text) was around 2 min−1, a value 30 times lower than that already published for intact cells which is close to 60 min−1 (14Chirio M.C. Brèthes D. Napias C. Grandier-Vazeille X. Rakotomanana F. Chevallier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Such reduced efficiency of a carrier is rather common in reconstituted systems and mainly attributable to effects of physical and chemical constraints imposed during plasma membrane preparation and vesicle fusion, and to the nature of the phospholipid environment of the carrier in the artificial system.Data in Fig. 2 demonstrate that cytosine uptake is a secondary active transport process depending on the presence of a proton-motive force or, at least, one of its components. The observed cytosine accumulation ratio was only 6.8 when the Δp was 160 mV. Various attempts have been done to improve this low accumulation ratio by modifying the preparation of CL-PMV. Instead of the extrusion procedure, sonication methods described for other carriers were tried (19Van Leeuwen C.C.M. Postma E. Van den Broek P.J.A. Van Steveninck J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12146-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Opekarová M. Caspari T. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, in the fusion procedure, the protein/phospholipid ratio, the pore size of the extruder filters, and the number of passes through the filter were also varied. The vesicles obtained from these numerous attempts always displayed the same or lower accumulation ratio (not shown). Modifications of the phospholipid environment of the carrier have also been tried by preparing CL-PMV with purified phospholipids from various sources (Fig. 4). Phosphatidylethanolamine from E. coli was more efficient than all the other phospholipids, and particularly more so than the natural purified phospholipids extracted from plasma membrane fractions of S. cerevisiae. Such behavior has already been observed for some secondary active carriers (19Van Leeuwen C.C.M. Postma E. Van den Broek P.J.A. Van Steveninck J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12146-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Driessen A.J.M. Zheng T. Veld G.I. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphatidylethanolamine from E. coli was also shown to confer the best carrier environment for the well investigated branched amino acid permease of Streptococcus cremoris, located in vivo in a membrane totally lacking this phospholipid (31Driessen A.J.M. Zheng T. Veld G.I. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Clearly, more work is needed to understand why natural yeast phospholipids did not allow good uptake and accumulation of cytosine in CL-PMV.Use of ionophores collapsing either the ΔpH or the ΔΨ component of the Δp (Fig. 6) showed that the cytosine active transport was solely driven by the ΔpH component and that the solute accumulation ratios observed were related with the ΔpH (Table I). In all cases, the accumulation plateaus were stable for about 10–15 min except for the experiment shown in Fig. 6 B in the presence of valinomycin, where the curve showed a maximum instead of a plateau followed by a decrease which was related to the energy source exhaustion (as observed by the appearance of a blue color of the incubation medium due to the stable free radical form of TMPD).Thus, if we assume a H+/solute stoichiometry of 1 (11Hopkins P. Shaw R. Acik L. Oliver S. Eddy A.A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and if the system was to reach its thermodynamic equilibrium, one ΔpH unit should lead to a solute accumulation ratio of 10. In the various uptake experiments described, we observed values ranging from 32 to 58% of that value (Table I). Two main reasons could account for these results. First, in the fusion procedure, there was a large excess of cytochrome c oxidase proteoliposomes as compared with the plasma membrane fraction. Thus, in the CL-PMV population not all the energizable vesicles might contain purine-cytosine permease. Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine the amount of functional vesicles as already done for reconstituted vesicles containing other permeases, where the reconstituted material contained from 10 to 50% of functional vesicles (19Van Leeuwen C.C.M. Postma E. Van den Broek P.J.A. Van Steveninck J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12146-12151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Geros H. Cassio F. Leao C. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1263-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Ongjoko R. Szkutnicka K. Cirillo V.P. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2926-2931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, because of the low affinity of the carrier in CL-PMV for the nucleobases, and because of the low specific radioactivity of the commercially available [2-14C]cytosine, a rather high external solute concentration had to be used to measure the uptake accurately. In such conditions, as solute accumulation proceeds, it causes the internal solute concentration to reach values for which the efflux via passive diffusion becomes large for such a hydrophobic compound and, consequently, limits its accumulation ratio. This is shown by uptake analyses done at external cytosine concentrations of 25 μm (Fig. 5 A) and 120 μm (Fig.5 B) which led to accumulation ratios of 6.8 and 3.4, respectively. This has been observed and discussed for other carriers (33Driessen A.J.M. Hellingwerf K.J. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12438-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, this made it very difficult to determine accurately the H+/cytosine stoichiometry. However, our data (Table I) fit with the postulated stoichiometry of 1 (11Hopkins P. Shaw R. Acik L. Oliver S. Eddy A.A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, replacement of K+ by Na+ ions in the uptake buffer did not change the behavior of the transport (Fig. 6). Clearly, this is consistent with the results of Hopkins et al. (10Hopkins P. Chevallier M.R. Jund R. Eddy A.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1988; 49: 173-177Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the nucleobase transport is electroneutral, K+ or Na+ counterflow should not occur via the permease itself, but rather through some unidentified monocation/H+ exchange system located in the plasma membrane. But, an alternative to this would be that the cytosine transport is actually electroneutral by itself. This means that the carrier would take up, instead of the cytosine neutral form, its anionic specie (very scarce at the experimental pH since the relevant pK a of cytosine is 12.2) with a tremendous affinity: this mechanism would be in good agreement with the fact that the cytosine accumulation ratio depends only on the ΔpH component of the proton-motive force.On the other hand, another important finding was the role played by the internal pH value on the uptake kinetics, alkaline values leading to stimulation of the apparent rate of cytosine uptake (Fig. 6). In this respect, it is to be noted that there was a clear dependence of the apparent rate of cytosine uptake on the internal CL-PMV pH. Weak acid deprotonation is known to be very rapid and, this event, by itself, cannot be rate-limiting in the active H+/solute translocation process. However, alkalinization of the medium leads to an increase in the ratio of deprotonated/protonated forms of the permease. As a consequence, this might increase the relative amount of the carrier form involved in the rate-limiting step of the catalytic cycle, as described for the models of cytosine transport (11Hopkins P. Shaw R. Acik L. Oliver S. Eddy A.A. Yeast. 1992; 8: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and of leucine transport (34Driessen A.J.M. De Jong S. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5193-5200Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It would be highly speculative to propose a mechanistic model based only on our present results, but these data are nevertheless very consistent with the above mentioned models.In intact cells lacking cytosine deaminase, the cytosine accumulation ratio was close to 500 and the catalytic constant was around 60 min−1 (14Chirio M.C. Brèthes D. Napias C. Grandier-Vazeille X. Rakotomanana F. Chevallier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, there was a transmembrane ΔpH close to 2.7 pH units, when the external medium was pH 4.5 ([31P]Pi NMR cytosolic pH measurements). 2M. C. Chirio and D. Brèthes, unpublished results. Such pH values are the optimal in vivo conditions for carrier-mediated cytosine active transport, leading to thermodynamic equilibrium between ΔpH and the cytosine accumulation ratio (assuming a H+/cytosine stoichiometry of 1). Unfortunately, in vivo ΔpH conditions could not be mimicked in CL-PMV.Finally, exchange experiments at the steady state level of accumulation have shown that no transinhibition by accumulated cytosine occurred, and that the observed steady state plateau of accumulation was the result of equal influx and efflux rates (Fig. 5). Such behavior has already been observed in other transport system (35Van den Broek P.J.A. Van Gompel A.E. Luttik M.A.H. Pronk J.T. Van Leeuwen C.C.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast, it has been shown that yeast arginine and maltose permeases are totally irreversible (29Opekarová M. Caspari T. Tanner W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 35Van den Broek P.J.A. Van Gompel A.E. Luttik M.A.H. Pronk J.T. Van Leeuwen C.C.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). An interesting case is the histidine permease ofSalmonella typhimurium. By using energized right-side-out plasma membrane vesicles, it was first shown that the transport was fully reversible (36Prossnitz E. Gee A. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5006-5014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, by using a totally reconstituted system, the same group showed it to be fully irreversible and regulated by transinhibition (37Liu C.E. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 859-866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As, in our present work, CL-PMV were prepared from plasma membrane fractions, caution is needed about the reversible aspect of cytosine accumulation and the answer to that question would be obtained by total reconstitution.In conclusion, the CL-PMV system used in this work is a very useful tool in the study of the purine-cytosine permease. It has allowed us to make the following statements: (a) the carrier catalyzes a nucleobase-active transport process; (b) the ΔpH component of the Δp is the sole driving force for solute accumulation; (c) the vesicle internal pH plays a crucial role in the uptake kinetics; and (d) the purine-cytosine permease does not show any strict specificity for K+ ions.However, our observations indicate the limitations of the CL-PMV system for complete characterization of the translocation process and show that further elucidation of the transport mechanism will require a totally reconstituted system. Living cells have to take up various ions and metabolites from extracellular medium. Recent reviews have listed many hydrophobic proteins of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plasma membrane involved in specific transport of a large array of molecules, such as hexoses and amino acids, as well as potassium and sulfate ions (1Van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2André B.

Purine-cytosine permease from S. cerevisiae is one of these plasma membrane carriers (3Weber E. Rodriguez C. Chevallier M.R. Jund R. Mol.

In vivo, this permease seems to mediate the co-transport of proton and purine bases (adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine) or a pyrimidine base (cytosine) (5Polak A. Grenson M. Eur. J.

CL-PMV displayed an internal volume value very similar to that already obtained by other methods (19Van Leeuwen C.C.M. Postma E. Van den Broek P.J.A. Van Steveninck J. J. Biol.

The equilibrium binding parameters values (K d (app) and B max) measured for cytosine were almost the same for CL-PMV as those measured with plasma membrane-enriched fractions. However, because of a dramatic decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity at pH values below 5.5, the experiments presented here were done at pH 5.7 or 6.2. These pH conditions, which were not the optimum for purine-cytosine permease activity, were acceptable since nucleobase uptake on intact cells and equilibrium binding on plasma membrane fractions were still accurately measured at these pH (12Brèthes D. Napias C. Torchut E. Chevallier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).Upon energy supply, CL-PMV containing purine-cytosine permease were able to actively transport nucleobases in a solute/H+symport process (Fig. 2 and Table I). The apparent Michaelis constant of cytosine uptake measured for CL-PMV (Fig. 3) was not dramatically different to that of intact cells: they were 13.0 ± 3.3 and 1.9 ± 0.1 μm, respectively. The uptake catalytic constant (calculated from B max andV max values given in this text) was around 2 min−1, a value 30 times lower than that already published for intact cells which is close to 60 min−1 (14Chirio M.C.

Mutations caused by DNA-damaging agents play a key role in cancer via activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (1Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 138-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1509) Google Scholar). DNA repair is the major defense mechanism of cells against DNA damage and its deleterious effects. The major repair strategy in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is excision repair. It involves excision of the damaged region from DNA, followed by re-synthesis using the complementary undamaged strand as a template (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Two excision repair mechanisms are known for DNA damage: nucleotide excision repair (NER), 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; BER, base excision repair; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; MMS, methylmethanesulfonate. which operates on a wide variety of DNA lesions (3Sancar A. Science. 1994; 266: 1954-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and base excision repair (BER) which is more limited in its range of substrate specificity (4Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjoras M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The key step in these mechanisms is the recognition of DNA damage. In the bacteriumEscherichia coli, the protein UvrA is responsible for the recognition of a broad range of DNA lesions that are repaired by NER, whereas in BER a series of DNA glycosylases with a much narrower range of specificity recognize and excise damaged or foreign bases from DNA (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). A DNA lesion that has escaped repair can cause a discontinuity in DNA in the form of a ssDNA region carrying the lesion. This occurs when the replication fork is blocked at the lesion (5Witkin E.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 869-907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 465-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), or occasionally because of complications in nucleotide excision repair (7Tomer G. Cohen-Fix O. O'Donnell M. Goodman M. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This gap/lesion structure poses a problem for excision repair; an attempt to eliminate the lesion will cause a double-strand break, which is highly lethal, but on the other hand, the gap must be filled in for DNA replication to be completed and cell division to occur. Two tolerance mechanism that operate in E. coli are responsible for filling in the gap/lesion structures (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). A recombinational repair mechanism patches the gap via recombination using homologous sequences from the sister chromatid. This process does not remove the damaged base, but it enables an error-free bypass, resulting in the restoration of genome continuity. An alternative bypass mechanism, which is regulated by the SOS stress response, involves filling in of the gap by DNA synthesis. This translesion replication reaction is potentially mutagenic because of the miscoding properties of most DNA lesions (6Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 465-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Walker G.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 416-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The process was termed SOS mutagenesis, or error-prone repair, because the gap is repaired (though the damaged nucleotide remains) with the concomitant formation of mutations. It is responsible for mutations caused by a large spectrum of DNA lesions, including UV lesions, bulky carcinogen adducts, and abasic sites, which share the property of being blocks to DNA replication (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Biological regulation is often achieved by a combination of both positive and negative affectors; however, so far little is known on negative affectors that act directly on error-prone repair (9Shavitt O. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11275-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Tadmor Y. Ascarelli-Goell R. Skaliter R. Livneh Z. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the possibility that proteins that bind lesions on ssDNA act as inhibitors of mutagenesis by directly inhibiting translesion replication. UvrA and RecA were purified as described (11Thomas D.C. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9875-9883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Yeung A.T. Mates W.B. Oh E.Y. Yoakum G.H.

Goodman (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA), and DNA polymerase III (α subunit), purified as described (15Maki H. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Laval (Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France). The 40-nucleotide-long templates AB1 (5′-GCT GTA CAA CGT CGT GAC TGF GAA AAC CCT GGC GTT ACC C-3′) and AB2 (5′-GGA AAA CCC TGG CGT TAC CCF ACT TAA TCG CCT TGC AGC A-3′), each containing a site-specific abasic site analog (marked F), were synthesized and purified as described (16Takeshita M. Chang C. Johnson F. Will S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10171-10179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were gifts from M. Takeshita (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). Similar oligonucleotides with no damage were synthesized by the Synthesis Unit of The Biological Services Department of the Weizmann Institute of Science. The substrates were prepared each by annealing the complementary 32P-end-labeled 17-mer primer to the 40-nucleotide-long synthetic DNA template as described (17Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Essentially, all template molecules contain the abasic site analog (>99.98%), as deduced from the complete arrest of DNA synthesis at the lesion when bypass was assayed with pol I in the presence of 0.1m KCl (<0.02% bypass, representing the limit of detection; Ref. 18Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The assay was performed essentially as described (17Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The in vitro replication reaction mixture (25 or 50 μl) contained 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 8 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 4% glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP and 0.5 mm dNTPs. In addition the mixtures contained 70 nm pol I and 70 nmtemplate AB1, 24 nm pol II and 36 nm template AB2, or 150 nm pol III (α subunit) and 85 nmtemplate AB1. The time course of bypass was performed in the absence or the presence of 0.8 μm Fpg or 0.2 μm UvrA. These concentrations are comparable with the estimated intracellular concentrations of UvrA (0.3 μm; Ref. 19Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Fpg (0.15–0.30 μm; Ref. 20Boiteux S. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 1993; 19: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which are minimal estimated concentrations that might be further increased by compartmentalization. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for the indicated time periods, after which they were treated with proteinase K and fractionated by electrophoresis on 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 murea. End-labeled oligonucleotides were used as size standards. Samples were run at 1500–1600 V for 3–4 h, after which they were visualized and quantified using a Fuji BAS 1000 phosphorimager. The E. coli mutants used were derived from AB1157 argE3 his4 leuB6 proA2 thr1 ara14 galK2 lacY1 mtl1 xyl5 thi1 tsx33 rpsL31 supE44 by P1 transduction as described (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, NY1972Google Scholar). WBY130 was prepared by moving theΔuvrA::cat mutation from strain MH1 (obtained from P. van de Putte, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands) to AB1157. WBY131 is AB1157 but also uvrC279::Tn10(transduced from strain N3124 obtained from R. G. Lloyd, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, England). Strains WBY136 and WBY137 are Δphr::kan derivatives of strains WBY130 and WBY131, respectively. The mutation was moved from strain UNC523 (obtained from A. Sancar, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The His reversion assay was performed essentially as described (10Tadmor Y. Ascarelli-Goell R. Skaliter R. Livneh Z. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2517-2524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Derivatives of E. coli AB1157 cells were UV-irradiated at 254 nm with the indicated doses using a germicidal lamp, after which they were plated on M9 minimal plates supplemented with 100 mg/liter each of Pro, Arg, Thr, Leu, Ile, and Val, and a limited amount of 2 mg/liter His. His+ colonies were counted after 3–4 days. The total number of cells was determined by plating the appropriate dilution of the culture on the same plate (the amount of His was sufficient to allow growth of several hundreds of colonies). The mutation frequency was calculated by dividing the number of mutants by the total number of cells. The assay for UV light-induced reversion of Arg auxotrophy was conducted according to the same procedure except that the concentration of His in the plates was raised to 100 mg/liter, and that of Arg was lowered to 3 mg/liter. MMS-induced His reversions were assayed as follows; cells were grown to OD595 0.5, after which they were washed, resuspended in 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.5–2.0 μg/ml MMS. His+ mutants were assayed as described above for UV mutagenesis. Abasic sites are a classical example of miscoding and replication-blocking DNA lesions, which cause mutations via the SOS response (22Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Although polymerization frequently terminates at abasic sites, purified DNA polymerases were shown to be able to bypass abasic sites unassisted, usually incorporating a dAMP residue opposite the lesion (23Kunkel T.A. Schaaper R.M. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2378-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 24Sagher D. Strauss B.

A. 1988; 85: 5046-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Bonner C.A. Randall S.K. Rayssiguier C. Radman M. Eritja R. Kaplan B.E. McEntee K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18946-18952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, we utilized a model assay system that we have recently developed for translesion DNA synthesis, based on a synthetic DNA substrate containing a site-specific abasic site analog (17Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Livneh Z. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The DNA substrate utilized consisted of a 5′-radiolabeled 17-mer oligonucleotide primer, annealed to a 40-nucleotide-long synthetic ssDNA carrying a site-specific abasic site analog at position 21 (Fig.1 A). Replication of this substrate by a DNA polymerase resulted in extension of the radiolabeled primer, and this was assayed by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by quantitative measurements of the radiolabeled bands. Termination of DNA synthesis at the lesion is expected to yield products that are 19 or 20 nucleotides long, for termination prior to or opposite the lesion, respectively, whereas translesion replication is expected to yield a full-length 40-nucleotide product (Fig. 1 A). We examined first the effect on bypass of formamido-pyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg), a repair enzyme involved in BER of oxidative DNA damage. It catalyzes the removal of formamido-pyrimidines and 8-oxo-guanine from DNA, and it has an associated AP lyase activity, and thus is also an abasic site-binding protein (27O'Connor T.R. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5222-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Tchou J. Kasai H. Shibutani S. Chung M.H. Laval J. Grollman A.P. Nishimura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4690-4694Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The AP lyase activity leads usually to the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond; however, the lack of the hydroxyl group in the furanyl abasic site analog renders it resistant to breakage. The fact that Fpg binds but does not cleave the abasic site analog (29Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) makes it a convenient model system to assay inhibition of bypass. We examined the effects of Fpg on bypass synthesis by each of the three known DNA polymerases of E. coli. We have shown previously that when the appropriate reaction conditions are used, each of the DNA polymerases can bypass the abasic site analog, unassisted by other proteins, at frequencies higher than reported previously (17Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We used DNA polymerase I, DNA polymerase II, and the α subunit of DNA polymerase III (pol IIIα). In this bypass assay system, pol III core showed little bypass, and thus its α subunit, which contains the polymerase active site, was used instead (17Paz-Elizur T. Takeshita M. Goodman M. O'Donnell M. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24662-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig.1, each of the DNA polymerases was capable of replicating through the abasic site analog, albeit at different rates. Addition of Fpg caused an inhibition of translesion replication by each of the DNA polymerases of up to 10–20-fold (Fig. 1, B and C). This was evident from the decreased amount of bypass products, and from the accumulation of termination products at the lesion (Fig.1 B). To examine whether other DNA damage-binding proteins inhibit translesion synthesis, we analyzed the effect of the UvrA protein on bypass of the abasic site analog. UvrA is the general DNA damage recognition protein of E. coli (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). It recognizes a large spectrum of DNA lesions (19Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including abasic sites (30Snowden A. Kow Y.W. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7251-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). When purified UvrA protein was added to the bypass reaction, it caused a strong 10–20-fold inhibition of bypass synthesis by DNA polymerase I or by pol IIIα, and it completely inhibited (900-fold) translesion synthesis by pol II (Fig. 2; TableI). The termination of DNA synthesis in these experiments and in the experiments with Fpg was not caused by cleavage of the template by Fpg or by UvrA at the abasic site analog, because the abasic site analog is insensitive to the enzyme (29Castaing B. Boiteux S. Zelwer C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and UvrA has no nuclease activity (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). This was confirmed by repeating the bypass reactions in the presence of Fpg or UvrA with a DNA substrate in which the 5′-end of the template strand was radiolabeled (data not shown). Thus, DNA damage-binding proteins of both the NER and BER pathways of repair strongly inhibit translesion replication.Table IEffects of the DNA damage-binding proteins Fpg and UvrA on DNA synthesis on undamaged DNA, and on substrates containing a site-specific abasic site analogDNA polymeraseRate of DNA synthesis−Fpg+Fpg-Fold inhibition−UvrA+UvrA-Fold inhibitionfmol molecules replicated/minpol I Undamaged DNA150014201.114001608.8 Damaged DNA6.00.415.04.60.415.3pol II Undamaged DNA6206401.06002202.7 Damaged DNA191.019.018.50.02925.0pol III (α subunit) Undamaged DNA196013401.519604804.1 Damaged DNA7.40.612.38.90.811.1The reactions were carried out and analyzed as described in the legends to Figs. 1 and 2, except that undamaged templates AB1 and AB2 were used, each containing a guanine residue instead of the abasic site analog, and reaction times were 2, 4, and 6 min. The rates were calculated from the phosphorimager images of gels similar to those presented in Fig. 1. Open table in a new tab The reactions were carried out and analyzed as described in the legends to Figs. 1 and 2, except that undamaged templates AB1 and AB2 were used, each containing a guanine residue instead of the abasic site analog, and reaction times were 2, 4, and 6 min. The rates were calculated from the phosphorimager images of gels similar to those presented in Fig. 1. The dependence of the inhibitory effect on the presence of the lesion in DNA was addressed by repeating the inhibition experiments with a control template with no damage, and the results are shown in Table I. DNA synthesis on the undamaged DNA by each of the three DNA polymerases was not affected by Fpg, compared with the 10–20-fold inhibition on the damaged template. Thus, inhibition of bypass by Fpg was DNA damage-specific. The UvrA protein caused an inhibition of DNA synthesis on the undamaged template; however, its extent depended on the polymerase. DNA synthesis by pol II was inhibited only 2.7-fold, much weaker than the 900-fold inhibition of bypass synthesis. For pol I and pol IIIα, inhibition by UvrA of DNA synthesis on the damaged template was 2–3-fold stronger than on the undamaged template (Table I). To examine whether any protein that binds ssDNA inhibits bypass synthesis, we assayed the effect on translesion synthesis of RecA, a protein that binds ssDNA regardless of the presence of DNA damage (31Roca A.I. Cox M.M. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 25: 415-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We found that RecA inhibited bypass synthesis by pol I and pol IIIα by 10% and 21%, respectively, and it stimulated bypass by pol II by 23%. Thus, RecA had only a marginal effect on bypass synthesis. This small effect was not due to lack of DNA binding, since under our conditions RecA caused a large retardation in the mobility of the template when assayed by the gel mobility shift assay (data not shown). Thus, not every ssDNA-binding protein inhibits translesion synthesis. The in vitro studies presented above raise the possibility that DNA damage-binding proteins have an anti-mutagenic activity separate from the one which is associated with the removal of DNA damage. If true in vivo, one would predict that SOS mutagenesis will be higher in a strain that lacks DNA damage-binding proteins when compared with a strain that contains these proteins. The examination of such a prediction should be made under conditions in which the repair capacity of the two strains is the same, and the only difference is the presence or absence of DNA damage-binding proteins. The mutagen that we examined was UV light. It was chosen because it provided a convenient experimental system (see below) in which the concept could be examined on DNA lesions other than abasic sites. UV light produces primarily cyclobutyl dimers and 6–4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone adducts (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). These lesions are chemically very different from abasic sites, and they are repaired by different error-free repair mechanisms. However, they give rise to mutations by the same SOS mutagenesis pathway, and thus they are functional homologues, as far as induced mutagenesis is concerned (6Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 465-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 32Schaaper R.M. Glickman B.W. Loeb L.A. Mutat. Res. 1982; 106: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In particular, the 6–4 photoadducts share with abasic sites the properties of being both blocking and miscoding (33Horsfall M.J. Lawrence C.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cyclobutyl photodimers are blocking, but only weakly miscoding (34Banerjee S.K. Christensen R.B. Lawrence C.W. LeClerc J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8141-8145Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 35Horsfall M.J. Borden A. Lawrence C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2835-2839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both types of UV lesions are repaired by the UvrABC NER system, although the 6–4 adducts are repaired faster. The cyclobutyl dimers are also repaired by DNA photolyase, using light as a cofactor (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). By using a uvrC mutant (NER not operative) and working under yellow light (DNA photolyase not active), one creates a situation in which cyclobutyl dimers and 6–4 adducts are not repaired. Under these conditions, the repair capacity of the uvrC strain is the same as a uvrA phr double mutant, except that in theuvrC strain both UvrA and DNA photolyase are still present and bind UV lesions (photolyase also binds cyclobutyl dimers in the dark; Ref. 36Sancar G.B. Smith F.W. Reid R. Payne G. Levy M. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 478-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prediction was that if UvrA and photolyase inhibit translesion replication in vivo, UV mutagenesis would be higher in the uvrA phr double mutant as compared with the uvrC mutant (TableII).Table IIPhenotypes of E. coli strains that were constructed in order to examine the effect of DNA damage-binding proteins on UV mutagenesisPhenotypeGenotypeuvrA phruvrCRelevant proteins presentNoneUvrA, photolyaseRepair by NER and PRNoNo (in dark)Binding to UV dimers and 6–4 adductsNoYesUV mutagenesis (predicted)++++ Open table in a new tab We compared UV mutagenesis and survival of an isogenic series of singleuvrA and uvrC mutants, and the uvrA phr and uvrC phr double mutants. We used low UV doses, under which cell survival was high (70–90%), conditions that are physiologically relevant. As can be seen in Fig.3 A, the frequency of UV light-induced His− → His+ reversions was 3.3-fold higher in the uvrA phr strain, as compared with theuvrC strain. UV survival was identical, indicating that the repair capabilities of these strains were the same, as expected. Mutants carrying the uvrA or uvrC phr mutations exhibited intermediate mutagenicity. We also examined the same mutants in the Arg reversion mutagenesis assay (Fig. 3 B). Similarly to the His reversions, UV-induced Arg− → Arg+ reversions were higher in the uvrA phrstrain, as compared with the uvrC strain, although the effect was slightly lower (2.5-fold). These results indicate that, when present, UvrA and DNA photolyase eliminate as much as 70% of the UV-induced His+ mutations by a mechanism that does not involve DNA damage removal. Our model predicts that the anti-mutagenic effect of a particular DNA damage-binding protein will be directed only against the DNA lesions to which it binds. Thus, no anti-mutagenic effect of UvrA and DNA photolyase is predicted, for example, for alkylation damage in DNA. This prediction was examined by assaying MMS mutagenesis in the various mutants. Like UV mutagenesis, MMS mutagenesis is SOS-dependent. However, in contrast to UV light DNA damage, the alkylation DNA damage caused by MMS is repaired primarily by demethylation and by BER (2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). Thus, it was expected that MMS mutagenesis would be the same in the uvr and phrmutants. As can be seen in Fig. 3 C, there were no differences in MMS mutagenesis among the four strains, as expected, suggesting that the effect is specific for the appropriate combination of DNA damage-binding proteins and the DNA lesions to which they bind. The most likely explanation for the lower UV mutagenesis in theuvrC mutant as compared with the uvrA phr mutant is binding of UvrA and DNA photolyase to UV lesions present on ssDNA regions, and physical obstruction of the bypass attempts by the polymerase, similar to our in vitro results with the abasic site analog. The magnitude of the inhibition of translesion DNA synthesis by DNA-binding proteins in vivo may be larger than the 3.3-fold effect observed in our UV mutagenesis experiments, because there may be other proteins that bind pre-mutagenic UV lesions in addition to UvrA and DNA photolyase. This study addressed the possibility that DNA damage-binding proteins can intervene directly in the mutagenic bypass reaction and inhibit it, thus providing extra anti-mutagenic protection to the cell. Our results with the in vitro model system showed that the Fpg and UvrA repair proteins specifically inhibited in vitrotranslesion replication through an abasic site analog by purified DNA polymerases. These effects can be explained by the binding of the DNA damage-binding proteins to the damaged site in DNA, forming a physical obstacle to polymerization by the DNA polymerases. As the polymerase encounters the lesion, it pauses and readily dissociates from DNA (25Hevroni D. Livneh Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5046-5050Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,37Shwartz H. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10518-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Shwartz H. Shavitt O. Livneh Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18277-18285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a DNA damage-binding protein may facilitate dissociation and/or inhibit rebinding of the polymerase to the primer-lesion site, leading to an inhibition of bypass synthesis. Such a mechanism could be common to many types of DNA lesions and the proteins that specifically bind them. In particular, replication of strongly blocking lesions is expected to be prone to this type of inhibition, because the DNA polymerases have difficulty in replicating them in the first place, strongly favoring dissociation over bypass (6Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 465-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). UV lesions and abasic sites give rise to mutations by a similar translesion replication mechanism (6Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 465-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 8Walker G.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 416-420Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Our findings that, in the absence of DNA repair, UV mutagenesis was higher in a strain lacking UvrA and DNA photolyase and that Fpg and UvrA inhibit bypass synthesisin vitro can be explained by the same basic molecular mechanism. According to this mechanism, a DNA lesion that has escaped repair and is located in a ssDNA region is recognized by both specific and general DNA damage-binding proteins. These proteins are unable to eliminate the lesion by excision repair, because that would cause a lethal double strand break. Instead, the binding of these proteins to the lesion inhibits bypass synthesis, and thus causes a reduction in mutagenesis. Consistent with our suggestion is the observation that overproduction of DNA photolyase reduced in vivo UV mutagenesis (39Ruiz-Rubio M. Yamamoto K. Bockrath R. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5371-5374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A related observation was the report that mutations due to a site-specific O6-butylguanine in phage φx174 increased 8-fold in a uvrA6 mutant. However, the interpretation of this experiment is complicated by the fact that a missenseuvrA6 mutant, rather than a deletion mutant, was used, and because repair mechanisms responsible for removal of alkylation damage were not neutralized in the cell (40Chambers R.B. Sledziewska-Gojska E. Hirani-Hojati S. Borowy-Borowsky H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7173-7177Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The exact events that occur in a cell following UV irradiation are not fully understood. However, it is clear that ssDNA regions are formed due to the inhibition of DNA replication by blocking UV lesions that were not repaired (5Witkin E.M. Bacteriol. Rev. 1976; 40: 869-907Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Livneh Z. Cohen-Fix O. Skaliter R. Elizur T. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 465-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These regions may serve as binding sites for DNA damage-binding proteins, thus suppressing the error-prone translesion replication. The final mutagenicity is the outcome of the activity of factors that facilitate UV mutagenesis, such as RecA, UmuD, and UmuC, and factors that inhibit the process, such as UvrA and DNA photolyase. How does the binding of UvrA and photolyase lead to an anti-mutagenic effect? One possibility is that this intermediate cannot be repaired and will lead to cell death. This would have predicted differences in UV survival of uvrA phr anduvrC mutants; however, such a difference was not observed. We favor the idea that, while inhibitory to the mutagenic translesion DNA synthesis, the binding of DNA damage-binding proteins does not interfere with error-free recombinational repair. This enables continuation of chromosome replication and cell division, without creating a mutation. In summary, our results suggest that the mutagenic effects caused by agents such as UV light, which produce replication blocks, are suppressed by DNA damage-binding proteins. This provides a second line of defense, which reduces the mutagenic effects of DNA lesions that have escaped DNA repair. It operates by the direct inhibition of translesion replication, mediated via binding of DNA damage-binding proteins to the pre-mutagenic ssDNA regions carrying the DNA lesions. This represents a new regulatory mechanism of induced mutagenesis, and a new anti-mutagenic function for DNA damage-binding proteins. At this point, we do not know whether a similar mechanism operates in eukaryotes. However, based on the great similarity in basic DNA repair mechanisms between E. coli and eukaryotes, direct inhibition of translesion DNA synthesis by DNA damage-binding proteins, such as the human XPA or the yeast Rad14 proteins, is likely to be involved in the regulation of induced mutagenesis in eukaryotes as well.
