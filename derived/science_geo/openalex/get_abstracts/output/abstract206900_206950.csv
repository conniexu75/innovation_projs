https://openalex.org/W965269273,"The behavior of bovine plasma albumin in moving boundary electrophoresis has been studied in great detail, especially by Aoki and Foster (l-6) and by Cann (7-10). In general terms, it has been found that this protein yields a single moving boundary at pH values above the isoelectric point (approximately pH 4.5) but two, and in some cases three, boundaries between pH 3.5 and 4.5. These results have been interpreted by Aoki and Foster (l-6) in terms of a cooperative alteration in the protein conformation, which takes place near pH 4. Some independent evidence for this “isomerization” has been obtained from solubility studies (11) and, more recently, from studies of optical rotation and rotatory dispersion (12, 13). It has also been suggested that the well known anomaly in the acid titration curve of this protein can be explained, in the main, as due to this phenomenon (6). At the time of initiation of the experiments reported here, no evidence existed for the isomerization of plasma albumins of any species other than bovine. It was shown earlier by Tanford, Swanson, and Shore (14) that the titration curves of human and bovine alhumins are essentially identical. This would imply that if indeed the titration anomaly in bovine plasma albumin is due to the isomerization reaction, the same reaction must take place in the human protein. However, Jirgensons (15) suggested that this may not be the case. We considered it of some importance, therefore, to examine the electrophoretic behavior of the human protein. Furthermore, since the plasma albumins are patently heterogeneous, in that some of the molecules contain free sulfhydryl groups and others do not, we were led to utilize the mercaptalbumin fraction of the protein by the thought that it might be more homogeneous. In the interim since this program was initiated, ample evidence has appeared that human albumin exhibits much the same type of isomerization behavior as bovine (12, 16-19). However, we know of no published electrophoretic studies that demonstrate the isomerization equilibrium in human mercaptalbumin nor, in fact, in the mercaptalbumin fraction of any albumin. A more important reason for presenting these results at this time is"

While engaged on a programme of research on the phylogenetic relationships of primates, I had the opportunity of studying the chromosomes of two orang-utans (male and female, R. 33 and R. 34) in the Zoological Gardens of Rome."

https://openalex.org/W2051011499,WE have reported1 the isolation of 14 phages active on Lactobacilli by the use of an enrichment technique in which 10 batches of sewage were incubated with groups of Lactobacilli. Each group comprised 12 different strains. These experiments have now been repeated with one modification: the sewage in the mixtures has been replaced by an equal volume of tap water. No phage was isolated. It would appear that none of the 120 strains of Lactobacillus used was lysogenic and that the phages originally isolated were present in the sewage.

The mechanism synthesizing the new infectivity was believed to be located within isolated nuclei. Ultrasonic rupture of the nuclear membranes appeared to increase the rate of synthesis."

All the compounds were labeled; the bulk of the radioactivity appeared in the aspartic acid. The findings suggest the operation in lobster nerves of the citric acid cycle including CO 2 fixation."

The results indicate that the enzymic conversions of chymotryp- sinogen to 7~ or d-chymotrypsin and to cr-chymotrypsin are accompanied by changes in conformation. The stability of chymotrypsinogen in urea solutions is intermediate between that of the two forms of chymotrypsin. REFERENCES 1. CHERVENKA, C. H., J. Am. Chem. Sot., 82, 582 (1960). 2. NORTHRUP, J.

https://openalex.org/W2043958579,A theory for ultrafiltration is presented which makes possible the characterization of a membrane at a given temperature and solute concentration by a single experiment at that temperature and concentration. The theory is applied to data in the literature and is shown to be consistent with those data.
https://openalex.org/W1992439601,Disruption and lysis as well as accumulation of cell-wall precursor material have been demonstrated in several strains of Gram-positive cocci as results of the action of penicillin. The concurrence of these phenomena in typically penicillin-sensitive bacteria lends further support to the hypothesis that penicillin exerts its antibiotic action through interference with the formation of cell walls.

https://openalex.org/W2086604862,IT is known that many biological systems can be protected in part against the effect of ionizing radiation by the presence of very small amounts of additives. It is often difficult to assess the mechanism of this protection due to the complex nature of the system. The effect of radiation on simple organic polymers can also be reduced by various additives. It is believed that this offers many analogies with protection in the more complex biological systems.

https://openalex.org/W2031312729,"PHYLLODY, a disease of clovers, occurs in eastern North America and appears to be similar or identical to the disease present in England, continental Europe and the U.S.S.R. In England, Frazier and Posnette1 first demonstrated that a virus, transmitted by certain species of leafhoppers, is responsible for causing phyllody in clover, and that the same virus, transmitted by dodder, is responsible for causing greenpetal of strawberry. Leafhopper vectors of this virus recorded to date include Euscelis lineolatus Brullé1, Macrosteles viridigriseus (Edwards)1, Aphrodes bicinctus (Schrank)2,3, Aphrodes albifrons L.4 and Macrosteles cristatus (Ribaut)4. The work reported here was undertaken to determine if the disease occurring in clover in North America is also caused by a leafhopperborne virus."

https://openalex.org/W2050444972,"Rinehart and Greenberg1,2 observed a marked thickening of the intima and deposition of lipid in pyridoxine-deficient monkeys. Though the role of pyridoxine as an essential co-factor in fat and protein metabolism has been well established, the precise mechanism of atherogenesis in pyridoxine deficiency has not been elucidated. Goswami and Sadhu3 have adduced evidence tending to show that the hyper -cholesterolæmia of pyridoxine deficiency is not related to impairment of formation of arachidonic acid. The possibility that atherogenesis may be a consequence of defective formation and maintenance of collagen and elastic tissue brought about by decreased trans-aminase activity therefore gains added importance. However, while the transaminase activities of several tissues, both under normal and pathological conditions, have been examined, very little work has been reported on the transaminase activity of arterial tissue. The present communication reports the demonstration of significant transaminase activity in arterial tissue."
