https://openalex.org/W2091759162,"Adipose differentiation is accompanied by changes in cellular morphology, a dramatic accumulation of intracellular lipid and activation of a specific program of gene expression. Using an mRNA differential display technique, we have isolated a novel adipose cDNA, termed adipoQ. The adipoQ cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 247 amino acids with a secretory signal sequence at the amino terminus, a collagenous region (Gly-X-Y repeats), and a globular domain. The globular domain of adipoQ shares significant homology with subunits of complement factor C1q, collagen α1(X), and the brain-specific factor cerebellin. The expression of adipoQ is highly specific to adipose tissue in both mouse and rat. Expression of adipoQ is observed exclusively in mature fat cells as the stromal-vascular fraction of fat tissue does not contain adipoQ mRNA. In cultured 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, hormone-induced differentiation dramatically increases the level of expression for adipoQ. Furthermore, the expression of adipoQ mRNA is significantly reduced in the adipose tissues from obese mice and humans. Whereas the biological function of this polypeptide is presently unknown, the tissue-specific expression of a putative secreted protein suggests that this factor may function as a novel signaling molecule for adipose tissue.

INTRODUCTIONAdipose tissue is highly specialized to play important roles in energy storage, fatty acid metabolism, and glucose homeostasis(1.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes synthesize and store triglyceride in periods of nutritional abundance and mobilize the lipids in response to fasting(2.Spiegelman B.M. Choy L. Hotamisligil G.S. Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. J.

Fat tissue is also involved in regulating blood glucose levels through the expression of the insulin responsive glucose transporter, Glu4(4.Kaestner K.H. Christy R.J. McLenithan J.C. Braiterman L.T.

Fat and muscle, in fact, constitute the two major sites for insulin-regulated glucose uptake.At a molecular level, many genes involved in lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis are prominently expressed in fat(1.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). These include fatty acid synthase(6.Moustaid N. Sul H.S. J. Biol.

In addition to these genes that clearly participate in the metabolic functions of adipose tissue, a group of genes that function in extracellular signaling have also been identified in fat. A prototype of these molecules is insulin-like growth factor 1, which is expressed in many tissues during development and plays an important role in cell proliferation(18.Froesch E.R. Schmid C. Schwander J. Zapf J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 443-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In adipocytes, however, insulin-like growth factor 1 is found to stimulate cell differentiation(19.Smith P. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More interestingly, insulin-like growth factor 1 is synthesized by preadipocytes in response to growth hormone stimulation(20.Doglio A. Dani C. Fredrikson G. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4011-4016Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), thus potentially functioning in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to promote adipogenesis during development. Another signaling molecule from adipose tissue is TNF-α. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-αtumor necrosis factor αDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPCRpolymerase chain reaction. TNF-α is secreted from fat, especially in obesity, and acts in an autocrine or paracrine manner to interfere with insulin action in fat and muscle(21.Hotamisligil G. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6031) Google Scholar, 22.Hotamisligil G.S. Arner P. Caro J.F. Atkinson R.L. Spiegelman B.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2409-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). The recent cloning and characterization of the ob gene product has further illustrated that adipose tissue secretes signaling molecules that function in an endocrine fashion(23.Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11632) Google Scholar). The ob gene product (leptin) is secreted from fat into the circulation and acts to regulate body weight, perhaps via a putative receptor in the cerebroventricular region of the brain(15.Campfield L.A. Smith F.J. Guisez Y. Devos R. Burn P. Science. 1995; 269: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3060) Google Scholar, 23.Zhang Y. Proenca R. Maffei M. Barone M. Leopold L. Friedman J.M.

Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4199) Google Scholar). Hence, molecules secreted from adipose tissue are capable of modulating diverse functions in fat and other tissues, thus representing a new facet of adipose tissue physiology.In this study, we have used mRNA differential display to clone a novel adipose gene termed adipoQ. Sequence analysis suggests that adipoQ is a secreted protein that shares significant homology to subunits of complement factor C1q and contains a collagenous structure at the NH2 terminus and a globular domain at the COOH terminus. The expression of this novel gene is highly regulated during the adipose differentiation process and is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue in vivo. Moreover, a significant down-regulation in adipoQ mRNA was observed in fat tissues from obese mice and humans. Our results provide a potentially valuable new molecular tool to explore the physiology of adipose tissue in normal and pathological states.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsDMEM, calf serum, and fortified calf serum were from Hyclone, Inc. Insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethylxanthine were purchased from Sigma, Inc. Reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus), Klenow fragment and T4 kinase were obtained from BRL, Inc. Isotopes including [32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) and 35S-dATP (1300 Ci/mmol) were from DuPont NEN. GenAMP kit containing Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Perkin-Elmer.Cell Lines and Cell CultureMurine fibroblastic 3T3-C2 cells and 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured as described (7.Spiegelman B.M. Frank M. Green H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10083-10089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Induction of adipocyte differentiation was performed essentially as described(26.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). Briefly, differentiation was initiated by administration of insulin at 5 μg/ml at confluence for 3T3-F442A cells and dexamethasone (1 uM), isobutylmethylxanthine (0.25 mM), and insulin (5 μg/ml) for 3T3-L1 cells. For 3T3-L1 cells, cells were treated with dexamethasone/isobutylmethylxanthine/insulin mix for 48 h and then were refed by DMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 μg/ml insulin. Using this protocol, more than 90% of the cells in both cell lines acquire an adipocyte morphology 5-7 days after the initiation of differentiation. Culture medium was routinely changed every 2 days, and adipocyte differentiation was examined visually under the microscope.mRNA Differential DisplaymRNA differential display was performed essentially as described(27.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar, 28.Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular RNA was isolated from 3T3-C2, 3T3-F442A preadipocytes, and differentiated 3T3-F442A adipocytes using the guanidine isothiocyanate extraction(29.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). 50 μg of total RNA was then treated with 20 units of RNase free-DNase (BRL, Inc.). Subsequently 0.2 μg of treated RNA was used in a reverse transcription reaction using each of the four 1-base pair-anchored 3′ oligo(dT) primers (30.Liang P. Zhu W. Zhang X. Guo Z. O'Connell R.P. Averboukh L. Wang F. Pardee A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5763-5764Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and 300 units of Mo-MLV reverse transcriptase (BRL) in 20 μl volume as recommended by the manufacturer. 2 μl of the reverse transcribed cDNA was used for each PCR reaction. PCR reaction was performed using the same 1-base pair-anchored 3′ oligo(dT) primer and 10 5′ arbitrary oligos of 10 nucleotides in length. The sequence of the 5′ arbitrary oligonucleotide that gave DD1 PCR product (see text) is 5′-AGTCATACAT-3′. The 50-μl PCR reaction contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin, 2 uM dNTP (except dATP), 1 μl of α-35S-dATP (1300 Ci/mmol), 2 uM of 5′ arbitrary oligo and 3′ anchored dT oligo, and 0.2 μl of Taq polymerase. Parameters for PCR were 30 cycles of denaturing at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 40°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds. 5 μl of the PCR reaction mixture was loaded on a 8% sequence gel, and differentially amplified PCR fragments were visualized by exposing the dried sequencing gel to x-ray film. Candidate PCR products were excised from the sequencing gel, and the DNA was eluted from the gel slices by boiling the gel slice in TE (10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA) buffer for 10 min. The eluted DNA fragment was re-amplified by using the same primer pair and subsequently cloned into the TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Inc.).Library Screening, cDNA Cloning, and SequencingThe cDNA library screening, restriction fragment analysis, subcloning, and sequencing analysis were performed as described(31.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). An adipocyte-specific λZAP II cDNA library was custom made by Stratagene Inc. as described(26.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar). GenBank data base searches were performed using the Eugene program at the computer service in Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and further homology searches were performed using Blast and Autosearch programs. Homology alignments were completed using the Pileup program from the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis package (Madison, Wisconsin).In Vitro Translation of AdipoQ cDNAIn vitro transcription and translation was performed using a TNT in vitro translation system from Promega, Inc. according to the manufacturer's instructions. [35S]methionine (800 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) was used to label the translated protein and visualized on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel after fluorography. Molecular markers were from Amersham Corp. (rainbow markers).Expression of Flag-tagged AdipoQThe coding sequence of adipoQ was subcloned into pSV-sport eukaryotic expression vector (BRL) using oligonucleotides 5′-GAATTCGGGATGCTACTGTTGCAAGCT-3′ and 5′-CTCTTCCATGATACCAACGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTGAGAATTC-3′. The flag-epitope (DYKDDDDK, Kodak Scientific Imaging, Inc) was incorporated into the COOH terminus. The NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transient transfected with pSV-sport-flag-adipoQ as described(31.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and DMEM medium with no serum was added. DMEM medium was collected after 24 h, and cells were lysed with RIPA buffer as described(31.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antibody against Flag-epitope (M2 monoclonal antibody, Kodak) was used to immunoblot the proteins separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot AnalysisTotal RNA was isolated from both 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 cell lines as well as from various mouse, rat, and human tissues as described(29.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar, 31.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA was denatured in formamide and formaldehyde at 55°C and separated in formaldehyde-containing gels as described(31.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was blotted onto Hybond nylon membranes, and the nylon membranes were baked, hybridized, and washed as directed by the manufacturer. cDNA probes were radiolabeled to specific activities of at least 109 cpm/μg with [α-32P]dCTP (6000 Ci/mmol) using the random priming method(32.Fineberg A.P. Volgelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (5171) Google Scholar).Fractionation of Rat Fat Pad into Stromal-vascular and Fat CellsFractionation of rat fat fads was performed as described (33.Gregoire F. Todoroff G. Hauser N. Remacle C. Biol. Cell. 1990; 69: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, epididymal fat deposits were removed and transferred into Petri dishes containing the DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (penicillin 100 μg/ml, streptomycin 10 μg/ml). The fat pads were minced by surgical scissors and digested with collagenase (5 mg/ml) for 45 min at 37°C under agitation. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 100-μm nylon filter and centrifuged at 400 × g for 5 min. The floating mature adipocytes were washed and centrifuged again. The pelleted fractions were collected and combined. Floating adipocytes and the pelleted stromal-vascular fraction were lysed with guanidine isothiocyanate, and total RNA was isolated as described(29.Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of AdipoQ cDNATo identify novel genes that are differentially expressed during adipose differentiation, we employed an mRNA differential display technique(27.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar, 34.Liang P. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). RNA samples were prepared from 3T3-C2 cells (C), a fibroblastic cell line unable to differentiate into adipocytes, and a similarly derived preadipocyte cell line, 3T3-F442A cells before (P) and after (A) differentiation(25.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 35.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The RNA was used to synthesize the corresponding cDNA, which was subsequently used for differential display PCR reaction using 10 different arbitrary 5′ primers (see “Experimental Procedures”). A number of candidate α-35S-dATP-labeled PCR products visualized in sequencing gels were expressed preferentially in mature adipocytes (data not shown), and we focused on one such product, DD1 (Fig. 1A). A partial cDNA clone for DD1 was obtained by PCR re-amplification (see “Experimental Procedures”) and sequenced. No significant sequence homology with any other genes in GenBank was apparent from this 200-base pair fragment. However, putative polyadenylation signals were present in this short nucleotide sequence. Northern analysis using this cDNA fragment revealed a mRNA expressed predominantly in differentiated fat cells (Fig. 1B). These data suggested that this cDNA fragment reflected a genuine mRNA species that was differentially regulated. A full-length clone of DD1 was subsequently obtained by screening a λZAP II cDNA adipocyte library with the partial cDNA clone. Sequence analysis revealed a single open reading frame in the full-length cDNA clone (Fig. 2A).Figure 2:Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of adipoQ: homology to components of C1q, collagen α1(X), and cerebellin. A, nucleotides are numbered from the 5′ end of the sequence. The amino acid sequence is derived from the longest open reading frame. The bold region indicates the collagen-like domain. Putative polyadenylation signals are underlined. The accession number for adipoQ in GenBank is U49915. B, homology of adipoQ with murine C1q A, B, and C chains. The bold region indicates identical amino acids in all four sequences. Two interruptions in collagenous region of C1q-B and C1q-C chains are indicated by an asterisk (see text). Symbols # and mark the conserved cysteines (see text) that are altered in adipoQ. C, comparisons of the globular region between C1q B chain, collagen α1(X), and cerebellin. Identical or conserved residues in all four sequences are indicated by bold letters. The two regions that are most homologous are underlined. Pair-wise comparisons between adipoQ and C1q-B chain, collagen α1(X), and cerebellin give 31, 38, and 25% identity, respectively. D, in vitro transcription and translation of adipoQ cDNA. TNT in vitro translation system (Promega) was used for translation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Varying amounts of purified cDNA plasmid (pBluescript) were added directly to the transcription-translation mixture with no RNA polymerase (lane 1), T3 RNA polymerase (0.5 μg DNA) (lane 2), T3 RNA polymerase (2 μg of DNA) (lane 3), T7 RNA polymerase (0.5 μg DNA) (lane 4) and T7 RNA polymerase (2 μg of DNA) (lane 5). [35S]Methionine-labeled products were separated on 10% SDS gel and visualized after fluorography. Molecular mass is indicated by kDa at the left side of the gel. E, Western blot of proteins from conditional medium and cell lysates of transiently transfected NIH-3T3 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lane 1 and 2 were 1 μl of in vitro translated Flag-adipoQ and empty vector. Lanes 3 and 4 were 50 μl (10 μg of protein) of culture medium from Flag-adipoQ transfected (lane 3) and empty vector (lane 4). Lanes 5 and 6 were 10 μl (50 μg of protein) of cell lysates from Flag-adipoQ transfected (lane 5) and empty vector (lane 6). The proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with M2-Flag antibody from Kodak, Inc.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Analysis of the putative protein sequence identified a hydrophobic leader from amino acid residues 2 to 17, presumably representing a signal peptide. A region of collagenous repeats (Gly-X-Y) was present from amino acids 45 to 110, with 22 individual Gly-X-Y repeats. Comparisons with genes in GenBank identified several regions of homology to the subunits (A, B, and C chains) of complement factor C1q (36.Petry F. Reid K.B.M. Loos M. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3988-3993PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Petry F. Reid K.B.M. Loos M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a tissue-specific collagen α1(X)(38.Elima K. Eerola I. Rosati R. Metsaranta M. Garofalo S. Perala M. De Crombrugghe B. Vuorio E. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and a brain-specific protein cerebellin(39.Urade Y. Oberdick J. Molinar-Rode R. Morgan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1069-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The identity with the C1q chains is approximately 31% in the globular COOH-terminal region (Fig. 2B), with the homology localized primarily in two segments of uncharged, hydrophobic regions (Fig. 2C). In addition, adipoQ and C1q A, B, and C chains have a similar size of 240-250 amino acids (Fig. 2B). The number of Gly-X-Y repeats is similar as well, with 22 such repeats for adipoQ and 26-29 for the C1q chains. The similarity of this protein to collagen α1(X) and cerebellin is found mainly at the COOH-terminal globular domain (Fig. 2C) with 38 and 25% identity over a 130-amino acid region. Collagen α1(X), however, encodes a much larger protein (680 amino acids) with a long collagenous segment (154 Gly-X-Y repeats). Cerebellin, on the other hand, is a smaller polypeptide with 193 amino acid residues and does not contain a collagenous domain(39.Urade Y. Oberdick J. Molinar-Rode R. Morgan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1069-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Because of the similarity between this novel protein and all three components of C1q molecules in size, domain structure and overall homology, we termed this novel protein adipoQ.AdipoQ is clearly a distinct member of a proteins family characterized by a collagenous helical structure at the NH2 terminus, and a globular domain at the COOH terminus(40.Prockop D.J.

The presence of a collagenous domain in adipoQ suggests that this protein is likely to form oligomeric structures by itself or with other proteins.Although the COOH-terminal region of adipoQ shares significant similarity with the C1q chains, it also has some notable differences. For example, a cysteine (marked in Fig. 2B) in the globular region of C1q B (residue 194) and C (residue 198) chains is known to form disulfide bonds with activator molecules, e.g. IgG(45.Martin H. Kaul M. Loos M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1641-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In adipoQ sequence, this cysteine is not conserved and is replaced by an aspartate residue. Another conserved cysteine (residue 180 for C1q C chain, marked # in Fig. 2B) that is important for the formation of disulfide bonds and the stabilization of triplex strands in the collagenous domain (37.Petry F. Reid K.B.M. Loos M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 46.Sim R.B. Reid K.B.M. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 307-311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) is also altered in adipoQ. In addition, an interruption (marked ∗ in Fig. 2B) in a collagenous motif found in C1q A (residue 61) and C (residue 65) chains is absent in adipoQ. These interruptions have been shown to be conserved between human and mice and result in a bend in the collagen triplex formation that can be observed under the electron microscope (47.Knobel H.R. Villinger W. Isliker H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1975; 5: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 48.Brodsky-Doyle B. Leonard K.R. Reid K.B.M. Bochem. J. 1976; 159: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These differences suggest that adipoQ may have structural and functional properties distinct from those of C1q.In an in vitro transcription and translation system, the adipoQ cDNA generates a protein of approximately 30 kDa in size (Fig. 2E). This is in agreement with the molecular mass predicted from the cDNA sequence.To test whether adipoQ is secreted, we constructed a flag-epitope tagged adipoQ and transiently transfected the DNA construct into NIH-3T3 cells. Western blot analysis (Fig. 2E) demonstrated that NIH-3T3 cells synthesized the adipoQ protein, and the protein is secreted into the medium.Differentiation-dependent Expression of AdipoQ mRNAWe next examined the expression of adipoQ mRNA during adipocyte differentiation. As was shown in Fig. 1B, a single mRNA species of approximately 1.3 kilobases was expressed in both 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 preadipocytes but not in fibroblastic 3T3-C2 cells. The expression of adipoQ mRNA was found to increase approximately 20-50-fold during adipocyte differentiation in both 3T3-F442A and 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Compared with the expression of early adipose differentiation markers such as lipoprotein lipase (9.Cornelius P. Enerback S. Bjursell G. Olivecrona T. Pekala P.H. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and PPAR-λ2 (26.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1983) Google Scholar), the expression of adipoQ mRNA is a late event in adipogenesis, first appearing at approximately day 4 after induction of differentiation. This kinetics is similar to"

The current study was undertaken to determine the transcriptional requirements for the induction of 92-kDa gelatinase B expression by an activated ras oncogene. Transfection of OVCAR-3 cells with an expression vector encoding an activated Ha-ras increased 92-kDa gelatinolytic activity and stimulated (over 10-fold) the activity of a CAT reporter driven by 670 nucleotides of 5‘ flanking sequence of the 92-kDa gelatinase B gene. Transient assays using a CAT reporter driven by 5‘ deleted fragments of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter indicated that a region spanning −634 to −531 was required for optimal induction of the promoter. The individual deletion, or mutation, of a PEA3/ets(−540) motif, AP-1 sites(−533, −79), a NF-κB(−600) consensus sequence, and a GT box(−52) substantially reduced the activation of the promoter by ras. An expression vector encoding the PEA3 transcription factor caused a 3-fold stimulation of the wild type but not the PEA3/ets-deleted 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter. Co-expression of a dominant negative c-jun antagonized the ras-dependent stimulation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter-driven CAT reporter. The signaling pathway mediating the induction of 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity by ras was examined. The expression of a phosphatase (CL100) which inactivates multiple mitogen-activated protein kinase members abrogated the stimulation of 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity by ras. However, the expression of a kinase-deficient mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK1) did not prevent the activation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter by ras and a constitutively activated c-raf expression vector was insufficient for 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activation. Thus, the stimulation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter by ras requires multiple elements including closely spaced PEA3/ets and AP-1 sites and is MEK1-independent.

The 92-kDa type IV matrix metalloproteinase (92-kDa gelatinase B also known as MMP-9) plays a major role in cell migration in both physiological and pathological processes (1.Bernhard E.J.

The 92-kDa gelatinase B is encoded by a 7.7-kilobase pair gene, which spans 13 exons(8.Huhtala P. Tuuttila A. Chow L. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

Mutation, or deletion, of the NF-κB, AP-1, and Sp1 motifs located 600, 79, and 558 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site, respectively, reduced or abolished the ability of tumor necrosis factor-α to stimulate the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter in OST osteosarcoma and HepG2 hepatoma cells(9.Sato H.

On the other hand, activation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter by v-src in HT 1080 fibrosarcoma cells was attributed to binding sites for AP-1(−79) and a Sp1-binding GT box at −52(10.Sato H.

Several lines of evidence suggest an important role for ras in the regulation of 92-kDa gelatinase B expression. First, the amount of this collagenase is increased by growth factors including transforming growth factor-α and epidermal growth factor (11.Lyons J. Birkedal-Hansen B. Pierson M.C. Whitelock J.M. Birkedal-Hansen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19143-19151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which via their transmembrane receptors, signal through the Ras GTP-binding protein(12.Stacey D.W. Roudebush M. Day R. Mosser S.D. Gibbs J.B. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2297-2304PubMed Google Scholar). Second, and equally important, the ras oncogene, itself, is a potent stimulus for 92-kDa gelatinase B secretion in rat embryo cells(13.Bernhard E.J. Muschel R.J. Hughes E.N. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3872-3877PubMed Google Scholar). However, while the role of ras in the regulation of this collagenase is clear, the events downstream of ras that lead to induction of 92-kDa gelatinase B synthesis have not been elucidated. ras can stimulate multiple signaling pathways(14.Minden A.

One of these involves the sequential activation of the serine-threonine kinase c-raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK1), and the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs)(18.Bruder J.T.

Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar) and ets(23.O'Neill E.M. Rebay I. Tjian R. Rubin G.M.

Alternatively, ras can modulate gene expression through other signaling pathways, which can be distinguished from each other on the basis of their utilization of the jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK)(25.Hibi M.

Accordingly, the purpose of the current study was twofold: first, to identify the cis acting elements in the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter that mediate the inductive effects of ras on the expression of this gene, and second, to examine the signaling events connecting ras with the nuclear regulators of 92-kDa gelatinase B expression. A 6.6-kilobase pair BamHI fragment from the activated c-Ha-rasEJ oncogene from T24 bladder carcinoma cells cloned into a pSV2 neo plasmid (28.Nicolson G.L. Gallick G.E. Dulski K. Spohn W.H. Lembo T.M. Tainsky M.A. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 747-753PubMed Google Scholar) was used for ras transfections. The TAM-67 vector, encoding a c-Jun protein lacking the transactivation domain (amino acids 3-122 absent) of the molecule, has been described elsewhere(29.Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E.

The 5‘ deleted fragment and mutated (−600 NF-κB mt; −558-Sp1 mt; −79 AP-1 mt, −52 GT mt) 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter CAT reporter constructs have been described previously(9.Sato H. Seiki M.

OVCAR-3 cells were transfected by a calcium phosphate method (33.Lengyel E. Stepp E. Gum R. Boyd D. J. Biol.

Transient transfections were performed in the presence of 4 μg of a β-galactosidase expression vector to correct for differences in transfection efficiencies. Briefly, DNA precipitate formed in the presence of 124 mM calcium chloride in a buffer (pH 7.1) containing 15 mM Hepes, 280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4 was added to 50% confluent OVCAR-3 cells. After 6 h, the cells were changed to fresh 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium and cultured for an additional 48 h. The cells were harvested and lysed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles in a buffer containing 0.25 M Tris-Cl, pH 7.8. Transfection efficiencies were determined by assaying for β-galactosidase activity. CAT activity was measured by incubating cell lysate (normalized for transfection efficiency) at 37°C for 8 h with 4 μM [14C]chloramphenicol and 1 mg/ml acetyl coenzyme A. After 4 h, the acetyl coenzyme A was replenished. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and acetylated products subjected to thin layer chromatography using chloroform:methanol (95:5) as a mobile phase. The amount of acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol was determined using a model 603 Betascope. These were performed as described previously (34.Lengyel E. Gum R. Juarez J. Clayman G. Seiki M. Sato H. Boyd D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 963-967PubMed Google Scholar). Culture supernatants were denatured in the absence of reducing agent and electrophoresed in a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin. The gel was incubated at room temperature for 2 h in the presence of 2.5% Triton X-100 and subsequently at 37°C overnight in a buffer containing 10 mM CaCl2, 0.15 M NaCl, and 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5). The gel was then stained for protein with 0.25% Coomassie and photographed on a light box. Proteolysis was detected as a white zone in a dark field. Point mutations and deletions of the 670-bp 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter sequence were generated using a Transformer™ kit from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) as described by the manufacturer. A unique AatII site was used as the selection restriction site and changed to a SacI site. Mutations were checked by restriction digestions and by the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method (35.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52055) Google Scholar) using Sequenase™ (Amersham Corp.). The mutations (lowercase) of the indicated transcription factor binding sites in context of 670 bp of 5‘ flanking sequence of the 92-kDa gelatinase B gene were generated and are as follows: −615 NF-κB mt represents a mutation (GGGGGTTGCCCC mutated to GcccGTTGCCCC) of the NF-κB-like site at −615; −540 PEA3 del designates a construct in which 10 bp (GGAGAGGAAG) including the PEA3/ets binding site at −540 was deleted; the AP-1 motif at −533 was mutated from TGAGTCA to TatGTCA generating the −533 AP-1 mt; −175-146 del designates a construct lacking the −175 to −146 nucleotide sequence. Other 92-kDa gelatinase B mutants were as described previously(9.Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We first determined if an activated ras was inductive for 92-kDa gelatinase B synthesis. OVCAR-3 cells, which lack a mutated ras, were transiently transfected with various amounts of an expression vector encoding an activated c-Ha-ras (H-ras) or, as a control, the empty expression vector (pSV2 neo). After 24 h, the cells were changed to serum-free medium and cultured for an additional 48 h. After this time, the conditioned medium was collected and the cells enumerated. Conditioned medium clarified by centrifugation was normalized for any difference in cell number and assayed for gelatinase activity by zymography. The activated ras, but not the empty expression vector (pSV2 neo), caused a dose-dependent increase in a gelatinase activity the size (92 kDa) of which was indistinguishable from that of 92-kDa gelatinase B (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a 72-kDa gelatinase activity, which was identical in size (36.Huhtala P. Chow L. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to that of the 72-kDa type IV collagenase (72-kDa gelatinase A), was unaltered by transfection with the mutated ras and served as an internal control for loading differences. Using identical transfection conditions, OVCAR-3 cells were co-transfected with a CAT reporter driven by the wild type 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter (MMP-9 CAT) and the ras expression vector or the empty vector (pSV2 neo). The cells were harvested 48 h later and assayed for CAT activity. 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity was activated 13-fold with 4 μg of the ras expression vector over that achieved with the empty expression vector (pSV2 neo), while 1 μg of the oncogene caused a 6-fold induction of promoter activity (Fig. 1B). These data suggested that the increased synthesis of 92-kDa gelatinase B brought about by the activated ras is likely a reflection of a trans-activation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter. To determine the region of the promoter required for its stimulation by ras, OVCAR-3 cells were transiently transfected with a CAT reporter driven by 5‘ deleted fragments (9.Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar) of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter and the ras expression construct (Fig. 2). The reporter driven by either 670 or 634 bp of 5‘ flanking sequence was strongly stimulated (16- and 13-fold, respectively) by ras. In contrast, CAT reporter activity was dramatically reduced to a 3-fold stimulation with 531 bp of 5‘ flanking sequence. A CAT reporter driven by 90 or 73 bp of 5‘ flanking sequence demonstrated little if any stimulation by ras over that achieved with the empty expression vector (pSV2 neo). Since deletion of the region from −634 to −531 was associated with a substantial reduction in the activation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter by ras, we questioned whether transcription factor binding sites in this part of the promoter were required for its maximal activation by the oncogene. A computer search of this part of the sequence (9.Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar) indicated the presence of a previously unrecognized PEA3/ets binding site(−540) followed by an AP-1 motif at −533. Since these juxtaposed motifs have been shown to be responsible for basal and inducible expression of type I collagenase (37.Auble D.T. Brinckerhoff C.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4629-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) as well as the urokinase-type plasminogen activator(38.Nerlov C. Rorth P. Blasi F. Johnsen M. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1583-1593PubMed Google Scholar), we determined the role of these motifs in the regulation of 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity by ras. Removal of either of these sites either by mutation, or by deletion, substantially impaired the stimulation of the promoter by ras (Fig. 3). Thus, whereas ras caused a 11-fold stimulation of the wild type 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter (MMP-9 wt), deletion of the PEA3/ets site at −540 (−540 PEA3 del) reduced this by about two-thirds (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter mutated at the AP-1 site at −533 (−533 AP-1 mt) was induced only 2-fold by ras. Additionally, a number of other transcription factor binding sites along the full length of the promoter were also required for its stimulation by ras. Thus, mutation of an Sp1 motif at −558 (−558 Sp1 mt), and an AP-1 binding site at −79 (−79 AP-1 mt) previously, shown to be required for the tumor necrosis factor-α- or phorbol ester-dependent stimulation (9.Sato H. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar) of 92-kDa gelatinase B, all substantially reduced the ability of ras to stimulate the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter (Fig. 3B). Also, the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter mutated at an NF-κB site at −600 (−600 NF-κB mt) was stimulated far less (Fig. 3A) than the wild type promoter. Mutation of an Sp1-binding GT box (−52 GT mt) located 52 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site and which is required for 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter stimulation by v-src(10.Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), practically abolished the induction by ras (Fig. 3B). The observation that 90 bp of 5‘ flanking sequence was insufficient for ras stimulation (Fig. 2), combined with the finding that mutation of the AP-1 site at −79 or the GT box at −52 abrogated ras stimulation, suggests that these motifs are required for but, by themselves, insufficient to mediate the ras induction of 92-kDa gelatinase B. An NF-κB-like motif (39.Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) located at −615 did not appear to be required for optimal 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity since mutation of this site (−615 NF-κB mt) did not diminish the stimulation by ras (Fig. 3A). We also found that deletion of a sequence spanning −175 to −146 (175-146 del), which was shown to mediate the induction of the osteopontin gene by ras(40.Guo X. Zhang P. Mitchell D.A. Denhardt D.T. Chambers A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 476-487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not impair the stimulation of 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity by the oncogene (Fig. 3B). The observation that the deletion of the PEA3/ets site at −540 impaired the stimulation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter by ras, suggested that this transcription factor binding site was mediating, at least in part, the induction by the oncogene. To further investigate this possibility, we determined if expression of the PEA3 transcription factor could itself stimulate the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter. OVCAR-3 cells were transiently transfected with a PEA3-encoding expression vector (PEA3 pcDNA3) and a CAT reporter driven by either the wild type 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter or the promoter that had the −540 PEA3/ets site deleted. Expression of PEA3 increased the activity of a CAT reporter driven by either a PEA3-containing promoter (TORU CAT) (41.Soudant N. Albagli O. Dhordain P. Flourens A. Stehelin D. Leprince D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B) or the wild type 92-kDa gelatinase B (MMP-9 wt) promoter (Fig. 4A). The induction of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter was more modest than that achieved with ras (3- compared with 15-fold), suggesting that other transcription factors are also required (as indicated by mutational analysis; Fig. 3) and/or that the mouse transcription factor is less effective than the human homologue(31.Xin J. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes & Dev. 1995; 6: 481-496Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 42.Higashino F. Yoshida K. Fujinaga Y. Kamio K. Fujinaga K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 547-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of the PEA3/ets site at −540 (−540 PEA3 del) in the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter completely abolished the stimulation by the ets family member and reduced the ras-dependent activation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter by over 80% (Fig. 4A). These data suggested that the stimulation of the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter by ras is mediated, in part, through a previously unrecognized PEA3/ets site located 540 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. The observation that mutations of the novel(−533) and previously described(−79) AP-1 binding sites in the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter countered the stimulation by ras suggested that trans-acting factors bound to either, or both, of these sequences were required in the induction. To investigate this possibility, we performed two experiments. First, we co-transfected OVCAR-3 cells with the 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter-driven CAT reporter, the ras expression vector, and an expression construct (TAM-67), which encodes a mutant c-jun that lacks amino acids 3-122(43.Brown P.H. Alani R. Preis L.H. Szabo E. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant protein inhibits AP-1-mediated processes through a quenching mechanism by inhibiting the function of endogenous Jun and/or Fos proteins(44.Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant jun antagonized the induction of 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter (MMP-9 CAT) activity by ras in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). The 10-fold stimulation by ras observed in the absence of the TAM-67 was reduced to a 3-fold induction in the presence of 7 μg of the vector encoding the mutant jun. We determined previously that in these cells TAM-67 reduces the activity of a CAT reporter driven by 3 AP-1 tandem repeats(33.Lengyel E. Stepp E. Gum R. Boyd D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23007-23012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Further evidence supporting a role for AP-1-binding factors in the regulation of 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity by ras comes from experiments which showed that in OVCAR-3 cells the oncogene also stimulated an AP-1 tandem repeat-driven CAT reporter (Fig. 5B). The AP-1-driven CAT reporter (3X AP1 pBLCAT) was weakly activated in OVCAR-3 cells, and this was substantially augmented in co-transfections with Ha-ras (9-fold) but not with the empty expression construct (pSV2 neo). Control experiments indicated that this stimulation was through the tandem AP-1 repeats, since ras was without effect on the activity of the same reporter construct which lacked the AP-1 repeats (pBLCAT) (Fig. 5B). These findings suggested that the induction of 92-kDa gelatinase B promoter activity by ras probably requires AP-1-binding transcription factors associating with one, or both, of the AP-1 sites located at −533 and at −79. Both Ets and AP-1 family members have been shown to be regulated by the dual activity mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)(22.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E.

We have investigated at the molecular level the antiestrogenic activity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). We show that the previously documented TCDD-mediated decrease in estradiol-inducible gene products such as cathepsin D (cat D) is due to a sharp decline in mRNA accumulation despite any change in estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA levels. The decline in cat D mRNA level is most likely due to a decrease in transcription of the cat D gene since TCDD blocks the ability of ER to transactivate from an estrogen response element. AhR is required for this activity as TCDD is no longer antiestrogenic in a mutant cell line that is deficient in functional AhR. We provide evidence that the loss of transactivation potential by ER in the presence of TCDD is due to a sharp decrease in its ability to bind to an estrogen response element. Reciprocally, estradiol treatment blocked TCDD-induced accumulation of CYP1A1 mRNA and AhR-mediated activation of the CYP1A1 promoter. This is due to the ability of liganded ER to interfere with the binding of AhR to the xenobiotic response element.

https://openalex.org/W2083230754,"In unstimulated cells, the transcription factor NF-κB is held in the cytoplasm in an inactive state by the inhibitor protein IκBα. Stimulation of cells results in rapid phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, thus releasing NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of responsive genes. Here we demonstrate that in cells where proteasomal degradation is inhibited, signal induction by tumor necrosis factor α results in the rapid accumulation of higher molecular weight forms of IκBα that dissociate from NF-κB and are consistent with ubiquitin conjugation. Removal of the high molecular weight forms of IκBα by a recombinant ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase and reactivity of the immunopurified material with a monoclonal antibody specific for ubiquitin indicated that IκBα was conjugated to multiple copies of ubiquitin. Western blot analysis of immunopurified IκBα from cells expressing epitope-tagged versions of IκBα and ubiquitin revealed the presence of multiple copies of covalently bound tagged ubiquitin. An S32A/S36A mutant of IκBα that is neither phosphorylated nor degraded in response to signal induction fails to undergo inducible ubiquitination <i>in vivo</i>. Thus signal-induced activation of NF-κB involves phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of IκBα, which targets the protein for rapid degradation by the proteasome and releases NF-κB for translocation to the nucleus."

https://openalex.org/W2058408742,"Antagonists of multiple chemokines could be more effective than inhibitors of specific chemokines for controlling cell migration and inflammation. To attempt to identify such antagonists we characterized a number of truncated analogs of regulated on activation normal T cell expressed protein (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3, and MCP-1. On the basis of their ability to compete for binding of their parent chemokines, three analogs were selected for cross-reactivity studies: RANTES (9-68), MCP-3 (10-76), and MCP-1 (9-76). These analogs bound to THP-1 monocytic cells with dissociation constants that were within 4-6-fold of their native counterparts, but they did not promote detectable chemotaxis of THP-1 cells or enzyme release from purified human monocytes. The RANTES (9-68) analog competed for the binding and inhibited the activities of all three chemokines. In contrast, native RANTES was specific for RANTES binding sites. However, truncation of either MCP-1 or MCP-3 did not change their respective binding specificity. MCP-3 and MCP-3 (10-76) competed for binding of all three labeled chemokines.

The aim of the present study is to generate and characterize receptor antagonists for CC chemokines. With defined antagonists we can test whether cellular infiltration and inflammatory disease progression is retarded in vivo and evaluate the possibility that antagonists could have therapeutic value. Previously we characterized a series of analogs of MCP-1 and found that some truncated forms were potent antagonists for MCP-1 in vitro(23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Other studies indicated that MCP-1 forms with deletions in the NH2-terminal region also had some antagonistic properties (24.Zhang Y.J. Rutledge B.J. Rollins B.J. J. Biol.

Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that different regions within the NH2-terminal domain are important for binding and activity. Based on this study, we hypothesized that modification of MCP-1 or other chemokines that bind to several different receptors may lead to antagonists that block multiple CC chemokine receptors. In this study we have compared truncated analogs of three potent CC chemokines, namely RANTES, MCP-3, and MCP-1, which have differing cellular and receptor specificity, but all stimulate monocytes and the THP-1 monocytic cell line(17.Uguccioni M.

Synthetic chemokines and their analogs were synthesized using tBoc chemistry on an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) 430A peptide synthesizer, folded by air oxidation, and purified using at least two steps of reverse phase HPLC as described (27.Clark-Lewis I.

The molecular mass of each was determine by electrospray mass spectrometry (27.Clark-Lewis I. Moser B. Walz A. Baggiolini M. Scott G.J. Aebersold R.

Peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from buffy coats supplied by the Central Laboratory of the Swiss Red Cross. Centrifugation on Ficoll-Paque was followed by centrifugation on a Percoll gradient(29.Colotta F. Peri G. Villa A. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 936-944PubMed Google Scholar). The final cell preparations consisted of 90-95% monocytes and 5-10% lymphocytes. The human monocytic cell line THP-1 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cell migration was evaluated by using Boyden microchambers (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD) as described for THP-1 cells (23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) and monocytes(17.Uguccioni M. D'Apuzzo M. Loetscher M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Eur J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), respectively. All determinations were performed in triplicate. The percentage of cell migration was calculated by dividing the mean number of migrating cells by the mean number of cells migrating in medium alone. The release of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase in response to stimulation of cytochalasin B-pretreated monocytes was determined as described previously(17.Uguccioni M. D'Apuzzo M. Loetscher M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Eur J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). For measuring antagonistic activity, the procedure was slightly modified. Briefly, the monocytes (1.2 × 106) that had been treated for 2 min with cytochalasin B (2.7 μg•ml-1) were exposed to the antagonist for 2 min and then stimulated with the appropriate agonist for 3 min. The final volume of the incubation mixture was 0.4 ml. Monocytes were loaded with Fura-2 (0.4 nmol Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester/106 cells) and then washed and stimulated, and the [Ca2+] changes were recorded as described previously(17.Uguccioni M. D'Apuzzo M. Loetscher M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Eur J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Antagonistic activity was assayed by sequential addition of antagonist and then agonist at a 1 min interval. MCP-1 and MCP-3 were labeled with monoiodinated Bolton-Hunter reagent (specific activity, 2,200 Ci•mmol-1; DuPont NEN) according to the method supplied. Briefly, 10 μg of MCP-1 was reacted with 1 mCi of 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent at 4°C in sodium borate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8.5) for 20 min. Labeled MCP-1 was separated from unreacted Bolton-Hunter reagent by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. The specific activity of the 125I-labeled MCP-1 and MCP-3 was 130 and 150 Ci•mmol-1, respectively. RANTES could not be labeled by the Bolton-Hunter method and therefore was labeled using lactoperoxidase. One mCi (3.7 MBq) of Na 125I (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) and 1 μg of lactoperoxidase (80-150 units•mg-1; Sigma) were added to 5 μg of RANTES in 50 μl of 0.5 M sodium acetate, pH 6.5, at room temperature for 3 min. Saturated tyrosine (150 μl) was added to stop the reaction, and the proteins were separated from the label by Sephadex G-25 chromatography. The specific activity of 125I-labeled RANTES was 260 Ci•mmol-1. The labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to establish that label was associated only with molecules of the apparent Mr of these proteins. They were also analyzed for functional activity to check that their biological potency was retained following labeling. Receptor binding of analogs was assayed by competition with 125I-labeled chemokines. First, the maximal binding of the labeled preparation was determined by measuring binding at saturating concentrations(30.Calvo J.C. Radicella J.P. Charreau E.H. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 259-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The bindability of the labeled proteins was about 20%. For binding assays, cells (5 × 106) were incubated with 4 nM of 125I-labeled chemokine and increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (10-10-10-5M) in 200 μl of RPMI medium, containing Hepes (25 mM), bovine serum albumin (10 mg•ml-1), and sodium azide (0.1%). The incubations were carried out for 30 min at 4°C, except for RANTES, which was incubated at room temperature due to its low solubility at 4°C. Cell-associated radioactivity was immediately separated by spinning the cells through a 2:3 mixture of diacetylphthalate and dibutylphthalate, and the cpm was determined. The cpm that specifically bound to cells was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific cpm (the cpm bound in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of the corresponding unlabeled chemokine) from the total cpm that was bound to the cells. Dissociation constants (Kd values) were determined by Scatchard analysis. A second low affinity class of binding sites (Kd > 2,000 nM) were apparent for some ligands; however, the specificity and significance of these is uncertain, and they were not included in the analysis. To characterize the antagonistic activity and specificity of NH2-terminally modified CC chemokine analogs, we synthesized several NH2-terminal variants of RANTES, MCP-3, and MCP-1. These included: RANTES (6-68), (7-68), (8-68), (9-68), and (10-68); MCP-3 (2-76), (8-76), (9-76), (10-76), and (11-76), and eleven truncated MCP-1 analogs that have been described previously(23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal sequences of these analogs are shown in Fig. 1. The yield of purified folded protein was in the 10-100 mg range, depending on the amount of peptide-resin synthesized (0.05-0.3 mmol corresponding to 0.5-2.0 g of unpurified peptide) and the yield obtained after reverse-phase HPLC purification. The measured molecular masses were consistent with the polypeptides having the expected composition. The average masses ± S.D., with the calculated mass minus the measured mass in parentheses, were: RANTES, 7847 ± 0.2 (−0.1); RANTES (10-68), 6909.6 ± 0.6 (−1.5); RANTES (9-68), 7006.3 ± 1.0 (−1.9); RANTES (8-68), 7108.7 ± 1.3 (−0.6); RANTES (7-68), 7210.3 ± 1.5 (−0.1); RANTES (6-68), 7324.3 ± 1.1 (−1.2); MCP-3, 8934.2 ± 1.5 (−1.3); MCP-3 (2-76), 8824.7 ± 0.9 (0.3); MCP-3 (8-76), 8242.8 ± 1.1 (0.1); MCP-3 (9-76), 8154.7 ± 0.8 (−0.9); MCP-3 (10-76), 8054.0 ± 1.2 (−0.5); MCP-1, 8662.6 ± 1.1 (−0.5); MCP-1 (9-76), 7971.2 ± 0.8 (−0.1). Based on preliminary studies of their competition for native ligand, RANTES (9-68), MCP-3 (10-76), and MCP-1 (9-76) were selected for further examination of their agonist and antagonist activities. In contrast to the full-length native forms, RANTES (9-68), MCP-3 (10-76) (Fig. 2), and MCP-1 (9-76) (23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) lacked detectable chemoattractant activity for human THP-1 monocytic cells. In addition, for human blood-derived monocytes, neither chemotaxis nor N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase release was detected up to 1 μM (not shown). RANTES (6-68), (7-68), (8-68), and (10-68) as well as MCP-3 (8-76), (9-76), and (11-76) also lacked activity (not shown). Thus, residues within the 1-5 region of RANTES and 1-7 region of MCP-3 are essential for their functional activities. Previously we had shown that residues within the 1-6 region of MCP-1 were critical for its chemoattractant activity and receptor activation(23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and analysis of the MCP-3 analogs showed that as with MCP-1 (2-76), MCP-3 (2-76) had greatly reduced activity, indicating that the NH2-terminal residue of both MCP-1 and MCP-3 is important for function (data not shown). RANTES (9-68), MCP-3 (10-76), and MCP-1 (9-76) were tested for their antagonist activities. Both inhibited the activity induced by the corresponding native forms. As shown in Fig. 3A, RANTES (9-68) fully blocked the chemoattractant activity of RANTES for THP-1 cells, and 41 nM was required to inhibit the agonist activity of 10 nM native RANTES by 50% (IC50 = 41 nM). Similar results were obtained for migration of peripheral blood monocytes (not shown). The ability of RANTES (9-68) to inhibit chemokine-induced exocytosis from human blood monocytes was assessed by measuring the release of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (Fig. 4A). A 10-fold lower concentration (IC50 = 4 nM) of RANTES (9-68) was required to inhibit RANTES-induced enzyme release than was needed for similar inhibition of chemotaxis (Table 1).Figure 4:Inhibition of monocyte exocytosis by the truncated analogs. Cells were stimulated with a constant concentration of either MCP-1 (10 nM) (•), MCP-3 (10 nM) (▲), or RANTES (30 nM) (▪) in the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations of RANTES (9-68) (A), MCP-3 (10-76) (B), and MCP-1 (9-76) (C). The release of N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase into the medium was then determined. The data are expressed as percentages of control (agonist alone) and represent the mean ± S.E. of values from three to five experiments performed with monocytes from different donors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TABLE 1TABLE 1 Receptor sharing and cross-binding is known to occur amongst of members of the CC family of chemokines. Because the truncated antagonists have lost a part of their structure that is important for receptor activation, it is reasonable to suggest that their receptor selectivity may be altered. To test the specificity of the three truncated antagonists, their ability to inhibit the activities induced by RANTES, MCP-3, and MCP-1 was examined. The RANTES (9-68) analog completely inhibited both MCP-3- and MCP-1-induced chemotaxis (Fig. 3A) and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase release (Fig. 4A). The respective IC50 values were 200 nM and 820 nM for chemotaxis and 170 nM and 220 nM for release activity (Table 1). Thus RANTES (9-68) inhibited all the chemokines, but it had the highest potency for RANTES. MCP-3 (10-76) was found to inhibit MCP-3-induced monocyte N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase release with an IC50 of 37 nM and also chemoattractant activity IC50 470 nM (Fig. 3B). Thus it was less potent than RANTES (9-68) for RANTES-stimulated release. However, MCP-3 (10-76) also inhibited RANTES- and MCP-1-induced activities with similar effectiveness to its inhibition of MCP-3 elicited function. Furthermore, MCP-3 (10-76) blocked enzyme release from monocytes (Fig. 4B). The IC50 values for both RANTES- or MCP-3-induced release were around 10-fold lower than for chemotaxis of either THP-1 cells (Table 1) or monocytes (not shown). Another MCP-3 variant, MCP-3 (9-76), was 2-3-fold more potent than MCP-3 (10-76) in all the inhibition assays (not shown). As shown in Fig. 3C and Table 1, MCP-1 (9-76) inhibited MCP-1-induced chemoattractant activity (IC50 = 72 nM) and was also a potent inhibitor of MCP-3 activity (IC50 = 51 nM). MCP-1 (9-76) did not inhibit RANTES promoted activity. MCP-1 (9-76) inhibited both MCP-1 and MCP-3 induced N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase release, but it did not block RANTES-elicited release, at least over the concentration range tested (Fig. 4C). Thus, the ability of MCP-1 (9-76) to inhibit migration and release was similar. Competition binding studies were performed to determine if the observed antagonist properties correlated with their interaction with chemokine binding sites. Because we wished to correlate inhibition of function with binding interactions, we used monocytic cells for both studies, rather than cells engineered to express single receptors. Thus we have measured chemokine binding sites rather than receptor molecules. Despite the presence of multiple receptors on these cells, the binding data always fitted a one site model, suggesting that either the receptors involved have similar affinities or the interaction with one receptor predominates. The RANTES (9-68) analog competed for binding of labeled RANTES as shown in Fig. 5A. From this data the dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated to be 19 nM. Furthermore, RANTES (9-68) also displaced both labeled MCP-3 (Kd = 57 nM) and MCP-1 (Kd = 120 nM) with moderate efficiency (Fig. 5, A-C, and Table 1). Although, as expected, native RANTES competed strongly for RANTES binding (Fig. 5A), its competition for labeled MCP-3 (Fig. 5B) and MCP-1 (Fig. 5C) was very weak and insufficient to derive a Kd value. Thus, truncation of RANTES resulted in a markedly increased affinity for both MCP-1 or MCP-3 binding sites. MCP-3 (10-76) competed for MCP-3 binding with a Kd of 57 nM (Fig. 5E and Table 1) and also competed for binding of both RANTES (Kd = 50 nM) and MCP-1 (Kd = 69 nM) (Fig. 5, D and F, and Table 1). The competition of the MCP-3 (10-76) analog for labeled MCP-3 was only 2-fold weaker than that of full-length MCP-3. For RANTES receptors, MCP-3 and MCP-3 (10-76) had about the same affinity. On the other hand, for MCP-1 receptors, MCP-3 (Kd = 13 nM) had about a 5-fold higher affinity than MCP-3 (10-76) (Kd = 69 nM). The results indicate that MCP-3 (10-76) had similar affinity for the binding sites of all three chemokines. Similar results were obtained with MCP-3 (9-76) (not shown). Consistent with previous observations(23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), MCP-1 (9-76) competed for binding of labeled MCP-1 with a Kd of 9 nM (Fig. 5I and Table 1). It also competed for binding of labeled MCP-3, although in this case the Kd (128 nM) was considerably higher (Fig. 5H and Table 1). MCP-1 (9-76) exhibited only weak binding (Kd = 340 nM) to RANTES receptors (Fig. 5G and Table 1). Thus, MCP-1 (9-76) had high affinity for MCP-1 binding sites but only low affinity for MCP-3 or RANTES binding sites. When MCP-1 and MCP-1 (9-76) were compared, they were similar in affinity for both MCP-3 and RANTES binding sites, but for MCP-1 binding sites, MCP-1 (9-76) was around 4-fold lower (Fig. 5, G-I, and Table 1). The cross-reactivity of RANTES (9-68) antagonist was unexpected and prompted us to evaluate other truncated RANTES analogs for their specificity. A series of five RANTES analogs was tested for inhibition of binding of labeled RANTES and MCP-1 (Fig. 6). There was a general correlation in the ability of the RANTES analogs to displace the two labeled chemokines, although for the (7-68), (8-68), and (9-68) analogs the Kd was around 10-fold higher for MCP-1 than for RANTES (Fig. 6). The order of the efficiency of displacement (low to high Kd) was: RANTES (9-68) > (8-68) > (7-68) = (10-68) > (6-68). Only RANTES (8-68) and (9-68) completely inhibited the binding of labeled MCP-1, with the 9-68 analog having a 5-fold higher binding affinity. Similar results were obtained when competition with labeled MCP-3 was tested. Thus, the results indicate that amongst the truncated RANTES analogs tested, RANTES (9-68) had the highest affinity for MCP-1, MCP-3, and RANTES binding sites. The truncated analogs RANTES (9-68), MCP-3 (10-76), and MCP-1 (9-76) were tested for their ability to inhibit the transient rise of [Ca2+]1 induced in monocytes by native RANTES, MCP-3, and MCP-1. As shown in Fig. 7, in all three cases the truncated analogs inhibited the [Ca2+]1 rise induced by the native chemokines. The most potent effect was observed with RANTES (9-68), which at 30 nM totally prevented the [Ca2+]1 changes induced by 10 nM RANTES. For inhibition of the responses to MCP-3 and MCP-1, markedly higher concentrations of the corresponding truncated analogs were required. At high concentration (1,000 nM), all truncated analogs also attenuated or even prevented the [Ca2+]1 changes induced by either of the three chemokines (Fig. 8). Interestingly, RANTES (9-68) markedly decreased the [Ca2+]1 induced by MCP-3 and MCP-1. In contrast, desensitization experiments indicate that native RANTES does not interact with the receptors that mediate MCP-1 responses in monocytes (17.Uguccioni M. D'Apuzzo M. Loetscher M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Eur J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).Figure 8:Cross-desensitization of the chemokine-induced [Ca2+]i rise by the truncated analogs. The truncated analogs were used at 1,000 nM, and the agonists were used at 10 nM. One of three similar experiments is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Antagonists for three CC chemokines, RANTES, MCP-3, and MCP-1, were identified and further characterized to determine their specificity as inhibitors of chemokine functions and correlate this with their selectivity for receptor binding sites. These antagonists, RANTES (9-68), MCP-3 (10-76), and MCP-1 (9-76) were selected because of their high affinity for binding sites on monocytic cells. The affinity of full-length RANTES for MCP-3 and MCP-1 binding sites was marginal at the highest concentration tested. However, the binding affinity of RANTES (9-68) to sites for both was considerably higher. MCP-3 differed in that it bound to cellular sites for all three ligands with comparable affinity. Furthermore, the MCP-3 antagonist also bound to these sites, but it did not have high affinity for any of the chemokine binding sites, including MCP-3. MCP-1 had high affinity for MCP-1 sites but competed only very weakly for RANTES or MCP-3 binding sites. However, truncation of MCP-1, unlike RANTES, did not reveal a significant change in affinity for MCP-3 and RANTES sites. The ability to inhibit function correlated with the binding data. The truncated analogs of RANTES or MCP-3 blocked the activities of all three chemokines. The inhibitory potency of RANTES (9-68) for MCP-3 and MCP-1 activity was lower than for native RANTES. The MCP-3 antagonist had the same broad specificity as the parent agonist, but overall it did not have high potency. Subsequent experiments indicated that MCP-3 (9-76) was 2-3-fold more potent than MCP-3 (10-76) in its inhibition of function. Thus, as was the case for MCP-1(23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), the MCP-3 (9-76) analog was the optimal truncated antagonist (not shown). When the inhibitory activities of RANTES (9-68) and MCP-3 (10-76) are compared, the RANTES analog was more potent for RANTES, the MCP-3 analog was more potent for MCP-1, and both inhibited MCP-3. On average, for all three chemokines, the RANTES (9-68) was the most effective antagonist. The results for binding and inhibition of function were consistent with the data for desensitization of calcium induction. The truncated analogs attenuated or blocked the calcium response to all three ligands with the RANTES (9-68) being the most effective. This suggests a probable link between the equilibrium binding, the inhibition of intracellular signaling events, and the inhibition of the functional responses. RANTES (9-68) was a particularly potent inhibitor of monocyte release activity with only 4 nM required to inhibit 30 nM RANTES by 50%. In contrast, 19 nM (9-68) was required to displace 5 nM of labeled RANTES from THP-1 cells in the receptor binding studies. The reasons for this difference are not known. One possible explanation is that the binding studies were done with THP-1 cells, whereas the release activity was measured on human peripheral blood monocytes, and therefore different receptors may be involved. However, against this is the observation that the inhibition of RANTES-induced migration of both THP-1 cells and monocytes was similar (not shown). THP-1 cells did not show detectable exocytosis in response to chemokines so the release activities could not be compared. In addition, functionally important but low abundance receptors may not be detected in the binding studies. These findings clearly indicate that the RANTES analog is binding to receptor(s) that are not accessible to native RANTES. Truncation of RANTES has resulted in decreased binding selectivity, which could be due to loss of residues that normally prevent it from binding to other receptors, for example, by a steric hindrance mechanism. For the series of RANTES analogs with between 5 and 9 residues deleted, the affinity for RANTES, MCP-1, and MCP-3 binding sites correlated, suggesting that the determinants of receptor specificity are located within residues 1-6. However, for MCP-1 there was no difference in the selectivity of the full-length or the truncated analog, suggesting that the determinants of its receptor specificity are located elsewhere in the protein. The selectivity and affinity of the antagonists can probably be modified by alterations to residues outside the NH2-terminal motif. Nevertheless the results clearly demonstrate that the binding selectivity of RANTES can be modified to generate multiple chemokine antagonists. The observation that RANTES (9-68) has 50-fold higher affinity than RANTES (10-68) demonstrates that residue 9 contributes to the receptor binding of the RANTES antagonist. However, residues within the (10-68) domain also contribute to binding, because the (10-68) analog did bind, but the RANTES (1-9) peptide did not. Analogs that had residues 6-8 of RANTES intact had decreased binding. One possibility is that flexibility of residues 6-8 region results in loss of binding. For all three chemokines 1 or 2 residues NH2-terminal to the first cysteine were required for optimal binding and antagonist activity. In a previous investigation of MCP-1 analogs, we concluded that residues 1-6 were critical for receptor activation and function and residues 7-10 were important for receptor binding. The current findings for RANTES and MCP-3 are consistent with the model for receptor interactions proposed for MCP-1 (23.Gong J.-H. Clark-Lewis I. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Our findings can be interpreted in terms of interactions with known receptor proteins. The RANTES response could be due to interactions with three known RANTES receptors, CKR-1, CKR-3, or K5-5. The truncated RANTES analog is likely to be also interacting with the CKR-2 protein, which has been shown to bind MCP-1 (14.Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and MCP-3 (15.Franci C. Wong L.M. Van Damme J. Proost P. Charo I.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6511-6517PubMed Google Scholar) but not RANTES(14.Charo I.F. Myers S.J. Herman A. Franci C. Connolly A.J. Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2752-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). MCP-3 also binds to CKR-1(12.Combadiere C. Ahuja S.K. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16491-16494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13.Ben-Baruch A. Xu L. Young P.R. Bengail K. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22123-22128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which is well known to be a receptor for RANTES (9-11). Thus the observations with both MCP-3 and the MCP-3 antagonist could be explained by their interaction with these two receptors. MCP-1 and MCP-1 (9-76) responses are likely to be due to interactions with the CKR-2 receptor. The weak binding to RANTES binding sites may be due to low level cross-reactivity with CKR-2 or binding to K5-5. It is possible that not all the receptors on monocytes are represented on THP-1 cells, and therefore some receptor interactions were not included in our binding studies. Conversely, these antagonists may also interact with receptors that are only found on other cell types. An argument could be made that a general chemokine antagonist would be the most effective anti-inflammatory molecule. Inflammation involves the infiltration of multiple cell types that is likely to occur through the interaction of different chemokines with distinct functional receptors. Blocking the infiltration of multiple effector cells could be highly effective in breaking the inflammatory cycle. Further experiments are required to test this idea. It remains to be determined which other chemokines are inhibited and to which receptor proteins they bind. Our aim was to correlate binding with inhibition of chemokine-induced function, therefore we used chemokine-responsive cells for the binding studies rather than cell lines engineered to over-express single receptors. However, to determine which receptors the antagonists bind, experiments with individual receptors are required. It will be important to know the effects of the antagonists on other cells such as basophils, eosinophils, and T lymphocytes. The chemokine antagonists described here are potent enough to demonstrate their effects in disease models and thus establish a precedent for the usefulness of chemokine receptor antagonists as anti-inflammatory agents.

By this latter procedure five mutated tetrameric holoenzymes were obtained as judged from their subunit composition, sedimentation coefficient on sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and increased activity toward a specific peptide substrate as compared with the isolated α subunits. The kinetic constants and the phosphorylation efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of all the mutants with the parent peptide RRRADDSDDDDD and a series of derivatives, in which individual aspartic acids were replaced by alanines, have been determined. Three mutants, namely K74A,K75A,K76A,K77A; K79A,R80A, K83A; and R191A,R195A,K198A display dramatically lower phosphorylation efficiency and 8-50-fold higher Km values with the parent peptide, symptomatic of reduced attitude to bind the peptide substrate as compared with CK2 wild type. Such differences either disappear or are attenuated if the mutants R191A,R195A, K198A; K79A,R80A,K83A; and K74A,K75A,K76A,K77A are assayed with the peptides RRRADDSADDDD, RRRADDSDDADD, and RRRADDSDDDAA, respectively. In contrast, the phosphorylation efficiencies of the other substituted peptides decrease more markedly with these mutants than with CK2 wild type. These data show that one or more of the basic residues clustered in the 191-198, 79-83, and 74-77 sequences are implicated in the recognition of the acidic determinants at positions +1, +3, and +4/+5, respectively, and that if these residues are mutated, the relevance of the other acidic residues surrounding serine is increased. In contrast the other two mutants, namely R228A and R278A,K279A, R280A, display with all the peptides Vmax values higher than CK2 wild type, counterbalanced however by somewhat higher Kmvalues. It can be concluded from these data that all the five mutations performed are compatible with the reconstitution of tetrameric holoenzyme, but all of them influence the enzymatic efficiency of CK2 to different extents. Although the basic residues mutated in the 74-77, 79-83, and 191-198 sequences are clearly implicated in substrate recognition by interacting with acidic determinants at variable positions downstream from serine, the other basic residues seem to play a more elusive and/or indirect role in catalysis. Five mutants of protein kinase CK2 α subunit in which altogether 14 basic residues were singly to quadruply replaced by alanines (K74A,K75A,K76A,K77A; K79A, R80A,K83A; R191A,R195A,K198A; R228A; and R278A, K279A,R280A) have been purified to near homogeneity either as such or after addition of the recombinant β subunit. By this latter procedure five mutated tetrameric holoenzymes were obtained as judged from their subunit composition, sedimentation coefficient on sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, and increased activity toward a specific peptide substrate as compared with the isolated α subunits. The kinetic constants and the phosphorylation efficiencies (Vmax/Km) of all the mutants with the parent peptide RRRADDSDDDDD and a series of derivatives, in which individual aspartic acids were replaced by alanines, have been determined.

https://openalex.org/W2089582261,"STATs (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) comprise a family of transcription factors that reside in the cytoplasm of resting cells. In response to a variety of stimuli, STATs become tyrosine-phosphorylated and translocate to the nucleus where they mediate transcriptional regulation. We have used the 3T3-L1 murine cell line to examine the expression of STAT proteins as a function of their differentiation into adipocytes. The expression of STATs 1, 3, and 5, but not of STAT 6, is markedly elevated in adipocytes as compared with their fibroblast precursors. Exposure of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) blocks their differentiation into adipocytes. Therefore, we examined STAT expression as a function of differentiation in the presence of this cytokine. The expression of STATs 1 and 5 is markedly attenuated in the presence of TNFα, whereas STAT 3 expression is unaffected by this treatment. Only STAT 1 is down-regulated by TNFα in fully differentiated cells. Thus, although the expression of STATs 1, 3, and 5 is markedly enhanced upon differentiation, only STAT 5 expression is tightly correlated with the adipocyte phenotype. These data suggest that STAT 5, and possibly STAT 1, could be potential inducers of tissue-specific genes, which contribute to the development and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype.

The 3T3-L1 cell line differentiates under the controlled conditions of cell culture from fibroblasts, or preadipocytes, into cells with the morphological and biochemical properties of adipocytes (Green and Kehinde, 6.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (746) Google Scholar; Green and Kehinde, 7.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) in a process that closely resembles the development of adipose tissue in vivo. Upon differentiation, these cells acquire sensitivity to hormones and exhibit a coordinate increase in the activities of numerous enzymes in the lipolytic, lipogenic, and glycolytic pathways (Smas and Sul, 16.Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To date, members of two transcription factor families, C/EBP (C/AAAT Enhancer Binding Proteins) and PPAR (Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors) have been shown to be induced during adipocyte differentiation and are thought to play a significant role in the regulation of fat-specific gene expression. The STAT (Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription) family of transcription factors is comprised of six family members (STATs 1-6) that, in response to stimulation of various receptors, mainly those for cytokines, are phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, which causes their translocation to the nucleus. Each STAT family member shows a distinct pattern of activation by cytokines, has a unique tissue distribution, and upon nuclear translocation can regulate the transcription of particular genes (Schindler and Darnell, 13.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar; Ihle, 9.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). The likely order of events for STAT activation can be described as follows: 1) ligand binding of cell surface receptor; 2) receptor association with a JAK (Janus kinase) kinase family member; 3) JAK tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins; 4) dimerization of the STATs; 5) translocation to the nucleus; and 6) DNA binding. STATs have been shown to bind at least three different consensus sequences, and this binding regulates the transcription of specific genes (Schindler and Darnell, 13.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar; Ihle, 9.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). One of the first identified inhibitors of adipocyte differentiation was tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα), 1The abbreviations used are: TNFαtumor necrosis factor-αDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumC/EBPC/AAAT enhancer binding proteinPPARperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a cytokine that elicits a wide range of biological effects including the regulation of growth and differentiation. In addition, TNFα has been shown to down-regulate the insulin responsiveness of fully differentiated adipocytes (Stephens and Pekala, 17.Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hotamisligil et al. 8.Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6193) Google Scholar). Because regulation of the STATs is mainly cytokine-mediated, TNFα could be a mediator of STAT expression during and/or after adipocyte differentiation. Most of the studies on the STAT family of transcription factors have focused on their tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding. In this report, we demonstrate that another level of regulation of these proteins exists as they are induced during the differentiation of adipose cells in culture. Moreover, we demonstrate that inhibition of differentiation by TNFα completely suppresses the expression of two STAT family members. We interpret these data to indicate that STAT family members may play a role in the regulation of genes that contribute to the phenotype of the mature adipocyte. tumor necrosis factor-α Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal bovine serum C/AAAT enhancer binding protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured, maintained, and differentiated as described previously (Cornelius et al., 3.Cornelius P. Marlowe M. Lee M.D. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20506-20516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated and grown to 2 days postconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf bovine serum. Differentiation was then induced by changing the medium to DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 1.7 μM insulin. After 48 h, the differentiation medium was replaced with maintenance medium containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. The maintenance medium was changed every 48 h until the cells were utilized for experimentation. Human recombinant TNFα (Quality Control Biochemical) was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% fatty acid-free and growth factor-depleted bovine serum albumin (Sigma). Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (150-175 g) by collagenase digestion as described (Rodbell, 12.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell fractionation was performed as described previously (Simpson et al., 15.Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), and the cytosol fraction was used for Western blotting. 3T3-L1 cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested in a buffer containing 25 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μM pepstatin, 50 trypsin inhibitory milliunits of aprotinin, and 10 μM leupeptin. Protein content for whole cell extracts and rat cytosol were determined using a BCA kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated in 7.5% polyacrylamide (acrylamide from National Diagnostics) gels containing SDS according to Laemmli (Laemmli, 10.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) in 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, and 20% methanol. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked in 4% milk for 1 h at room temperature. The STAT antibodies were monoclonal IgGs purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Results were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). The expression in adipocytes of the various STAT proteins, as detected by Western blot, is depicted in Fig. 1. The profile in panel A illustrates that STAT 1, STAT 3, STAT 5, and STAT 6 have similar levels of expression in the whole cell extracts from 3T3-L1 cultured murine adipocytes (lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10) and from the cytosol of rat epididymal fat cells (lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11). The third lane of each panel shows STAT expression in cellular extracts (provided by Transduction Laboratories) from cells known to express these proteins at substantial levels (lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12). It can be seen that STAT expression in adipocyte extracts was equivalent to or greater than cells known to express these proteins. The expression of STAT 4 protein was undetectable in either cultured adipocytes or adipose tissue when compared with positive controls (data not shown), and species-specific antibodies for STAT 2 are not commercially available at this time. Panel A also illustrates that the 91- and 84-kDa proteins of STAT 1, reported as alternatively spliced products of the same gene (Schindler et al. 13.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), were detectable in both cultured adipocytes and adipose tissue. The monoclonal antibody for STAT 5 reacted with three protein products from cultured adipocytes (best illustrated in Fig. 3). The 96- and 94-kDa doublet has been consistently identified in various other cell types and postulated to be alternatively spliced gene products of STAT 5 (Schindler and Darnell, 13.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). The higher molecular mass band at 110 kDa has been speculated to be a phosphorylated form of STAT 5 (Barahmand-pour et al., 1.Barahmand-pour F. Meinke A. Eilers A. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Decker T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Alternatively, this protein product could be another form of STAT 5 or even an unidentified STAT family member. Monoclonal antibodies for STAT 3 and STAT 6 reacted with single protein products with molecular masses of 92 and 100 kDa, respectively. Panel B of Fig. 1 depicts the expression of STAT proteins in 3T3-L1 cells before and after differentiation into adipocytes. As previously reported, the fully differentiated phenotype is attained 6-8 days following the addition of an induction mixture to the cell medium of postconfluent preadipocytes (Green and Kehinde, 6.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1974; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 7.Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1976; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). As illustrated in panel B, STAT 1 and STAT 5 proteins were dramatically elevated after differentiation, and STAT 3 was expressed at a greater level in adipocytes as compared with preadipocytes, whereas STAT 6 was unchanged. The correlation of STAT protein expression with adipocyte differentiation is further depicted in Figure 2:, Figure 3: where the protein amounts were measured during the time course of differentiation. As shown in Fig. 2, STAT 1, STAT 3, and STAT 5 proteins were minimally expressed in preadipocytes (0 h), similar to that illustrated in panel B of Fig. 1. The level of all three STAT proteins was increased 6-12 h following the addition of the differentiation mixture to the cell medium of postconfluent preadipocytes. STAT 3 protein expression plateaued approximately 36 h following the induction of differentiation and remained at this level throughout the time course. On the other hand, STAT 1 and STAT 5 protein amounts decreased between 24 and 72 h, then increased by 96 h, and remained significantly elevated over the amount of protein expressed in preadipocytes. This transient down-regulation of STAT 1 and STAT 5 was observed in four independent experiments. The amount of STAT 6 did not vary as a function of differentiation.Figure 3:STAT expression during 3T3-L1 differentiation (-/+ TNFα). Whole cell extracts were prepared from 3T3-L1 cells at various times following the induction of differentiation in the presence and absence of TNFα. Cells were induced to differentiate as described in Fig. 2, except that TNFα (1 nM) was added to the differentiation mixture of some cells. Fifty μg of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, subjected to Western blot analysis, and visualized as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 3 illustrates STAT protein expression over a 7-day period, which was sufficient to allow for the development of the fully differentiated adipocyte phenotype. This time course was also performed in the presence of TNFα, a cytokine known to inhibit adipose conversion as judged by triacylglycerol accumulation and inhibition of expression of fat-specific genes (Torti et al., 21.Torti F.M. Torti S.V. Larrick J.W. Ringold G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1105-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As in the previous figures, STAT 1, STAT 3, and STAT 5 protein amounts increased with time, while STAT 1 and STAT 5 were transiently decreased during the early phases of differentiation. The lower molecular mass protein present in the STAT 3 panel likely represents cross-reaction with the 84-kDa protein of STAT 1 (Bonni et al., 2.Bonni A. Frank D.A. Schindler C. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1575-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, Fig. 3 shows that inhibition of differentiation by TNFα completely obliterated the increase in STAT 1 and STAT 5 expression without affecting STAT 3. Again, STAT 6 expression was unaffected under all conditions. The suppression of STAT 1 and STAT 5 expression could be due to a direct down-regulation by TNFα rather than by the events involved in the differentiation process. To test for this possibility, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were fully differentiated (8 days after the induction of differentiation) and then treated with TNFα over a time course known to effect the regulation of genes such as the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT4) and the fat-specific lipid binding protein (aP2/422) (Stephens and Pekala, 17.Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Stephens and Pekala, 18.Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13580-13584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 illustrates that treatment of fully differentiated adipocytes with TNFα resulted in a specific and significant decrease in STAT 1 protein levels. After 96 h exposure to TNFα, there was a 90% decrease in STAT 1 expression whereas STATs 3, 5, and 6 were completely unaffected by this treatment. Members of the STAT family have been well documented to regulate gene expression following their activation by cytokines and other stimuli (Schindler and Darnell, 13.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar; Ihle, 9.Ihle J.N. Nature. 1995; 377: 591-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). Moreover, the tissue distribution of each STAT is unique suggesting that the regulation of tissue-specific genes may be a physiological role for these proteins. Here, we provide indirect support for this hypothesis by demonstrating that STATs 1, 3, and 5 are induced during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells from fibroblasts to adipocytes. This expression does not appear to be an artifact of the cell culture system, as these same proteins are readily detectable in rat adipose cells. The induction of these family members during adipocyte differentiation indicates that this family of transcription factors can be regulated at the level of their expression as well as by their cytokine-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. To date, two families of transcription factors, the C/AAAT enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARs), have been shown to be induced during adipocyte differentiation and to play a significant role in the regulation of fat-specific genes. C/EBPα is induced late (60-96 h) during 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and has been shown to regulate the transcription of a number of fat-specific genes (Cornelius et al., 4.Cornelius P. MacDougald O.A. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1994; 14: 99-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Expression of C/EBPα in fibroblast cell lines can promote adipogenesis (Freytag et al., 5.Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1654-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), while expression of C/EBPα antisense RNA blocks the differentiation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and the expression of some fat-specific genes (Lin and Lane, 11.Lin F.-T. Lane M.D. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). PPARγ is a recently cloned member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor family and has been identified as a component of the adipogenic transcription factor complex (ARF6), which regulates transcription of the fat-specific gene aP2/422 (Tontonoz et al., 19.Tontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar). PPARγ is expressed primarily in adipocytes and is induced very early in the process of adipocyte differentiation. Like C/EBPα, when ectopically expressed in a number of fibroblast cell lines, PPARγ can induce adipogenesis (Tontonoz et al., 1994b). We show here that three members of the STAT family of transcription factors, STATs 1, 3, and 5, are induced during differentiation in a manner similar to C/EBPα and PPARγ. Therefore, these STATs could potentially play a critical role in both the development of the adipose phenotype and the regulation of expression of fat-specific genes. Since STAT 1 and STAT 5 are highly induced during differentiation and their accumulation is repressed when differentiation is inhibited, it is likely that these STAT family members could be transcriptional regulators involved in the development and/or maintenance of the adipose phenotype. However, the repression of STAT 1 and STAT 5, which occurs when inhibiting differentiation with TNFα, could be due to a direct effect of TNFα on STAT expression. In fact, this may be the case for STAT 1 whose expression is severely down-regulated when fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes are exposed to prolonged TNFα treatment (Fig. 4, see also, next paragraph). TNFα has no effect on STAT 5 accumulation in fully differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 4), and STAT 5 expression strongly correlates with the degree of adipocyte differentiation when this process is manipulated by subtraction of differentiation mixture elements (data not shown). STAT 3 expression is increased upon conversion of preadipocytes to adipocytes (Fig. 2), but its induction is not inhibited with TNFα, which also inhibits differentiation (Fig. 3), thus suggesting that its increased expression is unrelated to this process. However, STAT 3 is still likely to have a function in the terminally differentiated adipocyte as it is clearly present in the fully differentiated adipocytes and in rat fat cells (Fig. 1). STAT 1 expression also correlates with the degree of adipocyte differentiation, albeit to a lesser extent than STAT 5 (data not shown). The transient down-regulation of STAT 1 and STAT 5 during differentiation occurs between 24 and 72 h after the induction of differentiation. This time frame overlaps with the presence of the differentiation-inducing mixture (0-48 h), and it is possible that the combination of hormones present in the mixture may be responsible for this temporary down-regulation of STAT 1 and STAT 5 protein levels, either directly or indirectly, by inducing the expression of some additional effector (inhibitor) of STAT expression. We are currently examining the effects of specific components of the induction mixture on STAT expression during differentiation. Exposure of fully differentiated adipocytes to TNFα results in a highly specific and significant decrease in STAT 1 expression (Fig. 4). As previously shown, this exposure to TNFα did not result in dedifferentiation or a loss of lipid content (Stephens and Pekala, 1991). Recent studies have demonstrated that TNFα treatment of fully differentiated cultured adipocytes results in insulin resistance, which is accompanied by the down-regulation of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT4) and the insulin receptor (Stephens and Pekala, 17.Stephens J.M. Pekala P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21839-21845Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Hotamisligil et al., 8.Hotamisligil G.S. Shargill N.S. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1993; 259: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (6193) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the observed decrease in STAT 1 parallels the TNFα-induced repression of GLUT4. 3J. M. Stephens, R. F. Morrison, and P. F. Pilch, unpublished observation. Given that the induction of STAT 1 expression is concomitant with the acquisition of insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and is down-regulated by TNFα in a condition of insulin resistance, we hypothesize that STAT 1 expression and function may be contributing to the regulation of genes involved in insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We are in the process of experimentally addressing this and other hypotheses concerning the physiological role of STATs 1, 3, and 5 in adipocyte differentiation and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W2053622356,"The reaction of long lived proteins with reducing sugars has been implicated in the pathophysiology of aging and age-related diseases. A likely intranuclear source of reducing sugar is ADP-ribose, which is generated following DNA damage from the turnover of ADP-ribose polymers. In this study, ADP-ribose has been shown to be a potent histone glycation and glycoxidation agent in vitro. Incubation of ADP-ribose with histones H1, H2A, H2B, and H4 at pH 7.5 resulted in the formation of ketoamine glycation conjugates. Incubation of histone H1 with ADP-ribose also rapidly resulted in the formation of protein carboxymethyllysine residues, protein-protein cross-links, and highly fluorescent products with properties similar to the advanced glycosylation end product pentosidine. The formation of glycoxidation products was related to the degradation of ketoamine glycation conjugates by two different pathways. One pathway resulted in the formation of protein carboxymethyllysine residues and release of an ADP moiety containing a glyceric acid fragment. A second pathway resulted in the release of ADP, and it is postulated that this pathway is involved in the formation of histone-histone cross-links and fluorescent advanced glycosylation end products. The reaction of long lived proteins with reducing sugars has been implicated in the pathophysiology of aging and age-related diseases. A likely intranuclear source of reducing sugar is ADP-ribose, which is generated following DNA damage from the turnover of ADP-ribose polymers. In this study, ADP-ribose has been shown to be a potent histone glycation and glycoxidation agent in vitro. Incubation of ADP-ribose with histones H1, H2A, H2B, and H4 at pH 7.5 resulted in the formation of ketoamine glycation conjugates. Incubation of histone H1 with ADP-ribose also rapidly resulted in the formation of protein carboxymethyllysine residues, protein-protein cross-links, and highly fluorescent products with properties similar to the advanced glycosylation end product pentosidine. The formation of glycoxidation products was related to the degradation of ketoamine glycation conjugates by two different pathways. One pathway resulted in the formation of protein carboxymethyllysine residues and release of an ADP moiety containing a glyceric acid fragment.

https://openalex.org/W1986651793,"An important feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the cerebral deposition of amyloid. The main component of the amyloid is a 39-44-amino acid residue protein called amyloid β (Aβ), which also exists as a normal protein in biological fluids, known as soluble Aβ. A major risk factor for late-onset AD is the inheritance of the apolipoprotein (apo) E4 isotype of apoE. How apoE is involved in the pathogenesis of AD is unclear; however, evidence exists for a direct apoE/Aβ interaction. We and others have shown that apoE copurifies with Aβ from AD amyloid plaques and that under certain in vitro conditions apoE promotes a β-sheet structure in Aβ peptides. Currently we document the high affinity binding of Aβ peptides to both human recombinant apoE3 and -E4 with a KD of 20 nM. This interaction is greatly influenced by the conformational state of the Aβ peptide used. Furthermore, we show that the fibril modulating effect of apoE is also influenced by the initial secondary structure of the Aβ peptide. The preferential binding of apoE to Aβ peptides with a β-sheet conformation can in part explain the copurification of Aβ and apoE from AD amyloid plaques.

https://openalex.org/W1595553176,"Based on the multidomain structure of the bacterial Pseudomonas exotoxin A, a recombinant fusion protein was constructed which serves as a target cell-specific carrier for the transfer of DNA via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The protein consists of three functional domains: 1) an ErbB-2 -specific single chain antibody confers target cell specificity, 2) the exotoxin A translocation domain facilitates endosome escape, and 3) a DNA binding domain derived from the yeast GAL4 protein enable sequence-specific high affinity binding to DNA. Carrier protein purified from bacterial lysates displayed both ErbB-2-specific and DNA sequence-specific binding in vitro. Complexes which formed spontaneously by the interaction of the fusion protein with a luciferase reporter gene construct carrying a GAL4-specific recognition sequence, after condensation of the DNA and compensation of excess negative charge with poly-L-lysine were able to transfect ErbB-2-expressing cells in vitro in a cell-specific manner. Transient expression of the luciferase gene driven by the SV40 early promoter was observed and correlates with the amount of carrier protein in the complex. Truncated forms of the carrier protein lacking either the cell recognition domain or the translocation domain failed to facilitate efficient DNA transfer."

INTRODUCTIONInterferons are a group of multifunctional cytokines that regulate cellular antiviral, anti-tumor, and immunological responses(1.Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C.

Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Products of ISGs carry out the biological effects of IFNs(2.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Type I (α, β) and type II (γ) IFNs employ distinct receptors for eliciting cellular responses(2.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical approaches identified molecular pathways that regulate ISG expression ((3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar) and references therein). IFN-α/β-regulated genes are regulated through a promoter motif called the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)(3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). IFN-γ stimulates ISGs using a wide variety of elements(2.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Foremost of these is the γ-IFN-activated site (GAS). A primary regulatory factor, ISGF-3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor-3), is essential for gene induction by IFN-α/β. ISGF-3 is a heteromeric factor consisting of four proteins: p48, p84, p91, and p113. Cells lacking this factor or its components fail to respond to IFNs(3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). Binding of IFN-α/β to their receptor(s) activates two nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and TYK2, that rapidly phosphorylate cytoplasmic p84, p91, and p113, also known as STAT (signal transducing activators of transcription) proteins, at specific tyrosine residues (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). These phosphoproteins migrate to the nucleus and associate with p48, the major DNA binding protein, to induce gene expression. p91, p84, and p113 are known as STAT1α, STAT1β, and STAT2, respectively (3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). Ligand-bound IFN-γ receptor associates with two protein tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK2, that subsequently phosphorylate STAT1α. This protein migrates to the nucleus, binds to GAS or GAS-like elements, and stimulates transcription(3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar). Studies with mutant cells have shown that in a cell mutant lacking STAT1, expression of STAT1α alone restores normal IFN-α/β and IFN-γ responses. Thus, JAK1 and STAT1 are shared components for all IFN signaling pathways(3.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4950) Google Scholar).Retinoids are a group of vitamin A-related compounds with profound influences on cell growth and differentiation(4.Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar). A prototype of these is all-trans-retinoic acid (RA), a natural metabolite. Upon entry into cells, RA binds to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RAR), which then associate with RA response elements (RARE) to stimulate target gene expression(5.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). Multiple RAR isotypes such as α, β, and γ and corresponding subtypes are present in the cells that create a complex pattern of gene regulation. A novel receptor, retinoid X receptor (RXR), is preferentially activated by 9-cis-RA. Similar to the RARs, three isotypes of RXRs and corresponding subtypes have been described(5.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). RXRs heteromerize to serve as auxiliary activators for RARs, vitamin D3 receptor, and thyroid hormone receptor and regulate ligand-specific gene expression(5.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). Retinoids suppress the growth of several tumor cells in vitro and in vivo(5.Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar, 6.Hong W.K. Itri L.M. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S.

However, mechanisms of growth suppression are not clearly understood.Although IFNs and retinoids have been shown to suppress the growth of certain tumor cells, a number of tumor cells are not inhibited by these single agents(6.Hong W.K.

However, a combination of these agents produces significant additive or synergistic anti-tumor activity(7.Lippman S.M. Glisson B.M. Kavanagh J.J. Lotan R. Hong W.K. Paredes-Espinoza M. Hittelman W.N.

Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar), cross-talk in the regulation of cellular anti-tumor responses. In an effort toward this direction, we analyzed the early events that occur in IFN-resistant tumor cells that may lead to enhanced growth suppression by RA/IFN combination. In this investigation, using pharmacologically achievable doses of IFN-β and RA, we show that growth of an IFN-unresponsive breast tumor cell is significantly suppressed by such combination. Growth suppression is correlated with an enhanced transcriptional induction of ISGs in the presence of RA. Transcriptional enhancement is due to an increase in the STAT1 levels in RA-treated cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagentsHuman IFN-β was a gift of Berlex Inc.

Tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cell line and polyoma virus-transformed murine breast tumor cells were provided by Joseph Fontana and Robert Freund of University of Maryland at Baltimore, respectively. STAT1 cDNA cloned under the control of chicken β-actin promoter of the mammalian expression vector pCXN2 (11.Niwa H. Yamamura K.-I Miyazaki J.-I. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 108: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (4548) Google Scholar) was a gift from Keiko Ozato, National Institutes of Health. This vector also carried a neomycin resistance marker for the selection of stably transfected cells.Cell Culture and Stable TransfectionCells were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum. Experiments with MCF-7 breast tumor cells were performed in phenol red free media containing 10-11M estradiol. MCF-7 cells were transfected either with the vector alone or with the STAT1 expression construct by electroporation. Selection was initiated with 1 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) on the second day and continued for 25 days until drug-resistant colonies appeared. The resultant colonies were then pooled, grown further, and used in the experiments(12.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar). Expression of STAT1 was confirmed by Western blot analysis, and its functional activity was assessed by IFN-inducible expression of a reporter gene (see below).Growth Inhibition AssaysCells (4 × 103) were cultured in phenol red free media containing 5% charcoal-stripped calf serum in 96-well dishes as indicated above. Various concentrations of IFN-β and RA were added to the cultures and incubated for 4-5 days. Cells were washed and fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 1 h and then were stained with sulforhodamine B in 1% acetic acid for 1 h. After washing, the dye bound to the cells was released with 100 μl of 10 μM Tris-HCl, pH 10, and absorbance at 570 nm was measured. A control plate to determine the initial seeding intensity was also included except that the cells were fixed with trichloroacetic acid immediately. Absorbance obtained with this plate was taken as 0% growth. Growth obtained with untreated cells was taken as 100%, and growth in treated cultures was expressed as percentage of control (13.Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8731) Google Scholar). Loss of originally plated cells during the treatments was considered as death. In a graphic representation, these values are shown on negative scale. In each case quadruplicate samples were tested for growth inhibition. Data obtained with this method directly correlated with cell counts obtained with a Coulter counter.Transcriptional AnalysesNorthern blot, nuclear run-off transcription, and cell transfection assays were performed as described previously(10.Kalvakolanu D.V. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Harter M.L. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7459-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmids as described earlier. After 40 h, they were treated with RA (1 μM) for 12 h where indicated and then with IFN-β (100 units/ml) for 16 h. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase assays (12.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar) were performed. Transfection efficiency among different samples was monitored by assaying for galactosidase activity. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed as described earlier (10.Kalvakolanu D.V. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Harter M.L. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7459-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Western Blot AnalysisTotal protein (70 μg), after various treatments, was analyzed in Western blots(12.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar). Blots were incubated with the indicated primary antibody. After stringent washing, they were incubated with appropriate second antibody and developed using an ECL kit (Amersham).Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)These assays were carried out as described earlier(10.Kalvakolanu D.V. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Harter M.L. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7459-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity and identity of the complexes, competition with specific unlabeled oligonucleotides and supershifting of the complexes with specific antibodies to ISGF-3 proteins were performed. Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides of GAS and pIRE (from ICSBP gene) were a gift from Keiko Ozato, NIH. 32P-Labeled probes of these oligonucleotides were prepared essentially as described earlier (14.Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason G.L. Darnell J.E. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3951-3963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).RESULTSRetinoic Acid and Interferon-β Combination Inhibits Cell Growth and Causes Cell Death in Several Breast Tumor Cell LinesTo study the effect of IFN, MCF-7 (an estrogen receptor containing human breast tumor) cell line was incubated with various amounts of IFN-β and scored for growth using sulforhodamine staining(13.Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8731) Google Scholar). Various concentrations of IFN-β were added to the cells and incubated for 5 days. IFN-β failed to inhibit the growth of these cells (Fig. 1A, bars 2-4). Similarly, RA had very little growth inhibitory effect on these cells, although at 1 μM it inhibited growth by only 15% (data not presented). To study whether combination of RA/IFN-β would have any effect on these cells, we incubated these cells with either IFN-β, RA, or a combination of both. Fig. 1B shows the data obtained in such experiments. IFN-β (50 units/ml) or RA (0.1 μM) had little effect on the growth of the cells. In the presence of these single agents only 5% of growth was suppressed (bars 2 and 3). These results are consistent with previous observations from MCF-7 and other tumor cell lines (15.Marth C. Daxenbichler G. Daunt O. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 77: 1197-1202PubMed Google Scholar) that demonstrated failure of IFN-α or RA to inhibit growth. However, upon combination of these drugs, >80% of the growth was inhibited (Fig. 1A, bar 4). We tested a series of RA and IFN-β concentrations and found that at every concentration tested the combination had significant growth inhibitory activity compared with individual agents (data not presented). Median effect analysis (16.Chou T.C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1984; 22: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (5863) Google Scholar) of these data revealed a synergistic growth suppressive activity of IFN-β/RA. Furthermore, we observed cell death at high concentrations within 70-80 h posttreatment (see below). These results were generally consistent with other studies in MCF-7 cells. Our results differed from the previous study (15.Marth C. Daxenbichler G. Daunt O. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1986; 77: 1197-1202PubMed Google Scholar) in the following respects. 1) Low doses of IFN-β/RA were sufficient to inhibit the growth. 2) Cell death was consistently observed in 3-5 days at pharmacological doses. Although a different study has shown growth inhibitory action of RA alone in MCF-7 cells(17.Fontana J.A. Nervi C. Shao Z.M. Jetten A.M. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3938-3945PubMed Google Scholar), we observed only marginal effects on cell growth by RA. These differences could be due to use of different methods, duration of drug exposures, fetal bovine sera, types of IFN, and the types of media containing phenol red, which is known to function as an estrogen(18.Wakeling A.E. J. Steroid Biochem. 1989; 34: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in the previous studies.We next examined whether continuous presence of RA was required for growth inhibition. In these experiments, we incubated cells with 1 μM RA for 16 h and then removed it. Cells were washed with serum-free medium and incubated in the presence of various doses of IFN-β. As shown in Fig. 2, RA pretreatment followed by IFN-β significantly suppressed the growth (Fig. 2, bars 2-4). As little as 10 units/ml IFN-β was sufficient to inhibit growth in these cells by 70% (bar 2). At 100 units, cell death was noticed (bar 3). These data on the negative scale indicate the loss of originally plated cells. A higher extent of cell death was noticed upon treatment with 1000 units of IFN-β (bar 4). Continuous presence of RA during IFN treatment had pronounced effects on the cells compared with pretreatment and its withdrawal during IFN treatment (bars 5-7). Under these conditions, 10 units of IFN-β, 1 μM RA caused cell death (bar 5). At higher doses of IFN-β with a similar dose of RA, more cell death was observed as compared with pretreatment controls (compare bars 2 and 3 to bars 5 and 6). Thus, continuous presence of RA was not necessary; however, it enhanced the cytotoxic effects when present. We performed a similar experiment in which cells were pretreated with 500 units of IFN-β for 16 h, washed, and incubated with 1 and 4 μM RA for the same length as in bars 2-7.No significant growth inhibition was noticed (see Fig. 2, bars 8 and 9). While RA pretreatment makes cells conducive to the growth inhibition of IFN, IFN pretreatment followed by RA did not. Thus, a specific interaction between IFN and RA mediates the arrest of cellular growth.Figure 2:RA pretreatment is essential for cell growth inhibition in MCF-7 cells. Cells were treated with none (bar 1); 1 μM RA for 16 h first and then washed (bars 2-4); 1 μM RA without further removal (bars 5-7). IFN-β treatments were 10 units/ml (bars 2 and 5), 100 units/ml (bars 3 and 6), and 1000 units/ml (bars 4 and 7). Bars 8 and 9 represent data obtained with cells that were pretreated with 500 units/ml IFN-β for 16 h, removed, and then treated with 1 and 4 μMRA, respectively. Growth assays were performed for 5 days as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)It was also of interest to determine whether growth inhibition could also be exerted in estrogen receptor negative breast tumor cells treated with IFN/RA combination. In these experiments, we employed the BT-20 breast tumor cell line that lacks estrogen receptor. IFN-β alone inhibited the growth in these cells by 35% (Fig. 3). RA by itself failed to inhibit the growth even at higher doses (data not presented). However, upon cotreatment with these agents, cell death occurred (Fig. 3, bar 4). These doses were identical to the ones described under Fig. 1A. Since these continuous cell lines may have genetically or epigenetically drifted from primary tumors, we tested the effects of the drug combination in several polyoma virus-induced primary murine breast tumor cells (Fig. 4). As observed with human cell lines, growth of these cells was not suppressed by murine IFN-β ranging from 10 to 1000 units/ml (data not presented). RA itself had little effect on these cells. However, the combination treatment of 10 units of IFN-β and 0.1 μM RA suppressed >80% of cell growth (Fig. 4, bar 4). Cell death was noticed upon increment of either IFN-β or RA doses in combination or prolonging the time of treatment (data not shown). Furthermore, we also noted synergistic growth inhibition by RA/IFN in an MCF-7 cell line resistant to tamoxifen (∼10 μM) (Fig. 5). As observed with parent MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1, A and B), neither IFN (Fig. 5, bars 2 and 3) nor RA (Fig. 5, bars 4 and 5) were effective inhibitors, but the combination strongly suppressed its growth (bars 6 and 7).Figure 3:Growth inhibition of estrogen receptor negative breast tumor cell line BT-20 by RA and IFN-β. Cells were treated as described in the legend for Fig. 1B. The following treatments were given: none (bar 1), 50 units/ml IFN-β (bar 2), 0.1 μM RA (bar 3), and the combination (bar 4).

Cells were preselected for tamoxifen resistance (5 μM). They were then challenged with different doses of the indicated reagents: none (bar 1), 10 units/ml IFN-β (bar 2), 100 units/ml IFN-β (bar 3), 0.1 μM RA (bar 4), 1 μM RA (bar 5), 0.1 μM RA, 10 units/ml IFN-β (bar 6), and 1 μM RA, 100 units/ml IFN-β (bar 7).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RA Pretreatment Enhances the Gene Induction by IFN-βUsing the above described assays, we determined that RA (1 μM) pretreatment for 12 h was optimal for growth inhibition. Since IFN failed to inhibit cell growth significantly and RA pretreatment enhanced the growth inhibitory action of IFN-β, we examined whether IFN-inducible gene expression was modulated by RA in these cells. Although low dose of RA (0.1 μM) could enhance the expression, longer treatment time was required for induction. We observed that 1 μM RA provided optimal conditions for ISG expression. Therefore, these conditions were employed for the rest of the study. Northern blot analyses were performed to detect IFN-induced gene expression. Two IFN-inducible gene products, 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase and protein kinase R, which are implicated in growth inhibition(1.Kalvakolanu D.V. Borden E.C. Cancer Invest. 1996; 14: 25-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2.Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), were chosen. A low dose of IFN was chosen because we intended to work with pharmacologically achievable doses. In IFN-β-treated cells (Fig. 6lane 2), no significant expression of these mRNAs was observed. RA alone did not induce these genes (Fig. 6, lane 3). However, pretreatment of cells with RA followed by IFN resulted in a strong induction of ISGs (Fig. 6, lane 4).Figure 6:Induction of ISG expression by RA/IFN-β combination in MCF-7 cells. Cells were pretreated either with none (lanes 1 and 2) or with 1 μM RA (lanes 3 and 4) for 12 h where indicated. IFN-β (100 units/ml) was added (lanes 2 and 4) and incubated further for additional 6 h. Total RNA was isolated, and 15 μg of RNA from each sample was denatured, separated on 1% formaldehyde/agarose gels, and subjected to Northern blotting. Blots were probed with the indicated gene- specific probe labeled with 32P. These blots were washed stringently and exposed to x-ray films to detect gene expression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We next tested whether the enhanced expression of ISGs was due to an increase in the stability of mRNA or induction of transcription in these cells, because a previous study in neuroblastoma cells indicated a posttranscriptional effect of RA(19.Higuchi T. Hannigan G.E. Malkan D. Yeger H. Williams B.R. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3958-3964PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear run-off transcription assays were performed to identify the level of regulation (Fig. 7). MCF-7 cells were treated with indicated agents as described above, except that IFN-β treatment was for 45 min. Nuclei were isolated, and run-off transcription assays were performed as described earlier(10.Kalvakolanu D.V. Bandyopadhyay S.K. Harter M.L. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7459-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, no transcription of three ISGs was detected in control as well as IFN-β-treated cells (lanes 1 and 2). RA alone did not induce the gene expression (lane 3). However, a dramatic induction of ISG transcription by IFN-β was noted in the RA-pretreated cells (Fig. 7, lane 4). Lack of gene expression in these cells was not global because a housekeeping gene, β-actin, was transcribed normally under all these conditions. Thus, transcriptional up-regulation by IFN-β was stronger in RA-pretreated cells.Figure 7:Induction of ISG transcription by RA/IFN-β combination. Cells were pretreated either with none (lanes 1 and 2) or with 1 μM RA (lanes 3 and 4) for 12 h where indicated. IFN-β (100 units/ml) was added (lanes 2 and 4) and incubated further for an additional 45 min. Nuclei (5 × 106) were isolated, and transcripts were extended at room temperature for 30 min. Total nuclear RNA was extracted and hybridized to gene-specific probes immobilized on nylon filters. Autoradiography was performed after washing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)RA Pretreatment Up-regulates the Expression of Transfected GenesTranscriptional up-regulation was also assessed by transiently transfecting MCF-7 cells with IFN-stimulated reporter genes. As shown in Fig. 8A, expression of pRM-luciferase, containing promoter elements of ISG-561, was strongly induced by IFN-β only in the cells pretreated with RA (Fig. 8A, bar 4). Neither IFN nor RA by themselves was capable of inducing the transfected gene (bars 2 and 3). A similar experiment was performed using a CAT reporter, in which promoter elements from ISG 6-16 drive the gene expression (Fig. 8B). Consistent with data in Fig. 8A, ISG 6-16 CAT gene induction by IFN-β was also noted only in the cells pretreated with RA (see Fig. 8B, lane 4).

INTRODUCTIONThe ret protooncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK). 1The abbreviations used are: RPTKreceptor protein tyrosine kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseSHSrc homologyEGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorHAhemagglutininPLCγphospholipase CγPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. The extracellular domain of Ret is unrelated to any other subfamily of RPTKs and contains multiple cadherin-like repeats and a cysteine-rich region(1.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Ret plays a critical role in renal development as well as that of endocrine organs derived from the neural crest including the adrenal medulla and the thyroid gland. Mutations in the ret protooncogene have been shown to result in a variety of disorders including Hirschsprung's disease, multiple endocrine neoplasias 2A and 2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma(2.Carlson K.M.

More recently, ret has been shown to be a dominant acting oncogene capable of germline transmission. Knockout studies have demonstrated that mice lacking ret have renal agenesis or severe dysgenesis and lack enteric neurons(9.Schuchardt A. D'Agati V. Larsson-Blomberg L. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Nature. 1994; 367: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the ligand for Ret has yet to be identified, several signaling molecules have been identified that interact with Ret including PLCγ, rasGAP, Shc, Grb2, and paxillin(10.Romano A. Wong W.T. Santoro M. Wirth P.J. Thorgeirsson S.S. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2923-2933PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Borrello M.G. Pelicci G. Arighi E. De Filippis L. Greco A. Bongarzone I.

Biol. 1994; 14: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).In an effort to identify additional signaling intermediates capable of transducing signals originating from Ret, we had previously used the cytoplasmic domain of Ret as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This resulted in the identification of Grb10 as a molecule that specifically bound the activated form of Ret(14.Pandey A. Duan H. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21461-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Grb10 is a recently described SH2 domain containing adapter protein that belongs to an emerging family of adapter proteins. This family includes the previously described protein Grb7 and is characterized by a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain, a central domain, and a proline-rich region(15.Margolis B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16.Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B.

A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The central domain (also termed GM domain), is similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans gene mig-10 that is crucial for the migration of a subset of neuronal cells and contains a pleckstrin homology domain. The central domains of Grb7 and Grb10 are 54% identical to each other(16.Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Since Grb10 interacted with the Ret receptor protein-tyrosine kinase in an activation dependent manner, we asked if Grb7 might also associate with Ret in a similar fashion. This reasoning was based on the fact that since the SH2 domains of Grb7 and Grb10 are 64% identical to each other, it was possible that they engaged similar receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. Grb7 has previously been shown to associate with HER2/neu, a receptor closely related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)(18.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Activation of the HER2 receptor led to association and tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 in cells overexpressing the chimeric EGFR/HER2 receptor(18.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that Grb7 directly associates with Ret via its SH2 domain, and unlike Grb10, it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Ret activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression VectorsConstruction of hemagglutinin tagged Ret cytoplasmic domain (HA-Ret) plasmid has been described previously(14.Pandey A. Duan H. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21461-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Construction and characterization of the EGFR/Ret construct has also been described earlier(13.Santoro M. Wong W.T. Aroca P. Santos E. Matoskova B. Grieco M. Fusco A. di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For these studies, EGFR/Ret was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pZeoSV (Invitrogen) where its expression was driven by the SV40 promoter. The Grb7 expression construct was a gift from Dr. Ben Margolis (University of Michigan). The expression vector for Flag-epitope tagged CD40 binding protein (CD40bp-Flag) has been described earlier(19.Hu H.M. O'Rourke K. Boguski M.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30069-30072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged Ret cDNA and the kinase defective mutant encoding methionine instead of lysine at position 758 (K758M) have been described elsewhere(20.Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).Production of Fusion ProteinsThe SH2 domain of Grb7 expressed as a GST fusion was a gift from Dr. Ben Margolis. Construction of GST fusions expressing the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal domains of PLCγ have been described earlier(21.Zhu G. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9559-9563Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins were prepared using standard procedures and the recombinant proteins immobilized onto glutathione-Agarose beads (Sigma). Soluble GST fusions of SH2 Grb7 and Grb10 were generated by eluting the beads with 10 mM reduced glutathione followed by dialyzing the eluate against phosphate-buffered saline. His-tagged constructs were generated by cloning the SH2 domains of Grb7 (amino acids 434-535 of mouse Grb7) and Grb10 (amino acids 503-622 of mouse Grb10) into the pET15b vector, and COOH-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ (amino acids 668-756 of bovine PLCγ) into the pQE-30 vector. The His-tagged fusion proteins were purified using Ni2+-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) and eluted with imidazole according to manufacturer's instructions.GST Binding and Competition AssaysDirect binding of the SH2 domain of Grb7 to activated EGFR/Ret was evaluated as follows. First, 293 cells were transfected with EGFR/Ret, and after 48 h, starved overnight in 1% BSA. Anti-EGFR immunoprecipitates from EGF-treated or untreated lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membrane was then incubated with 5 μg/ml of SH2 Grb7 GST in TBS-Tween containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After extensive washing, the membrane was immunoblotted with anti-GST monoclonal antibody to visualize the bound SH2 Grb7 GST.For in vitro competition assays, 293 cells were transfected with EGFR/Ret, the EGFR/ret receptor immunoprecipitated using anti-EGFR antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and the immunoprecipitates phosphorylated in vitro in the presence of 45 μM ATP. The samples were then divided into equal parts, and preincubated with the indicated amounts of soluble His-tagged SH2 domains for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then incubated with 5 μg of soluble GST fusion of SH2 domains for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing and SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., CA) to detect the bound SH2 domain GST fusion protein.Coimmunoprecipitation AssaysFor in vivo binding studies, 293 cells were cotransfected with EGFR/Ret and either Grb7 or CD40bp expression constructs, or Grb7 alone, starved in 1% BSA overnight, and either not treated or treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min and lysed in lysis buffer. Cleared cell lysates were incubated with 5 μg of anti-Grb7(N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-Flag monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with protein A/G, and washed and bound material was eluted by boiling in sample buffer. The eluates were subjected to Western blot analysis as described below.For in vivo binding studies using SKBR-3 cells, these cells were transiently transfected with EGFR/Ret using the calcium phosphate method. 48 h after transfection, cells were starved in 1% BSA overnight and left untreated or treated with EGF followed by lysis as described above. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb7 (N-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine as described below.Western Blot AnalysisPrecipitated immune complexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting, blocked with 1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-T) overnight at 4°C and then incubated with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc), followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or IgG (Bio-Rad). After extensive washing, membranes were developed using a chemiluminescent reaction (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of EGFR/Ret protein was done by immunoprecipitating parallel samples with anti-human EGFR monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) followed by immunoblotting with the same antibody.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONGiven the importance of Ret in mammalian development and oncogenesis, characterization of molecules that participate in its signaling is of paramount importance. Since the ligand for Ret is unidentified, a strategy was utilized to exploit the finding that the cytoplasmic domain of Ret mimics the activated form of the receptor as it possesses constitutive tyrosine kinase activity that results in autophosphorylation. The phosphorylated tyrosines in turn, should be capable of engaging downstream signaling molecules. Using the Ret cytoplasmic domain fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid screen, we had previously identified Grb10, an SH2-containing adapter protein, as a downstream target of Ret(14.Pandey A. Duan H. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21461-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Grb10 belongs to an emerging family of SH2 containing adapter proteins with Grb7 as the prototypical member(15.Margolis B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16.Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both of these proteins contain a single SH2 domain at the COOH terminus, a central region containing a pleckstrin homology domain, and a proline-rich region at the NH2 terminus.Grb7 was initially identified by screening a λgt11 expression library with a phosphorylated 32P-labeled carboxyl-terminal segment of EGFR(17.Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Despite this, it has not been shown to bind to EGFR in vivo. It does, however, associate with HER2/neu, a receptor closely related to the EGF receptor (18.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). As a result of this binding, Grb7 is tyrosine-phosphorylated which may be sufficient to initiate further downstream signaling. Since the SH2 domain of Grb7 is 64% identical to Grb10, we asked whether Grb7 could associate with Ret in a manner similar to Grb10. To directly ascertain if the SH2 domain of Grb7 could bind the cytoplasmic domain of Ret, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding hemagglutinin-tagged Ret cytoplasmic domain (HA-Ret). The lysates were incubated with Grb7 SH2-GST, NH2- and COOH-terminal SH2 domains of PLCγ, or GST alone. As shown in Fig. 1, the SH2 domain of Grb7 bound the Ret cytoplasmic domain as did the COOH-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ. The COOH-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ has been previously shown to bind Ret, and served as an important positive control. This interaction was specific since the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ or GST by itself did not bind.To confirm that the binding was due to the ability of the Ret kinase to autophosphorylate itself, a kinase-defective mutant of Ret (K758M) was generated by replacing lysine in the ATP binding pocket of the kinase domain with methionine(20.Liu X. Vega Q.C. Decker R.A. Pandey A. Worby C.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5309-5312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected either with wild type or kinase-defective Ret receptor, and the receptors were immunoprecipitated, phosphorylated in vitro, and incubated with a soluble GST fusion protein of the SH2 domain of Grb7. Although Grb7 efficiently bound the wild type receptor, it showed no detectable binding to the kinase defective mutant of Ret (data not shown).Since the ligand for Ret is not known, it is difficult to activate the native receptor in vivo and determine if the tyrosine-phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain has engaged Grb7. To circumvent this problem, we have used an EGFR/Ret chimera in which the extracellular domain of EGFR is fused to transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions derived from Ret. When such a chimeric receptor is tested, the tyrosine kinase activity of Ret is increased substantially upon addition of EGF. 293 cells were either transfected with Grb7 alone, EGFR/Ret and Grb7, or EGFR/Ret and an unrelated gene product CD40bp-Flag to serve as a control. Cells were then either left untreated or treated with EGF, and anti-Grb7 or anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to detect coprecipitating EGFR/Ret. As shown in Fig. 2A, Grb7 associated with EGFR/Ret in an activation-dependent manner, and as expected, the negative control, CD40bp, did not show any detectable binding. The bottom panel shows equal expression of EGFR/Ret in the various samples. Fig. 2B shows that Grb7 underwent an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation upon addition of EGF. This is analogous to the situation with cells expressing the EGFR/HER2 receptor chimera where stimulation of HER2 by EGF leads to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7. This suggests that Grb7, besides binding receptor kinases, also serves as a substrate being phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. In order to eliminate the possibility that the observed association of Grb7 with Ret was due to overexpression of Grb7, the SKBR-3 cell line which expresses endogenous Grb7 was used for analysis. This cell line was transiently transfected with the EGFR/Ret plasmid, and left untreated or treated with EGF. Anti-Grb7 immunoprecipitates were then immunoblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to detect co-precipitated EGFR/Ret. As shown in Fig. 2C, the endogenous Grb7 again associated with the activated chimeric Ret receptor but not with the unactivated receptor. There was equal expression of EGFR/Ret in the unactivated and activated samples (data not shown).Figure 2:Grb7 binds activated Ret RPTK in vivo and is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation of Ret. A and B, 293 cells were cotransfected with expression plasmids containing EGFR/Ret and either Grb7 or Cd40bp-Flag, or with Grb7 alone as indicated. After starvation in 1% BSA for 24 h, cells were untreated or treated with EGF (100 ng/ml). Anti-Grb7 or anti-Flag immunoprecipitates were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (anti-pTyr) (top panels, A and B). The bottom panel of A shows parallel samples that were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with anti-EGFR antibody to demonstrate equal expression of EGFR/Ret. The bottom panel of B shows the blot in the top panel of B stripped and reprobed with anti-Grb7 antibody. C, SKBR-3 cells which express endogenous Grb7 were either untransfected or transfected with the EGFR/Ret expression vector as described under “Materials and Methods.” Untreated or EGF-treated cells were lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb7 antibody followed by anti-phosphotyrosine antibody to detect coprecipitating EGFR/Ret.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The SH2 domain of Grb7 could either bind the autophosphorylated Ret receptor directly, or this binding could be mediated by adapter proteins such as Shc which are phosphorylated by Ret. In order to distinguish between these two possibilities, a direct binding assay using a soluble GST fusion of the SH2 domain of Grb7 was carried out. EGFR/Ret was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells that were either untreated or treated with EGF and the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. This membrane was then incubated with soluble SH2 GST Grb7 followed by conventional immunoblotting with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody to detect the GST fusion bound to immunoprecipitated EGFR/Ret receptor. As shown in Fig. 3A, SH2 GST Grb7 directly bound the activated chimeric receptor on the membrane. This confirms that Grb7 does not need an intermediate molecule to bind to the activated Ret receptor.Figure 3:Grb7 interacts directly with Ret, and Grb10 competes with Grb7 for binding to Ret. A, immunoprecipitated EGFR/Ret from 293 cells treated as indicated was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was incubated with 5 μg/ml soluble SH2 Grb7 GST followed by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. The arrow indicates the position of EGFR/Ret where bound SH2 Grb7 can be detected. B, in vitro competition assay. In vitro phosphorylated EGFR/Ret receptor was incubated with soluble SH2 Grb7 GST with or without a preincubation with the indicated excess of soluble His-tagged SH2 Grb10 or COOH-terminal SH2 PLCγ. The blot was immunoblotted with an anti-GST antibody to detect bound Grb7. C, same as panel B except that soluble SH2 Grb10 GST was used instead of SH2 Grb7 GST, and His-tagged SH2 Grb7 was used for competition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to compare the binding abilities of Grb7 and Grb10, in vitro experiments utilizing soluble forms of His-tagged and GST-tagged SH2 Grb7 and Grb10 were carried out. EGFR/Ret receptors were immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated in vitro, and then incubated with soluble GST fusions of the SH2 domains. In parallel competition experiments, the samples were preincubated with increasing concentrations of His-tagged fusion protein of the corresponding SH2 domain. As shown in Fig. 3B, a 50-fold molar excess of competing Grb10 SH2 domain was able to completely abrogate the binding of Grb7 to Ret suggesting that they bind to the same site. However, a 10-fold excess of His-tagged Grb10 was not as effective as a 2-fold excess of His-tagged Grb7 which totally abolished binding to Ret implying a higher affinity of the Grb7 SH2 domain for Ret. Importantly, a 20-fold excess of His-tagged COOH-terminal SH2 PLCγ had no effect on binding of Grb7 suggesting that the observed inhibition was not due to nonspecific binding. Additionally, when the experiment was repeated in reverse, a 10-fold molar excess of Grb7 SH2 domain was sufficient to completely abolish binding of Grb10 to Ret (Fig. 3C).In summary, we have shown that Grb7 associates with the Ret receptor tyrosine kinase through its SH2 domain and that activation of Ret results in tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7. Given the importance of Ret during development and in carcinogenesis, signaling molecules downstream of Ret are likely to be important as they may mediate some of these actions of Ret. Clearly, determining the binding sites of Grb7 and Grb10 will be important to further dissection of the signaling pathways initiated by Ret. However, it should be noted that it has been exceedingly difficult to map the Grb7 binding sites on the HER2/neu receptor(18.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, studies are ongoing in our laboratories to delineate the site(s) on the Ret receptor protein-tyrosine kinase responsible for binding to these adapter molecules. Further, it should be noted that though Grb7 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Ret activation, we have failed to see a similar phosphorylation in the case of Grb10. 2A. Pandey and V. M. Dixit, unpublished data. However, the significance of this phosphorylation is not clear at the present time. One explanation may be that this difference in tyrosine phosphorylation may serve to recruit distinct downstream effectors. Identification of these downstream effectors will be important in dissecting Ret signaling pathways. INTRODUCTIONThe ret protooncogene encodes a transmembrane receptor protein-tyrosine kinase (RPTK). 1The abbreviations used are: RPTKreceptor protein tyrosine kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferaseSHSrc homologyEGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorHAhemagglutininPLCγphospholipase CγPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albumin. The extracellular domain of Ret is unrelated to any other subfamily of RPTKs and contains multiple cadherin-like repeats and a cysteine-rich region(1.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Ret plays a critical role in renal development as well as that of endocrine organs derived from the neural crest including the adrenal medulla and the thyroid gland. Mutations in the ret protooncogene have been shown to result in a variety of disorders including Hirschsprung's disease, multiple endocrine neoplasias 2A and 2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma(2.Carlson K.M.

More recently, ret has been shown to be a dominant acting oncogene capable of germline transmission. Knockout studies have demonstrated that mice lacking ret have renal agenesis or severe dysgenesis and lack enteric neurons(9.Schuchardt A. D'Agati V. Larsson-Blomberg L. Costantini F. Pachnis V. Nature. 1994; 367: 380-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that the ligand for Ret has yet to be identified, several signaling molecules have been identified that interact with Ret including PLCγ, rasGAP, Shc, Grb2, and paxillin(10.Romano A. Wong W.T. Santoro M. Wirth P.J. Thorgeirsson S.S. Di Fiore P.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2923-2933PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Borrello M.G. Pelicci G. Arighi E. De Filippis L. Greco A. Bongarzone I.

Biol. 1994; 14: 663-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).In an effort to identify additional signaling intermediates capable of transducing signals originating from Ret, we had previously used the cytoplasmic domain of Ret as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. This resulted in the identification of Grb10 as a molecule that specifically bound the activated form of Ret(14.Pandey A. Duan H. Di Fiore P.P. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21461-21463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Grb10 is a recently described SH2 domain containing adapter protein that belongs to an emerging family of adapter proteins. This family includes the previously described protein Grb7 and is characterized by a carboxyl-terminal SH2 domain, a central domain, and a proline-rich region(15.Margolis B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16.Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B.

A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The central domain (also termed GM domain), is similar to the Caenorhabditis elegans gene mig-10 that is crucial for the migration of a subset of neuronal cells and contains a pleckstrin homology domain. The central domains of Grb7 and Grb10 are 54% identical to each other(16.Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Since Grb10 interacted with the Ret receptor protein-tyrosine kinase in an activation dependent manner, we asked if Grb7 might also associate with Ret in a similar fashion. This reasoning was based on the fact that since the SH2 domains of Grb7 and Grb10 are 64% identical to each other, it was possible that they engaged similar receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. Grb7 has previously been shown to associate with HER2/neu, a receptor closely related to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)(18.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Activation of the HER2 receptor led to association and tyrosine phosphorylation of Grb7 in cells overexpressing the chimeric EGFR/HER2 receptor(18.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that Grb7 directly associates with Ret via its SH2 domain, and unlike Grb10, it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Ret activation."
https://openalex.org/W2035699003,"A prominent model for the mechanism of transcription-coupled DNA repair proposes that an arrested RNA polymerase directs the nucleotide excision repair complex to the transcription-blocking lesion. The specific role for RNA polymerase II in this mechanism can be examined by comparing the extent of polymerase arrest with the extent of transcription-coupled repair for a specific DNA lesion. Previously we reported that a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer that is repaired preferentially in transcribed genes is a strong block to transcript elongation by RNA pol II (Donahue, B. A., Yin, S., Taylor, J.-S., Reines, D., and Hanawalt, P. C.(1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 8502-8506). Here we report the extent of RNA polymerase II arrest by the C-8 guanine DNA adduct formed by N-2-aminofluorene, a lesion that does not appear to be preferentially repaired. Templates for an in vitro transcription assay were constructed with either an N-2-aminofluorene adduct or the helix-distorting N-2-acetylaminofluorene adduct situated at a specific site downstream from the major late promoter of adenovirus. Consistent with the model for transcription-coupled repair, an aminofluorene adduct located on the transcribed strand was a weak pause site for RNA polymerase II. An acetylaminofluorene adduct located on the transcribed strand was an absolute block to transcriptional elongation. Either adduct located on the nontranscribed strand enhanced polymerase arrest at a nearby sequence-specific pause site. A prominent model for the mechanism of transcription-coupled DNA repair proposes that an arrested RNA polymerase directs the nucleotide excision repair complex to the transcription-blocking lesion. The specific role for RNA polymerase II in this mechanism can be examined by comparing the extent of polymerase arrest with the extent of transcription-coupled repair for a specific DNA lesion. Previously we reported that a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer that is repaired preferentially in transcribed genes is a strong block to transcript elongation by RNA pol II (Donahue, B.

An acetylaminofluorene adduct located on the transcribed strand was an absolute block to transcriptional elongation. Either adduct located on the nontranscribed strand enhanced polymerase arrest at a nearby sequence-specific pause site. The cellular processes of replication and transcription can be disrupted by the presence of bulky and helix-distorting lesions in the DNA. Such disruptions may cause cell death or mutagenic processes leading to tumorigenesis. Most if not all organisms utilize the nucleotide excision repair pathway to remove these harmful lesions and restore DNA integrity. An intriguing feature of this pathway is that it can be coupled to transcription. For some lesions the transcribed strands of active genes are repaired at a faster rate than the nontranscribed strands or unexpressed DNA sequences(1.Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Transcription-coupled repair provides a mechanism by which the expression of essential genes may be rapidly restored following DNA damage, thereby enhancing cell survival. Indeed, cells from patients with the disorder Cockayne's syndrome lack transcription-coupled repair and exhibit an increased sensitivity to the lethal effects of ultraviolet radiation(2.Venema J. Mullenders L.H.F. Natarajan A.T. Van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4707-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 3.Troelstra C. Odijk H. De Wit J.

Although the mechanism of transcription-coupled repair in eukaryotes is not yet understood, it is clear that the process requires an active RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) 1The abbreviations used are: RNA pol IIRNA polymerase IIAFN-2-aminofluoreneAF-dGN-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluoreneAAFN-2-acetylaminofluoreneAAF-dGN-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluoreneCPDcyclobutane pyrimidine dimerGDgapped duplexesbpbase pair(s)HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography. elongation complex. A model has emerged in which a repair complex is directed to a transcription-blocking lesion by the arrested RNA pol II(1.Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 4.Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the role of RNA pol II in transcription-coupled repair, we showed that a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer, the major DNA lesion formed by short wave UV light, is a strong block to RNA pol II (5.Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The arrested polymerase is stable and competent to resume elongation, but it prevents recognition of the CPD by a bacterial repair protein, photolyase, and at least under these conditions seems to inhibit DNA repair. Previously it was reported that a CPD is a strong block to Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and that the stalled polymerase inhibits the recognition of the CPD by components of the UvrABC repair system(6.Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21330-21336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of transcription-coupled repair must include a process by which the encumbrance of the arrested polymerase at the site of damage is overcome. On the basis of studies using cell-free extracts from E. coli, Selby and Sancar (7.Selby C.P. Sancar A. Science. 1993; 260: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) proposed that the arrested polymerase is removed from the DNA template by a transcription repair coupling factor. In order to resume transcription after repair, an RNA polymerase would have to reinitiate at the promoter. It remains unclear whether a similar mechanism is utilized by eukaryotes or whether the polymerase is moved away from the site of damage without dissociating from the template(8.Hanawalt P. Mellon I. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 67-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 9.Hanawalt P.C. Donahue B.A. Sweder K.S. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 518-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Once the template is repaired, the arrested polymerase could resume elongation without releasing the incomplete transcript.

The role of RNA pol II in transcription-coupled repair can be examined more closely by comparing the extent of RNA pol II blockage by different DNA lesions with the extent of transcription-coupled repair of these lesions. DNA lesions formed by the potent carcinogen N-2-acetylaminofluorene provide good candidate lesions for such a study. AAF is activated in vivo and binds to DNA predominantly at the C-8 position of guanine. The major adduct observed is the deacetylated N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-aminofluorene adduct, but AAF also forms the N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-2-acetylaminofluorene adduct. Although the AAF adduct differs from the AF adduct only by the presence of an acetyl group, the two lesions have quite distinct structural effects on DNA. The fluorene moiety of the AAF adduct is inserted between base pairs within the helix and the guanine switches from the anti to the syn conformation, leading to a great deal of helix distortion(10.Fuchs R.P.P. Daune M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2659-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11.O'Handley S.F. Sanford D.G. Xu R. Lester C.C. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Krugh T.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2481-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, the fluorene moiety of the AF adduct remains outside of the helix, and consequently, the AF adduct does not induce much distortion(12.Daune M. Fuchs R.P.P. Leng M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 58: 201-210Google Scholar). These structural differences are reflected by the types of mutations induced by each lesion in E. coli. AAF adducts induce primarily frameshift mutations(13.Fuchs R. Schwartz N. Daune M.P. Nature. 1981; 294: 657-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14.Koffel-Schwartz N. Verdier J.-M. Bichara M. Freund A.-M. Daune M.P. Fuchs R.P.P. J. Mol.

Biol. 1985; 183: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interestingly, AAF-treated plasmids replicated in human cells lead to both types of mutations(16.Mah M.C.-M. Boldt J. Culp S.J.

Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2245-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The structural differences between these two adducts are also reflected by the effect each has on the action of various polymerases. An AAF adduct is a much stronger block than an AF adduct to the progression of E. coli DNA polymerase I(18.O'Connor D. Stöhrer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1989; 264: 14455-14462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported no difference in the rate of repair of AF adducts in a DNA fragment within the transcriptionally active DHFR gene compared with a transcriptionally silent fragment downstream of the gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that AF adducts are not repaired in a transcription-coupled manner, and taken together with the evidence for bypass of AF-dG adducts by T7 RNA polymerase, it is consistent with our model that an arrested RNA pol II directs repair to the transcribed strand of active genes. A direct correlation between the lack of transcription-coupled repair of an AF adduct and its transcriptional bypass cannot be made, however, until the effects of an AF adduct specifically on a eukaryotic RNA pol II are determined. In this study, we constructed DNA templates containing AF-dG and AAF-dG adducts located at specific sites downstream from a strong eukaryotic promoter. We found that an AF adduct located on the transcribed strand was a weak block, whereas an AAF adduct on the transcribed strand was a strong block to RNA pol II elongation. In contrast to our previous results using DNA templates containing a CPD, the transcription elongation factor SII did not induce transcript cleavage by RNA pol II stopped by an AAF adduct, suggesting that transcription was terminated. We also found that either an AF or an AAF adduct situated on the nontranscribed strand enhanced a sequence-specific pause site for RNA pol II. RNA pol II, transcription initiation factors, and SII were purified from rat liver or recombinant sources as described previously(28.Reines D. J. Biol.

Construction of plasmids pAdBam and pAdSma1 has been described(5.Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To construct plasmids to receive AF- and AAF-adducted oligonucleotides, 24-base oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-GATCCCGAGTATCGATGAGTGGG-3′ and 5′-GATCCCCACTCATCGATACTCGGG-3′ were annealed and ligated into the BamHI site of pAdBam in one orientation to yield pAdCla1 and in the opposite orientation to yield pAdCla2 (Fig. 1). Both plasmids are identical to pAdSma1 except that the SmaI recognition sequence is interrupted by 14-bp fragments containing the recognition sequence of ClaI. Plasmid pAdSma2 was constructed by replacing the 215-bp BamHI-SphI fragment of pAdBam with a duplex oligonucleotide made by annealing the oligonucleotide 5′-GATCCCCGGGCATG-3′ with 5′-CCCGGG-3′. Plasmid pAdCla3 was constructed by replacing the 215-bp BamHI-SphI fragment of pAdBam with the oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCCCACTCATCGATACTCGGGCATG-3′ and 5′-CCCGAGTATCGATGAGTGGG-3′. Plasmid pAdCla3 is identical to pAdSma2 except that the SmaI recognition sequence is interrupted by the same 14-bp fragment that interrupts the SmaI recognition sequence of pAdCla2. Fourteen-base oligonucleotides of the sequence 5′-ATCCATCGATACTC-3′ were prepared by automated DNA synthesis and purified from a polyacrylamide gel. A portion of the oligonucleotides was treated with N-acetoxy-N-2-acetylaminofluorene to form an AAF adduct at the C-8 position of the single G in the oligonucleotide as described(21.Lindsley J.E. Fuchs R.P.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A portion of the 14-AAF oligonucleotides was incubated with 1 N NaOH and 0.25 M β-mercaptoethanol to deacetylate the AAF adduct, thereby forming an AF adduct on the G residue(31.Shibutani S. Grollman A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11703-11710Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All three oligonucleotides were purified extensively by HPLC and characterized by their UV absorption spectra. The fact that the 14-AAF and 14-AF eluted at different positions in the HPLC chromatogram showed that the deacetylation reaction went to completion. Oligonucleotides containing an AF adduct were stored in TE buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) with 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, whereas the 14-dG and 14-AAF oligonucleotides were stored in TE alone. The presence and the position of the AAF and AF adducts were verified by their ability to block the 3′→ 5′ exonucleolytic activity of T4 DNA polymerase and by the cleavage pattern obtained upon heating the adducted oligonucleotides in the presence of piperidine (data not shown). DNA templates containing a single AF or AAF adduct on either the transcribed or nontranscribed strand were constructed by utilizing gapped duplexes (GD) as described previously(5.Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase and inserted into GD using T4 DNA ligase. DNA ligation products were purified from an agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Under these conditions, covalently closed circular DNA migrates as supercoiled DNA and can be resolved from nicked plasmids that resulted from incomplete ligation of the oligonucleotides into the GD. Plasmids pAdSma1 and pAdCla1 were used to make GD in which the adducted oligonucleotides ligated into the transcribed strand (Fig. 1). Plasmids pAdSma1 and pAdCla2 or pAdSma2 and pAdCla3 were used to make GD in which the adducted oligonucleotides ligated into the nontranscribed strand. Transcription reactions were performed as described previously(28.Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50-100 ng of DNA templates were linearized with HindIII and incubated at 28°C with rat liver protein fractions D (2 μg, containing TFIID and TFIIH), B′ (1 μg, TFIIF/TFIIE), recombinant rat TFIIB (3 ng), and rat liver RNA pol II (0.5 μg) to form preinitiation complexes. Nascent transcripts were radiolabeled at their 5′ ends by the addition of ATP, UTP, and 40 μCi of [α-32P]CTP. Elongation proceeds until position 15, where the first GTP was required for incorporation. Heparin was added to prevent further initiation, and then 800 μM of each NTP was added to allow elongation to continue, typically for 15 min. Reactions were stopped with SDS and proteinase K and the RNA was precipitated twice in EtOH to remove unincorporated nucleotides. RNA was resuspended in formamide loading dye, heat denatured, and electrophoresed through a polyacrylamide (19:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel in TBE (89 mM Tris, 89 mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8) with 8.3 M urea. Gels were dried and autoradiographed using intensifying screens. For transcript cleavage experiments, elongation complexes were precipitated with D44 anti-RNA antibodies and formalin-fixed S. aureus and then washed in reaction buffer [20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.9, 3 mM HEPES•NaOH, pH 7.9, 60 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 3% (v/v) glycerol, and 2.2% (w/v) polyvinyl alcohol]. Purified elongation complexes were incubated with SII and NTPs in the presence of 7 mM MgCl2 as described in each experiment. Reactions were stopped, and the RNA was analyzed as described above. To study the effects of AF-dG and AAF-dG on transcription elongation by RNA pol II, DNA templates were constructed in which the adducts were located at specific sites downstream of the major late promoter of adenovirus (Fig. 1). Adducts on the transcribed strand were located 170 bp from the transcriptional start site, and adducts on the nontranscribed strand were located 171 bp from the transcriptional start site. The presence of the adducts in these templates was confirmed by their resistance to cleavage by ClaI (data not shown). Templates were linearized by HindIII prior to transcription in order to obtain a distinct 377-nucleotide full-length run-off transcript in the absence of polymerase arrest. Adducted DNA templates were used in an in vitro transcription assay to determine the extent of RNA pol II blockage by each adduct. An AF adduct located on the transcribed strand was a weak block to RNA pol II as shown by the large proportion of full-length run-off transcripts compared with truncated transcripts (Fig. 2). An AAF adduct located on the transcribed strand, on the other hand, was a complete block to RNA pol II. All transcripts were ∼170 nucleotides in length, suggesting that the polymerase transcribes the DNA up to but not past the adduct. The length of the truncated transcripts was confirmed by comparison with the 171 nucleotide run-off transcript from ClaI-digested pAdCla1. Interestingly, transcripts were blocked ∼15 bp downstream from either an AF or an AAF adduct situated on the nontranscribed strand. As was the case for the adducts on the transcribed strand, an AAF adduct on the nontranscribed strand was a stronger block to polymerase than was an AF adduct (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 8). Templates prepared with unadducted oligonucleotides on either strand yielded full-length run-off transcripts, indicating that the truncated transcripts were due specifically to the presence of the AF and AAF adducts on the DNA templates. The small amount of short transcripts observed with templates containing AF-dG on the transcribed strand could be either the result of a small population of polymerase molecules being completely arrested by the adduct or could indicate that the adduct generates a pause site for RNA pol II and that given enough time, the polymerase can bypass this adduct. To test these possibilities, the progression of the transcription complex past the AF adduct was examined at various times by removing samples from the reaction mixture 5, 10, 15, and 30 min after the addition of NTPs. Under the conditions of the transcription assay, RNA pol II did not reinitiate at the promoter; hence, only one round of transcription was observed. As shown in Fig. 3(lanes 6-9) incomplete transcripts of many sizes could be seen from undamaged templates after 5 min, but by 10 min nearly all the transcripts were full-length. On the other hand, only incomplete transcripts of one size were seen from templates containing the AF adduct on the transcribed strand after both 5 and 10 min (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3). These transcripts were 170 nucleotides in length, suggesting that all polymerase molecules transcribed up to but then paused at the site of the lesion. The polymerases eventually continued past the AF adducts, however, because by 30 min virtually all transcripts were full-length (Fig. 3, lane 5). Thus, AF-dG in this particular nucleotide sequence context is a pause site for RNA pol II but not a complete block; the polymerase eventually bypasses the AF adduct in the absence of repair. The transcription elongation factor SII facilitates read-through past certain types of transcriptional pause sites often associated with bends in the DNA helix(32.Reines D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Transcription: Mechanisms and Regulation. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 263-278Google Scholar). Integral to this process is the endonucleolytic cleavage of an oligonucleotide from the 3′ end of the nascent transcript by RNA pol II before elongation can resume. Presumably, this cleavage allows the polymerase another chance to transcribe through an arrest site. Previously, we showed that SII induces transcript cleavage by RNA pol II arrested by a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer(5.Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To determine whether this process occurs when RNA pol II is arrested by either AF-dG or AAF-dG on the transcribed strand, DNA templates were first transcribed in vitro, and elongation complexes were immunopurified from the reaction mixture and incubated with SII. The vast majority of the truncated transcripts remained ∼170 nucleotides in length (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 5), indicating that SII did not induce transcript cleavage by RNA pol II blocked by either an AF or an AAF adduct located on the transcribed strand. The result for AF-dG was not surprising in light of the fairly efficient bypass of this lesion shown in Fig. 3. The lack of transcript cleavage by the polymerase arrested by an AAF adduct, however, is in direct contrast to the case for RNA pol II arrested by a CPD. It is likely that the complex blocked by AAF-dG adduct is unstable and dissociates from the DNA, thereby terminating transcription and precluding SII-induced transcript cleavage. A clue to the nature of the polymerase arrest by AF and AAF adducts located on the nontranscribed strand is given in the time course of transcription of unadducted templates by RNA pol II shown in Fig. 3. The most predominant incomplete transcript observed at 5 min migrates as 185 nucleotides, approximately the same length as the truncated transcripts resulting from transcription of templates containing either AF-dG or AAF-dG on the nontranscribed strand (Fig. 2, lanes 6 and 8). To determine more precisely if the adduct-related arrest site coincides with this intrinsic pause site, a time course of transcription was examined for DNA templates in which either unmodified or AAF adducted oligonucleotides had been ligated into the nontranscribed strand (Fig. 5). The progression of transcript elongation on unadducted templates (Fig. 5, lanes 2-5) resembled the results presented in Fig. 3. After 5 min a number of incomplete transcripts including a 185-nucleotide species were seen, but by 15 min nearly all transcripts were full-length, the one exception being a small amount of 185-nucleotide transcript. For the templates containing AAF adducts (Fig. 5, lanes 6-9) at 5 min most transcripts were incomplete. Furthermore, even after 15 min the greatest population of transcripts was 185 nucleotides, suggesting that AAF-dG on the nontranscribed strand increases the time the polymerase is arrested at this site. We have determined that RNA pol II remains arrested at this site for at least 1 h (data not shown). In an effort to determine if SII induces transcript cleavage by RNA pol II arrested by an AAF adduct on the nontranscribed strand, arrested complexes were purified and incubated with SII for 30 min. Unlike the case in which the adducts were located on the transcribed strand, SII did induce transcript cleavage by RNA pol II arrested by an AAF adduct on the nontranscribed strand (Fig. 6). Transcripts were shortened by approximately 5, 10, and 25 nucleotides from the 3′ end (Fig. 6, lane 3). Furthermore, the addition of NTPs after the induction of transcript cleavage resulted in an increase in the amount of run-off transcripts (Fig. 6, lane 4), suggesting that SII facilitates bypass of the pause site when the AAF lesion is located on the nontranscribed strand. These results also show that an AAF-dG itself does not necessarily terminate transcription but that the particular strand where the adduct is located also plays a role. Similar results of SII-induced transcript cleavage were observed for templates containing AF-dG on the nontranscribed strand (data not shown). The sequence specificity of the transcription arrest by the adducts on the nontranscribed strand was examined by changing the sequence downstream of the adduct site. A 215-bp fragment between the ClaI and HindIII sites and including the pause site of plasmid pAdCla2 was removed creating plasmid pAdCla3 (Fig. 1). This plasmid was linearized with PvuII to yield a 370-nucleotide full-length run-off transcript. As seen in Fig. 7, nearly all transcripts from templates containing either lesion on the nontranscribed strand of plasmid pAdCla3 were full-length. A small amount of truncated transcripts was seen for both adducted templates (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3) that map to the ligation sites of the oligonucleotides, thereby suggesting that a single-stranded nick on the nontranscribed strand may block transcriptional elongation. In addition, a small amount of ∼185-nucleotide transcript was seen for the AAF-dG template but not nearly to the same extent as was seen for AAF-adducted pAdCla2. For comparison of the lengths of transcripts, unadducted pAdCla3 digested with PvuII, ClaI, and HindIII were used in the transcription assay to yield 370-, 170-, and 187-nucleotide run-off transcripts (Fig. 7, lanes 4-6). Based on these results, we suggest that the 215-bp fragment contains an intrinsic pause site and that removal of this site eliminates the RNA pol II arrest induced by AF-dG or AAF-dG located on the nontranscribed strand. We have examined the effects of AF and AAF DNA adducts on transcript elongation by rat liver RNA pol II. An AF-dG located on the transcribed strand of the template was only a weak block to the polymerase, whereas an AAF-dG located on the transcribed strand was an absolute block to transcriptional elongation (Fig. 2). Similar results have been reported for the effects of these lesions on transcription by T7 RNA polymerase (22.Chen Y.-H. Bogenhagen D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5849-5855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and on replication by DNA polymerases(18.O'Connor D. Stöhrer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2325-2329Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19.Michaels M.L. Johnson D.L. Reid T.M. King C.M. Romano L.J. J. Biol.

Fuchs R.P.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The translesional bypass of an AF adduct by RNA pol II we observed contrast with results reported for X. laevis RNA pol III, which was blocked by the presence of an AF adduct(23.Chen Y.-H. Matsumoto Y. Shibutani S. Bogenhagen D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9583-9587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This difference is most likely explained by differences in the structure and function of the relatively termination-prone RNA pol III compared with RNA pol II. The nucleotide sequence context of the lesion in the respective systems, however, could also account for the differences in the results. The different effects that these two adducts have on transcription by RNA pol II are most likely due to the different structural effects each adduct has on DNA. AAF-dG induces local denaturation of double-stranded DNA described as the insertion-denaturation model, whereas AF-dG does not appear to induce denaturation described as the outside-binding model(10.Fuchs R.P.P. Daune M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2659-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11.O'Handley S.F. Sanford D.G. Xu R. Lester C.C. Hingerty B.E. Broyde S. Krugh T.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2481-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12.Daune M. Fuchs R.P.P. Leng M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 58: 201-210Google Scholar). The guanine of AAF-dG remains in the syn conformation even in single-stranded DNA and may therefore be a noncoding nucleotide for RNA pol II, thereby blocking elongation. Noncoding regions on the transcribed strand are bypassed by T7 RNA polymerase(33.Zhou W. Reines D. Doetsch P.W. Cell. 1995; 82: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), however, and it is likely that the bulky nature of the AAF adduct also plays a role in transcriptional arrest. Intrinsic arrest sites for RNA pol II are often associated with bends in the DNA helix(34.Kerppola T.K. Kane C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and it is likely that the AAF-induced helix distortion combined with the noncoding nature of the adduct contributes to the termination of RNA pol II by AAF-dG. An AF adduct induces little DNA denaturation or helix distortion; therefore it comes as no surprise that AF-dG is not a strong block to chain elongation by RNA pol II. We have shown that RNA pol II pauses at an AF-dG but that given time, the polymerase can bypass the adduct (Fig. 3). A similar effect has been reported for replication of AF-adducted DNA templates by T7 DNA polymerase(21.Lindsley J.E. Fuchs R.P.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this case, pausing by the polymerase at AF-dG was ascribed solely to a decrease in the rate of incorporation of a nucleotide opposite the adducted nucleotide. It is likely that a decrease in the rate of incorporation of a ribonucleotide opposite AF-dG is responsible for the pausing by RNA pol II. Interestingly, although the rate of incorporation of dCMP opposite AF-dG by T7 DNA polymerase was faster than the rate of incorporation of dAMP, the latter rate was significant and suggests a mechanism for the induction of G•C → T•A base pair substitution mutations by AF adducts in vivo(21.Lindsley J.E. Fuchs R.P.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 764-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether the rate of incorporation of AMP by RNA pol II opposite the lesion is significant. The transcription elongation factor SII induces transcript cleavage by RNA pol II arrested by a CPD located on the template strand(5.Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.-S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The fact that cleaved transcripts can be re-elongated up to the site of the CPD demonstrates that the arrested complex is stable and competent to resume transcription. Although an AAF adduct on the transcribed strand is also an absolute block to RNA pol II, SII did not induce transcript cleavage by RNA pol II (Fig. 4). This differential response to SII may be explained by differences in the stability of the arrested complexes. It has been previously shown that when RNA pol III is arrested by an AAF adduct, the polymerase dissociates from the DNA template releasing the nascent transcript(23.Chen Y.-H. Matsumoto Y. Shibutani S. Bogenhagen D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9583-9587Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). If an analogous response occurs with RNA pol II, SII could not induce transcript cleavage because the ternary transcription complex has been disrupted and transcription effectively terminated. It has been suggested that the stability of an elongation complex is dependent upon the stability of the RNA-DNA duplex(35.von Hippel P.H. Yager T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2307-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar); however, the stability of the RNA pol II elongation complex also appears to be dependent upon DNA binding domains at both the downstream and upstream edges of the transcribing polymerase and on an RNA binding domain that is thought to hold the nascent transcript(36.Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1994; 88: 1-21Google Scholar). It seems likely that the decreased stability of the arrested complex is due to steric interference by the bulky AAF adduct, more so than the interference caused by a CPD. Alternatively, the AAF adduct may not affect the stability of the arrested complex but might specifically inhibit the cleavage reaction, perhaps by influencing the conformation or recognition of RNA pol II by SII. Current studies using footprinting analysis are designed to determine directly whether the polymerase has been dissociated from the DNA at an AAF adduct. Both AF-dG and AAF-dG when located on the nontranscribed strand impeded elongation by RNA pol II (Fig. 2). The arrest site was located ∼15 bp downstream from the site of the lesions and was coincident with a pause site for the polymerase. These blocked complexes were stable and could undergo SII-induced transcript cleavage (Fig. 6). Removal of the sequence-specific pause site abolished the adduct-specific blockage, suggesting that the adducts simply enhance RNA pol II pausing at this site. Indeed, the time course of transcription study confirmed that an AAF lesion increased the pause time at this site (Fig. 5). It has been shown that increasing the dwell time of an elongating transcription complex at a particular nucleotide sequence can induce a switch from a paused complex in which the polymerase remains elongation competent to an arrested complex in which accessory factors are required for elongation to resume(29.Gu W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11238-11244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37.von Hippel P.H. Yager T.D. Science. 1992; 255: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is likely that AF-dG and AAF-dG also induce a shift to polymerase arrest at the intrinsic pause site. The footprint of an arrested elongation complex covers ∼30 bp centered over the transcript arrest site(38.Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the AF and AAF adducts are located at the upstream edge of the complex when the polymerase is paused. The lesions may increase the dwell time of RNA pol II at this site by interfering with the upstream DNA binding site of the polymerase impeding translocation past this site. It is noteworthy that the AAF adduct, which induces a “hinge point” on the DNA helix(10.Fuchs R.P.P. Daune M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2659-2666Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 39.Fuchs R.P.P. LeFevre J.F. Pouyet J. Daune M. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3347-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), has a stronger effect on this intrinsic pause site compared with the less distorting AF adduct. The translesional bypass of AF-dG by RNA pol II is consistent with a model for the mechanism for transcription-coupled repair in which the arrested polymerase directs repair enzymes to DNA lesions located on the transcribed strand of active genes(1.Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 4.Mellon I. Hanawalt P.C. Nature. 1989; 342: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Repair of AF adducts does not appear to be coupled to transcription. AF adducts located within the active DHFR gene of Chinese hamster ovary cells were repaired at a rate similar to that for adducts located in a transcriptionally silent region downstream of the gene(27.Tang M. Bohr V.A. Zhang X. Pierce J. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14455-14462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although RNA pol II pauses at an AF adduct, the period of pausing may not be long enough to attract the transcription-repair coupling factor(s) that are needed to recruit repair proteins to the arrested polymerase. Similarly, RNA pol II paused at AF-dG does not require SII to bypass the adduct. Even though an AAF-dG is a strong block to RNA pol II, it also may not be a good substrate for transcription-coupled repair if it provokes polymerase release associated with transcriptional termination. It remains unclear whether AAF adducts located on transcribed strands are preferentially repaired because in many eukaryotic cells the AAF-dG is rapidly deacetylated to form AF-dG(40.Poirier M.C. Williams G.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1980; 18: 581-587PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the results for AF and AAF adducts, a CPD is a strong block to RNA pol II, and the resulting stable arrested complex is probably recognized by a transcription-repair coupling factor leading to the preferential repair of these lesions. The transcriptional arrest induced by AF and AAF adducts located on the nontranscribed strand reveals the importance of sequence context on polymerase blockage and in turn transcription-coupled DNA repair. If sequence context plays an important role in RNA pol II bypass of a particular DNA lesion, then it must play an important role in transcription-coupled repair of that lesion. Sequence-specific heterogeneity in the rates of repair of CPDs have been reported for both the p53 gene (41.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and the PGK1 gene (42.Gao S. Drouin R. Holmquist G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1438-1440Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) of human cells. Sites where CPDs were shown to be repaired at a slow rate were also shown to be hot spots for mutation, including some sites implicated in tumorigenesis(41.Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. Science. 1994; 263: 1436-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The slow repair rate of CPDs on the transcribed strand may reflect efficient bypass by RNA pol II in a specific sequence context.

To investigate the mechanism of the interaction between α-crystallin and substrate proteins, we prepared a tryptophan-free mutant of human αA-crystallin and assessed the conformation of thermally destabilized proteins captured by this chaperone using fluorescence spectroscopy. The fluorescence emission characteristics of bound substrates (rhodanese and γ-crystallin) and the results of fluorescence quenching experiments indicate that the proteins captured by α-crystallin are characterized by a very low degree of unfolding. In particular, the structure of rhodanese bound to αA-crystallin appears to be considerably more native-like compared to that of the enzyme bound to the chaperonin GroEL. We postulate that α-crystallin (and likely other small heat shock proteins) recognize preferentially the aggregation-prone conformers that occur very early on the denaturation pathway. With its ability to capture and stabilize these early non-native structures, α-crystallin appears to be uniquely well suited to chaperone the transparency properties of the ocular lens. α-Crystallin, the major protein of the ocular lens, acts as a molecular chaperone by suppressing the nonspecific aggregation of damaged proteins.

The A and B chains noncovalently self-associate to form a large macromolecular complex of approximately 40 subunits(1.Horwitz J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis.

Much less specific information is available regarding the tertiary and quaternary structure of the protein. While a number of structural models have been proposed for α-crystallin oligomers(2.Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), none of them is generally accepted. Believed for many years to be strictly lens-specific proteins, αB- and αA-crystallin have recently been found in many nonlenticular tissues(5.Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K.H. Goldman J.E.

Furthermore, αB-crystallin has been associated with a number of neurodegenerative disorders(5.Iwaki T. Kume-Iwaki A. Liem R.K.H. Goldman J.E.

Another important recent development is the rapidly growing evidence that α-crystallin belongs to a family of small heat shock proteins (sHSPs). 1The abbreviations used are: sHSPsmall heat shock proteinPCRpolymerase chain reactionbis-ANS1,1′-bi(4-anilino)naphthalene-5,5′-disulfonic acid, dipotassium salt. This is indicated by extensive structural similarities between α-crystallin and other sHSPs(8.Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol.

Sci. 1994; 19: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), no obvious function has been associated with these ubiquitous proteins. A new light on the potential physiological role of α-crystallin and related sHSPs has been shed by recent findings that these proteins act in vitro as molecular chaperones by preventing the aggregation of other proteins under conditions of thermal stress or other insults(1.Horwitz J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 10-21PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 16.Wang K.

The chaperone function of α-crystallin and other sHSPs is likely to be of considerable importance in vivo. In the context of eye research, it has been postulated that the ability of α-crystallin to suppress the aggregation of damaged proteins may be critical for maintaining the transparency of the ocular lens and that aging-related deterioration of the chaperone function could contribute to the development of cataracts(1.Horwitz J.

Despite the rapidly growing interest in the chaperone function of α-crystallin and related sHSPs, very little is known about the mechanism by which these proteins interact with their substrates. Recent results indicate that, in contrast to other known chaperones, α-crystallin has very low affinity for folding intermediates formed during protein refolding reactions in vitro and that its substrate specificity is limited to non-native structures that occur on the denaturation pathway only(21.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the critically important information about the specific conformational state(s) of the non-native structures that are recognized by α-crystallin is still missing. In this work, we have cloned and overexpressed αA-crystallin mutant in which the sole Trp residue has been replaced with Phe. Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments with the complexes formed between the Trp-free αA-crystallin and various substrate proteins allowed us, for the first time, to gain a direct insight into the conformation of proteins bound to this chaperone. bis-ANS was purchased from Molecular Probes. Acrylamide, bovine pancreas insulin, and bovine liver rhodanese were obtained from Sigma. The low molecular mass β-(βL) and γ-crystallin fractions were isolated from young bovine lenses and purified as described previously(21.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Complementary DNA clones encoding human αA-crystallin were constructed using RNA PCR (Perkin Elmer). First strand cDNA synthesis was carried out on human lens total RNA by priming with a downstream primer/adaptor (GGCTGCTATCTAA) designed to anneal in the 3′-untranslated region of the αA-crystallin mRNA. For amplification of target sequences by PCR, an upstream primer (ATGGACGTGACCATCCAG) was designed to anneal at the translational initiation codon. Sequences of primer binding sites were deduced from the human crystallin gene sequence deposited by Jaworski and Piatigorsky, GenBank™ accession number X14789. Both PCR primer/adaptors contained sequences that permitted ligation-free cloning of the PCR product into the pDIRECT cloning vector (PCR-Direct, Clontech). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a PCR-based system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Nucleotide sequence analysis of both strands of the wild type and mutant clones confirmed their structures. For overexpression studies, wild type and W9F mutant coding sequences were transferred into the expression plasmid pMON20,400 and cultured in shake flasks as described previously(22.Petrash J.M. Harter T.M. Devine C.S. Olins P.O. Liu S.Q. Srivastava S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24833-24840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallins were extracted from host cells essentially as described by Merck et al.(23.Merck K.B. de Haard Hoekman W.A. Oude Essink B.B. Bloemendal H. de Jong W.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and were purified by chromatography on a TMAE-fractogel ion exchange column (EM Separations) using a linear gradient (0-0.5 M) of NaCl. Fractions corresponding to a single predominant peak were further purified by gel permeation chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Virtually all protein from this column was found in fractions eluting at a position similar to that observed for bovine α-crystallin. Purified recombinant αA-crystallins showed on SDS-gel electrophoresis a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of approximately 20 kDa. One ml of a solution containing 0.25 mg of αA-crystallin and a known amount of the substrate protein in 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was incubated for 1 h at a temperature which induces thermal denaturation of a given substrate (55, 60, and 65°C for rhodanese, βL-crystallin, and γ-crystallin, respectively). While in the absence of the chaperone, the thermally denaturating proteins aggregate, α-crystallin prevents the aggregation process by forming stable, water-soluble complexes with the aggregation-prone proteins(1.Horwitz J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1993; 34: 10-21PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 16.Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation, the samples were cooled down to room temperature and the complexes were separated from the remaining free substrate proteins by repetitive filtration using a 100-kDa cut-off Microcon microconcentrators (Amicon) until no tryptophan fluorescence was detectable in the filtrate. The absence of unbound substrates in the retentate was further verified by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column. The molar ratio of α-crystallin to the substrate protein in a given complex was estimated by subtracting the amount of the unbound substrate (as determined spectrophotometrically) from the initial amount of this protein in the incubation mixture. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were measured on an SLM 8100 spectrofluorometer using the excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Quenching experiments were performed by titrating the solution of free- and W9F αA-crystallin-bound proteins with freshly prepared 5 M solutions of acrylamide or potassium iodide. Fluorescence intensities were measured at the wavelength corresponding to the emission maximum of each protein and were corrected for dilution, blanks, and the inner filter effect. The effective quenching constants (KSV)eff (equal to feffKSV) were calculated from the inverse slopes of the F0/ΔF versus 1/[Q] plots according to the modified Stern-Volmer equation: F0/ΔF = 1/feff+ 1/feffKSV [Q], where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities in the absence and presence of the quencher, [Q] is the molar concentration of the quencher, and ΔF = F0 - F(24.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 25.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). The fraction of quenchable fluorescence, feff, was obtained from the ordinate intercept of the linear portion of the F0/ΔF versus 1/[Q] plot(24.Lehrer S.S. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3254-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar). αA-Crystallin (0.1 mg/ml) with or without bound substrate was incubated with 20 μM bis-ANS for 2 h at room temperature, and fluorescence emission spectra of protein-bound dye were recorded using the excitation wavelength of 390 nm. Since binding of bis-ANS to α-crystallin at room temperature is dependent on the thermal history (preincubation temperature) of the sample(19.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), prior to incubation with the probe, control α-crystallin was subjected to the same treatment (i.e. 1-h incubation at elevated temperature) as used to prepare α-crystallin complex with a given substrate protein. The fluorescence characteristics of tryptophan residues depend strongly on the microenvironment and thus provide a sensitive probe of the conformational state of proteins. Measurements of intrinsic fluorescence properties of substrate proteins have been used previously to study protein interaction with the chaperonin GroEL (26.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 27.Mendoza J.A. Butler M.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24648-24654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hayer-Hartl M.K. Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3192-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the heat shock protein DnaJ(29.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), providing critical information about the conformation of folding intermediates that are captured by these chaperones. Fluorescence studies with proteins bound to α-crystallin are hampered by the fact that, in contrast to tryptophan-free GroEL and DnaJ, α-crystallin itself contains Trp residues whose emission spectrum overlaps with those of substrate proteins. Therefore, in order to facilitate characterization of the conformational states of proteins bound to α-crystallin, we have cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli the mutant of αA in which the sole Trp at position 9 was replaced with Phe. As anticipated, the conservative Trp → Phe substitution had a negligible effect on the structural and functional properties of the protein. Thus, the Sephacryl S-300 size exclusion chromatography profiles for the wild type αA-crystallin and the W9F mutant were essentially identical. Furthermore, the mutation fully preserved the chaperone function of the protein as indicated by a very similar ability of both the wild type and Trp-free αA-crystallin to suppress the thermal aggregation of rhodanese and γ-crystallin (data not shown). In general, when the protein unfolds, it exposes buried tryptophans to the aqueous solvent; this results in the shift of the fluorescence emission maximum toward longer wavelength. The fluorescence spectrum of native rhodanese has a maximum at 332 nm (Fig. 1A, trace 1) and is consistent with a largely apolar environment of eight Trp residues. Upon unfolding in 6 M guanidine HCl, the fluorescence maximum of rhodanese shifts to 352 nm, a wavelength characteristic of tryptophans fully exposed to water. The spectrum of rhodanese bound to W9F αA-crystallin has a maximum at 337 nm (Fig. 1A, trace 2). A small (5 nm) red-shift in the fluorescence spectrum indicates that the tertiary structure of the chaperone-bound enzyme is somewhat looser that that of the native form; however, the average environment of Trp residues in the bound protein appears to be still fairly hydrophobic. Notably, the position of the emission maximum for rhodanese associated with αA-crystallin is much closer to that observed for the native enzyme than for its chemically denatured form. The fluorescence properties of γ-crystallin bound to αA-crystallin were very similar to those of rhodanese. γ-Crystallin contains four Trp residues which are uniformly distributed throughout the molecule. As shown in Fig. 1B, unfolding of bovine γ-crystallin in guanidine HCl results in a 23 nm red-shift of the fluorescence maximum (from 330 nm in the native form to 353 nm). γ-Crystallin bound to αA-crystallin shows an emission maximum at 337 nm, i.e. red-shifted only by 7 nm from that of its native state. These observations suggest that the conformation in which both proteins are captured by α-crystallin is characterized by a relatively low degree of unfolding. Furthermore, the conformation of α-crystallin-associated proteins appears to be remarkably stable; there is very little change (2-3 nm) in fluorescence maxima of bound rhodanese or γ-crystallin upon heating of the complexes to temperatures well above those at which free proteins undergo thermal denaturation (Table 1).TABLE 1TABLE 1 Further insight into the tertiary structure of α-crystallin-bound substrate proteins may be obtained from fluorescence quenching experiments. Acrylamide and iodide were used as a complementary set of water-soluble quenchers of tryptophan fluorescence. Neutral acrylamide, although relatively polar, has the ability to penetrate into protein interior(25.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Iodide is a highly hydrated, negatively charged molecule; its quenching ability is limited almost exclusively to surface-exposed tryptophans and also depends on the location of the neighboring charged groups. In general, the interpretation of fluorescence quenching data for multitryptophan proteins is complicated by factors such as heterogeneous emission and varied accessibility of individual tryptophan residues to the quenchers. Therefore, we have used in our analysis the effective Stern-Volmer constant (KSV)eff; this effective parameter represents weighted average of the quenching constants of individual Trp residues and may contain contributions from both dynamic and static quenching processes(25.Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows representative Stern-Volmer plots for the quenching of Trp fluorescence of rhodanese and γ-crystallin under various experimental conditions. The quenching parameters (KSV)eff and feff are summarized in Table 1. Unfolding of both rhodanese and γ-crystallin in 6 M guanidine HCl at 25°C results in a greatly increased solvent exposure of Trp residues, as indicated by about a 6-fold increase in (KSV)eff for acrylamide. This may be contrasted with only a 2-fold increase of the above parameter observed for the proteins bound to α-crystallin. A very similar trend may be found when the characteristics of iodide quenching are compared, although in this case the analysis is somewhat more complicated since only a fraction of the emission arises from iodide-quenchable fluorophores (as indicated by a downward curvature of the respective Stern-Volmer plots). For both proteins, the fraction of iodide-accessible tryptophans in α-crystallin-bound conformers is larger compared to the native states. However, the increase in (KSV)eff values for bound proteins is very modest, especially when compared with that observed upon unfolding of the proteins in guanidine HCl. Altogether, the results of the quenching experiments support the notion that the structure of α-crystallin-bound proteins is characterized by a relatively low degree of unfolding. Although somewhat loosened, this structure is clearly closer to the native conformation than that of chemically denatured proteins. It is also worthwhile noting that heating of the complexes to temperatures as high as 75°C has only a small effect on the quenching parameters of bound proteins. This is consistent with the lack of major changes in γmax at high temperatures and further indicates that the conformation of α-crystallin-associated proteins is highly stable. The fluorescence of bis-ANS is strongly dependent on the polarity of the environment: it is very weak in water and increases dramatically upon binding to hydrophobic sites of proteins. This compound has been widely used as a probe to assess the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in proteins(19.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 30.Horowitz P.M. Hua S. Gibbons D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1536-1542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown previously, bis-ANS has considerable affinity for α-crystallin; this indicates the presence of surface-exposed hydrophobic patches(19.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, essentially no binding of the probe could be detected to native rhodanese, γ- and βL-crystallin. However, when the same proteins were bound to the chaperone, the fluorescence of bis-ANS in the presence of the complexes was substantially higher than that for α-crystallin alone. Furthermore, the increase in fluorescence intensity appeared to correlate with the amount of bound substrates (Fig. 3). This strongly indicates that, in contrast to the native states, the conformation of chaperone-associated proteins is characterized by high affinity for the hydrophobic probe. Employing site-directed mutagenesis and fluorescence spectroscopy, we have explored the structural properties of non-native proteins that are bound to αA-crystallin. The present data clearly show that the fluorescence characteristics of Trp residues in α-crystallin-bound conformers are much closer to those of native proteins than the fully unfolded ones. This strongly suggests that α-crystallin stabilizes aggregation-prone proteins in a conformation which, although compromised, remains relatively compact and is characterized by a low degree of unfolding. The specific conformational features of substrate proteins bound to various functionally different chaperones have been the subject of many recent studies (for review see (31.Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar) and (32.Landry S.J. Gierasch L.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 645-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar)). For example, DnaK and PapD are believed to bind polypeptides in an extended conformation. In contrast, substrate proteins bound to the chaperones GroEL and DnaJ appear to be in a partially folded conformation, often characterized as a molten globule state with a largely preserved secondary structure and a collapsed, highly flexible tertiary structure(26.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 27.Mendoza J.A. Butler M.C. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24648-24654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Hayer-Hartl M.K. Ewbank J.J. Creighton T.E. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3192-3202Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U.

It is informative to compare the fluorescence characteristics of the same substrate, rhodanese, bound to α-crystallin and the two latter chaperones. The fluorescence emission maximum for rhodanese bound to GroEL or DnaJ occurs at 342-343 nm(26.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.-U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 29.Langer T. Lu C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), i.e. it is red-shifted by 10-11 nm compared to that of the native enzyme. In contrast, γmax maximum for rhodanese associated with α-crystallin occurs at a wavelength as low as 337 nm, indicating a substantially more hydrophobic (native-like) environment of Trp residues as compared with that of rhodanese bound to GroEL or DnaJ. A more compact (less accessible) tertiary structure of the substrate protein associated with α-crystallin than that bound to GroEL is further supported by the quenching data for rhodanese stabilized by these different chaperones (cf. data for GroEL in Refs. 26 and 27 and present results for α-crystallin). A potential complication in the interpretation of fluorescence data for substrate proteins is caused by the possibility that the chaperone itself could affect the environment of tryptophan residues by shielding them from the aqueous environment. This indeed may be a factor for GroEL-bound proteins, in which case a single molecule of a substrate is locked in the central cavity of the oligomeric chaperone(33.Fenton W.A. Kashi Y. Furtak K. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1994; 371: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). However, since α-crystallin can accommodate as many as 40 substrate molecules per 800-kDa oligomer (one substrate protein per subunit), geometric considerations point to the location of substrate proteins on the surface of the chaperone. In this case, the role of shielding effects mentioned above would be much less significant. We and others have recently shown that α-crystallin has substrate specificity strikingly different from other chaperones: it binds non-native protein structures formed on the denaturation pathway, but apparently has no affinity for intermediates formed on the refolding pathway(21.Das K.P. Surewicz W.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34.Carver J.A. Guerreiro N. Nicholls K.A. Truscott R.J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our present results complement the previous findings by providing crucial information about the conformational state of proteins captured by this chaperone. In view of these combined data, one can postulate that α-crystallin preferentially recognizes non-native structures characterized by an increased surface hydrophobicity but a remarkably low degree of unfolding, i.e. the aggregation-prone conformers that occur very early on the denaturation pathway. Such a unique substrate specificity would be fully consistent with the putative physiological role of α-crystallin as a “junior chaperone” specifically designed to suppress irreversible aggregation of proteins under stress conditions. The above function of α-crystallin may be of particular importance in the ocular lens(15.Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Major physiologically relevant factors known to induce aggregation of lens proteins include ultraviolet radiation and oxidative stress. While the above insults are highly unlikely to cause extensive unfolding of protein molecules, they may induce perturbations in the tertiary structure, leading to an increased surface hydrophobicity and, eventually, protein aggregation (17.Raman B. Rao C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27264-27268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With its ability to capture and stabilize these early non-native structures, α-crystallin appears to be uniquely well suited to chaperone the transparency properties of the ocular lens.

B transferase transfers galactose in place of GalNAc to the same acceptor substrate to synthesize B antigens. We have previously identified four amino acid substitutions between human A and B transferases. Out of these four, substitutions at the last two positions (codons 266 and 268) were found to be crucial for the different donor nucleotide-sugar specificities between A and B transferases as analyzed by gene transfer of chimeric A-B transferase genes.In the present study, we have in vitro mutagenized codon 268 of these two transferase cDNA expression constructs (glycine and alanine in A and B transferases, respectively) and produced substitution constructs with every possible amino acid residue at this position. We examined the activity and specificity of each construct by gene transfer followed by immunodetection of A and B antigens and in vitro enzymatic assay. Amino acid substitution constructs on the A transferase backbone with alanine, serine, and cysteine expressed enzymes with A and B transferase activities. Weak A activity was detected with histidine and phenylalanine constructs while weak B activity was detected with asparagine and threonine constructs. All the other amino acid substitutions at codon 268 on the A transferase backbone showed neither A nor B activity. The glycine construct on the B transferase backbone expressed both A and B transferase activities. Some substitution constructs on the B transferase backbone maintained B activity while some other substitutions abolished the activity.These results show that the side chain of the amino acid residue at 268 of the human A and B transferases is responsible for determining both activity and nucleotide-sugar donor substrate specificity and strongly suggest its direct involvement in the recognition of and binding to the sugar moiety of the nucleotide-sugars. Histo-blood group A transferase produces A antigens and transfers GalNAc to the acceptor substrate, H structures of glycolipids and glycoproteins. B transferase transfers galactose in place of GalNAc to the same acceptor substrate to synthesize B antigens. We have previously identified four amino acid substitutions between human A and B transferases. Out of these four, substitutions at the last two positions (codons 266 and 268) were found to be crucial for the different donor nucleotide-sugar specificities between A and B transferases as analyzed by gene transfer of chimeric A-B transferase genes. In the present study, we have in vitro mutagenized codon 268 of these two transferase cDNA expression constructs (glycine and alanine in A and B transferases, respectively) and produced substitution constructs with every possible amino acid residue at this position. We examined the activity and specificity of each construct by gene transfer followed by immunodetection of A and B antigens and in vitro enzymatic assay. Amino acid substitution constructs on the A transferase backbone with alanine, serine, and cysteine expressed enzymes with A and B transferase activities. Weak A activity was detected with histidine and phenylalanine constructs while weak B activity was detected with asparagine and threonine constructs. All the other amino acid substitutions at codon 268 on the A transferase backbone showed neither A nor B activity. The glycine construct on the B transferase backbone expressed both A and B transferase activities. Some substitution constructs on the B transferase backbone maintained B activity while some other substitutions abolished the activity. These results show that the side chain of the amino acid residue at 268 of the human A and B transferases is responsible for determining both activity and nucleotide-sugar donor substrate specificity and strongly suggest its direct involvement in the recognition of and binding to the sugar moiety of the nucleotide-sugars. Glycoproteins and glycolipids are essential components of cellular membranes. Carbohydrate structures of these molecules are complex and exhibit great variety, and they are synthesized through a series of reactions catalyzed by the enzymes called glycosyltransferases(1.Beyer T.A. Sadler E. Rearick J.I. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1982; 52: 23-175Google Scholar, 2.Hakomori S. Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1984; 2: 103-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). The human histo-blood group ABO system offers one of the best systems to study the structural basis of specificity and activity of glycosyltransferases(3.Yamamoto F. Vox Sang. 1995; 69: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The functional alleles at the ABO locus encode glycosyltransferases to catalyze the final step of reactions to synthesize the carbohydrate antigens A and B(4.Watkins W.M. Harris H. Hirschhorn K. Advances in Human Genetics. 10. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 1-136Google Scholar). A1 alleles encode an enzyme (A1 transferase) to transfer N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (or GalNAc for short) from the donor substrate, UDP-GalNAc, to the acceptor substrate H structures of glycoproteins and glycolipids. B alleles encode another enzyme (B transferase) to transfer a different sugar, D-galactose from UDP-galactose, to the same acceptor substrate. Therefore, comparative structural analysis is needed to delineate the structural basis of the different specificities of A and B transferases. O alleles are incapable of producing functional enzymes, and the substrates remain unchanged. In addition to these three major alleles, there are many other minor subtypes. Although they are rare in the population, glycosyltransferases coded by these subtypic alleles offer clues about the structural basis of the enzymatic activity of glycosyltransferases. We have cloned the cDNA for the human histo-blood group A transferase (5.Yamamoto F. Marken J. Tsuji T. White T. Clausen H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1146-1151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used this cDNA to screen cDNA libraries made with RNA from human cell lines showing different ABO phenotypes. We then co-related the differences in the nucleotide sequences with each of the three major (A1, B, and O) alleles(6.Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Four amino acid substitutions (RGLG and GSMA at codons 176, 235, 266, and 268 in A and B transferases, respectively) were identified, which discriminate between A and B transferases. O alleles were found to possess a single nucleotide deletion relatively close to the amino terminus of the coding sequence of the enzyme. We then analyzed A2 alleles, one of the A subtypes, and identified another single nucleotide deletion, which, different from the single nucleotide deletion of O alleles, is located at the carboxyl terminus of the A transferase coding sequence(7.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This deletion changes the frame of codons and results in a transferase (A2 transferase) with an additional 21 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The presence of this domain was then proven to diminish the activity and confer restriction on the acceptor substrate usage of the enzyme. Sequence analysis of the alleles responsible for various minor subtypes(8.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Harris T. Judd W.J. Davenport R.D.

Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and two interesting phenotypes, cis-AB (10.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Kominato Y. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Ishimoto S. Nishida S. Shima M. Fujimura Y. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and B(A)(9.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Harris T. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), also revealed other mutations in the gene. We also determined the partial nucleotide sequences of ABO genes from some species of primates (11.Kominato Y. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Russell M. Hakomori S. Yamamoto F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Among the four amino acid substitutions that discriminate human A and B transferases, amino acid residues at only the third and the fourth positions were found to be conserved in the primate ABO genes. All the information from these sequence analyses, in combination with functional assays of A and B transferases and their chimeras(12.Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicate the importance of amino acid residues at 266 and 268 of the human A and B transferases for the activity and the different donor substrate specificities of these two enzymes. We have recently identified a second type of O allele that is devoid of the single nucleotide deletion found in all other O alleles previously analyzed and instead possesses two amino acid substitutions, one at codon 176 (arginine to glycine) and the other at codon 268 (glycine to arginine) of A transferase(13.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Bromilow I.M. Duguid J.K.M. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The presence of this O allele in the Danish population has been reported(14.Grunnet N. Steffensen R. Benett E.P. Clausen H. Vox Sang. 1994; 67: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). DNA transfection experiments have shown that the introduction of these two missense mutations to a functional A transferase expression construct completely abolished the enzymatic activity. Because the arginine to glycine substitution at codon 176 was incapable of changing activity or specificity of the enzyme(12.Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that the glycine to arginine substitution at codon 268 was responsible for the inactivation of the transferase. Sequence comparison of A and B transferases with bovine (15.Joziasse D.H. Shaper J.H. van den Eijnden D.H. Van Tunen A.J. Shaper N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14290-14297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and murine (16.Larsen R.D. Rajan V.P. Ruff M.M. Kukowska-Latallo J. Cummings R.D. Lowe J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) α-1,3-galactosyltransferases confirmed the importance of codon 268 (rather than codon 266) of the human A and B transferases for different donor nucleotide-sugar specificities. In order to test more directly this hypothesis and learn more about the structural specificities of these enzymes, we produced amino acid substitution constructs with every possible amino acid residue at position 268 in both A and B transferases. We then analyzed the effect of the amino acid residue at codon 268 on the nucleotide-sugar donor substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of A and B transferases.

Restriction enzymes and LipofectAMINE™ reagent were from Life Technologies, Inc. Frozen competent bacteria XL1-Blue strain of Escherichia coli was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Anti-A and anti-B mixtures of murine monoclonal antibodies were from Ortho Diagnostic Systems Inc. (Piscataway, NJ), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin was from Sigma. β-Galactosidase assay kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). 2′-Fucosyllactose, UDP-galactose, UDP-GalNAc, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactoside (X-gal) were from Sigma, and Poly-Prep prefilled AG1-X8 resin chromatography columns were from Bio-Rad. Degenerate oligodeoxynucleotides FY-78, FY-81, and PDM-1 to −6 were custom synthesized at BioSynthesis Inc. (Denton, TX). The nucleotide sequences of these oligodeoxynucleotide primers are as follows: FY-78, CCGGATCCGTGTGATTTGAGGTGGGGAC; FY-81, CGGAATTCA(A/T)G(T/C)ACTTCATGGT(G/T)GGCCA; PDM-1, ATTTCTACTACCTGGGGNNNTTCTTCGGGGGGTCGGT; PDM-2, ACCGACCCCCCGAAGAANNNCCCCAGGTAGTAGAAAT; PDM-3, ATTTCTACTACATGGGGNNNTTCTTCGGGGGGTCGGT; PDM-4, ACCGACCCCCCGAAGAANNNCCCCATGTAGTAGAAAT; PDM-5, ACCCCCCGAAGAACATCCCCAGGTAGTA; PDM-6, ACCCCCCGAAGAA(C/T)ATCCCCATGTAGTA.

The capitalized underlined letter N denotes a mixture of four nucleotides (GATC) at the position. polymerase chain reaction fluorescence-activated cell sorter. We employed polymerase chain reaction with degenerate oligodeoxynucleotides to introduce mutations at codon 268 of human A and B transferases (Fig. 1). Two DNA fragments were first amplified from the template plasmid pAAAA (or pBBBB) DNA(12.Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with two sets of oligodeoxynucleotide primers (FY-81 and PDM-2 (or −4) or FY-78 and PDM-1 (or −3), respectively). Oligo primers, PDM-1 and −2 (and PDM-3 and −4), possess degenerate nucleotide sequences(NNN) at codon 268 to represent all the possible 64 combinations. The two primers, PDM-1 and −2 (and PDM-3 and −4), are complementary to each other except at codon 268. Supplemented with the original plasmid DNA, the two amplified fragments overlapping one another at the primer sequence were used as templates to amplify the fragment bordered by the outer primers, FY-78 and −81. Oligo primer FY-81 contained a degenerate sequence, but the DNA portion containing this sequence was removed from the insert by SstII and BamHI double digestion before ligation with the remaining portion of A (or B) transferase expression construct. The ligated DNA was used to transform the XL1-Blue strain of E. coli. Plasmid DNA was prepared from individual transformants and analyzed for the presence of inserts, and DNA containing the insert was denatured and used as a template for DNA sequencing reactions by Sanger's dideoxy chain termination method using the Sequenase™ sequencing kit. The nucleotide sequence of codon 268 and its surrounding region (from nucleotide 695 to nucleotide 885) of 381 and 259 clones of A and B transferase amino acid substitution constructs, respectively, was determined for individual clones. Multiple clones with the correct sequence over the region were obtained for each amino acid substitution construct except for methionine constructs. In order to obtain methionine substitution constructs at codon 268, we used primer PDM-5 (or −6) in place of PDM-2 (or −4). Primer PDM-5 has a methionine codon (ATG) at amino acid 268 in the A transferase sequence background whereas PDM-6 has a mixture of methionine and isoleucine codons (AT(G/A)) at this position in the B transferase sequence background. We used degenerate primer PDM-6 because the number of isoleucine constructs was small when this oligonucleotide primer was designed. Further DNA sequencing was performed over the entire coding region, which was amplified by PCR (from the SstII site to the termination codon between nucleotides 470 and 1065) in order to exclude the clones with any additional unexpected mutation(s). We have obtained at least one such clone for each amino acid substitution construct. Two cell lines (HeLa and COS 1) were used as recipients of DNA transfection experiments. LipofectAMINE™ reagent (17.Hawley-Nelson P. Ciccarone V. Gebeyehu G. Jessee J. Felgner P. Focus (Idaho). 1993; 15: 73-79Google Scholar) was used as per the manufacturer's instructions. DNA from a single representative clone (whose coding sequence was confirmed to be correct over the PCR-amplified region) from each amino acid substitution was co-transfected with DNA from pSV-β-galactosidase control vector. Two days after transfection, HeLa cells were harvested and fixed. Portions of cells were immunostained with a mixture of murine anti-A or anti-B monoclonal antibodies and secondarily with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibody, and they were subjected to FACS analysis. The percentages of cells stained for β-galactosidase activity in situ(18.Lim K. Chae C.B. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were used to normalize the different transfection efficiencies among constructs. DNA-transfected COS 1 cells were harvested and lysed, and the supernatant was used for A and B transferase assays in vitro. A and B transferase activities were analyzed by the transfer of the radioactivity from [14C]UDP-GalNAc and UDP-galactose to the acceptor substrate, 2′-fucosyllactose, respectively. The reaction was performed in a mixture of 100 mM sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5), 5 mM ATP (pH 6.5), 20 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM UDP-GalNAc or UDP-galactose (containing 14C-labeled UDP-GalNAc or UDP-galactose, respectively), and 0.5 mM 2′-fucosyllactose. The reaction mixture containing the cell extract was incubated at 37°C for 6 and 2.5 h for A and B transferase assays, respectively. Incorporation of the radioactivity was found nearly proportional to the incubation time for the original A and B transferase under these conditions. The reaction without the acceptor substrate was used as a negative control. Radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter after separation of enzymatic reaction products from the donor nucleotide-sugar substrates through the AG1-X8 anion exchange column chromatography. The supernatant was also used for β-galactosidase enzymatic assay. Activity was determined for each sample by measuring hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside, a substrate for β-galactosidase, and the resulting value was used to normalize DNA transfection efficiency. Two cell lines were used as recipients of DNA transfection. HeLa cells express type H antigens on the cell surface and have been used successfully in our previous studies as recipients of DNA transfection of A and B transferase expression constructs and their derivatives(7.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 12.Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Bromilow I.M. Duguid J.K.M. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The specificity and activity of each amino acid substitution construct were analyzed by immunodetecting A and B antigens, which appeared on the surface of DNA-transfected cells by FACS. DNA from a single representative clone, whose nucleotide sequence was confirmed to be correct over the PCR-amplified coding sequence, from each amino acid substitution construct was used for DNA transfection with LipofectAMINE™. A construct containing a cDNA from the O allele in pSG-5 vector in the antisense orientation was used as a negative control, and the intensity of fluorescence of HeLa cells transfected with this DNA was measured and the borderlines to discriminate FACS positive cells from negative ones were placed accordingly. COS 1 cells, which produce T antigens to trigger high expression of genes under control of the SV 40 promotor sequence, were also used as recipients of DNA transfection to obtain the maximum expression of the constructs made in the vector pSG-5. The enzymatic activities of A and B transferases were measured in vitro with extracts from transfected COS 1 cells. The results of immunoassays of HeLa cells and those of enzymatic assays of COS 1 cells, which were transfected with DNA from A transferase amino acid substitution constructs, were normalized for the different efficiencies of DNA transfection and are shown in Table 1. The median intensities of fluorescence among the positively stained cells are also indicated in parentheses. Based on all the experimental results including the data from the pilot experiments (data not shown), A and B transferase activities of each amino acid substitution construct were determined and shown in the two far right columns.TABLE 1 The original A transferase glycine construct expressed very strong A transferase activity as expected. An A transferase alanine construct expressed strong A transferase activity, which was comparable with that of the glycine construct, but this alanine construct expressed weak B transferase activity as well. Two A transferase substitution constructs (serine and cysteine) expressed moderately strong A and B activities. Histidine and phenylalanine constructs showed very weak A activity, and asparagine and threonine constructs showed very weak B activity. Several A transferase constructs with other amino acids at codon 268 showed no activity of A or B transferase. The results of DNA transfection experiments with B transferase amino acid substitution constructs are shown in Table 2. The original B transferase alanine construct expressed only B activity in FACS analysis; however, very weak A transferase activity was measured by in vitro enzymatic assay. One B transferase glycine construct showed strong activities of both A and B transferases. Two B transferase substitution constructs (serine and cysteine) expressed strong B transferase activity comparable with that of the original alanine construct. Two constructs (asparagine and threonine) showed strong B activity and five (aspartic acid, histidine, leucine, proline, and valine) constructs expressed moderate B activity. Two (glutamine and phenylalanine) and one (methionine) constructs expressed weak and very weak B activity, respectively.TABLE 2 It is logical to assume that the detection of A and B antigens (secondary enzymatic reaction products) is more sensitive than that of enzymes (primary gene product) if the enzymes are translocated to the appropriate locus (Golgi apparatus) and functional in vivo. As shown in TABLE 1, TABLE 2, sensitivity was actually much higher with the detection of A and B antigens than with the in vitro enzymatic assay. The median intensities of fluorescence of positively stained cells among different constructs seem similar, suggesting that even small amounts of enzymatic activity generated significant numbers of cell surface A and/or B antigenic determinants very efficiently. We used only single in vitro enzymatic assay conditions. However, under these conditions, we were able to detect activity even less than 1% of the original A and B transferase constructs using extracts from COS 1 cells transfected with each amino acid substitution construct. For example, A transferase activity of A transferase serine substitution construct has 0.4% of that of the original A transferase glycine construct. COS 1 cells possessed low activities of A and B transferases, and small amounts of radioactivity incorporated into the reaction products (high background level) made it difficult to detect very weak activities of some substitution constructs. However, it is true that antigen-positive HeLa cells were also not detectable with those constructs by immunological means when the transfection efficiency was low. The percentages of A and B antigen expressing HeLa cells seemed proportional to the enzymatic activities when the expression of the enzymes was low (data not shown), whereas at higher expression they are linear but not proportional (TABLE 1, TABLE 2). This may be due to the saturation of A and B antigens on the cell surface when large numbers of enzymes are produced in vivo. We found one exception where no enzymatic reaction products were detected on HeLa cells, but A transferase enzymatic activity was measured in vitro in the COS 1 cell extract (B transferase original alanine construct). This result may not be real because the A transferase activity detected in vitro was so small (0.3% of that of original A transferase); however, a similar finding was previously reported using sera from blood group B individuals as an enzyme source(19.Greenwell P. Yates A.D. Watkins W.M. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 149: 149-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We have previously identified two missense mutations in two cases of cis-AB alleles responsible for the cis inheritance of both A and B transferase activities by a single gene on a single chromosome(10.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Kominato Y. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Ishimoto S. Nishida S. Shima M. Fujimura Y. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). One of these mutations was found at the last position of the four amino acid substitutions that discriminate the human A and B transferases. cis-AB alleles contained the B-specific alanine at codon 268 in the A transferase backbone. Therefore, the A transferase alanine substitution construct corresponds exactly to previously published expression construct pAAAB. DNA transfection of this A transferase alanine construct has yielded a result showing weak B transferase activity, which is different from the previous result with pAAAB(12.Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The repeated analysis of the pAAAB indicates that discrepancy may be ascribed to antibody specificity issues. The same explanation can be applied to pBABB, another chimeric construct representing B(A) allele(9.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Harris T. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which was previously found not to express A activity(12.Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the fact that B(A) was initially identified with certain murine anti-A monoclonal antibody(20.Treacy M. Stroup M. A Scientific Forum on Blood Grouping Serum Anti-A (Murine Monoclonal Blend) BioClone. Ortho Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Raritan, NJ1987Google Scholar), different anti-A antibodies may detect A antigens on HeLa cells transfected with the pBABB construct. Clearly positive A transferase activity was observed with six amino acid substitution constructs with the A transferase backbone. Those amino acid residues are glycine, alanine, serine, cysteine, histidine, and phenylalanine, and activity decreases in that order. Apparently, the strength of activity is reciprocally proportional to the size of side chain. The side groups of amino acid residues other than four (glycine, alanine, serine, and cysteine) may be too bulky to accommodate the GalNAc portion of the UDP-GalNAc nucleotide-sugar into the recognition and interacting site of A transferase. It is difficult to explain weak A activity of histidine and phenylalanine constructs only by the size of the side group; however, these amino acid residues may have special characteristics considering the fact that these amino acid substitution constructs on B transferase backbone also showed moderate B transferase activity, as will be discussed. B transferase activity was observed with serine, cysteine, alanine, asparagine, and threonine (all with small side chains) at codon 268 in A transferase constructs. The side chain of glycine (hydrogen) may be big enough to interact with GalNAc but too small to interact with galactose. Strong A transferase activity was detected only in the glycine construct with the B transferase backbone. The methionine at codon 266 of B transferase constructs is bigger than the leucine residue of A transferase constructs, and this bigger size may compensate the small hydrogen side chain of glycine at codon 268 and enable the B transferase glycine mutant to interact with and transfer both GalNAc and galactose. Strong B activity was observed with six B transferase constructs (alanine, glycine, serine, cysteine, asparagine, and threonine). In addition, five (aspartic acid, histidine, leucine, proline, and valine), two (glutamine and phenylalanine), and one (methionine) constructs showed moderate, weak, and very weak B activity, respectively. Comparison of B antigen-positive cell percentages among constructs with a neutral polar amino acid at codon 268 (glycine > serine > threonine > tyrosine = 0) indicates the importance of the size of side chain as shown above with A transferase substitution mutants. Comparison among four amino acid substitutions (asparagine > aspartic acid > glutamine > glutamic acid = 0) suggests that the presence of an acidic side chain decreased enzymatic activity. Not only the size but also the basic charge of the side groups may be responsible for the loss of activity in arginine and lysine constructs. However, the construct with histidine, a basic amino acid with an imidazole group, showed moderate B activity. Comparison among constructs with neutral hydrophobic side chains (alanine > valine ≥ leucine > isoleucine = tryptophan = 0) shows again the importance of the size of the side chain for the strength of activity. The phenylalanine construct, however, showed weak B transferase activity. The construct with a proline residue, in which the nitrogen atom of the amino group is incorporated into a ring, introducing a bend in a peptide, still possessed B activity. In addition, more amino acid substitutions were functional in B transferase backbone than those in A transferase backbone. This implies that the amino acid residues at 266 and possibly 267 as well are also important in both the activity and the specificity of the transferases and that the size of the side chain at codon 268 is not the only issue. We hope that three-dimensional structural analysis by x-ray crystallography and molecular modeling of these transferases will clarify these ambiguities in the future. We have previously identified a second type of O allele, which contains two amino acid substitutions (arginine-to-glycine at 176 and glycine-to-arginine at 268)(13.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Hakomori S. Bromilow I.M. Duguid J.K.M. Vox Sang. 1993; 64: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The A transferase arginine construct showed no activity of A or B transferase suggesting that the glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 268 is sufficient alone to abolish A transferase activity in the protein coded by this rare type of O allele. Single nucleotide substitutions at the first and the second positions of codon 268 (nucleotides 802 and 803) of the A transferase coding sequence result in five amino acid substitutions at codon 268 (from GGG: glycine to GAG: glutamic acid, GTG: valine, GCG: alanine, AGG and CGG: arginine, or TGG: tryptophan). Out of these five, alanine was the only substitution that did not spoil the enzymatic activity as shown in Table 1. Similarly, single nucleotide substitutions at those positions of the B transferase coding sequence result in six amino acid substitutions (from GCG: alanine to ACG: threonine, TCG: serine, CCG: proline, GGG: glycine, GAG: glutamic acid, or GTG: valine). As shown in Table 2, B transferase alanine to glycine substitution resulted in an enzyme with both A and B transferase activities while the glutamic acid substitution abolished the B transferase activity. All the other amino acid substitutions (threonine, serine, proline, and valine) did not abolish but weakened B transferase activity. In all, five single base substitutions at codon 268 in the A transferase backbone and one in the B transferase backbone abolish the activity and result in phenotypically O alleles. Of these six possible mutations only an arginine substitution at codon 268 with the A transferase backbone has been discovered in O alleles in the human population so far(13.Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D.

Vox Sang. 1994; 67: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), in addition to the single nucleotide deletion that distinguishes most O alleles(6.Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Our present results, however, suggest the possible existence of O alleles with other amino acid residues at codon 268 in the A or B transferase backbone.

We used amperometric detection of exocytosis and indo-1 monitoring of [Ca2+]i to identify PACAP actions in cultured chromaffin cells. PACAP (100 nM) required external Ca2+ to evoke secretion. However, unlike nicotine and KCl which caused immediate and relatively brief secretion, PACAP had a latency of 6.8 ± 0.96 s to the first secretory response and secretion continued for up to 2 min. PACAP elevation of [Ca2+]i showed similar latency and often remained above base line for several minutes following a brief exposure. ZnCl2 (100 μM) selectively inhibited PACAP-stimulated secretion and [Ca2+]i with little effect on nicotine-evoked responses. Nifedipine (10 μM) had little effect on PACAP-evoked secretion but inhibited nicotine-evoked secretion by more than 80%, while ω-conotoxin (100 nM) failed to affect either agonist. PACAP-stimulated cAMP levels required 5 s to significantly increase, consistent with the latency of exocytotic and Ca2+ responses. Forskolin (10 μM) caused responses similar to PACAP. PACAP-evoked exocytosis was blocked by the protein kinase A inhibitor adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate Rp-diastereomer (Rp-cAMPS). These data show that PACAP stimulates exocytosis by a mechanism distinctly different from cholinergic transmitters that appears to involve cAMP-mediated Ca2+ influx. Differences in receptor coupling mechanisms and pharmacology of Ca2+ entry stimulated by cholinergic and peptidergic agonists support the idea that the peptidergic system maintains catecholamine secretion under conditions where the cholinergic system desensitizes or otherwise fails.

There is convincing evidence that secretion of adrenal medullary hormones in various species is regulated by peptidergic neurotransmitters.

However, there is also evidence against the existence of VIP immunoreactive fibers in adrenal medulla (5.Maubert E. Tramu G. Croise D. Beauwillain C.J. Dupouy J.P. Neurosci.

While VIP stimulates the cAMP as well as phosphatidylinositol pathways(7.Malhotra R.K. Wakade T.D. Wakade A.R. J.

At the same time that VIP was being characterized as a medullary neurotransmitter, a new member of the VIP/glucagon/secretin family of peptides (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide, PACAP) was discovered and shown to be a most potent activator of adenylyl cyclase(8.Miyata A.

PACAP occurs in both a 27 (PACAP27) and 38 (PACAP38) amino acid form and has about 70% homology with VIP(8.Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R. Ninamino N. Uehara A. Jung L. Culler M.D. Coy D.H. Biochem.

Finally, the adrenal gland has been reported to contain the second highest concentration of PACAP among peripheral organs of the rat(17.Arimura A. Somogyvari-Vigh A. Miyata A. Mizuno K. Coy D.H. Kitada C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 81: 6388-6392Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we have suggested that both VIP and PACAP might function as non-cholinergic neurotransmitters controlling catecholamine synthesis and secretion in the rat adrenal medulla ((12.Wakade A.R. Guo X. Strong R. Arimura A. Haycock J. Regul. Pept. 1992; 37: 331Crossref Google Scholar) and see also (18.Haycock J.W. Wakade A.R. J.

Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of PACAP-evoked catecholamine secretion remains unclear. We undertook the present work to identify the mechanism by which PACAP mobilizes Ca2+ and stimulates secretion in primary cultures of rat chromaffin cells. Amperometric detection of exocytosis and indo-1 fluorescence measurement of [Ca2+]i were used to define PACAP effects on single chromaffin cells. Our recently developed protocols were used to isolate and identify internal versus external sources of Ca2+ used in exocytosis. PACAP-evoked exocytosis was monitored in cells during transient exposure to a Ca2+-free environment and in cells in the presence of Ca2+ but depleted of internal Ca2+ stores. Our findings show that a peptidergic transmitter utilizes extracellular Ca2+ to evoke catecholamine secretion, but by a mechanism distinctly different from acetylcholine acting on nicotinic and muscarinic receptors in this preparation. The data indicate that PACAP increases Ca2+ influx in association with cAMP production. Chromaffin cells were cultured from 19- to 31-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described(21.Tischler A.S.

Briefly, medullary fragments were incubated in 1.5 mg/ml type I collagenase and 0.5 mg/ml DNase (Worthington) in phosphate-buffered saline, followed by trypsin (1.25 mg/ml in PBS) and DNase (0.5 mg/ml), and cells dissociated by trituration. Cells were washed by centrifugation (600 × g, 5 min) and plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips in M-199 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus serum and 0.1 μM dexamethasone and used after 2-7 days. Immunohistochemical staining showed that cultures contained greater than 90% tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells. 3T. D. Wakade and A. R. Wakade, unpublished data. Coverslips with attached chromaffin cells were transferred to HEPES-buffered bath solution for monitoring of exocytosis or [Ca2+]i. The solution contained (in mM) 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Ca2+-free solution had no added CaCl2 and was supplemented with 1 mM EGTA. Exocytosis from single rat chromaffin cells was detected using established micro-electrochemical techniques(15.Chowdhury P.S. Guo X. Wakade T.D. Przywara D.A. Wakade A.R.

Eight-μm carbon fibers were cannulated into polyethylene tubing, pulled and cut (final tip diameter < 9 μm), and sealed into glass capillaries.

Carbon fiber electrodes were positioned within 1 μm of a chromaffin cell to record currents resulting from oxidation of exocytotically released catecholamines(25.Wightman R.M. Jankowski J.A.

Secretagogues in control or Ca2+-free bath solutions were applied by pressure ejection from pulled glass capillaries (∼10 μm tip diameter) positioned about 20 μm from the cell. Ca2+-free solution had no added CaCl2 and was supplemented with 1 mM EGTA. Intracellular Ca2+ stores were depleted by 15-min pretreatment in Ca2+-free solution. Control of the Ca2+ environment was verified in two ways. First, by showing that in a Ca2+-containing bath, application of KCl (or nicotine) in Ca2+-free pipette solution failed to produce exocytosis (Fig. 1a) or elevate [Ca2+]i, (not shown) while mobilization of internal Ca2+ by caffeine under the same conditions gave positive responses (Fig. 1a). Second, in Ca2+-depleted cells, caffeine (applied with Ca2+ in the pipette) failed to stimulate the cells, while KCl depolarization continued to give positive responses (Fig. 1b). In most experiments each cell was used as its own control. [Ca2+]i was measured by ratiometric determination of in indo-1 fluorescence as described previously (27.Przywara D.A. Bhave S.V. Bhave A.

Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using an ACAS 570, confocal laser photometer (Meridian Instruments, Lansing, MI). Experimental protocols for [Ca2+]i determination paralleled those used during monitoring of exocytosis. For determination of cAMP content, chromaffin cells were plated at a concentration of about 5 medullae (250,000 cells)/dish and used after 3 days. Culture medium was removed by washing with Krebs buffer solution, and 100 nM PACAP in Krebs was added to the dish for various time periods from 0 to 30 s. The reaction was stopped and cells extracted in 1 ml of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (6%). The extract was centrifuged (3000 × g, 15 min) and the pellet used for protein determination as described(30.Schacterle G.R. Pollack R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 51: 654-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). The supernatant was extracted with ethyl ether, evaporated to dryness, and the residue used for cAMP determination using a DuPont NEN radioimmuno assay kit according to the protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Fig. 2a shows a representative amperometric recording of exocytotic events stimulated in an individual rat chromaffin cell by a 10-s application of 100 nM PACAP from an ejection pipette aimed at the cell. Both the bath and pipette solutions contained 2.5 mM Ca2+. Exocytosis began 6.8 ± 0.96 s (25 cells) after the start of PACAP application and continued for a minute or more after agonist application. This pattern of stimulation is much different than exocytosis produced by depolarization with KCl ((16.Guo X. Wakade A.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1994; 475: 539-545Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and (31.Guo, X., Przywara, D. A., Wakade, T. D., Wakade, A. R. (1996) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar) and see Fig. 1a) or stimulation of nicotinic receptors (below), both of which cause an almost immediate and brief (20-30 s) burst of exocytotic events. The role of Ca2+ entry from the external medium in PACAP-induced exocytosis was examined by applying PACAP in a nominally Ca2+-free pipette solution to chromaffin cells in a 2.5 mM Ca2+-containing bath solution. PACAP (100 nM for 30 s) produced no exocytosis during the application period (Fig. 2b). However, immediately after the cessation of peptide application, there was a massive exocytotic response as the Ca2+-free pipette solution was displaced by the Ca2+-containing bath solution. Exocytosis continued for several minutes (not shown). To confirm the utilization of external Ca2+ in PACAP-evoked exocytosis experiments were performed with cells depleted of internal Ca2+ by maintaining cells in Ca2+-free (1 mM EGTA) bath solution for 15 min prior to and during PACAP application. Ten second application of PACAP plus Ca2+ to Ca2+-depleted cells caused a burst of exocytosis with typical latency (Fig. 2c). The duration of PACAP-evoked exocytosis in Ca2+-depleted cells was much less compared with cells with normal Ca2+ stores (compare Fig. 2, a and c). The effects of PACAP on [Ca2+]i were determined in parallel with exocytosis experiments using identical protocols. Fig. 3a shows that a 10-s application of PACAP to an indo-1-loaded chromaffin cell caused an increase in [Ca2+]i that exhibits a latency to onset and prolonged duration consistent with PACAP stimulated exocytosis. In some chromaffin cells, the initial rise in [Ca2+]i was followed by fluctuating [Ca2+]i after a brief application of PACAP (see Fig. 4 for example). In six cells monitored for 1 min or longer after PACAP application, the average latency to the beginning of [Ca2+]i elevation was 7.9 ± 0.8 s. The mean peak was 398 ± 35 nM and in four of the six cells [Ca2+]i remained elevated for the duration of recording (352 ± 29 nM at 60 s). The remaining two cells exhibited Ca2+ fluctuations throughout the recording period.Figure 4:ZnCl2 selectively blocks PACAP-stimulated exocytosis and elevated [Ca2+]i. Exocytotic events stimulated by 10-s application of 100 nM PACAP (a) or 500-ms application of 10 μM nicotine (c) in the absence (open bars) and presence (filled bars) of 100 μM ZnCl2 were counted for 60 s beginning with the onset of agonist application (zero time). Bars show number of exocytotic events binned in consecutive 5-s intervals and represent the mean ± S.E. of 12 experiments. [Ca2+]i was recorded in indo-1-loaded chromaffin cells stimulated by 100 nM PACAP for 10 s (b) or 10 μM nicotine for 500 ms (d) in the absence and presence of 100 μM ZnCl2 as indicated. Traces are representative of 12 (b) and 7 (d) observations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When [Ca2+]i was monitored after application of PACAP in a Ca2+-free pipette solution (Fig. 3b), there was no change in [Ca2+]i until after cessation of peptide application, identical to the pattern of exocytosis produced under the same conditions. Finally, the effects of PACAP on [Ca2+]i were determined in cells depleted of internal Ca2+ stores (Fig. 3c). The rapid decline of [Ca2+]i under these conditions is consistent with a more rapid sequestration of Ca2+ into depleted internal stores and confirms the role of external Ca2+ entry in PACAP-evoked catecholamine secretion. We used a pharmacological approach to discriminate between the delayed but long lasting responses stimulated by PACAP and the immediate brief effects of depolarizing stimuli. Among several Ca2+ channel antagonists tested, only Zn2+ exhibited differential effects on PACAP versus other secretagogues. ZnCl2 (100 μM) almost completely suppressed PACAP-evoked exocytosis (Fig. 4a) and elevated [Ca2+]i (Fig. 4b) with little or no effect on nicotine-stimulated responses (Fig. 4, c and d) or KCl-evoked exocytosis (not shown). In the example in Fig. 4b, brief application of PACAP caused a fluctuating rather than sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i. Nifedipine (10 μM) had no effect on PACAP-induced secretion of catecholamines. PACAP stimulated 71 ± 7 and 72 ± 7 exocytotic events during 2-min recording in control and nifedipine-treated cells (n = 9), respectively. ω-Conotoxin produced an approximate 18% decline in secretion (58 ± 6 events/2 min recording, n = 9), but the difference was not significant. However, when tested against nicotine-evoked secretion, nifedipine produced 83% inhibition (70 ± 3 and 12 ± 2 events in control and 1 μM nifedipine, respectively, n = 5), and ω-conotoxin had no effect (103 ± 22%) compared with untreated controls (n = 5). Because PACAP is established as a potent stimulator of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP formation, we questioned whether forskolin, which also stimulates adenylyl cyclase, would have secretory actions similar to PACAP. Application of forskolin (10 μM for 10 s) produced a long-lasting secretory response in 2.5 mM Ca2+ medium (Fig. 5a). The delay between beginning of forskolin application and detection of the first exocytotic event was 7.5 ± 0.95 s (28 cells). When forskolin was administered in a nominally Ca2+-free pipette solution, exocytotic events were detected only after cessation of the Ca2+-free solution (Fig. 5b). Application of forskolin plus Ca2+ to Ca2+-depleted chromaffin cells, like PACAP, stimulated exocytosis only during the period when Ca2+ was available to the cells (Fig. 5c). When tested on indo-1 loaded chromaffin cells, forskolin caused a rise in [Ca2+]i that was similar to that produced by PACAP. The average peak [Ca2+]i was 322 ± 29 nM with a latency of 6.7 ± 1 s (n = 5). However, forskolin typically produced fluctuations in [Ca2+]i (see Fig. 6b for example) rather than the sustained elevation seen with PACAP. In this regard, it was noted that forskolin-evoked exocytosis was qualitatively similar to PACAP in terms of latency, use of external Ca2+, and sensitivity to Zn2+ (Fig. 6a). However, compared with PACAP, forskolin-evoked exocytosis was less robust with fewer total exocytotic events (compare Fig. 6a and Fig. 4a). These data suggest that PACAP-evoked catecholamine secretion has a prominent, but not exclusive, cAMP-mediated mechanism. In all tests performed, the latency between beginning of agonist application and detection of the first exocytotic event appeared to be most closely correlated to the mechanism of agonist action (Table 1). Nicotine and excess KCl, which act by depolarization and opening of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, cause secretion to occur almost instantaneously. The observed delay of a few hundred ms with these agonists reflects the positioning of the ejection pipette 20 μm from the cells and the resulting delay in changing the environment around the cell. Under these same conditions, agonists which mobilize internal Ca2+, muscarine, and caffeine, exhibited a latency between 2 and 3 s, while PACAP (or forskolin) acting presumably through a cAMP-dependent phosphorylation cascade, required approximately 7 s to evoke secretion.TABLE 1 To determine if the time required for cAMP elevation could account for the latency of PACAP effects, we monitored cAMP levels during PACAP exposure. PACAP required 5 s to significantly increase cAMP levels compared with unstimulated controls (Fig. 7). The small and variable increase in cAMP observed at 2.5-s exposure to PACAP was not statistically significant. cAMP levels appeared to reach a plateau at 5 s and remained at about the same level during PACAP exposure for up to 30 s (Fig. 7). To further implicate cAMP-dependent phosphorylation, PACAP effects were tested in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor, adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate Rp-diastereomer (Rp-cAMPS)(32.Marley P.D. Thompson K.A. Barlow R.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 114: 1687-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rp-cAMPS (300 μM for 30 min) caused a significant reduction of PACAP-evoked exocytosis with little effect on nicotine-evoked responses (Fig. 8). Several lines of evidence have been presented to define the secretory mechanism of PACAP, a non-cholinergic co-transmitter in the adrenal medulla. The secretory mechanism of PACAP appears distinctly different from acetylcholine acting through nicotinic and muscarinic receptor stimulation. PACAP-evoked exocytosis and elevated [Ca2+]i occurred only after a pronounced latency and required the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The time course of PACAP-stimulated cAMP elevation and the close correspondence between effects of PACAP and forskolin support the conclusion that PACAP actions are mediated by cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinases. PACAP (or forskolin) stimulated exocytosis and elevated [Ca2+]i only when external Ca2+ was present, indicating that the peptide causes Ca2+ entry into chromaffin cells. The absence of exocytosis and elevated [Ca2+]i during 30-s application of PACAP without CaCl2 also shows that Ca2+ influx is required for PACAP-evoked catecholamine secretion. The pronounced increase in [Ca2+]i and exocytosis upon cessation of the stimulus was most likely due to stimulation of intracellular second messengers during the application period, coupled with high affinity binding of PACAP and slow dissociation from its receptors, producing an exaggerated response as the pipette solution was displaced by the Ca2+ containing bath solution. The mechanism of Ca2+ entry following PACAP application was different than that produced by acetylcholine. Acetylcholine effects were sensitive to block of L-type Ca2+ channels by nifedipine, but PACAP effects were not. This is somewhat different from PACAP effects in mass cultures of porcine chromaffin cells, which were reported to be inhibited by nifedipine(14.Isobe K. Nakai T. Takawa Y. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1757-1765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neither agonist was opposed by block of N-type channels by ω-conotoxin. The finding that 100 μM Zn2+ discriminates between PACAP and other secretagogues that stimulate Ca2+ entry supports the idea that PACAP promotes Ca2+ entry by a distinct mechanism. One possibility is that PACAP causes a phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of channels not active during nicotinic or KCl induced depolarization. While forskolin-evoked exocytosis was qualitatively similar to that produced by PACAP, forskolin consistently produced fewer exocytotic events. This may be due to the reported ability of PACAP38 to stimulate the inositol lipid cascade along with elevated cAMP levels(33.Deutsch P.J. Sun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5108-5113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple signaling pathways stimulated by PACAP but not forskolin would account for the more robust secretion by PACAP. The most intriguing characteristic of PACAP stimulation was the approximate 7-s delay between application and onset of action. Only a fraction of the latency could be attributed to time required for the pipette solution to displace bath solution around an individual cell. Delay intrinsic to the protocol was less than 0.5 s as indicated by the latency when depolarizing stimulus was administered. Receptor-mediated signal transduction is unlikely to account for much of the latency, since nicotinic receptor activation produced an almost immediate response. The observed latencies appear to be closely related to the intracellular mechanism involved in stimulating catecholamine secretion. Agents that mobilize internal Ca2+ (muscarine and caffeine) acted within 2-3 s, while agents which elevate cAMP (forskolin and PACAP) required about 7 s to produce exocytosis. Receptor-mediated production of second messengers is not likely to account for the latency for two reasons. First, both muscarine and PACAP stimulate complex second messenger pathways, but produced exocytosis with significantly different latencies. Second, caffeine, which mobilizes internal Ca2+ but does not act through a plasma membrane receptor, acts with the same delay as muscarine, while forskolin, which elevates cAMP independent of membrane receptors, acts with the same delay as PACAP. These observations, coupled with the instantaneous action of depolarizing agents, suggest that the last step in the signaling pathway that directly causes Ca2+ influx or liberation of internal stores is the factor controlling latency. The approximately 5-s latency for PACAP-evoked elevation of cAMP levels in the present work is similar to the latent period (about 5 s) before cAMP-dependent enhancement of Ca2+ current is observed in cardiac cells(34.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinaur Associates, Sunderland, MA1992: 177-178Google Scholar). The high density of chromaffin cells in the cultures (>90% tyrosine hydroxylase positive)3 makes it unlikely that non-chromaffin cells account for the observed changes in cAMP levels. Furthermore, inhibition of protein kinase A by Rp-cAMPS significantly reduced PACAP-evoked exocytosis without affecting nicotine-evoked responses. These findings coupled with the observed 7-s latency to PACAP-evoked exocytosis support the idea that cAMP production and activation of protein kinase A are involved in stimulating Ca2+ entry and exocytosis. However, the mechanism of this action remains unknown. In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate the importance of multiple transmitters acting through cholinergic and non-cholinergic pathways in the adrenal synapse. PACAP stimulation of catecholamine secretion is not redundant or simply modulatory, but occurs independent of other secretagogues via mechanisms distinct from cholinergic receptor coupled pathways. Thus peptidergic transmission is likely to maintain catecholamine secretion during periods of stress or situations where cholinergic receptors desensitize or cholinergic transmission otherwise fails."
https://openalex.org/W2095593063,"Eukaryotic protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is a 55-kDa enzyme with cysteine oxidoreductase, chaperone, and antichaperone activities that catalyzes disulfide formation and rearrangement in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum. In Gram-negative bacteria, the formation of disulfide bonds in the periplasm is mediated by DsbA, a strong cysteine oxidase but an inefficient catalyst of disulfide bond isomerization with no known chaperone activity. We show that rat PDI (rPDI) secreted in the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli can catalyze the formation of disulfide bonds and complement several of the phenotypes of dsbA mutants. The function of rPDI was dependent on the dsbB gene, suggesting that the reoxidation of this eukaryotic enzyme involves direct interactions with bacterial redox proteins. Co-expression of rPDI increased the yield of bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) severalfold, an effect that was enhanced when reduced glutathione was added to the growth medium. Whereas PDI is thought to function primarily as an isomerase in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum, rPDI failed to decrease the accumulation of two-disulfide folding intermediates of BPTI and thus did not appear to appreciably catalyze the rate-limiting step in the oxidative folding pathway of BPTI. These results demonstrate that expression of eukaryotic foldases in E. coli can be exploited to better understand their function in vivo and also to increase the yield of biotechnologically valuable proteins."

Incubation of resealed ghosts with the membrane-impermeant oxidant ferricyanide doubled the ghost membrane concentration of F2-isoprostanes, a sensitive marker of lipid peroxidation. Incorporation of ascorbate into ghosts during resealing largely prevented F2-isoprostane formation due to extravesicular ferricyanide. This protection was associated with a rapid transmembrane oxidation of intravesicular ascorbate by extravesicular ferricyanide. Transmembrane electron transfer, which was measured indirectly as ascorbate-dependent ferricyanide reduction, correlated with the content of α-tocopherol in the ghost membrane in several respects. First, ascorbate resealed within ghosts protected against ferricyanide-induced oxidation of endogenous α-tocopherol in the ghost membrane. Second, when exogenous α-tocopherol was incorporated into the ghost membrane during the resealing step, subsequent ferricyanide reduction was enhanced. Last, incubation of intact erythrocytes with soybean phospholipid liposomes, followed by resealed ghost preparation, caused a proportional decrease in both the membrane content of α-tocopherol and in ferricyanide reduction.

We demonstrate that LacCer (10 μM) can stimulate the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase p44MAPK to phosphorylated p44MAPK in aortic smooth muscle cells from rabbit or human origin. Western immunoblot assays and direct measurement of activity in immunoprecipitated MAP kinase revealed that within 5 min of incubation of cells with LacCer there was a 3.5-fold increase in the activity of p44MAPK. This continued up to 10 min of incubation; thereafter, the MAP kinase activity decreased in these cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the tyrosine and threonine moieties of p44MAPK was phosphorylated by LacCer. Incubation of cells with ceramide and glucosylceramide did not significantly stimulate p44MAPK activity. Preincubation with tyrphostin (20 μM; a potent and specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinase) markedly inhibited the LacCer mediated stimulation in p44MAPK activity. Next we investigated the upstream and downstream parameters in MAP kinase signaling pathways. We found that lactosylceramide stimulated (7-fold) the loading of GTP on Ras. Concomitantly, LacCer stimulated the phosphorylation of MAP kinase kinases (MEK) and Raf within 2.5 min. Lactosylceramide specifically induced c-fos mRNA expression (3-fold) in these cells as compared to control.

Computer-assisted analysis of the DNA sequence revealed three putative open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. ORF2 extends beyond the sequenced DNA fragment, and its deduced product shares no similarities with any other known proteins in the data bases. ORF3 is also truncated, and its 41-amino acid C-terminal product is identical to the S. coelicolor adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.

Streptomyces species have a complex cell life cycle that involves morphological and biochemical differentiation. Antibiotic production is usually initiated at the transition between vegetative growth and the development of the spore-bearing aerial mycelium(1.Hopwood D.A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1988; 235: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2.Chater K.F. Trends Genet. 1990; 5: 372-377Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar), suggesting that there may be a close relationship between both processes. During this developmental regulation, antibiotic biosynthesis is controlled by a series of metabolites and regulatory gene products operating at different levels, with their final target being the structural genes of the antibiotic pathway. Streptomyces coelicolor, the genetically most studied Streptomyces species, produces at least four structurally different antibiotics: actinorhodine(3.Wright L.F. Hopwood D.A. J. Gen.

J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 2787-2795Google Scholar). The second route for (p)ppGpp synthesis in E. coli, mediated by a ribosome-independent enzyme, (p)ppGpp synthetase II activity (spoT gene product)(43.Sarubbi E. Rudd K.E. Xiao H. Ikehara K. Kalman M. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15074-15082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is deduced to occur because during carbon and energy source deprivation, (p)ppGpp does accumulate in relA-deleted strains(44.Metzger S. Schreiber G. Aizenman E. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21146-21152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while it is no longer detectable in strains carrying deletions of both the relA and spoT genes(45.Xiao H. Kalman M. Ikehara K. Zemel S. Glaser G. Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5980-5990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a (p)ppGpp synthetase from Streptomyces antibioticus has been purified and characterized (46.Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1482-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47.Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1475-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shown to possess differential catalytic properties, which raises the possibility that the reported enzyme would not represent the analog of the RelA (or SpoT) protein from E. coli; nevertheless, the presence in S. antibioticus of a pathway similar to that of relA in E. coli for (p)ppGpp synthesis could not be excluded. The isolation of relC mutants in S. antibioticus(41.Kelly K.S. Ochi K. Jones G.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2297-2300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Ochi K. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1987; 51: 829-835Google Scholar) supports this hypothesis. We report here the isolation and characterization of a new gene that strongly resembles relA and spoT and that is implicated in the regulation of antibiotic production in S. coelicolor. The E. coli strain used was JM101(49.Yanisch-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar). The S. coelicolor A3(2) strains used were J1501 (hisA1, uraA1, strA1, pgl, SCP1−, SCP2−)(50.Chater K.F. Bruton C.J. King A.A. Suárez J.E. Gene (Amst.). 1982; 19: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), J802(51.Hodgson D.A. Chater K.F. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1981; 124: 339-348Google Scholar), and MAFM0195 (an actI-ORF2-deleted mutant of S. coelicolor J1501 with an actinorhodine-nonproducing phenotype). 2M. A. Fernández-Moreno, personal communication. S. coelicolor strain CM01 was obtained using the recombinant phage described previously (52.Malpartida F. Niemi J. Navarrete R. Hopwood D.A. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 93: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) to lysogenize the J1501 strain, and the resulting lysogen has an undecylprodigiosin-nonproducing phenotype. The Streptomyces lividans strain employed was TK21 (str-6, SLP2−, SPL3−)(53.Hopwood D.A. Kieser T. Wright H.M. Bibb M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 2257-2269PubMed Google Scholar). The E. coli plasmids used were pUC19(49.Yanisch-Perron C. Viera J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar), pIJ2925(54.Janssen G.R. Bibb M.J.

Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar) were used for DNA sequencing. The Streptomyces plasmids were pIJ486(57.Ward J.M. Janssen G.R. Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Bibb M.J. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1986; 203: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), pIJ941(58.Lydiate D.J. Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 35: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and pMF1100(9.Fernández-Moreno M.A. Caballero J.L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. Cell. 1991; 66: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). pPAS3 and pPAS4 were obtained by introducing a frameshift within the thiostrepton resistance gene of pIJ941 and pMF1100, respectively, after filling the protruding ends of the ClaI site using the Klenow fragment of the DNA polymerase, followed by ligation of the resulting blunt-ended fragment. The Streptomyces ϕC31 derivative phage PM1 (59.Malpartida F. Hopwood D.A. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1986; 205: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) was used for both insertional inactivation and generation of the deleted mutant. E. coli strains were grown on L agar or in L broth, supplemented with 0.2% maltose and 10 mM MgSO4 when necessary(60.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Streptomyces manipulations were as described previously(61.Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom1985Google Scholar). Thiostrepton (Sigma, catalog No. T-8902) was used at a concentration of 50 μg/ml in agar medium and 10 μg/ml in broth cultures. Hygromycin B (Sigma, catalog No. H-2638) was used at 200 and 50 μg/ml in solid and liquid media, respectively. DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method(62.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52602) Google Scholar); DNA sequence was determined from both strands, routinely using the 7-deaza-dGTP reagent kit from U. S. Biochemical Corp. (catalog No. 70750) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Convenient DNA fragments were previously cloned in either M13mp18 or M13mp19 vectors using suitable restriction fragments. The DNA sequence was analyzed using the software programs of the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (Version 8.0-AXP)(63.Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). Analysis of open reading frames was done using CODONPREFERENCE with a codon usage table made from 100 Streptomyces genes(64.Wright F. Bibb M.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 113: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar); comparisons of sequences were made against the EMBL nucleic acid data base (daily updated) and the SwissProt data base (weekly updated), using FASTA, TFASTA, and BESTFIT. Protein alignments were made using PILEUP from the same package and displayed using PRETTYBOX from the Extended Genetics Computer Group package(65.Rice P. López R. Doelz R. Leunissen J. Eur. Mol. Biol. Network News. 1995; 2: 5-7Google Scholar). For insertional inactivation, an internal ORF fragment was cloned into the ϕC31 derivative PM1 vector, and the resulting recombinant phage was used to lysogenize the S. coelicolor J1501 strain by insert-directed recombination (66.Chater K.F. Bruton C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To obtain the deleted mutant, fragments flanking the region to be deleted were cloned into the PM1 vector, and the recombinant phage was used to lysogenize the wild-type strain by insert-directed recombination. The resulting lysogens were first isolated as a single colony and later allowed to grow without selection in order to obtain the double recombinants. The deletion was confirmed by Southern blot analysis(67.Southern E. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 503-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21461) Google Scholar). Isolation, cloning, and manipulation of nucleic acids were as described previously for Streptomyces(61.Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom1985Google Scholar) and E. coli(60.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). For constructing the S. lividans DNA library, the chromosomal DNA was totally digested with BamHI, and the DNA fragments were cloned into the BamHI site of pIJ486. S. coelicolor A3(2) J802 total DNA was partially digested with Sau3AI. The resulting fragments were fractionated by centrifugation in a 10-40% sucrose gradient as described(60.Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), and 15-20-kb DNA fragments were pooled and cloned into the BamHI site of λ EMBL4 phage; the recombinant phages were packaged in vitro using the λ EMBL4 system (Stratagene, catalog No. 242201) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The library was probed using a DNA fragment labeled by the polymerase chain reaction (68.Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13471) Google Scholar) with Thermostase (Linus, catalog No. MB014) following the manufacturer's recommendations. For high resolution S1 mapping, the method of Murray (69.Murray G.M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 158: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was used. For actI-ORF1(70.Fernández-Moreno M.A. Martínez E. Boto L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19278-19290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a 798-base pair SphI-SacI fragment (from positions 13.4 to 14.1) containing the actI-ORF1 promoter region uniquely labeled at the 5′-end of the SacI site within the actI-ORF1 coding region was used as probe. For actVI-ORF1(71.Fernández-Moreno M.A. Martínez E. Caballero J.L. Ichinose K. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24854-24863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a 847-base pair KpnI-BssHII fragment (nucleotides 1406-2252) that contained the actVI-ORF1 promoter region labeled at the 5′-end of the BssHII site within the internal actVI-ORF1 coding region was used. For actII-ORF4 (9.Fernández-Moreno M.A. Caballero J.L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. Cell. 1991; 66: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the actII-ORF4 promoter region included in a 635-base pair fragment (nucleotides 4824-5458) was uniquely labeled at the 5′-end of the XhoI site (nucleotide 5458) within the actII-ORF4 coding region and was used as probe. RNA was extracted as described (61.Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H. Genetic Manipulation of Streptomyces: A Laboratory Manual. John Innes Institute, Norwich, United Kingdom1985Google Scholar) from 3-day-old mycelium grown on the surface of cellophane discs on R5 agar plates as described(72.Leskiw B.K. Mah R. Lawlor E.J. Chater K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1995-2005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Actinorhodine and undecylprodigiosin were isolated from 6-day-old S. coelicolor mycelia grown on R5 solid medium over cellophane discs. For the blue pigment extraction, both mycelium and agar medium were separately processed; 10 and 40 ml of water were added to the fragmented agar and the scraped mycelium, respectively. The final pH was then increased to 10 with 1 N NaOH, and diffusion of the blue pigments was allowed for at least 2 h at 4°C. After 20 min of centrifugation at 25,000 × g at 4°C, the absorption of both supernatants was measured at 610 nm. Results are presented as total actinorhodine produced. Undecylprodigiosin was extracted from the scraped mycelium with 10 ml of methanol acidified with 1 N HCl and estimated spectrophotometrically at 530 nm. Blank correction was made using S. coelicolor MAFM0195 for actinorhodine and S. coelicolor CM01 for undecylprodigiosin. Antibiotic valorations are expressed as A units/g of obtained mycelia, wet weight. CDA production was tested as described(73.Hopwood D.A. Wright H.M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 3575-3579PubMed Google Scholar). At least three independent colonies were analyzed, and determinations were repeated twice. Ribosomes from E. coli and S. coelicolor were isolated essentially as describe previously(74.Krohn M. Wagner R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 188-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Either Streptomyces mycelia or E. coli cells (2-5 g, wet weight) were used. The clear ribosomal pellet was slowly resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris acetate, pH 8, 15 mM magnesium acetate, 60 mM potassium acetate, 30 mM NH4 acetate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 4°C. Ribosomal concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically at 260 nm and is expressed as A units/ml. Protein was measured as described (75.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Standard ATP:GTP 5′-pyrophosphotransferase assays were done in a final volume of 50 μl containing 2 mM ATP, 1.3 mM GTP, 10 μCi/ml [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Corp.), and 60 A units of ribosomes/ml in buffer A. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 45 min at 30°C and stopped by the addition of 2 μl of 88% formic acid. After the removal of precipitated protein by centrifugation for 2 min at 9000 × g, 2.5 μl of the resulting supernatants was spotted onto polyethyleneimine cellulose thin-layer plates. Plates were developed as described by Cashel(76.Cashel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3133-3141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and reaction products were identified by autoradiography. The migration position of ppGpp was confirmed by comparison with the authentic compound (generously supplied by K. Ochi) and with the reaction products, pppGpp and ppGpp, of isolated ribosomes from E. coli JM101 either alone or carrying extra copies of the relA gene (pGG21)(27.Metzger S. Dror I.B. Aizenman E. Schreiber G. Toone M. Friesen J.D. Cashel M. Glaser G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15699-15704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For quantification of the reaction products, portions of the plates corresponding to the equivalent migrating position of the (p)ppGpp compounds were cut and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. Corrections were made by subtracting the counts obtained from pppGpp and ppGpp regions following chromatography of a reaction mixture containing only GTP as substrate. The possible synthesis of polyphosphorylated nucleotides by a nucleotide 3′-pyrophosphokinase was tested by incubating the ribosomal fraction with either 1.3 mM [α-32P]GTP (7.6 mCi/mmol) or 2 mM [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 mCi/mmol) alone. S. lividans, a streptomycete closely related to S. coelicolor, has the whole genetic information for actinorhodine biosynthesis; however, this antibiotic is not produced under routine laboratory conditions. By introducing extra copies of the actII-ORF4 gene (or other pleiotropically acting genes) into S. lividans, actinorhodine is synthesized(9.Fernández-Moreno M.A. Caballero J.L. Hopwood D.A. Malpartida F. Cell. 1991; 66: 769-780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 19.Horinouchi S. Kito M. Nishiyama M. Furuya K. Hong S.K. Miyake K. Beppu T.

Since these trans-acting elements will give some understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in antibiotic production, we are interested in their isolation and characterization. Thus, BamHI fragments of S. lividans strain TK21 chromosomal DNA were ligated into the BamHI site of the high copy number plasmid pIJ486. S. lividans TK21 was transformed with the ligation mixture, and recombinant clones were selected for thiostrepton resistance. Among the transformants, a blue colony was isolated, and its phenotype was confirmed by retransformation. The plasmid DNA (named pSCNB079) obtained from this colony revealed a single (unique) 1-kb BamHI insert in the cloning site of the vector. This 1-kb DNA fragment was subcloned in E. coli and sequenced. Computer-assisted analysis of ORFs using the program CODONPREFERENCE showed a continuous ORF; other putative ORFs were discarded as coding regions because their codon usage did not fit the Streptomyces pattern.

In the absence of the CTP linker, the secretion rate was decreased over 3-fold. Unexpectedly, however, receptor binding/signal transduction was unaffected by the absence of the linker. These data show that the single-chain FSH was secreted efficiently and is biologically active and that the conformation determinants required for secretion and biologic activity are not the same.

https://openalex.org/W2028291036,"Previous work on the expression of bovine opsin fragments separated in the cytoplasmic region has allowed the identification of specific polypeptide segments that contain sufficient information to fold independently, insert into a membrane, and assemble to form a functional photoreceptor. To further examine the contributions of these and other polypeptide segments to the mechanism of opsin folding and assembly, we have constructed 20 additional opsin gene fragments where the points of separation occur in the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions. Nineteen of these fragments were stably expressed in COS-1 cells. A five-helix fragment was stably produced only after coexpression with its complementary two-helix fragment. Two fragments composed of the amino-terminal region and the first transmembrane helix were not N-glycosylated and were only partially membrane integrated. One of the singly expressed fragments, which is truncated after the retinal attachment site, bound 11-cis-retinal. Of the coexpressed complementary fragments, only those separated in the second intradiscal and third cytoplasmic regions formed noncovalently linked rhodopsins. Both of these pigments showed reduced transducin activation. Therefore, while many opsin fragments contain enough information to fold and insert into a membrane, only those separated at specific locations assemble to a retinal-binding opsin.

An important function of rhodopsin is to convey information stored in the specific geometry of the chromophore to the surface of the molecule upon light absorption.

Another aspect of rhodopsin conformation that has eluded a detailed understanding is the folding and assembly process. The first clues into the in vivo folding and assembly of bovine opsin came from a series of mutagenesis studies in the intradiscal region(15.Doi T. Molday R.S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4991-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 16.Anukanth A. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19738-19744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Short in-frame deletions and/or amino acid substitutions in all of the intradiscal polypeptide segments resulted in opsins that failed to bind 11-cis-retinal or bound it poorly, showed altered cellular processing, and were wholly or partially retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when expressed in cultured cells. Recently, a number of naturally occurring mutations in the human opsin gene have been discovered in patients afflicted with some forms of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a heterogenous group of inherited retinal diseases whose clinical hallmark is night blindness and, in some cases, progressive degeneration of the retina. Many of these mutations have also been examined after expression of the corresponding human, bovine, or murine opsin genes in cultured cells (17.Sung C.-H. Schneider B. Agarwal N. Papermaster D.S.

Interestingly, many of the mutations that preclude chromophore formation and result in abnormal cellular processing and transport of opsin in cultured cells or cause degeneration of the rod outer segment in the retina reside in the intradiscal and membrane-embedded regions. Thus, the evidence to date strongly supports the notion that polypeptide segments in both the intradiscal and transmembrane regions are intimately involved in the folding and assembly of opsin. In an earlier study(27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), we examined whether expressed complementary bovine opsin fragments separated in the second and third cytoplasmic regions (Fig. 1) contain sufficient information to independently fold, insert into a membrane, and assemble into a functional photoreceptor. The five opsin fragments investigated were stably produced upon expression in COS-1 cells and coexpression of two or three complementary fragments formed noncovalently-linked rhodopsins. These results provided the first evidence that the functional assembly of bovine rhodopsin is mediated by the association of multiple folding domains and demonstrated the utility of defined polypeptide fragments for studying the folding and assembly process. We have now focused on further defining the boundaries of these putative folding domains by identifying additional sites where discontinuity of the opsin polypeptide chain is tolerated. For this purpose, 20 additional opsin gene fragments were constructed. The points of separation in these fragments are located in all three topographical regions of the opsin (Fig. 1) and correspond to intron/exon boundaries (Gly-120/Gly-121, Ser-176/Arg-177, Glu-232/Ala-233, and Gln-312/Phe-313, (3.Nathans J.

The gene fragments were expressed in COS-1 cells singly or in combination and the polypeptide fragments were examined for stable production and for their ability to form a chromophore and activate GT. Coupled with our earlier findings, the present results show that while many opsin fragments with discontinuities in the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic regions fold and insert into a membrane, only those separated at key positions in the intradiscal and cytoplasmic regions assemble to form noncovalently linked rhodopsins. Endoglycosidase H and PNGase F were from New England Biolabs. Immunolon 4 microtiter plates were from Dynatech Laboratories, and the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate was from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. The rho 4D2 and rho 1D4 antibodies, which are specific for amino acid sequences 2-39 and 341-348 of opsin, respectively, have been described previously(32.Molday R.S. McKenzie D.

Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Bovine retinae were from J. A. & W. L. Lawson Co. (Lincoln, NE), and 11-cis-retinal was a gift of R. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina and the National Eye Institute). The sources of other materials used in this investigation have been reported(27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All opsin gene fragments were constructed by restriction fragment replacement of the synthetic bovine opsin gene in the pMT-3 expression vector(35.Ferretti L. Karnik S.S. Khorana H.G. Nassal M.

Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 380B DNA synthesizer and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The AB(1-63), AB(1-68), HC(1-120), DE(1-176), DE(1-186), DE(1-194), EF(1-232), EF(1-248), FG(1-280), and HG(1-312) gene fragments (Table 1) were prepared by replacement of the appropriate restriction fragment with a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex containing a termination codon (TAA) after the last encoded amino acid. The AB(64-348), AB(69-348), HC(121-348), DE(177-348), DE(187-348), DE(195-348), EF(233-348), EF(249-348), FG(281-348), and HG(313-348) gene fragments (Table 2) were constructed by replacing the appropriate restriction fragment with a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex containing a CCACC consensus sequence (37.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 857-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2375) Google Scholar) and a Met codon (ATG) to provide a translation initiation site. The sequences of the gene fragments were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method of DNA sequencing(38.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52055) Google Scholar).Tabled 1Tabled 1 Procedures for the transient transfection of COS-1 cells with the opsin gene and gene fragments have been described previously(27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were harvested 55-72 h after addition of DNA, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.0, and either solubilized with 1% (w/v) DM in PBS, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or incubated with 5 μM 11-cis-retinal for 3 h at 4°C in the dark. The retinal reconstituted proteins were solubilized with 1% DM in PBS, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and purified on immobilized concanavalin A or rho 1D4 antibody as described previously (27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein samples were analyzed by nonreducing SDS/Tris-glycine PAGE (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204702) Google Scholar) with a 5% stacking and a 15 or 16% resolving gel and electroblotted onto poly(vinyldifluoride) membranes(40.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, the proteins were analyzed by nonreducing SDS/Tris-Tricine PAGE (41.Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10377) Google Scholar) with a 4% stacking and a 10 or 12% resolving gel. Immunoreactive protein was detected using the rho 4D2, rho 1D4, or B6-30N primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as the second antibody. The protein bands were visualized by chemiluminescence. Whole cell detergent extracts were incubated with endoglycosidase H or PNGase F (500 units) in 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min at 20°C. The glycosidase treated proteins were analyzed by SDS/Tris-glycine or SDS/Tris-Tricine PAGE and immunoblotting. Whole cell detergent extracts containing wild-type opsin or opsin fragments were serially diluted in detergent extracts obtained from cells transfected with the pMT-3 vector. After drying the samples for 12-16 h at 37°C in microtiter plates, the unbound proteins were washed away with PBS, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and the wells were blocked with 10 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.5% (w/v) gelatin, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3 for 6 h at 20°C. Immunoreactive protein was detected by incubating the samples with the rho 4D2, rho 1D4, or B6-30N primary antibodies in blocking buffer for 16 h at 4°C. After washing away excess primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was added as the second antibody for 1 h at 20°C. Excess peroxidase-conjugated IgG was washed away before adding the 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate. Reactions were monitored using an automated ELISA reader equipped with a 650-nm filter (Dynatech Laboratories). A known amount of photobleached rod outer segment rhodopsin (3.2-400 ng) solubilized in 1% DM was used as the standard for quantitation. The absorbance at 650 nm was linear over this range of protein concentration. Spectral characterization of the opsin fragments and GT activation assays were performed as described previously(27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). COS-1 cell membranes were prepared by hypotonic lysis essentially as described previously(42.Bhattacharya S. Ridge K.D. Knox B.E. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6763-6769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane integration of wild-type opsin or the opsin fragments was determined by incubating the crude membrane preparations with 100 mM Na2CO3, pH 11.0, for 1 h at 4°C(43.Howell K.E. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 822-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Protein determinations were done using the method of Peterson (44.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7045) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Cellular expression of the amino-terminal opsin fragments (Table 1) was examined by immunoblotting of whole cell detergent extracts with the rho 4D2 or B6-30N antibodies. In contrast to wild-type opsin, the AB(1-63) and AB(1-68) fragments were not detected with the rho 4D2 antibody (Fig. 2A). This finding suggested that these opsin fragments had not folded to a conformation that was resistant to cellular proteolysis. However, fragments of the appropriate size (~7-8 kDa) were detected with the B6-30N antibody (Fig. 2B), indicating that the rho 4D2 antibody was unable to recognize these particular fragments. Expression of the EF(1-248) fragment showed the presence of two distinct species of ~30 and 27 kDa, which were detected with the rho 4D2 antibody (Fig. 2A). Both the HC(1-120) and DE(1-176) opsin fragments showed three distinct polypeptides (Fig. 2C), while expression of the EF(1-232) opsin fragment resulted in two faint polypeptides that were observed sporadically (Fig. 2C). However, coexpression of this opsin fragment with its complementary partner, EF(233-348), resulted in stable and reproducible production (Fig. 2D). Similar to the EF(1-248) polypeptide, expression of the DE(1-186), DE(1-194), FG(1-280), and HG(1-312) fragments also showed two prominent polypeptides (Fig. 2, C and E). The levels of amino-terminal opsin fragment production relative to wild-type opsin were estimated from ELISA assays. All of the opsin fragments showed a lower amount of polypeptide(s) when compared with wild-type opsin (Table 1). Treatment of the HC(1-120), DE(1-176), DE(1-186), DE(1-194), EF(1-232), EF(1-248), FG(1-280), and HG(1-312) fragments with endoglycosidase H all resulted in a single faster migrating polypeptide (Fig. 2F). As previously noted for the CH(1-146) and TH(1-240) opsin fragments(27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), these results indicate high mannose N-glycosylation at Asn-2, Asn-15, or both. However, neither the AB(1-63) or AB(1-68) fragments showed a shift in migration after similar treatment (Fig. 2G), suggesting that they lacked high mannose N-glycosylation. Similarly, incubating these fragments with PNGase F, which cleaves both high mannose and complex N-linked oligosaccharides, also caused no shift in migration (data not shown). To determine whether these fragments had inserted into a membrane, cells transfected with the AB(1-63) and AB(1-68) genes were subjected to hypotonic lysis, and the crude membranes were extracted with 100 mM Na2CO3, pH 11.0, prior to detergent solubilization. Like wild-type opsin, neither of these fragments was found in the cell cytosol (Fig. 2H, lanes 1, 4, and 7). However, both fragments were partially extracted with alkali (Fig. 2H, lanes 5 and 8), indicating that a portion of the fragments had not integrated into a membrane. The remainder of the fragments, as well as wild-type opsin, were extracted from membranes with DM detergent (Fig. 2H, lanes 3, 6, and 9). Cellular expression of the carboxyl-terminal opsin fragments (Table 2) was examined by immunoblotting of whole cell detergent extracts with the rho 1D4 antibody (Fig. 2I). The AB(64-348), AB(69-348), and EF(249-348) fragments each showed one prominent band of ~30, 29, and 17-18 kDa, respectively. Although a single prominent band of the appropriate size was noted for the HC(121-348), DE(177-348), and EF(233-348) fragments, numerous higher molecular weight species, presumably aggregates, were also present. The HG(313-348) opsin fragment was also stably produced to yield a single species. However, on this and other immunoblots, the HG(313-348) fragment migrated between the ~6.4- and 16.5-kDa markers, which is considerably higher than its expected molecular weight (~4 kDa). ( 2Recent results indicate that the singly expressed HG(313-348) fragment is palmitoylated, a finding that most probably accounts for its anomalous migration on SDS-PAGE (K. D. Ridge, N. G. Abdulaev, and S. S. J. Lee, unpublished work).) Both the DE(187-348) and DE(195-348) fragments each showed a prominent band ~19-20 kDa and numerous aggregated products. In contrast, the FG(281-348) opsin fragment showed only a faint single polypeptide of ~9-10 kDa. ELISA assays showed that with the exception of the FG(281-348) and HG(313-348) fragments, the carboxyl-terminal fragments were present at equivalent or higher levels than wild-type opsin (Table 2). Whether this difference reflects a higher level of expression or greater stability of many of the carboxyl-terminal opsin fragments or is due to more efficient recognition by the rho 1D4 antibody remains to be determined. Of the amino- and carboxyl-terminal opsin fragments, only the HG(1-312) fragment (Fig. 3) formed a chromophore with 11-cis-retinal. This result was not unexpected since the HG(1-312) polypeptide chain is terminated after the retinal attachment site (Lys-296) in helix G (Fig. 1). However, in contrast to the wild-type protein purified under the same conditions (Fig. 3), the HG(1-312) pigment showed a shorter wavelength species (λmax ~360 nm) in addition to the 500-nm chromophore. A portion of the 360-nm species appeared to be covalently linked as acidification of the pigment resulted in the formation of a higher absorbing peak (λmax ~420 nm). Similar treatment of wild-type rhodopsin produced only the 440-nm protonated retinyl-Schiff base (Fig. 3). Based on the absorbance at 500 nm and assuming a similar chromophore extinction (40,600 M-1•cm-1), the yield of the HG(1-312) pigment was ~25-33% of wild-type rhodopsin. Of the 10 complementary fragment combinations examined, only the DE(1-194) + DE(195-348) and EF(1-248) + EF(249-348) fragments formed rhodopsin-like pigments, which were amenable to affinity purification on immobilized rho 1D4 (Fig. 4). These rhodopsins appear to have folded and assembled to a correct ground-state structure as shown by their 500 nm λmax, similar chromophore bandwidth, and molar absorption coefficient (40,200-40,700 M-1•cm-1). Furthermore, these rhodopsins, like the wild-type pigment, showed little reactivity toward hydroxylamine in the dark over a 6-h period (data not shown). They also showed the characteristic shift in λmax to 380 nm upon illumination and formed the 440-nm protonated retinyl-Schiff base after acidification (Fig. 4). The yield of the DE(1-194) + DE(195-348) rhodopsin relative to wild-type rhodopsin was only 10-12%, while that for the EF(1-248) + EF(249-348) pigment was ~60-70%. Notably, coexpression of the HG(1-312) and HG(313-348) fragments did not allow the formation of a complex that could be purified on immobilized rho 1D4. Furthermore, coexpression had no effect on the amount of chromophore obtained after purification of the HG(1-312) fragment on immobilized concanavalin A (data not shown). The disposition of the polypeptide fragments in the DE(1-194) + DE(195-348) and EF(1-248) + EF(249-348) rhodopsins were examined by immunoblotting with the rho 4D2 and rho 1D4 antibodies. Like the previously described CH(1-146) + CH(147-348) and TH(1-240) + TH(241-348) rhodopsins (27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), both the DE(1-194) + DE(195-348) and EF(1-248) + EF(249-348) rhodopsins showed two opsin polypeptide fragments in which the amino-terminal fragment now migrated as an elongated band with a sharp leading edge and a trailing smear (Fig. 5). This results from further processing to the complex carbohydrate form(12.Kaushal S. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1994; 91: 4024-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To test whether the DE(1-194) + DE(195-348) and EF(1-248) + EF(249-348) rhodopsins activated GT, in vitro GTPγS binding assays were performed. While the DE(1-194) + DE(195-348) rhodopsin catalyzed light-dependent GTPγS binding by GT to about 45% of the level of wild-type rhodopsin, the EF(1-248) + EF(249-348) rhodopsin showed only 12% the level of activity after a 1-min reaction (Fig. 6). Patients afflicted with RP are often heterozygous for the mutant allele, i.e. they have one copy of the mutant gene and one copy of the wild-type gene. Since the Gln-64 → Stop mutation is associated with autosomal dominant RP, we attempted to mimic the in vivo genotype by examining the effects, if any, of AB(1-63) fragment expression on the folding and assembly of wild-type opsin. For this purpose, COS-1 cells were cotransfected with both the wild-type and AB(1-63) opsin genes. Since the AB(1-63) fragment is not recognized by the rho 1D4 antibody, the effect of this opsin fragment on wild-type folding and assembly could be discerned after purification on immobilzed rho 1D4. Both wild-type opsin and the AB(1-63) fragment were stably expressed in the cotransfected cells (Fig. 7A, lane 2). After addition of 11-cis-retinal and affinity purification, wild-type opsin expressed in the presence of the AB(1-63) fragment showed virtually the same amount of protein and 500 nm chromophore as the singly expressed wild-type (Fig. 7B). As expected, immunoblot analysis showed only the wild-type protein in the antibody column eluate (Fig. 7A, lane 3). Previously, we showed that coexpression of two or three complementary bovine opsin fragments separated in the second and third cytoplasmic regions allowed the formation of rhodopsins with spectral characteristics similar to the native pigment(27.Ridge K.D. Lee S.S.J. Yao L.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3204-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As indicated above, these results provided the first evidence that the functional assembly of rhodopsin is mediated by the association of multiple folding domains. In the present study, we focused on further defining the boundaries of these putative domains by identifying additional sites where discontinuity of the opsin polypeptide chain is tolerated. For this purpose, 20 additional opsin gene fragments were constructed (Table 1 and Table 2), where the points of separation occur in all three topographical regions of opsin. Although the AB(1-63) and AB(1-68) fragments appear to be stably expressed as judged by immunoblot analysis with the B6-30N antibody (Fig. 2A), they both lack high man"

Haemostasis 74, 743-750). We present here the entire 142- and 123-residue amino acid sequences of the respective α and β subunits and also demonstrate that the platelet GPIb-binding site resides on the β and not on the α subunit based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using biotin-labeled jararaca GPIb-BP and competing ligands. Sequences of the α and β subunits were determined by analysis of the intact S-pyridylethylated proteins and their peptides generated by digestion with Achromobacter protease I, Staphyloccocus aureus V8 protease, pepsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, or L-1-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin. A 38-39% identity of amino acid sequence between the α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP was observed, as well as a high degree of sequence identities (38-64%) with the respective subunits of botrocetin (Usami, Y., Fujimura, Y., Suzuki, M., Ozeki, Y., Nishio, K., Fukui, H., and Titani, K(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 928-932) and the β-chain of echicetin (Peng, M., Holt, J. C., and Niewiarowski, S.(1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 205, 68-72). Jararaca GPIb-BP, a snake venom protein composed of α and β subunits purified from Bothrops jararaca, binds to platelet glycoprotein (GP)Ib and functions as a receptor blocker for von Willebrand factor binding to GPIb (Fujimura, Y., Ikeda, Y., Miura, S., Yoshida, E., Shima, H., Nishida, S., Suzuki, M., Titani, K., Taniuchi, Y., and Kawasaki, T.(1995) Thromb. Haemostasis 74, 743-750). We present here the entire 142- and 123-residue amino acid sequences of the respective α and β subunits and also demonstrate that the platelet GPIb-binding site resides on the β and not on the α subunit based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using biotin-labeled jararaca GPIb-BP and competing ligands. Sequences of the α and β subunits were determined by analysis of the intact S-pyridylethylated proteins and their peptides generated by digestion with Achromobacter protease I, Staphyloccocus aureus V8 protease, pepsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, or L-1-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin. A 38-39% identity of amino acid sequence between the α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP was observed, as well as a high degree of sequence identities (38-64%) with the respective subunits of botrocetin (Usami, Y., Fujimura, Y., Suzuki, M., Ozeki, Y., Nishio, K., Fukui, H., and Titani, K(1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 90, 928-932) and the β-chain of echicetin (Peng, M., Holt, J. C., and Niewiarowski, S.(1994) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 205, 68-72). The first step in primary hemostasis is thought to be platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at the site of vascular injury. This process appears to involve the initial binding of plasma vWF 1The abbreviations used are: vWFvon Willebrand factorAPIAchromobacter protease IELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGPglycoproteinISMSion-spray mass spectrometryMALD/TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption/time of flightPEpyridylethylRP-HPLCreversed-phase high performance liquid chromatographyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTPCKL-1-tosylamino-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketoneV8Staphylococcus aureus V8. to subendothelial tissue, followed by vWF binding to platelet GPIb(1.Sakariassen K.S.

To date, purification and characterization of several GPIb-binding snake venom proteins have been reported, including alboaggregin-B from Trimeresurus albolabris(2.Peng M. Lu W. Kirby E.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11529-11536Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), echicetin from Echis carinatus(3.Peng M. Lu W. Beviglia L. Niewiarowski S. Kirby E.P. Blood. 1993; 81: 2321-2328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and agkicetin from Agkistrodon acutus(4.Chen Y-L. Tsai I-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These proteins bind to GPIb and function as receptor blockers of vWF binding. More recently, Peng et al. (5.Peng M. Holt J.C. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the reduced and S-alkylated β subunit of echicetin retains its inhibitory activity on vWF binding to GPIb, although with less potency than that of the intact protein, and reported the amino acid sequence of the β subunit. However, the structural features and entire amino acid sequence of GPIb-binding snake venom proteins have not yet been reported. Recently, we purified the GPIb-binding snake venom proteins jararaca GPIb-BP(6.Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Miura S. Yoshida E. Shima H. Nishida S. Suzuki M. Titani K. Taniuchi Y. Kawasaki T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), flavocetin-A and -B(7.Taniuchi Y. Kawasaki T. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Titani K. Sakai Y. Kaku S. Hisamichi N. Sato N. Takenaka T. Handa M. Sawai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and tokaracetin (8.Kawasaki T. Taniuchi Y. Hisamichi N. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Titani K. Sakai Y. Kaku S. Sato N. Takenaka T. Handa M. Sawai Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) from the venom of Bothrops jararaca, Trimeresurus flavoviridis, and Trimeresurus tokarensis, respectively. The characteristic features of these proteins, in particular their inhibitory effect on vWF binding to GPIb and on vWF-dependent platelet aggregation, appear to be closely similar to those of echicetin. However, which subunit of these proteins binds platelet GPIb remained unknown. In the present study, as a first step in elucidating the structure-function relationships of these GPIb-binding proteins, we determined the complete amino acid sequences of both the α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that the GPIb-binding site of jararaca GPIb-BP resides on its β and not its α subunit. This is the first report of the primary structure of a snake venom GPIb-binding protein. All reagents used were of analytical grade. Jararaca GPIb-BP (Japanese patent name “Yoshitobin”) was purified from the crude venom of B. jararaca (Sigma) as described recently(6.Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Miura S. Yoshida E. Shima H. Nishida S. Suzuki M. Titani K. Taniuchi Y. Kawasaki T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). API was the generous gift of Dr. T. Masaki(9.Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), Ibaraki University, Ibaraki, Japan. V8 protease, pepsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, and TPCK-trypsin were obtained from Miles Laboratories (Naperville, IL), Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan), Boehringer Mannheim, and Cooper Biochemical (Malvern, PA), respectively. Extracti-Gel D detergent-removing gel, NHS-LC-biotin, and micro BCA protein assay kit were products of Pierce. Jararaca GPIb-BP (1.4 mg) was reduced with 20 μl of tri-n-butyl phosphine (81 mM) (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) (10.Ruegg U.T. Rudinger J. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and S-pyridylethylated with 10 μl of 4-vinylpyridine (94 mM) (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) (11.Hermodson M.A. Ericsson L.H. Neurath H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 3136-3153Crossref Scopus (216) Google Scholar) in 1 ml of 0.3 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.3) in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride at room temperature for 3 h. The S-PE α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP were separated by RP-HPLC on a SynChropak RP-8 column (4.1 × 250 mm; Synchrom, Lafayette, IN) with a gradient of acetonitrile into 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid(12.Mahoney W.C. Hermodson H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11199-11203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S-PE α and β subunits were each digested at 37°C with API in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) in the presence of 2 M urea (enzyme to substrate ratio 1:300 by weight), with V8 protease in 0.1 M ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.0) in the presence of 2 M urea (enzyme to substrate ratio 1:100 by weight), and with pepsin in 0.5% HCOOH (pH 2.0) (enzyme to substrate ratio 1:100 by weight). The S-PE β subunit was also digested at 37°C with endoproteinase Asp-N in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence of 2 M urea (enzyme to substrate ratio 1:150 by weight) and at 37°C with TPCK-trypsin in 0.1 M NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 8.0) in the presence of 2 M urea (enzyme to substrate ratio 1:100 by weight). Each digest was separated by RP-HPLC on a SynChropak RP-8, RP-18 column or Cosmosil 5C8-300 column (4.6 × 100 mm, Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) with a gradient of acetonitrile into 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. The S-PE subunits were each hydrolyzed in 6 M HCl containing 1% phenol at 110°C for 24 h by the vapor-phase method and analyzed on a Hitachi Model L8500 amino acid analyzer. Smaller peptides obtained by enzymatic cleavage were analyzed by the 4-(dimethylamino)azobenzenesulfonyl chloride method (13.Knecht R. Chang J.Y. Anal. Chem. 1986; 58: 2375-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) after a 24-h acid hydrolysis. Sequence determination was performed with an Applied Biosystems Model 470A protein sequencer connected on-line to a Model 120A PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA)(14.Hewick R.M. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Dreyer W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7990-7997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ISMS analysis was performed with a PE-Sciex API-III bimolecular mass analyzer (triple-stage quadrupole mass spectrometer) equipped with a standard atmospheric pressure ion source (PE-Sciex, Ontario, Canada)(15.Bruins A.P. Covey T.R. Hanion J.D. Anal. Chem. 1987; 59: 2642-2646Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Approximately 10-50 pmol of peptides were dissolved in an appropriate volume of 33% isopropyl alcohol containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and injected into the spectrometer for positive-mode analysis. Subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP (300 μg) were first electrophoretically separated on a slab gel (Protean II, Bio-Rad) by SDS-15% PAGE under reducing conditions(16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the subunit bands were visualized by soaking the gel in 4 M NaOAc at room temperature for 60 min according to the method of Higgins and Dahmus(17.Higgins R.C. Dahmus M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 93: 257-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The visualized α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP were cut into small pieces and subjected to electroelution by the method of Hunkapiller and Hood(18.Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 486-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). After electroelution, SDS was removed from the SDS-protein complexes by passage through Extracti-Gel D gel (2 ml) equilibrated with 0.1 M NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8). Purified jararaca GPIb-BP (500 μg) was dialyzed against 0.1 M NaHCO3 at 4°C overnight. An equal amount (w/w) of NHS-LC-biotin dissolved in 200 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the dialyzed sample. The mixture was then incubated at room temperature for 4 h in the dark, followed by extensive dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.3) at 4°C. Biotinylated jararaca GPIb-BP had similar biological activity in inhibiting vWF binding to GPIb as the unlabeled counterpart (data not shown). Biotinylated jararaca GPIb-BP was stored in aliquots at −80°C until use. Preparation of washed normal platelets and immobilization of the platelets onto microtiter wells (Nunc, Denmark) via a polyclonal anti-platelet antibody (IgG) were recently described in detail(19.Yoshida E. Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Takeda I. Yamamoto Y. Nishikawa K. Miyataka K. Oonuki M. Kawasaki T. Katayama M. Narita N. Br. J. Haematol. 1995; 89: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); instead of the polyclonal antibody for immobilization, however, we used anti-GPIIb/IIIa monoclonal antibody VNR-5 (IgG, 10 μg/ml), kindly provided by Dr. M. Katayama at Takara Shuzo Co. (Shiga, Japan). The amount of biotin-labeled jararaca GPIb-BP bound to the immobilized platelets was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptoavidin (Dakopatts, Denmark) and O-phenylenediamine as a substrate and spectrometry at 492 nm. Preliminary experiments clearly indicated that biotin-labeled jararaca GPIb-BP specifically binds to platelet-immobilized wells in a saturable manner with a Bmax of 2.5 μg/ml but does not bind to platelet-uncoated wells (data not shown). For competitive inhibition assay, a mixture (125 μl) of biotinylated jararaca GPIb-BP (1 μg/ml, final) and various concentrations of competing ligands was incubated for 15 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of 50 μl of the mixture to the wells. After 2 h incubation at room temperature, ELISA was performed as described above. Nonspecific and total binding were measured in the presence of a 50-fold excess of unlabeled jararaca GPIb-BP and without any specific inhibitor, respectively, and specific binding was obtained by subtraction of nonspecific binding from the total. Reduced and S-pyridylethylated α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP (∼6 nmol) were separated by RP-HPLC on a SynChropak RP-8 column as shown in Fig. 1. The major peak was divided into four fractions. On the basis of amino-terminal sequence analysis, peaks 1-3 were identified as the PE-α subunit and peak 4 as the PE-β subunit. Peaks 1-3 fractions were combined for further study. The amino acid composition of the PE-α and -β subunits determined by amino acid analysis and that calculated from the sequence are presented in Table 1. Both these subunits have 7 half-cystine residues/mol (Table 1).TABLE 1TABLE 1 Sequence analysis of the intact α subunit (Intact Protein in Fig. 3) separated by SDS-PAGE of the purified protein under reducing conditions and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane yielded an amino-terminal sequence of 29 residues, with tentative identification of Trp at residue 10 and ambiguous identification at residues 6, 17, 26, and 27. Sequence analysis of the PE-α subunit isolated yielded an amino-terminal sequence of 25 residues, with tentative identification of His at residue 13, Lys at residue 19, Gln at residue 22, and Glu at residue 25, and ambiguous identification at residue 24. The combination of these results established the amino-terminal sequence of the α subunit through Glu25 and placed Asp-Asp at residues 28 and 29. An API digest of the PE-α subunit was separated by RP-HPLC as shown in Fig. 2. The peptides were designated with a prefix K as K1 through K15 according to their order in the final amino acid sequence. Six of 11 major peptides thus isolated were subjected to ISMS analysis (Table 2) and sequence determination with a protein sequencer (Fig. 3), although peptide K15 did not provide an appreciable signal by ISMS analysis. Peptide K3 extended the amino-terminal sequence obtained with the intact α subunit to Lys-44. Among peptic peptides of the PE-α subunit, separated by RP-HPLC (data not shown) and designated with a prefix P, peptide P25 was found to extend the sequence of peptide K4 and overlapped peptides K9, K10 (free Lys), and K11. The overlap of peptides K9, K10, and K11 was established by analysis of peptide D15 isolated from an Asp-N endoproteinase digest of the PE-α subunit and designated with a prefix D (data not shown). Among V8 peptides of the PE-α subunit with a prefix E (data not shown), peptide E21 extended the sequence of peptides K11 and K12 (free Lys) and overlapped the sequence of peptide K14. Finally, peptide E22 extended the sequence of peptide K14 to the carboxyl terminus of the subunit. The carboxyl-terminal residue of peptide E22 was not unambiguously identified by sequence analysis, but ISMS analysis indicated the presence of Arg in addition to the sequence obtained.TABLE 2TABLE 2Figure 3:Summary of the sequence proof of jararaca GPIb-BP. The proven sequences of specific peptides (underlined) are given in the one-letter code below the summary sequence (bold type). The prefixes K, E, P, D, and T denote peptides generated by cleavage of PE-α and PE-β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP with API, V8 protease, pepsin, endoproteinase Asp-N, and TPCK-trypsin, respectively. Products of API digest are numbered from the amino terminus to the carboxyl terminus of the protein. Sequences written in uppercase letters were proven by Edman degradation; sequences in lowercase letters indicate tentative identifications. Unidentified residues are shown by a × or dashes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Thus, the amino-terminal sequence of residues 1-44 and the carboxyl-terminal sequence of residues 45-142 were unambiguously determined by direct sequencing of the intact subunit and peptides derived from several digests of the PE-α subunit. However, although direct evidence for the overlap of these two sequences, namely that of peptides K3 and K4, was not obtained by analysis of any peptide, ISMS analysis showed an MH+ value of 17,458 ± 3.7 for the PE-α subunit, which coincides within experimental error with the value calculated from the sequence of residues 1-142, indicating no amino acid residue between residues 44 and 45. ISMS showed at least two MH+ signals by analysis of the intact PE-β subunit, indicating some microheterogeneities in the amino acid sequence. Sequence analysis of the intact β subunit (Intact Protein in Fig. 3) separated by SDS-PAGE of the purified protein under reducing conditions and electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane yielded an amino-terminal sequence of 22 residues with tentative identification of Trp at residue 6 and ambiguous identification at residues 2 and 13. Sequence analysis of the purified intact PE-β subunit (intact PE-protein in Fig. 4) yielded an amino-terminal sequence of 33 residues with tentative identification of Trp at residue 23 and Gln at residue 33 and ambiguous identification at residue 30. An API digest of the PE-β subunit was separated by RP-HPLC in a similar manner to that in Fig. 3(data not shown). The peptides were designated with a prefix K as K1 through K6 according to their order in the final amino acid sequence, and all were subjected to ISMS analysis (Table 2) and sequence determination with a protein sequencer (Fig. 3). The sequences of all K peptides were completely determined until the carboxyl terminus except for peptide K4, and their calculated molecular masses showed good agreement with those observed by ISMS analysis (Table 2). The sequence of peptide K6 showed some microheterogeneities at residues 115 (Gln/Glu) and 117 (Phe/Val), which were also identified with tryptic peptides T10 and T11, and agreed with the results by ISMS analysis (Table 2). In addition, the sequence of peptide K4 [2] derived from an API digest of the protein isolated from another batch of the snake venom showed Ser at residue 53 in place of Leu identified with peptide K4. The sequence of peptide K3 extended the amino-terminal sequence obtained with the intact protein to Lys35. The overlaps of peptides K3-K6 were obtained by analysis of some of either the peptic (designated with a prefix P) or V8 protease (designated with a prefix E) peptides. There were some problems in analysis of the carboxyl-terminal region of peptide K4. Sequencer analysis of peptides K4 and K4 [2] provided a partial sequence of residues 36-60 but became ambiguous after residue 61. Analysis of two peptic peptides P40 and P43, particularly of the former, extended the sequence of peptide K4 but still with tentative identification of Asn at residue 73 and Glu at residue 78 and ambiguous identification at residues 65 and 72. Residues 65 and 72 were both assumed to be Trp by sequence homology to other snake venom proteins of the same family (Fig. 4). The molecular masses calculated on this assumption showed good agreement with MH+ values of the intact PE-β subunit and peptide K4 as observed by either ISMS or MALD/TOF mass spectrometry, respectively (Table 2). These mass spectrometric analyses also indicated the absence of an amino acid residue between Glu78 and Trp79, which agreed with isolation of peptide E5 in terms of substrate specificity of V8 protease. However, Asn73 should still be regarded as a tentative identification. The amino acid sequence of jararaca GPIb-BP was compared with known sequences of botrocetin (20.Usami Y. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Ozeki Y. Nishio K. Fukui H. Titani K Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 928-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and the β subunit of echicetin(5.Peng M. Holt J.C. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Some polymorphisms occur in the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP, but the sequence of K4 is arranged for the calculation of identity. A high degree of homology (38-39% identity) was found between the α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP. Furthermore, sequence identities between the α subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP, the α and β subunits of botrocetin, and the β subunit of echicetin were 64, 39, and 38%, respectively. Identities between the β subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP, the α and β subunits of botrocetin, and the β subunit of echicetin were 40-41, 55-57, and 52-54%, respectively. The S-PE or reduced and S-carboxymethylated subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP lost their solubility in neutral buffer but were soluble in 4-6 M urea or buffer containing an organic solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide or acetonitrile(6.Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Miura S. Yoshida E. Shima H. Nishida S. Suzuki M. Titani K. Taniuchi Y. Kawasaki T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, only the reduced α and β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP without S-alkylation, isolated by electroelution followed by SDS removal by Extracti-Gel D chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”), retained their solubility in neutral buffer. The latter subunits retained their original molecular mass as judged by SDS-15% PAGE under reducing conditions (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 5, on competitive binding inhibition assay based on an ELISA using biotin-labeled jararaca GPIb-BP and platelet-immobilized microtiter wells, only the reduced β subunit inhibited binding. This inhibition was dose-dependent, with an IC50 of 0.6 μM and almost total inhibition at 5-10 μM. In contrast, the reduced α subunit showed no appreciable inhibition at 10 μM. We determined the complete amino acid sequence of jararaca GPIb-BP isolated from the venom of Bothrops jararaca. Jararaca GPIb-BP consists of two subunits, designated the α and β subunits. The α subunit consists of 142 amino acid residues, and the β subunit consists of 123 amino acid residues. Calculated Mr values of the α and β subunits (17,456.8 and 15,035.0/14,987.9, respectively) were in good agreement with their apparent Mr values estimated by SDS-PAGE (6.Fujimura Y. Ikeda Y. Miura S. Yoshida E. Shima H. Nishida S. Suzuki M. Titani K. Taniuchi Y. Kawasaki T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 743-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and coincide with their MH+ values observed by ISMS. In the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP, substitutions, at least at the residues of Leu53, Gln115, and Phe117, were observed in the same or other batches, suggesting the presence of polymorphism. When the sequences of jararaca GPIb-BP and the other proteins are aligned as shown in Fig. 4, considerable homology is seen (38-64% identity) between jararaca GPIb-BP and both botrocetin and echicetin. The identity of the amino acid sequence between the β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP and echicetin was 52-54%, whereas the identity between the α subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP and the β subunit of echicetin was 38%. As indicated in Fig. 5, the platelet GPIb-binding site resides on the β and not on the α subunit. Peng et al.(5.Peng M. Holt J.C. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that the biological activity of echicetin also resides in the β subunit. It is interesting that the identity of the amino acid sequence between the β subunits of jararaca GPIb-BP and echicetin was much higher than that between the α subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP and the β subunit of echicetin. However, the β subunit of echicetin retains its activity even after reduction and S-alkylation(5.Peng M. Holt J.C. Niewiarowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the β subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP loses its activity on S-alkylation for unknown reasons. Botrocetin, isolated from the venom of B. jararaca, is also a heterodimeric protein that has almost the same Mr as jararaca GPIb-BP (20.Usami Y. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Ozeki Y. Nishio K. Fukui H. Titani K Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 928-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) but that binds to vWF and not GPIb(21.Fujimura Y. Titani K. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Oyama R. Matsui T. Fukui H. Sugimoto M. Ruggeri Z.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ozeki et al. (22.Ozeki Y. Matsui T. Hamako J. Suzuki M. Fujimura Y. Yoshida E. Nishida S. Titani K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 308: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in our laboratory isolated a galactoside-binding lectin from the same venom whose structure is similar to GPIb-BP and botrocetin but that is clearly a homodimeric sugar-binding protein. It is now clear that B. jararaca snake venom contains several proteins with homologous structures but with clearly distinct binding characteristics. The amino-terminal sequences of alboaggregin-B(23.Yoshida E. Fujimura Y. Miura S. Sugimoto M. Fukui H. Narita N. Usami Y. Suzuki M. Titani K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 1386-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), flavocetin-A and -B(7.Taniuchi Y. Kawasaki T. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Titani K. Sakai Y. Kaku S. Hisamichi N. Sato N. Takenaka T. Handa M. Sawai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), tokaracetin(8.Kawasaki T. Taniuchi Y. Hisamichi N. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Titani K. Sakai Y. Kaku S. Sato N. Takenaka T. Handa M. Sawai Y. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 947-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and agkicetin (4.Chen Y-L. Tsai I-H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) are highly homologous; the primary structure of jararaca GPIb-BP may reveal a structure typical of these GPIb-binding proteins. In regard to the location of inter- and intra-chain disulfide bridges, the α and β subunits contain 7 half-cystines each (Fig. 3). The number of half-cystine residues and their positions in the sequence of jararaca GPIb-BP are almost identical with those in the α and β subunits of botrocetin and with the β subunit of echicetin, indicating that the disulfide bond pairings should be similar in these proteins. Thus, from the known disulfide pairings of botrocetin(20.Usami Y. Fujimura Y. Suzuki M. Ozeki Y. Nishio K. Fukui H. Titani K Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 928-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), those of jararaca GPIb-BP may occur as follows: α, 6-17, 39-136, and 111-128; β, 2-13, 30-119, 96-111. It is also likely that one interchain disulfide bond is formed between Cys88 of the α subunit and Cys75 of the β subunit. Although the present results provide information about the specific structural elements associated with the GPIb-binding ability of jararaca GPIb-BP, further studies on the structure-function relationship of the β subunit of jararaca GPIb-BP should help clarify the pathophysiological functions of platelet adhesion to exposed subendothelium at the site of vascular injury and may help in the discovery of a lead molecule for a low molecular GPIb antagonist.

The activation of gene transcription by hormones that function through protein-tyrosine kinase receptors is not well understood in comparison with that mediated by other classes of hormones. The receptors for the steroid-thyroid hormones are transcription factors that are activated by hormone binding(1.Umesono K. Evans R.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1139-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Gs protein-coupled receptors activate gene transcription following hormonal initiation of a cascade ending in the phosphorylation of CREB/ATF transcription factors(2.Montminy M. Sevarino K. Wagner J. Mandel G. Goodman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6682-6686Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Recently, numerous cytokines have been shown to activate transcription via phosphorylation of cytosolic ISGF-3 proteins that then become nuclear localized transcription factors(3.Sadowski H. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J. Gilman M. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The responsiveness of genes to each of these classes of hormones is dependent on the presence in the gene of the appropriate DNA sequence to which the activated transcription factor binds. Neither the hormone-responsive DNA element nor the transcription factors activated by protein-tyrosine kinase receptors are known. Recently, we have identified an insulin-response element in the prolactin promoter that is identical to the binding site for the Ets-related transcription factors(4.Jacob K. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This element also mediates the insulin sensitivity of the thymidine kinase and somatostatin promoters in both HeLa and GH4 cells and confers insulin responsiveness to the mammary tumor virus promoter when it is added to that promoter at −88. Further, the increase in the transcription of these genes in insulin-treated cells was inhibited by expression of a dominant-negative Ets protein(5.Jacob K. Ouyang L. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These studies identify the predominant Ets-related protein of GH4 cells, GABPα, and suggest that GABP mediates insulin-increased prolactin gene expression.

The construction of pPrl-CAT plasmids containing −173/+75 of prolactin 5′-flanking DNA was described(6.Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13444-13448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The human insulin expression vector, pRT3HIR2, was the gift of Dr. J. Whittaker (Stony Brook, NY). The plasmids CMV-GABPα and CMV-GABPβ were provided by Dr. C. Thompson (Carnegie Institute, Baltimore, MD). The Elk-1 and SRF expression vectors were the gift of Dr. R. Treisman. The GST-GABPα expression plasmid was constructed by ligating a blunt-ended BamHI/XhoI fragment from the GABPα cDNA (plasmid F27, Dr. S. L. McKnight) into the blunt-ended EcoRI site of pGEX 2T (Pharmacia). The fusion protein consists of the GST protein (26 kDa) and GABPα-(76-336) (30 kDa) that contains the three potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites. GH4 cells were harvested after 48 h with or without 1 μg/ml insulin, and nuclei were prepared as described(7.Stanley F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A nuclear extract was prepared by disrupting the nuclei with 400 mM KCl in a buffer containing 15% glycerol, 25 mM Tris, pH 8, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 12% gels(8.Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205076) Google Scholar). The proteins were then blotted to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separations) in Towbin's buffer (25 mM Trizma base, 192 mM glycine, and 20% methanol). Immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence was performed as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). Electroporation experiments and CAT assays were performed as described(9.Jacob K. Stanley F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). GH4 cells were placed for 24 h in DMEM containing 10% hormone-depleted serum (9.Jacob K. Stanley F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and harvested with an EDTA solution, and 20-40 × 106 cells were used for each electroporation. Trypan blue exclusion before electroporation ranged from 95 to 99%. The voltage of the electroporation was 1550 V. This gives trypan blue exclusion of 70-80% after electroporation. A Rous sarcoma virus-βGal expression plasmid was used to control for differences between electroporations as described(9.Jacob K. Stanley F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1995; 109: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were then plated in multiwell dishes (Falcon Plastics) at 5 × 106 cells/9-cm2 tissue culture well in DMEM with 10% hormone-depleted serum. Cells were refed with DMEM with 10% hormone-depleted serum ± insulin at 24 h. After 48 h, the flasks were washed three times with normal saline and frozen. The cells were harvested in hypotonic lysis buffer using a rubber policeman. CAT activity was assayed as described(10.Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide to the prolactin promoter sequence −106/-87 was prepared, purified on polyacrylamide gels, and end-labeled with [32P]dCTP. The sequence of this oligonucleotide is 5′-TCTTAATGACGGAAATAGAT-3′. Labeled prolactin 5′-flanking DNA was then used in mobility shift experiments with unlabeled nuclear extracts performed as described(7.Stanley F.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1627-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Two μg of nuclear extract were incubated at 25°C for 30 min with 10,000 cpm (10-20 fmol) of 32P-labeled Prl −106/-87. The protein-DNA complexes were then analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/acetate/EDTA buffer. GH4 cells were treated for 5 min with 1 μg/ml insulin or were left untreated as controls. They were then washed and frozen at −70°C. The cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM Na3VO4, 50 mM Na4P2O7, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Immunoprecipitations were performed for 90 min at 4°C in this buffer using 200 μg of protein. Antibody to MAP kinase was obtained from Santa Cruz, and 1 μg was used for each immunoprecipitation. The kinase assay was performed with immunoprecipitated MAP kinase and 0.1 μg of GST protein. The fusion protein consists of the GST protein (26 kDa) and GABPα-(76-336) (30 kDa) that contains the three potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites. The assay was performed in a buffer containing 25 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 μM ATP, and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol(11.Skolnik E. Batzer A. Li N. Lee C.-H. Lowenstein E. Mohammadi M. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Science. 1993; 260: 1953-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The supernatant was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. GH4 cells in 9-cm2 tissue culture wells were incubated for 2 h with phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed, charcoal-treated calf serum. They were then washed and incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed, charcoal-treated calf serum with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]H3PO4. Insulin was then added and the incubation was continued for 1 h. The cells were rapidly chilled, washed 3 times with ice-cold saline, and frozen at −70°C. The cells were then processed and immunoprecipitated as described above. Immunoblot analysis of GH4 cell nuclear extracts was performed to determine which of the Ets-related transcription factors might mediate the effects of insulin on prolactin gene expression (Fig. 1). A pan-Ets antibody was used to visualize Ets-related proteins in GH4 cell nuclear extracts. This antibody was raised against the conserved DNA binding domain of Ets-1, and it demonstrates broad cross-reactivity with Ets family proteins. One band of approximately 51 kDa was visible using either 1 or 3 μg of nuclear extract. This is the same size as the previously identified Ets-related protein GABPα. GABPα is a subunit of the heteromeric transcription factor, GABP. The other subunit is GABPβ, a notch-related protein(12.Thompson C. Brown T. McKnight S. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). GABP was originally identified as the transcription factor that binds to a purine-rich cis-regulatory element required for VP16-mediated activation of herpes simplex virus immediate early gene (13.Triesenberg S. LaMarco K. McKnight S. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 720-742Google Scholar). A separate set of filters was therefore analyzed using antibodies against GABPα or GABPβ1. One band, identical in size to that seen using the pan-Ets antibody, is seen with anti-GABPα. Anti-GABPβ1 antibody reveals two bands. The lower, more intense band migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa and thus likely represents GABPβ1. The levels of GABPα and GABPβ1 are not significantly different in nuclear extracts from control and insulin-treated cells (data not shown). Experiments were performed to determine if GABP might be involved in the response of the prolactin gene to insulin. Cotransfection of small amounts of GABPα expression vector inhibited the insulin-induced increase in prolactin gene expression (Fig. 2) to 25% of that seen in control transfections (22-fold) or in transfections with expression vector (21-fold). Cotransfection with an expression vector for GABPβ1 resulted in a 2-fold increase in the insulin-stimulated prolactin-CAT expression (45-fold). This suggests that levels of GABPβ1 may be limiting in GH cells. GABPβ1 was shown to increase the affinity of GABPα binding to DNA(12.Thompson C. Brown T. McKnight S. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus, it might be expected that a cotransfection with both GABPα and GABPβ1 would further affect insulin-increased prolactin-CAT expression. Coexpression of vectors for both GABPα with GABPβ1 completely eliminated any effect of insulin (Fig. 2) but has no significant effect on basal or EGF-increased prolactin gene expression. Basal expression of prolactin-CAT was not affected in these experiments (1.15 ± 0.25% acetylation/10 μg of protein in control cultures versus 1.07 ± 0.44% acetylation/10 μg of protein in GABPα+ GABPβ-cotransfected cells). Further, EGF-increased expression of prolactin-CAT was also not affected by cotransfection with GABP. EGF results in a 13-fold increase in control cells (15.12 ± 0.7% acetylation/10 μg of protein) and a 12-fold increase in GABPα- and GABPβ-cotransfected cells (13.6 ± 0.66% acetylation/10 μg of protein). Similar results were seen previously with SRF and Elk-1(14.Hill C. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The effects of Elk-1 and SRF were attributed to squelching caused by titration of limiting components or formation of non-functional transcription complexes(14.Hill C. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The squelching of prolactin gene expression due to overexpressed GABP appears to be specific since overexpression of SRF and Elk-1 has no effect on prolactin gene expression in GH cells (Fig. 2) although the Elk-1 binding site of c-Fos is similar to the insulin-response element of the prolactin gene. Since expression of GABP was able to block insulin responsiveness of the prolactin promoter, the binding of GABPα and GABPβ1 to the insulin-response element of the prolactin gene was examined. Nuclear extracts from GH cells produced a characteristic mobility shift pattern (Fig. 3, lane 1). This gel-shift pattern was identical with that previously shown to be inhibited by low levels of non-radioactive competitor(10.Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16719-16726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gel-mobility shift experiments performed with bacterially expressed GABPα showed three retarded bands with the prolactin insulin-response element (Fig. 3, lane 2). The upper band is a complex formed with a bacterially expressed protein since it was present in extracts from unprogrammed bacteria (not shown) The other two bands are complexes containing GABPα. Similar complexes were previously reported to be formed between DNA and GABPα monomer and GABPα dimer(12.Thompson C. Brown T. McKnight S. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Only the bacterial protein band is seen with bacterially produced GABPβ1 (lane 3). This was expected since previous studies had shown that GABPβ1 is not a DNA binding protein(12.Thompson C. Brown T. McKnight S. Science. 1991; 253: 762-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). When GABPα and GABPβ1 were added together (lane 4), the bands corresponding to GABPα were no longer visible and an abundant, more slowly migrating band was seen. This band corresponds to an abundant band seen with nuclear extracts from GH cells. The identity of this band as consisting of GABPα and GABPβ1 is confirmed in the experiment shown in Fig. 3(right). Lanes 1 and 2 show the gel-mobility shift pattern with nuclear extract alone (lane 1) and nuclear extract with normal rabbit serum (lane 2). Antibodies to GABPα, lane 3, GABPβ1 (lane 4), or antibodies to both GABPα and GABPβ1 (lane 5) shifted this complex to one with a slower migration. Since insulin receptor is a tyrosine-protein kinase that is activated by insulin binding, it is thought that activation of gene transcription by insulin may be the end product of a phosphorylation cascade. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation of GABP in response to insulin in 32P-labeled GH cells. The phosphorylation of GABPα was increased 3-fold in 1 h in insulin-treated cells as compared with control cells (Fig. 4A). GABPβ co-immunoprecipitated with GABPα in this experiment shows no increase in response to insulin. Immunoprecipitation with anti-GABPβ1 confirms this observation. GABPβ1 phosphorylation was not significantly increased by insulin treatment (20% above control) while the co-immunoprecipitated GABPα is increased 3-fold by insulin. MAP kinase activation was shown to be required for several types of insulin responses in numerous systems(15.White M. Kahn C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, Elk-1, an Ets-related transcription factor, was shown to be activated by MAP kinase phosphorylation(16.Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Pointed-P2, an Ets-related protein from Drosophila, is phosphorylated by MAP kinase in the sevenless signal transduction pathway(17.Brunner D. Ducker K. Oellers N. Hafen E. Scholz H. Klambt C. Nature. 1994; 370: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Our studies 2J. Sap, K. K. Jacob, and F. M. Stanley, manuscript in preparation. suggest that insulin activation of prolactin gene expression in GH cells is MAP kinase-dependent since all factors that inhibit insulin-increased prolactin gene expression also inhibit MAP kinase activation. Therefore, MAP kinase activated by insulin might phosphorylate GABPα. The representative increase in MAP kinase activity in cell lysates from insulin-treated cells is shown (Fig. 4B). Multiple experiments show an increase of 10 ± 0.8-fold in MAP kinase activity in insulin-treated cells. GABPα contains three potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites near the DNA binding domain. Therefore, GST-GABPα fusion protein containing the three MAP kinase phosphorylation sites was prepared and used in a kinase assay with MAP kinase immunoprecipitated from control or insulin-treated GH4 cells. GABPα was phosphorylated only by MAP kinase immunoprecipitated from insulin-treated cells (Fig. 4C). This shows that GABPα is a substrate for MAP kinase and suggests that MAP kinase phosphorylation of GABP may be functionally important. GABP was shown to be important for enhancement of transcription of the herpes simplex virus immediate early gene, but its physiological role in uninfected cells is unknown. Our studies show that GABP mediates the insulin response of the prolactin gene. Since GABP is widely distributed, these results could be significant to understanding insulin regulation of other genes. Analysis of 22 insulin-responsive promoters has identified potential Ets-response elements in all of these. For some of these, the Ets-response element is in a region defined by deletion analysis to be important for the effects of insulin (5.Jacob K. Ouyang L. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The insulin-mediated increase in the transcription of all three genes, prolactin, somatostatin, and thymidine kinase, that we have studied is inhibited by dominant-negative Ets protein. This indicates that GABP may be implicated in the regulation of other insulin-responsive genes. Ets-related transcription factors such as GABP are often found in large complexes with other transcription factors. For example, Ets-1 and Sp-1 interact to synergistically activate the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus long terminal repeat(18.Gegonne A. Bosselut R. Bailly R. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although this report demonstrates that GABP is necessary to the insulin effect, it may not be sufficient. The insulin responsiveness of the prolactin gene can be eliminated by mutation of two Ets motifs at −96/-87 and −76/-67 of the prolactin promoter(4.Jacob K. Stanley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25515-25520Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mutations have little effect on basal prolactin gene transcription. However, mutation of −101/-92 of the prolactin promoter eliminates the effect of insulin and reduces basal prolactin gene expression by >100-fold. Clearly, another protein(s) interacts at this sequence and is important both for basal prolactin gene expression and the effect of insulin. It is likely that GABP is complexed with this protein(s) in the prolactin promoter and that this complex is important to the increase in prolactin gene expression seen in insulin-treated cells.

The present study demonstrates that NFAT can act as a downstream effector of Gq-protein-coupled receptors in the non-lymphoid PC12 cell line, as well as in lymphoid cells. A plasmid containing multimers of the NFAT binding site located upstream from the minimal IL-2 promoter and the firefly luciferase reporter gene (NFAT-luciferase) (16.Northrop J.P. Ulman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from Rick Bram (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). Plasmids coding for human muscarinic receptors m2 and m3 (17.Bonner T.I. Buckley N.J. Young A.C. Brann M.R. Science. 1987; 237: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) were obtained from Allan Levey (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Plasmids encoding G-protein α subunits (wild type Gαq, and a chimera, Gαq/αi, in which the last five residues from αi are replaced with corresponding amino acids from Gαq(18.Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar)) were gifts from Bruce Conklin (Gladstone Cardiovascular Center, San Francisco, CA). Jurkat cells and PC12 cells (subcolony originated by Simon Haleguoa, SUNY, Stonybrook, NY) were obtained from Jeremy Boss and Ken Minneman, respectively (Emory University). Cells (0.8 ml) were electroporated in a 0.4-cm gap cuvette using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II at 950 microfarads and 300 V (for Jurkat cells) or 360 V (for PC12 cells), at cell densities of 1 × 107 cells/ml (for Jurkat cells) or 3-7 × 106 cells/ml (for PC12 cells). NFAT-luciferase plasmid DNA (10 μg) and pRSV-Tag plasmid DNA (5 μg), as well as 5 μg of each additional plasmid DNA, were included in every transfection, and all transfections were performed in duplicate in RPMI 1640 medium. Transfected cells were aliquoted in multiwell plates in RPMI 1640 with 10-20% FBS (for Jurkat) or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS (for PC12) with penicillin/streptomycin and maintained at 37°C (5% CO2). For luciferase assays, receptor agonists and other drugs were added to Jurkat or PC12 cells between 46 and 50 h after transfection. After an additional 8-12 h, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was determined as described previously(19.Takeuchi K. Alexander R.W. Nakamura Y. Tsujino T. Murphy T.J. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For phosphoinositide hydrolysis assays, fresh growth medium containing 1 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Corp.) was added at 36 h after transfection. After an additional 18 h of incubation, agonists and additional drugs were added to fresh medium containing 5 mM LiCl, and the incubation was continued for 60 min. Cells were lysed and [3H]inositol phosphates were measured as described previously(20.Murphy T.J. Nakamura Y. Takeuchi K. Alexander R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). RPMI 1640 and bicarbonate-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium used for growth media were made from powder obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. The RPMI 1640 (liquid) used for transfections, FBS, and calf serum were purchased from Cellgro Mediatech (Herndon, VA), and horse serum was from Atlanta Biologicals (Norcross, GA). Carbachol, ionomycin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and chemicals for buffers were purchased from Sigma. Firefly luciferin was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was a gift from Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland). Transcriptional responses to Ca2+ and PKC establish the salient features of NFAT-mediated gene expression in lymphoid (Jurkat) and non-lymphoid (PC12) cells. These were transfected with a well characterized NFAT-inducible luciferase reporter plasmid containing a concatemer of the distal IL-2 gene NFAT-responsive element on a minimal IL-2 gene promoter(16.Northrop J.P. Ulman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2917-2923Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), as well as a plasmid encoding the SV40 large T antigen (pRSV-Tag) to ensure plasmid replication. In Jurkat cells (n = 4 experiments) and in PC12 cells (n = 3 experiments), the respective basal luciferase responses in the absence of added drugs (0.04 ± 0.01 and 0.06 ± 0.02 Turner light units; mean ± S.E.) are near the lower limit of detectability. The PKC activator PMA does not significantly stimulate luciferase activity in either cell line. In Jurkat cells, the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin induces a modest increase in luciferase activity (5.5 ± 1.6-fold over basal). Consistent with previous reports(1.Shaw J.P. Utz P.J. Durand D.B. Toole J.J. Emmel E.A. Crabtree G.R. Science. 1988; 241: 202-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar), ionomycin and PMA together elicit synergistic stimulation of luciferase activity (550 ± 170-fold over basal) (Fig. 1a). Similarly, in PC12 cells, modest luciferase responses elicited by ionomycin alone (5.3 ± 1.4-fold) are potentiated by PMA (13 ± 3-fold in PC12 cells) (Fig. 1b). NFAT-mediated responses induced by ionomycin in PC12 cells exhibit dose-related increases at concentrations up to 1 μM, which attenuate at higher concentrations (Fig. 1c). Virtually identical results have been obtained using ionomycin in Jurkat cells (data not shown)(22.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PC12 cells, like Jurkat cells, express a functional NFAT capable of mediating transcriptional events in response to Ca2+ and PKC signaling. TCR activation of PLCγ defines the major known pathway for induction of NFAT-mediated transcription in lymphocytes. Recent studies suggest that lymphoid NFAT may also be induced through stimulation of receptors that activate PLCβ through coupling to heterotrimeric Gq-proteins(6.Desai D.M. Newton M.E. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 348: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7.Wu J. Katzav S. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Carbachol (1 mM) elevates luciferase activity (410 ± 44-fold increase; n = 5 experiments) in Jurkat cells expressing a muscarinic m3 receptor but not in cells transfected with empty vector as control (Fig. 2a). Similarly, carbachol elicits a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity that is 34 ± 7-fold over basal at the highest dose applied (1 mM carbachol) in PC12 cells expressing the m3 receptor but not in control cells transfected with empty vector (n = 5 experiments) (Fig. 2b). Carbachol-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and luciferase responses in PC12 cells were compared in side-by-side experiments. Both responses were elicited in cells expressing the m3 receptor but not in those transfected with empty vector instead (Table 1), although luciferase measurements clearly serve as a more sensitive indicator of receptor stimulation than inositol phosphate responses.TABLE 1TABLE 1 A chimeric Gαq/αi subunit that switches the coupling of Gi-linked receptors from inhibition of adenylate cyclase to stimulation of PLC (18.Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) was used to establish that heterotrimeric G-proteins are involved in muscarinic receptor-induced NFAT responses. PC12 cells were transfected with reporter plasmids, and either an empty vector, a plasmid coding for a wild type Gαq, or a plasmid coding for Gαq/αi was added. A dose-related increase in carbachol-stimulated luciferase activity is elicited in PC12 cells expressing Gαq/αi alone but not in control cells expressing wild type Gαq (Fig. 2c) or transfected with empty vector (data not shown). This response is likely mediated by a muscarinic m4 receptor endogenous to PC12 cells, which is known to couple negatively to adenylate cyclase(23.Pinkas-Kramarski R. Edelman R. Stein R. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 108: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, larger dose-related increases in carbachol-stimulated luciferase activity are elicited in cells expressing a Gi-coupled m2 receptor, and these responses are strictly dependent upon the presence of Gαq/αi (Fig. 2c). Carbachol elicits both phosphoinositide hydrolysis and NFAT-luciferase responses in side-by-side assays in PC12 cells expressing the m2 receptor in the presence, but not the absence, of the chimeric Gαq/αi subunit (Table 1). Since the chimeric G-protein complements a response otherwise refractory in the cells, the simplest interpretation of these data is that Gq-protein coupling is both necessary and sufficient for induction of NFAT-mediated transcription by muscarinic receptors. The immunosuppressant CsA forms a complex with a cyclophilin that inhibits calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase essential for the nuclear translocation of NFAT and subsequent NFAT-dependent transcription(22.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar, 24.Flanagan M.W. Corthésy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R.

Nature. 1992; 357: 692-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). As in Jurkat cells (data not shown) (22.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 357: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar) Ca2+- and PKC-dependent NFAT activation in PC12 cells is inhibited by CsA at concentrations consistent with its effects on immune cells(21.Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22.Clipstone N.A. Crabtree G.R.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3747-3752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CsA also inhibits carbachol-induced luciferase expression in cells expressing the m3 receptor (Fig. 3). Co-dependence of NFAT activation upon elevations of intracellular Ca2+ and PKC activity and its sensitivity to CsA are principal characteristics of NFAT activity (for reviews, see (2.Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, 3.Rao A. Immunol.

Therefore, the finding that m3 receptor-stimulated luciferase responses are blocked by CsA in PC12 cells provides further evidence that Gq-protein-coupled receptors can mediate NFAT induction in non-immune cells. This study establishes that NFAT transcription factors can serve as downstream effectors for Gq-protein-coupled receptors that activate PLC and that such receptors can induce NFAT activity in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. NFAT proteins or NFAT-like DNA binding and/or transcriptional activities and NFAT isoform mRNA have been identified in a variety of tissues (8.Verweij C.L. Guidos C. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol.

Receptors coupled to Gq-proteins are represented in numerous cell types and respond to a diverse array of hormones, autacoids, and neurotransmitters. The present studies indicate that these agents are capable of acting as physiological activators of NFAT and that NFAT-mediated transcription represents a heretofore unappreciated mechanism by which these receptor agonists can modulate cellular physiology. Furthermore, immunosuppressant therapy with CsA is limited by its toxicity to neural, hepatic, bone, and renal systems. The present findings raise the possibility that some of these side effects might arise in part through disruption of normal cellular processes that are modulated by virtue of Gq-protein-coupled receptor regulation of NFAT-mediated transcriptional activities. We are grateful to Drs. Jeremy Boss, Melissa Brown, Ray Dingledine, and Ken Minneman for thoughtful comments and to Drs. Rick Bram, Bruce Conklin, and Allan Levey for supplying plasmids."

Potential therapeutic applications include analgesia, sedation, attenuation of the nausea and vomiting due to cancer chemotherapy, appetite stimulation, decreasing intraocular pressure in glaucoma, certain motor or convulsant disorders, and concentration-time deficits(1.Dewey W.L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1986; 38: 151-178PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Mechoulam R. Cannabinoids as Therapeutics Agents. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986Google Scholar). A most probable site at which many of the pharmacological effects of cannabimimetics are induced is now thought to be the cannabinoid receptor (CB). This receptor type (CB1 and CB2 subtypes are described) is a subgroup of the Gi-protein-coupled seven transmembrane spanning receptor superfamily(3.Howlett A.C. Bidaut-Russell M. Devane W.A. Melvin L.S. Johnson M.R. Herkenham M. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The CB1 receptor subtype is found predominately in brain(4.Bouaboula M. Rinaldi M. Carayon P. Carillon C. Delpech B. Shire D. Le Fur G. Casellas P. Eur. J.

A series of compounds was designed, synthesized, and designated as nonclassical cannabinoids (NCCs), e.g. CP-55,940 in Fig. 1, which differ from classical cannabinoids by the absence of a tetrahydropyran ring, e.g. Δ9-THC and(-)9β-OH-hexahydrocannabinol(7.Melvin L.S. Johnson M.R. Harbert C.A. Milne G.M. Weissman A. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8.Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Mechoulam R. Cannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 121-146Google Scholar). Although the NCCs possess significant analgesic activity, there was sufficient data to indicate that these NCC molecules still exhibit the behavioral effects of the classical analogs(9.Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Althuis T.H. Bindra J.S. Harbert C.A. Milne G.M. Weissman A. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 271-282Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10.Howlett A.C. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Milne G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 297-302PubMed Google Scholar). Key pharmacophores for the NCC analogs include a phenolic hydroxyl (Ph-OH), an aliphatic side chain attached to the phenyl ring, and a cyclohexyl ring (C-ring), all of which are also present in the natural cannabinoid Δ9-THC. Two additional pharmacophores, the northern and southern aliphatic hydroxyl groups, are not found in the natural cannabinoids but are present in most NCCs. The presence of these aliphatic hydroxyl groups significantly enhances the analgesic activity in the NCC series(8.Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Mechoulam R. Cannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 121-146Google Scholar). Consequently, the spatial arrangement with regard to the molecular pharmacophores should play an important role in determining CB1 receptor binding affinity and pharmacological activity. The conformational properties of the NCCs still remained to be investigated in detail. Of the nonclassical analogs, one particularly potent and enantioselective derivative, CP-55,940, has received extensive attention because it was used as a radiolabel for the identification and characterization of the cannabinoid receptor(11.Howlett A.C. Champion T.M. Wilken G.H. Mechoulam R. Neuropharmacology. 1990; 29: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CP-55,940 is structurally similar to its prototype, CP-47,497, except for having a hydroxypropyl group (southern aliphatic OH) on the C-ring. This structural modification incorporated in CP-55,940 enhances CB1 receptor binding potency by 20-fold and enantioselectivity for CB1 receptor binding by 44-fold(12.Melvin, L. S., Milne, G. M., Johnson, M. R., Wilken, G. H., Howlett, A. C. (1996) Mol. Neuropharmacol., in pressGoogle Scholar). As an analgesic, it is 10 times more potent than CP-47,497 and about 100 times more potent than Δ9-THC(8.Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Mechoulam R. Cannabinoids as Therapeutic Agents. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1986: 121-146Google Scholar, 10.Howlett A.C. Johnson M.R. Melvin L.S. Milne G.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 297-302PubMed Google Scholar). In an earlier publication(7.Melvin L.S. Johnson M.R. Harbert C.A. Milne G.M. Weissman A. J. Med. Chem. 1984; 27: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we reported preliminary results on the conformational properties of prototype CP-47,497. In this report, we examine the conformational properties of CP-55,940 in order to define within this important ligand those stereoelectronic features most probably associated with cannabimimetic activity and receptor binding. To accomplish our goal, we have combined two-dimensional high resolution NMR and computer modeling techniques to study the conformational properties of CP-55,940 while paying special attention to: (i) the relative orientation of the C-ring with respect to the A-ring; (ii) the conformation of the phenolic Ph-OH group; and (iii) the conformation of the 1,1-dimethylheptyl side chain. CP-55,940 was a generous gift from Pfizer Central Research (Groton, CT). NMR samples were prepared in CDCl3 (99.8 atom %) at concentrations of 0.02 M for 1H and 0.2 M for 13C, filtered, degassed, and sealed in 5 mm NMR tubes. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal chemical shift reference. The high resolution one- and two-dimensional NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker AMX-500 and WP-200SY spectrometers. One-dimensional 1H 500 MHz NMR spectra were recorded using the acquisition parameters: pulse width, 5.0 μs; spectral width, 4990.0 Hz; data size, 16 k; recycling delay, 2 s; number of transients, 16; temperature, 298 K. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive 1H-1H chemical shift correlation spectra with double quantum filter (DQF-COSY) (14.Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar) were obtained at 500 MHz with the acquisition parameters: 90° pulse width, 5 μs; spectral width, 4990.0 Hz; recycling delay, 1.3 s. The data were 512 w in the F1 dimension and 2k in the F2 dimension and were zero-filled in F1 prior to two-dimensional Fourier transformation to yield a 2k × 2k data matrix. The spectra were processed using a shift sine-bell window function in both dimensions. Two-dimensional phase-sensitive 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra (NOESYPH) (15.Bodenhausen G. Kogler H. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 58: 370-388Google Scholar) were collected at 500 MHz using the acquisition parameters similar to the DQF-COSY with the addition of mixing time (800 ms). Two-dimensional chemical exchange spectra were performed using the same pulse sequence as in NOESYPH (16.Kessler H. Oschkinat H. Loosli H-R. Croasmun W.R. Carlson R.M.K. Methods in Stereochemical Analysis. 9. VCH Publishers, Inc., New York1987: 153-285Google Scholar) to assign the obscured aliphatic OH resonance. In the spectrum, the positive cross-peaks were observed due to the exchange among the hydroxyl groups. Two-dimensional 1H-13C inverse correlated experiments with heteronuclear multiquantum coherence (HMQC) (17.Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar) were performed at 500 MHz (for 1H) using the inverse detection probe with the acquisition parameters: 90° and 180° pulses for 1H, 8.4 and 16.8 μs, and for 13C, 12.2 and 24.4 μs; decoupling high power, 2 dB; decoupling low power, 18 dB; JC–H value delay time, 3.57 ms; delay for bilinear rotation decoupling inversion pulse, 0.35 s; increment, 9 μs; number of scans, 8; for 1H, SI2 = 1024k, TD2 = 512w, SW = 4716.98 Hz; for 13C, SI1 = 4096k, TD1 = 1024k, SW = 220.85 ppm. Simulations of one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were performed with Bruker's LAOCOON-based PANIC software (18.Diehl P. Kellerhals H. Lustig E. Diehl P. Fluck E. Kosfeld R. NMR: Basic Principles and Progress. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1972: 1-96Google Scholar) using procedures that we have described elsewhere(13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19.Kriwacki R.W. Makriyannis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 495-503PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular modeling and graphic display were performed on an 4D/70GT IRIS Silicon Graphics workstation using the Biosym InsightII/Discover molecular modeling package(21.Biosym, InsightII/DISCOVER (version 2.0.0/2.7.0) Biosym Inc., San Diego, CAGoogle Scholar). The structure of CP-55,940 was built from the molecular model of Δ9-THC, which was initially generated from the x-ray crystallographic data of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (22.Rosenqvist E. Ottersen T. Acta Chem. Scand. 1975; B29: 379-384Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and energy-minimized using the Biosym program. The minimum energy conformation of Δ9-THC was then used as a starting template on which the structures of CP-55,940 were generated by deletion and/or addition of atoms at standard bond lengths and bond angles under the Biosym software. Molecular mechanics/dynamics calculations (13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23.Hagler A.T. Osguthorpe D.J. Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Hempel J. Science. 1985; 227: 1309-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) were carried out using a Biosym-interfaced AMBER force field (24.Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A.

Chem. 1986; 7: 230-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (3595) Google Scholar) with the following three steps: 1) initial structure was minimized to relieve any overly strained coordinates; 2) molecular dynamics sampling was performed using the following protocol with time steps of 1 fs: (i) heat up to 2500 K and equilibrate for 1 ps and (ii) dynamics simulation at this temperature for 300 ps with atomic coordinate trajectories recorded every 1 ps; and 3) the 300 frames recorded during the dynamics run were retrieved and minimized with a two-step minimization, using the steepest descent method for the first 100 iterations and then the conjugate gradient method until the maximum derivative was less than 0.001 kcal/mol. The calculations were carried out in a vacuum condition (default, dielectric constant = 1). A total of 300,000 conformations or frames were sampled during the simulation. In order to reduce the volume of the output data to a more manageable level, conformer structures were recorded at 1-ps intervals, thus reducing the number of structures to be analyzed to 300 frames. For a molecule like CP-55,940 with several flexible substituents other than the hydroxypropyl chain, the dynamics calculations would have to sample too many conformations. Therefore, we imposed restraints on the torsional angles of certain regions, such as the DMH chain (except for the two dihedral angles adjacent to the A-ring, φ3 and φ4, in Table 3), the C-ring, and the Ph-OH, which we found to be similar to that of its earlier studied congener CP-47,497. To avoid a formation of cis or gauche segments in the DMH side chain and to evade possible chair-boat interconversions in the cyclohexyl ring, a torsional restraint of 100 kcal/rad2 was added to the corresponding torsion angles in those regions. This effectively eliminated unnecessary trans-cis or chair-boat conversions. A torsional force was also applied into our dynamics strategy to restrict the orientation of the phenolic OH on the basis of the NOE data in which the Ph-OH proton faces the adjacent aromatic H-2 proton. Such an external torque about the specific dihedral angles tends to force the calculation toward certain restrictions during dynamics sampling, thus biasing the molecule to the region of interest. Dihedral drive techniques (13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were performed to calculate rotational energy barriers with intervals of 5° for one-bond rotation and 10° for two-bond rotation. Finally, an additional torsion force (200 kcal/rad2) was applied to restrain the rotated dihedral angle when applying energy minimization to relax the whole molecule. The spectral assignments of CP-55,940 were initially made by analogy with the chemical shifts of CP-47,497 reported elsewhere (13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and then specifically assigned on the basis of the coupling connectivities in the 1H-1H COSY spectrum and confirmed by the 1H-13C HMQC spectrum. The full and expanded scales of one-dimensional NMR spectrum are shown in Fig. 2. The assignments of the cyclohexyl protons were achieved on the basis of integrated chemical shifts and analysis of the expanded regional contour plot of the DQF-COSY spectra. A logical starting point is the resonance of H-9a at δ 3.74 ppm, which shows vicinal coupling to H-10e, H-8e, H-10a, and H-8a. We could assign the proton signals of H-10e and H-10a at δ 2.09 ppm and δ 1.38 ppm with the support of the cross-peak connectivities of H-9a with H-10a, H-8a, H-10e, and H-8e. The COSY spectrum (Fig. 3) clearly shows three components (H-10e, H-8e, and H-11e) under the multiplet at 2.06 ppm, in which three related strong geminal 2J couplings, H-10e/a (F1 = 2.09, F2 = 1.38 ppm), H-8e/a (F1 = 2.05, F2 = 1.53 ppm), and H-11e/a (F1 = 1.98, F2 = 1.13 ppm) can be discerned. In order to confirm the assignments made above, two-dimensional heteronuclear 1H-13C correlated experiments were performed to gain information about the H-C connectivities. Fig. 4 shows the two-dimensional 1H-13C HMQC spectra with enhancement of 13C sensitivity. The cross-peaks serve to identify the H-C connectivities. The complete assignments of proton and carbon chemical shifts for CP-55,940 are summarized in Table 1. While comparing the above assignments with those of CP-47,497(13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we found that most of the proton resonances of CP-55,940 are very similar to the corresponding ones of CP-47,497. Variations, however, could be seen in the proton chemical shifts of the cyclohexyl ring of CP-55,940 due to the presence of the hydroxypropyl side chain. Our two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Fig. 3) also showed that each of the 2″-CH2 methylene protons had cross-peaks with the 3″-CH2 methylene protons. The separation of the two cross-peaks is about 0.28 ppm, indicating that the two protons of 2″-CH2 are nonequivalent (see “Discussion”).Figure 3:Expanded scale of a 500 MHz two-dimensional COSY-PH-DQF spectrum of CP-55,940 in CDCl3 solution at 298 K.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4:500 MHz two-dimensional 1H-13C inverse correlation spectrum (HMQC) of CP-55,940 in CDCl3 at 300 K (13C one-dimensional external spectrum is not displayed at F1 dimension).

Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 2J and 3J values were first approximated from the two-dimensional DQF-COSY spectra, which offered a better resolution of cross-peaks(25.Rance M. Sorensen O.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2597) Google Scholar). The chemical shift values (Table 1) and approximated J values were then used as the starting point for an iterative simulation of the subspectra thus allowing us to refine 2J and 3J values (Table 2). 3J values so obtained were then incorporated into the Karplus equation (18.Diehl P. Kellerhals H. Lustig E. Diehl P. Fluck E. Kosfeld R. NMR: Basic Principles and Progress. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1972: 1-96Google Scholar) as we have described elsewhere(13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19.Kriwacki R.W. Makriyannis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 495-503PubMed Google Scholar) to calculate the corresponding dihedral angles (Table 2), which indicated a typical chair conformation of the C-ring.TABLE 2 NOE is one of the most important NMR parameters used in conformational analysis because the magnitude of the NOE is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the interproton distance in space (INOE ∝ r−6). Typically, an observed NOE cross-peak indicates that the two protons are near in space within a distance of 3.0 Å and exhibit through space coupling with each other. Beyond the 3.0 Å range, the NOE is very weak, and the effect becomes barely detectable at 4.5 Å(26.Fesik S.W. Perun T.J. Propst C.L. Computer-Aided Drug Design, Methods and Applications. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1989: 56-91Google Scholar). To obtain the NOE values for the protons of CP-55,940, the two-dimensional 1H-1H phase-sensitive NOESY spectrum was obtained (Fig. 5). Our data show an NOE cross-peak between the phenol hydroxyl proton (δ 5.28 ppm) and the adjacent aromatic H-2 proton (δ 6.68 ppm), indicating that these two protons are spatially near and coupled through a dipole-dipole interaction. As will be discussed later, this result is used to assign the orientation of the phenolic OH proton. Another two NOE cross-peaks were identified as being due to spatial coupling between H-5 with H-8a and H-12a, indicating that H-5 is near H-8a and H-12a. Such cross-peaks provide important information regarding the preferred orientation of the A-ring with respect to the C-ring as shown in Fig. 5. The NOE cross-peak pattern that was observed between the DMH side chain and the aromatic ring protons (Fig. 5) indicates that the conformation of the DMH chain of CP-55,940 is very similar to one observed for CP-47,497, in which the DMH side chain is almost perpendicular to the plane of phenolic ring(13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Molecular dynamics/mechanics was used to search for the preferred conformations of CP-55,940 and to examine the possibility of intramolecular H-bonding between hydroxyl groups. The main advantage of using molecular dynamics is that it simulates molecular motion at high temperature, thus increasing the probability of inducing conformational transitions past any possible high energy barriers. This would ensure sampling of all possible minima while avoiding the risk of a situation in which the molecular mechanics calculation might lead to a local rather than the global energy minimum. Dynamics simulations were performed with time steps of 1 fs for 300 ps. The data were recorded at 1-ps intervals, and a total of 300 frames of conformers were sampled. Molecular mechanics energy minimizations were carried out for each of the 300 conformers while releasing all torsional angle constraints. This operation resulted in a convergence of these conformers into several families. Of these families, the six energetically lowest are shown in Fig. 6. Conformers II, III, IV, V, and VI allow for intramolecular H-bonding between the hydroxypropyl and the phenolic hydroxyl groups if we assume that hydroxyl groups separated by approximately 2 Å will form a H-bond. Such H-bonding imparts greater stability to each of the five conformers. The most stable of these is conformer IV, which is also the global energy minimum. Conformer II, with the Ph-OH/3″-OH hydrogen bond on the opposite face of the molecule, has only 0.28 kcal/mol higher energy than that of conformer IV. The summary of the calculated structural features of CP-55,940 is given in Table 3.TABLE 3TABLE 3 Intramolecular H-bonding is among the most important interactions in biological molecules and is an internal cohesive force that can play an important role in determining the geometry and mode of recognition and association of biological molecules(27.Jeffrey G.A. Saenger W. Hydrogen Bonding in Biological Structures. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1991: 1-155Google Scholar). In many instances, the presence of one or more H-bonds can be critical in determining the more stable conformer. Experimentally, the presence of H-bonding can be determined using solution NMR spectroscopy(28.Onda M. Yamamoto Y. Inoue Y. Chujo R. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1988; 16: 4015-4021Crossref Google Scholar). NMR experiments designed to study intramolecular H-bonding generally rely on the premise that intramolecular H-bonding is less concentration-dependent than intermolecular H-bonding. In an intramolecular H-bond system, the proton participating in the hydrogen bond becomes more positive in its electronic character. As a consequence, this proton is deshielded compared with a nonhydrogen bonded proton, causing its signal to shift to a downfield in the NMR spectrum(28.Onda M. Yamamoto Y. Inoue Y. Chujo R. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1988; 16: 4015-4021Crossref Google Scholar). This is usually the basis for measuring H-bonding using 1H NMR. To use this technique, the first step required identification of the two aliphatic OH resonances that were obscured by other resonances in the 1H spectrum of CP-55,940 in CDCl3 (Fig. 2), thus preventing a concentration dependence study. We approached this problem by obtaining the spectra in different solvents and with the use of two-dimensional exchange experiments. The two-dimensional exchange spectrum had two strong positive cross-peaks generated through chemical exchange among the three OH groups and appearing at F1 = 1.55, F2 = 5.08 ppm and F1 = 1.24, F2 = 5.08 ppm, respectively. Differentiation of these two sets of positive cross-peaks could be accomplished by slicing out the cross-section plot of the two-dimensional exchange spectrum along the F2 dimension to obtain three positive peaks (Fig. 7). Of these, the most downfield positive peak at δ 5.08 ppm is due to the phenolic OH proton, whereas the most upfield situated peak centered at δ 1.24 ppm is due to the 3″-hydroxypropyl OH proton appearing as a triplet due to scalar coupling with the adjacent methylene protons (Fig. 7A). The peak at δ 1.55 ppm was readily assigned to the cyclohexyl 9-OH, whereas the peak at δ 1.64 ppm was shown to be due to an impurity in the commercial CDCl3 solvent. The use of the two-dimensional 1H-1H exchange experiment thus allowed us to overcome the difficulty in identifying the two aliphatic OH peaks that overlapped with the methylene peaks in the one-dimensional spectrum. Several two-dimensional exchange spectra were obtained using the same parameters while varying the concentration from 0.05 M to 0.0026 M. The one-dimensional cross-section due to the phenolic OH proton from each of the two-dimensional exchange spectra are shown in Fig. 7. This allows us to follow the effect of concentration on the 1H chemical shifts of all three OH resonances. The results showed that the broad Ph-OH singlet at δ 5.08 ppm was the most concentration-dependent with a concentration coefficient of 10.8 ppm/mol; the 9-OH proton had a coefficient of 5.01 ppm/mol, whereas the 3″-OH triplet showed only a modest shift with a concentration coefficient of 2.3 ppm/mol. These results may be interpreted to mean that the 3″-OH proton is possibly engaged in intramolecular H-bonding with the phenolic OH and is thus less prone to chemical exchange or intermolecular H-bonding, whereas the phenolic OH hydrogen is more available for such interactions. The combined use of two-dimensional NMR and computer molecular modeling has enabled us to define the conformational properties of CP-55,940 as discussed below. The observed NOE cross-peak between the phenolic hydroxyl proton and the adjacent aromatic H-2 indicates that these two protons are spacially near each other and thus coupled through a dipole-dipole interaction (Fig. 5). Such a result implies that in its preferred conformation, the Ph-OH proton points away from the cyclohexyl ring and toward the H-2 proton. This result was also supported by our computational data showing that the phenolic O-H-bond lies in the plane of the aromatic ring and is oriented toward H-2. These findings are consistent with earlier results with the classical cannabinoid Δ9-THC (19.Kriwacki R.W. Makriyannis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 495-503PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Reggio P.H. Greer K.V. Cox S.M. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 35.Reggio P.H. Mazurek A.P. J. Mol. Struct. 1987; 149: 331-343Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the nonclassical cannabinoid prototype CP-47,497(13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The similar NOE cross-peak pattern observed as in the case of CP-47,497 (13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) implies the possibility of several interconverting DMH side chain conformers that are time averaged on the NMR time scale. This conclusion was confirmed by our molecular modeling studies, which showed that the DMH side chain of CP-55,940 has an equal probability of existing in one of four minimum energy conformations, having a φ3 dihedral angle of 60°, −60°, 120°, and −120°, respectively, and φ4 equal to 60° and −60°, respectively (Table 3). In all the above conformations, the DMH side chain is almost perpendicular to the plane of the phenyl ring. In these conformations, the 3′-CH2 protons of the DMH side chain are located either above or below the plane of the aromatic ring. This conformational feature would account for the observed upfield shift (0.16 ppm versus 4′, 5′) of the 3′ protons, which can thus be attributed to the shielding effect of the phenyl ring. Two NOE cross-peaks were assigned to the spatial coupling of H-5 with H-8a and H-12a. Such cross-peaks are congruent with a calculated preferred conformation in which the planes of the two rings are almost perpendicular to each other and the Ph OH bond points down in the same plane as the axial H-7 and toward the α-face of the cyclohexyl ring (Fig. 5). Additional information about the relative A/C-ring orientation was obtained from the NOESYVD spectrum (not shown) using a similar two-dimensional NOESYPH pulse sequence with four loops of randomly varied mixing times (800 ± 20 ms). In addition to the NOE cross-peak between H-5 with H-8a and H-12a, which was also observed in the previous NOESYPH spectrum, the spectrum had a very weak NOE cross-peak due to the interaction between the H-5 (δ 7.02 ppm) and H-7a (δ 2.72 ppm) protons. The presence of such an additional weak peak suggests the existence of two rotamers, a major one in which the phenolic OH is positioned toward the α-phase of the C-ring (φ1 ∼60°) and a minor one in which the OH group faces up toward the β-face of the C-ring (φ1 ∼120°). The calculated relative energy difference between the above two conformations was found to be only 0.34 kcal/mol. The two rotamer populations interpreted on the basis of the extra NOE cross-peak is also congruent with the calculated high rotational energy barrier of CP-55,940 (20.5 kcal/mol), whereas the value for CP-47,497 is 9.7 kcal/mol, and no minor NOE between H-5 and H-7a was observed. Rotation about the C7-C6 bond on the NMR time scale was also indicated by a broad peak for H-7a with hardly discernible splitting in the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. 2) at room temperature. When the spectrum of CP-55,940 was obtained at a higher temperature (345 K), the peak for the H-7a resonance became a sharper and narrower triplet of triplets as in the case of CP-47,497, which indicates a faster rotational motion about the C7-C6 bond of CP-55,940 at a high temperature. Such an interpretation may also explain the apparent disappearance of the aromatic carbon C5 signal in the one-dimensional 13C proton-decoupled broad band spectrum even when a delay as long as 120 s was used. Furthermore, the C5 carbon did not appear in the distortionless enhancement polarization transfer spectra and was not represented by a cross-peak in the hetero-COSY spectra. It was only with the help of a 1H-13C inverse detection HMQC spectrum, which is normally 10-100 times more sensitive than a conventional 13C-detected hetero-COSY spectrum(17.Bax A. Subramanian S. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 565-569Google Scholar), that a cross-peak due to 5-CH could be observed. We attribute the low intensity of the C5 resonance in the 13C spectrum to a broadening of this peak to the high rotational barrier around the C6-C7 bond. The detailed investigation will be published elsewhere. According to the one-dimensional and two-dimensional COSY 1H spectra of CP-55,940, the 3″-CH2 protons are nonequivalent. This is demonstrated by the features of the 3″-CH2 multiples at δ 3.47 ppm in the one-dimensional spectrum (Fig. 2) and the presence of two cross-peaks due to coupling of each of the 3″-CH2 protons with the vicinal 2″-CH2. The above two spectra clearly show that the two 3″-CH2 protons have different chemical shifts that differ by Δδ = 0.05 ppm. Theoretically, the two 3″-CH2 protons should be equivalent because the low rotational energy barrier would allow the C2″-C3″ bond to rotate freely and average out between the three rotamers. Therefore, the above observations imply some rotional restriction around the C2″-C3″ bond, possibly because of hydrogen bond formation between the 3″-OH and Ph-OH. Such a postulation is congruent with the earlier data regarding the spectroscopic properties of the three hydroxyl groups in CP-55,940. The occurrence of an intramolecular H-bond was also supported by the result obtained from computer molecular modeling (Fig. 6). According to the combined experimental and theoretical data, the intramolecular H-bonding stabilizes the conformation of CP-55,940 by forming a ten-membered H-bonded ring. Based on these data, the most preferred conformation having an intramolecular H-bond was conformer IV in Fig. 8. Such a conformation is also congruent with the observed nonequivalency of the 3″-CH2 protons because the ten-membered H-bonded ring would prevent free rotation in the hydroxypropyl chain. Our computational studies also revealed other conformers, especially conformer II in Fig. 8. Conformer II, differing from the IV by 0.28 kcal/mol, has all three hydroxyl groups pointing toward the same side of the molecule. Based on earlier (30.Rhodes D.G. Sarmiento J.G. Herbette L.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 27: 612-623PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Makriyannis A. Pertwee R. Cannabinoid Receptors. Academic Press, London1995: 87-115Google Scholar) studies from our laboratory, we postulate that a conformation such as II would be favored when these compounds partition into the cellular membrane because it would allow all three hydroxyls to interact with the polar side of the bilayer at the interface, whereas the other nonpolar parts of the molecule are associated with the hydrophobic bilayer chains. Such a conformer shares several stereochemical features of Δ9-THC, whose preferred conformation is depicted in Fig. 8(19.Kriwacki R.W. Makriyannis A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 495-503PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Rosenqvist E. Ottersen T. Acta Chem. Scand. 1975; B29: 379-384Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29.Reggio P.H. Greer K.V. Cox S.M. J. Med.

As can be seen, the A- and C-rings of CP-55,940 can be superimposed on those of Δ9-THC if the plane of its C-ring is rotated by 75°, a process that requires an expenditure of 2∼3 kcal/mol in energy as described elsewhere(13.Xie X.Q. Yang D.P. Melvin L.S. Makriyannis A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 1418-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher potency of CP-55,940 when compared with Δ9-THC can then be attributed to the additional structural features present in this molecule. They include a longer chain length, two α,α-dimethyl substituents in the side chain, the presence of a 9β-hydroxy, and a southern aliphatic hydroxypropyl group. All of these additional pharmacophores are expected to enhance the affinity of CP-55,940 for the cannabinoid receptor. In this study, the high resolution NMR experiments provided detailed information on the conformation of CP-55,940 in solution and allowed us to identify a major preferred conformer as well as the presence of a minor rotamer. Molecular modeling studies confirmed that the preferred conformation in solution was indeed the low energy conformer but also suggested at least one other low energy conformer that may be relevant to biological activity."

RK-1 is related to the corticostatin/defensins and has the sequence MPCSCKKYCDPWEVIDGSCGLFNSKYICCREK but differs from the very cationic corticostatins/defensins in having only one arginine and a calculated charge at pH 7 of +1. Like some myeloid corticostatin/defensins RK-1 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli. Since corticostatin/defensins effect ion flux in responsive epithelia we used volume changes in villus enterocytes as a model system to study the effects of RK-1 on ion channels in epithelial cells. At concentrations ≥10−9 M RK-1 decreased enterocyte volume in a dose-dependent manner through a pathway that requires extracellular calcium and is inhibited by niguldipine, a dihydropyridine-sensitive “L”-type Ca2+-channel blocker. In other assay systems for corticostatin/defensins, such as the inhibition of adrenocorticotropin-stimulated steroidogenesis, or cell lysis, RK-1 was inactive or only weakly active.

Like some myeloid corticostatin/defensins RK-1 inhibits the growth of Escherichia coli. Since corticostatin/defensins effect ion flux in responsive epithelia we used volume changes in villus enterocytes as a model system to study the effects of RK-1 on ion channels in epithelial cells. At concentrations ≥10−9 M RK-1 decreased enterocyte volume in a dose-dependent manner through a pathway that requires extracellular calcium and is inhibited by niguldipine, a dihydropyridine-sensitive “L”-type Ca2+-channel blocker. In other assay systems for corticostatin/defensins, such as the inhibition of adrenocorticotropin-stimulated steroidogenesis, or cell lysis, RK-1 was inactive or only weakly active. These results demonstrate the existence of a novel system of biologically active peptides in the kidney represented by RK-1 which is antimicrobial and can activate epithelial ion channels in vitro."

Furthermore, the b0,+-like transport activity has not been clearly described in the kidney or intestine. Here, we report that a “proximal tubular-like” cell line derived from opossum kidney (OK cells) expresses an rBAT transcript. Poly(A)+ RNA from OK cells induced system b0,+-like transport activity in oocytes. This was hybrid-depleted by human rBAT antisense oligonucleotides. A polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA fragment (∼700 base pairs) from OK cell RNA corresponds to an rBAT protein fragment 65-69% identical to those from human, rabbit and rat kidneys. We have also examined transport of L-cystine in OK cells and found characteristics very similar to the amino acid exchanger activity induced by rBAT cRNA in oocytes. Uptake of L-cystine was of high affinity, sodium-independent and shared with L-arginine and L-leucine. It was trans-stimulated by amino acids with the same specificity as rBAT-induced transport activity in oocytes. Furthermore, it was localized to the apical pole of confluent OK cells. To demonstrate that the rBAT protein is functionally related to this transport activity, we have transfected OK cells with human rBAT antisense and sense sequences. Transfection with rBAT antisense, but not with rBAT sense, resulted in the specific reduction of rBAT mRNA expression and b0,+-like transport activity. These results demonstrate that rBAT is functionally related to the L-cystine uptake via system b0,+-like in the apical pole of the renal OK cell line.

https://openalex.org/W1967713224,"Multicopy clones of Escherichia coli cytosine methyltransferases Dcm and EcoRII methylase (M. EcoRII) cause ~50-fold increase in C → T mutations at their canonical site of methylation, 5′-CmeCAGG (meC is 5-methylcytosine). These plasmids also cause transition mutations at the second cytosine in the sequences CCGGG at ~10-fold lower frequency. Similarly, M. HpaII was found to cause a significant increase in C → T mutations at a CCAG site, in addition to causing mutations at its canonical site of methylation, CCGG. Using a plasmid that substantially overproduces M. EcoRII, in vivo methylation at CCSGG (S is C or G) and other non-canonical sites could be detected using a gel electrophoretic assay. There is a direct correlation between the level of M. EcoRII activity in cells, the extent of methylation at non-canonical sites and frequency of mutations at these same sites. Overproduction of M. EcoRII in cells also causes degradation of DNA and induction of the SOS response. In vitro, M. EcoRII methylates an oligonucleotide duplex containing a CCGGG site at a slow rate, suggesting that overproduction of the enzyme is essential for significant amounts of such methylation to occur. Together these results show that cytosine methyltransferases occasionally methylate cellular DNA at non-canonical sites and suggest that in E. coli, methylation-specific restriction systems and sequence specificity of the DNA mismatch correction systems may have evolved to accommodate this fact. These results also suggest that mutational effects of cytosine methyltransferases may be much broader than previously imagined.

There is good correlation between the presence of methylation at position 5 of cytosines in DNA and transition mutations. Several years ago Coulondre et al.(1.Coulondre C. Miller J.H. Farabaugh P.J. Gilbert W. Nature. 1978; 274: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) showed that two cytosine methylation sites in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli were hot spots for spontaneous C → T mutations. These cytosines mutated to thymine at frequencies many times higher than the frequencies of mutations at any other base in the gene(1.Coulondre C. Miller J.H. Farabaugh P.J. Gilbert W. Nature. 1978; 274: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). More recently, a cytosine methylation site in the cI gene of a phage λ lysogen (2.Lieb M. Genetics. 1991; 128: 23-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was also shown to be a hot spot for spontaneous C → T mutations. In vertebrates, methylation of cytosines predominantly occurs within CpG dinucleotides, and cataloging of sequence changes that cause human genetic diseases has revealed that a disproportionately high fraction of these involve transition mutations at CpG sites(3.Cooper D.N. Youssoufian H. Hum. Genet. 1988; 78: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). There is also a striking correlation between some types of cancers and mutations at CpG dinucleotides in the tumor suppressor gene p53 (reviewed in (4.Jones P.A. Rideout III, W.A. Shen J.-C.

In addition, 53% of all the germline mutations found in Li-Fraumeni syndrome are C:G to T:A mutations within CpGs(5.Greenblatt M.S. Bennett W.P. Hollstein M. Harris C.C.

Nature. 1978; 274: 775-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar) as the explanation of this phenomenon. Recently several alternate hypotheses for the occurrence of such mutational hot spots have been proposed and studied. These include error-prone copying of 5-meC by DNA polymerases(9.Shen J.-C. Creighton S. Jones P.A. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5119-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), cytosine methyltransferase (C5 MTase)-mediated C → U (10.Shen J.-C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14752-14757Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) conversions, excision of 5-meC in DNA followed by error-prone repair (12.Vairapandi M. Duker N.J.

To help choose between these alternative hypotheses, we have developed two genetic systems in E. coli that can quantitate C → T mutations at sites of cytosine methylation. The assay involves scoring of kanamycin-resistant (Kanr) revertants from kanamycin-sensitive (KanS) alleles in which Leu (TTG) at codon 94 of the kan gene was replaced with Pro (CCG or CCA) mutations. Replacement of the second C in the codon with T restores a different Leu codon and is scored as Kanr (Fig. 1 and Refs. 15 and 16). The two KanS alleles will be referred to as kanS-H94 (codon 94; CCG) and kanS-D94 (CCA), respectively. While the former system detects C → T mutations within CpG sequences, the latter detects mutations within the sequence context of cytosine methylation in E. coli. EcoRII methyltransferase (M. EcoRII) is part of a plasmid-borne restriction-modification system found in a clinical E. coli isolate(17.Bannister D. Glover S.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1968; 30: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18.Yoshimori R. Roulland-Dussoix D. Boyer H.W. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 1275-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). M. EcoRII methylates position 5 of the second cytosine within the sequence 5′-CCWGG-3′ (W is A or T; Refs. 19 and 20). The chromosome of E. coli K-12 also codes for a C5 MTase called Dcm(21.Marinus M.G. Morris N.R. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Dcm and M. EcoRII have identical methylation specificities(22.May M.S. Hattman S. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 129-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Schlagman S. Hattman S. May M.S. Berger L. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 126: 990-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, both Dcm and M. EcoRII methylate within codon 94 of kanS-D94 (Fig. 1). Presence of a cognate MTase in cells containing one of the kan alleles results in a ~40-100-fold increase in the KanS to Kanr reversion frequency(15.Bandaru B. Wyszynski M. Bhagwat A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2950-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Wyszynski M. Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1574-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These studies provide direct evidence that an action of C5 MTases, presumably methylation itself, is the cause of mutational hot spots at sites of cytosine methylation. While Dcm or M. EcoRII were used as the cognate MTases with kanS-D94 in these studies, the methyltransferase in the HpaII restriction-modification system (M. HpaII) was used with kanS-H94. M. HpaII methylates the second cytosine within the sequence CCGG(24.Mann M.B. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have used restriction mapping and DNA sequencing to confirm that the Kanr revertants obtained during these studies contain the expected C → T mutation at codon 94(15.Bandaru B. Wyszynski M. Bhagwat A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2950-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Wyszynski M. Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1574-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This shows that the occurrence of second-site revertants is low in the system and that the system is well suited to study the effect of methylation within specific sequences on C → T mutations. An unexpected finding of these experiments was that the presence of non-cognate methylases in the cells also increased Kanr reversion frequency, although to a lesser extent. We describe below this phenomenon, discover its cause, and explore its implications to the structure and biology of C5 MTases.

Genet. 1981; 182: 505-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) into pACYC184. It contains the ecoRIm gene and a part of the ecoRIr gene. To construct pR400, M13 phage derivative BM1909 containing the wild-type ecoRIIm+ gene (28.Wyszynski M.W. Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was cloned into pUC119 as a PstI-EcoRI fragment. For reasons not related to this work, several nucleotides in this gene were changed to introduce an SpeI site (ACTAGT) and an AatII site (GACGTC) in the gene without changing the coded amino acids. ( 2B. Bandaru, J. Gopal, and A. S. Bhagwat, unpublished results.) The changes in the sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing. PR234 ( 3S. Gabbara, unpublished results.) was constructed by cloning a HindIII fragment containing ecoRIIm+ gene from pSS114 (30.Som S. Bhagwat A.S. Friedman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 313-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) into the Ptac promoter vector pKK223-3(31.Brosius J. Holy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The oligonucleotides 5′-GGCACTTCGCCTGGTAGCAGCCAGTC and 5′-GGCACTTCGCCCGGGAGCAGCCAGTCC, and their respective complements were synthesized by Genset Corp. (La Jolla, CA). They were purified using NENsorb Prep columns (DuPont NEN). To determine MTase activity in cells, 5-ml cultures were grown of BH143 containing the appropriate plasmids. Cells were concentrated by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of sonication buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol). EDTA was added to a concentration of 1 mM, and lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml. After 15 min on ice, the cells were freeze-thawed and then sonicated. Cell lysate was centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 20 min, and supernatant was suspended in 50% glycerol. Five-μl aliquots of this preparation were used in a 50-μl reaction mixture. Methyltransferase activity was measured as transfer of methyl groups from S-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-L-methionine (DuPont NEN) to chromosomal DNA from the strain RP4182. Unincorporated SAM was removed from the reaction using Sepharose CL-6B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) spin columns. The concentration of the protein in the extracts was determined using the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad, and the enzyme activity was calculated as the initial velocity of the reaction per milligram of extract used. Duplexes I and II were methylated with M. EcoRII purified to apparent homogeneity (specific activity 9.8 pmol of methyl groups/min/μg of protein) using S-[methyl-3H]adenosyl-L-methionine (DuPont NEN) (0.078 μM, 85 Ci/mmol) as the methyl donor in methylase buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.4 mM dithiothreitol). The reaction volume was 50 μl, and the reactions were carried out at 37°C and terminated at various times by the addition of 2 μl of 10% SDS. The samples were purified by extraction with phenol-chloroform and passed through Sephadex G-50 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) spin columns to remove unincorporated radioactive label. The incorporated radioactivity was quantitated by scintillation counting. When duplex I was used, it was at concentrations between 10 and 200 nM and the enzyme was at 2.1 nM. When duplex II was used, it was at concentrations between 1.0 and 20.0 μM and the enzyme was at 0.454 μM. Steady-state kinetics of methyl transfer was analyzed using the Statview Student package for the Macintosh, and the kinetic constants were calculated. The procedure for the reversion assay has been described before(15.Bandaru B. Wyszynski M. Bhagwat A.S. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2950-2952Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Wyszynski M. Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1574-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, three independent coloniesa were picked from each transformation and 5-ml cultures were grown to logarithmic phase (A550 ~ 0.3) in LB medium containing appropriate antibiotics. The culture was then concentrated and resuspended in 1 ml of LB broth and plated on LB plates without antibiotic or with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) to detect the reversion. The assay was carried out according to the procedure outlined by Miller(32.Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). A 50-ml culture of JH140 containing pNK627 and pR234 was grown from a single colony in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and tetracycline (10 μg/ml) at 37°C. Starting at A600 = 0.03, the turbidity of the culture and the β-galactosidase activity was monitored. At A600 = 0.065, the culture was divided in two halves and IPTG was added to one culture to a concentration of 100 μM. At 30-min intervals, 5-ml samples of the culture were removed to measure optical density and a part of this culture was used to determine β-galactosidase activity. Samples (0.5 ml) were used for the enzyme assay at the low cell densities, and progressively smaller volumes (to 50 μl) were used as the turbidity of the culture increased. For each assay, the sample was diluted to 1 ml with Z buffer and cells lysed with chloroform and SDS as described by Miller(32.Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). 2-Nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (0.2 ml of 4 mg/ml) was added to the lysates to start the reaction. The reaction tubes were maintained at 28°C and monitored for development of color and stopped by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 M Na2CO3 when a light yellow color was seen. The solutions were subjected to a clearing spin, and A420 was measured. The units of β-galactosidase activity are defined as (1000 × A420)/(t × v × A600), where t is the time of reaction in minutes and v is the volume of the sample used for the assay in milliliters. When E. coli containing kanS-D94 allele was transformed by a plasmid that codes for Dcm (pDCM72), KanS to Kanr reversion frequency increased by a factor of about 50 (Table 1). This increase is somewhat lower than the increase reported previously (100-fold; (16.Wyszynski M. Gabbara S. Bhagwat A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1574-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar)). The differences in the two sets of numbers may be due to the use of different E. coli strains in the two experiments. Unexpectedly, pDCM72 also caused a significant increase in reversion frequency with the kanS-H94 allele (Table 1). Although the extent of increase in revertants in this case was substantially smaller, it was reproducible. In different experiments it varied between 2- and 4-fold above background (data not shown). To assure that these increases were not the result of day-to-day variations in growth conditions of cells, the experiments with pDCM72 and the plasmid used as the negative control, pACYC184, were always done in parallel. Triplicate cultures were used in all experiments, and, although results from only one experiment are reported, each experiment was repeated to confirm its reproducibility. Similar precautions were taken for all the reversion assays reported below. When the gene for M. EcoRII (ecoRIIm+) was cloned into pBR322 and introduced into the test strains, it also caused an increase in Kanr reversion frequency with the kanS-H94 allele (Table 2). Once again, the level of increase in the reversion frequency was substantially lower than that with the kanS-D94 allele. Together, these data suggest that when dcm+ or ecoRIIm+ genes are cloned into medium copy number plasmids, there is an increase in the frequency of C → T mutations at the non-canonical site CCGGG by a factor of up to 4. We were concerned that the observed increases in Kanr reversion frequency caused by these MTases may be due to mutations at a site other than the CCWGG site at codon 94. To eliminate this possibility, plasmid DNA was extracted from 10 revertants obtained in experiments involving Dcm and kanS-H94. These DNA preparations typically contained three plasmids: the plasmid carrying the MTase gene, the plasmid with the original kanS-H94 allele, and the plasmid with the revertant. The latter plasmid was separated from the other plasmids by retransformation into a new host and selecting for Kanr phenotype. DNA was isolated from the transformants and analyzed by restriction digests. When codon 94 is CCG, a C → T mutation at the second position in this codon (but not at the first position) eliminates a SmaI site (CCCGGG) and creates a BstNI site (CCTGG, Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the restriction pattern for two such revertants. As expected, both the plasmids had lost the SmaI site (lanes 6 and 7) and gained a BstNI site (lanes 9 and 10). Furthermore, the sizes of the newly created BstNI fragments in the revertants were consistent with the sizes expected if a new BstNI site were to be created at codon 94 (not shown). The remaining eight revertants also showed a similar pattern of restriction sites. These results confirm that Dcm causes the expected sequence change at codon 94 of kanS-H94. It seemed conceivable that somehow the presence of a DNA methyltransferase (MTase) in the cells or the mere interruption of the tetracycline resistance (Tetr) gene in the vector causes a small increase in general mutation frequency in the host and that this phenomenon was responsible for the observed increase in Kanr reversion frequency. To eliminate this possibility, EcoRI MTase was cloned into pACYC184 and the plasmid was introduced into the test strains. M. EcoRI is an MTase that methylates the second adenine in the sequence GAATTC(20.Boyer H.W. Chow L.T. Dugaiczyk A. Hedgepeth J. Goodman H.M. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 244: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When the Kanr reversion frequency in these strains was compared with that in strains with pACYC184, no increase the frequency of mutations was observed with either of the two test plasmids (Table 3). Therefore, the apparent increase in reversion frequency due to the C5 MTases at non-canonical sites is not the result of some nonspecific effect of the presence of an MTase in the host on a multicopy plasmid or of the interruption of the tetracycline resistance gene in pACYC184. We wished to determine whether this phenomenon was restricted to the closely related MTases Dcm and M. EcoRII or whether other C5 MTases could also cause mutations at non-canonical sites. To test this, gene for the MTase in the HpaII restriction-modification system was cloned into pACYC184 and the resulting recombinant was tested for its effect on Kanr reversions with test plasmid carrying the CCAGG site at codon 94 (kanS-D94). With this plasmid, M. HpaII would be expected to encounter a CCAG site, instead of its canonical site, CCGG(24.Mann M.B. Smith H.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). M. HpaII caused a 4-fold increase in Kanr reversion frequency with the kanS-D94 allele (Table 4). Once again, although this increase was substantially less than that seen at the canonical site, it was quite reproducible. In different experiments the enhancement in mutagenesis caused by M. HpaII at the non-canonical site has been found to vary between about ~3- and 4-fold above background (not shown). Plasmid DNA was isolated from nine such revertants, and restriction analysis of the DNA was performed. In this case, the previously existing BstNI site (CCAGG) at codon 94 of kanS-D94 was found to be lost in 8 out of the 9 revertants (not shown). The remaining revertant had suffered DNA rearrangements and was not studied further. These results show that in nearly every case, the increase in the Kanr reversion frequency caused by M. HpaII was the result of C → T change at codon 94 and was not due to second-site revertants. Based on these results, we conclude that M. HpaII is also capable of causing mutations at a non-canonical sequence. A possible simple explanation for the results described above is that the MTases methylate the non-canonical sites at a certain rate and that the resulting 5-methylcytosine deaminates to give rise to C → T mutations. This seemed particularly likely in our reversion assay because the non-canonical sites differ from the canonical sites only in one position. Thus a modest “relaxation” of MTase specificity causing methylation of the CCGGG site could explain the result. M. DsaV, a C5 MTase that methylates the second cytosine in the sequence CCNGG (27.Gopal J. Yebra M.J. Bhagwat A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4482-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 33.Gopal J. Bhagwat A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) illustrates this point. When a plasmid carrying the gene for this MTase was introduced into the test strains, it caused roughly equal amounts of increase in the reversion frequency for the two kan alleles (Table 5). We tested the ability of M. EcoRII in vitro to transfer methyl groups to a 27 bp DNA duplex containing CCGGG sequence (Duplex I) and compared the kinetic parameters for this reaction with those for methyl transfer to duplex containing a CCAGG sequence (Duplex II). The DNAs used in these experiments contained the sequences surrounding codon 94 of kanS-D94 or kanS-H94. For this reason, they were considered to be good models for understanding methylation at codon 94 of kan by M. EcoRII in vivo. The enzyme methylated the non-canonical DNA sequence at a low rate (Table 6). Interestingly, the principal difference in the interaction of the enzyme with the two substrates was reflected in differences in Kcat (Table 6). While the Kcat for methyl transfer to the CCGGG-containing substrate was lower than that for the canonical substrate by a factor of ~2.0 × 103, Km for the non-canonical substrate was higher by only a factor of ~27 (Table 6). If the Km values for the two substrates are taken to reflect KS values, M. EcoRII can be said to discriminate between the two substrates more at the level of catalysis than at the level of DNA binding. Although the rate of methylation of the non-canonical duplex by M. EcoRII is poor, methylation does take place at the expected site. We demonstrated this by methylating 32P-labeled Duplex I with excess M. EcoRII and challenging the DNA with HpaII endonuclease. The digested DNA was separated from resistant DNA by gel electrophoresis, and the extent of protection against HpaII was quantitated. While HpaII digested 93-96% of the untreated DNA, it consistently cut the M. EcoRII-treated DNA less well. Analysis of the gel using a PhosphorImager revealed that 7.0% (S.D.= ±2.4%; n = 3) more of the total DNA was resistant to HpaII as a result of reaction with M. EcoRII, than without it. Because HpaII is inhibited by methylation of either cytosine in its recognition sequence(34.Walder R.Y. Langtimm C.J. Chatterjee R. Walder J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1235-1241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Butkus V. Petrauskiene L. Maneliene Z. Klimasauskas S. Laucys V. Janulaitis A.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 7091-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we can only conclude that M. EcoRII must have methylated one of the cytosines in the sequence CCGGG to render it resistant to HpaII. If occasional methylation of the CCGGG site by Dcm and M. EcoRII was responsible for the increase in Kanr reversion frequency, it should be possible to detect such methylation by challenging pKanS-H94 DNA isolated from these cells with HpaII and separating the products on agarose gels. Occasional methylation at these sites should create one or more partial digestion products that could be identified by an appropriate detection technique. However, when pKanS-H94 was isolated from cells that also contained pDCM72 and was digested with HpaII, no partial digestion products could be seen by ethidium bromide staining of the gel (not shown). We reasoned that this may be partly due to the fact that HpaII has >30 sites in each plasmid making the task of identifying partial digestion products difficult. We also reasoned that the increase in reversion frequency of kanS-H94 allele caused by pDCM72 or pR300 is small and may indicate that in cells containing these plasmids only a small percentage (<10%) of pKanS-H94 molecules are methylated at codon 94. This should make the detection of partial digestion products even harder. To improve the chances of detecting methylation at non-canonical sites by the MTases, two changes were made in the procedure. First, the gene for M. EcoRII was cloned into a high copy number plasmid, pUC118. Cells containing the resulting plasmid, pR400, were found to contain approximately 50 times as much methyltransferase activity as those containing pR300 (Table 7). Because pBR322-based plasmids have 30-50 copies/cell, while pUC-based plasmids have several hundred copies per cell, the level of expression of M. EcoRII may be the result of gene dosage effect. We reasoned that the overproduction of the MTase should result in greater methylation at non-canonical sites and increase the likelihood of its detection by ethidium bromide staining. This plasmid was introduced in cells containing kanS-H94 in pACYC184 (pKanS-H94/ACYC), and the ability of pR400 to methylate at codon 94 of kan was studied."

https://openalex.org/W2125790529,"Human UMP synthase is a bifunctional protein containing two separate catalytic domains, orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.10) and orotidine-5′-phosphate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.23). These studies address the question of why the last two reactions in pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis are catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme in mammalian cells, but by two separate enzymes in microorganisms. From existing data on subunit associations of the respective enzymes and calculations showing the molar concentration of enzyme to be far lower in mammalian cells than in microorganisms, we hypothesize that the covalent union in UMP synthase stabilizes the domains containing the respective catalytic centers. Evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from studies of stability of enzyme activity in vitro, at physiological concentrations, of UMP synthase, the two isolated catalytic domains prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of UMP synthase, and the yeast ODCase. The two engineered domains have activities very similar to the native UMP synthase, but unlike the bifunctional protein, the domains are quite unstable under conditions promoting the dissociated monomer."
https://openalex.org/W2082374612,"The cDNA encoding rat brain cytosolic acyl-CoA thioester hydrolase (ACT) has been cloned and sequenced, and the primary structure of the enzyme has been deduced. A partial amino acid sequence (38 amino acids) of the enzyme was determined using the peptides generated after CNBr digestion of the purified enzyme. Primers synthesized on the basis of this information were used to isolate two cDNA clones, each encoding the full length of the enzyme. The nucleotide sequences of these clones contained an open reading frame encoding a 358-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 39.7 kDa, similar to that determined for the purified enzyme (40.9 kDa). The deduced ACT sequence showed no homology to the known sequences of any other thioesterases nor to any other known protein sequence. However, there was a strong homology to a number of expressed sequence tag human brain cDNA clones. The identity of the ACT cDNA was confirmed by the expression of ACT activity in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. There was a 10-15-fold increase in ACT-specific activity in the bacterial extracts after induction with isopropyl thiogalactoside, and the properties of the expressed enzyme (fusion protein) were the same as those of the purified rat brain ACT. Northern blot analysis showed that a 1.65-kilobase ACT transcript was present in rat brain and testis but not in any other rat tissues examined. However, the ACT mRNA was induced in the liver of rats that were fed Wy-14,643, a peroxisome proliferator and inducer of rodent liver cytosolic acyl-CoA thioesterase. These results indicate that the induced rat liver ACT is homologous to the constitutive rat brain ACT."
https://openalex.org/W1598949250,"Abstract In the present study, the role of the IκBα C terminus in NF-κB/IκBα regulation was examined in NIH 3T3 cells engineered to inducibly express wild type or mutated human IκBα proteins under the control of the tetracycline responsive promoter. Deletion studies demonstrated that the last C-terminal 30 amino acids (amino acids (aa) 288 to aa 317, deleted in IκBαΔ3), including most of the PEST domain, were dispensible for IκBα function. However, deletions from aa 261 to 317 or aa 269 to 317 (IκBαΔ1 and IκBαΔ2 respectively), lacked the ability to dissociate NF-κB/DNA complexes in vitro and were unable to inhibit NF-κB dependent transcription. Moreover, IκBαΔ1 and IκBαΔ2 mutants were resistant to inducer-mediated degradation. Analysis of IκBα deletions in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors revealed that, independently of stimulation, IκBαΔ1 and IκBαΔ2 had a half-life four times shorter than wild type IκBα and the interaction of IκBαΔ1 and IκBαΔ2 with p65 was dramatically decreased in vivo as measured by co-immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, protease inhibitors which block inducer-mediated degradation of IκBα also stabilized the turnover of IκBαΔ1 and IκBαΔ2. Based on these studies, we propose that in the absence of stimulation, the C-terminal domain between aa 269 and 287 may play a role to protect IκBα from a constitutive protease activity."

Electrospray mass spectrometry demonstrates that, with penicillin G as substrate, the rate-limiting step in catalysis is the hydrolysis of the E166Y acyl-enzyme complex. Comparison of the 1.8-Å resolution x-ray structures of the wild-type and of the E166Y mutant enzymes shows that the binding of cephalosporin substrates is improved, in the mutant enzyme, by the enlargement of the substrate binding site. This enlargement is due to the rigid body displacement of 60 residues driven by the movement of the Ω-loop.

Bacterial resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins represents an increasing risk in the chemotherapy of Gram-negative bacterial infections. This resistance often arises from the emergence and the dissemination of the plasmid-encoded extended spectrum β-lactamases (EC 3.5.2.6) (Blazquez et al., 1995; Palzkill et al., 18.Palzkill T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 781-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Most of these proteins are derived from the Escherichia coli TEM enzyme, via the combination of a few point mutations, which have led, so far, to 27 TEM-related enzymes (Morosini et al., 16.Morosini M.I. Canton R. Martinez-Beltran J. Negri M.C. Perez-Diaz J.C. Baquero F. Blazquez J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 458-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parent TEM-1 is a very efficient enzyme and hydrolyzes penicillin substrates through an acylation and a deacylation step (Swarén et al., 1995). Extended spectrum TEM-related enzymes hydrolyze third generation cephalosporin substrates. Based on the kinetic data, two common characteristics of these enzymes are (i) a severalfold reduction in the catalytic turnover toward penicillins, and (ii) an increase in the catalytic efficiency against cephalosporin substrates (Raquet et al., 20.Raquet X.

At the molecular level, it appears that high catalytic efficiencies against the third generation cephalosporin oxyimino-β-lactams, such as cefotaxime and ceftazidime, are primarily linked, in natural TEM mutants, to the mutation of Arg164 (Naumovski et al., 17.Naumovski L. Quinn J.P. Miyashiro D. Patel M. Bush K. Singer S.B. Graves D. Palzkill T. Arvin A.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 1991-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) or to the mutation of Gly238 (Jacoby et al., 13.Jacoby G.A. Madeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 1697-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). In the x-ray structure of the TEM-1 enzyme (Brookhaven DataBank entry 1BTL) (Jelsch et al., 14.Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.-M. Samama J-P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), Arg164 forms two salt bridge interactions. These are important for the conformation and the stability of the Ω-loop region (residues 161-180). Some residues from this loop define the active site topology, while others, such as Glu164, are essential for catalysis. Site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated the requirement for an acidic side chain in position 166 (Delaire et al., 7.Delaire M. Lenfant F. Labia R. Masson J-M. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the involvement of Glu164 in the deacylation reaction (Adachi et al., 1.Adachi H. Ohta T. Matsuzawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3186-3191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the acid-base properties and the position of this proton acceptor group are reflected in the value of the deacylation rate constant (Swarén et al., 1995). Gly238 resides at the C-terminal edge of strand S3, which borders the substrate binding site cavity, and is in van der Waals contact with Asn170 main-chain atoms in the Ω-loop. Detailed kinetic and mass spectrometric investigations on the G238S mutant enzyme demonstrated a significant decrease of the deacylation rate constant, likely related to a perturbation of the deacylation machinery (Saves et al., 22.Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Maveyraud L. Samama J-P. Promé J-C. Masson J-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11660-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The E166Y mutant displays one of the characteristic features of extended spectrum enzymes: similar activities toward penicillin and cephalosporin substrates (Delaire et al., 1991). The high resolution structure of this mutant shows unexpected structural differences compared with the wild-type enzyme. Comparison of the kinetic data of the E166Y, E166Y/R164S, and R164S (Sowek et al., 1991; Raquet et al., 1994) mutant enzymes suggests that these structural differences may play a key role in extending the substrate specificity of the TEM-related enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis, protein expression, and purification was performed as described (Saves et al., 23.Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Swarén P. Lefèvre F. Masson J.-M. Promé J-C. Samama J-P. J.

For site-directed mutagenesis, the following oligonucleotides were used: E166Y, 3′-CTA GCA ACC ATA GGC CTC GAC-5′; and E166Y-R164S, 3′-CAT TGA GCG GAA CTA TCA ACC ATG GGC CTC GAC TTA CTT-5′. electrospray mass spectrometry. electrospray mass spectrometry. The Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters and the elementary rate constants by ESMS were determined as described previously (Saves et al., 1995a, 1995b). A solution of the E166Y mutant enzyme (14.5 mg/ml) in 45 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), containing 7.5% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate solution, was equilibrated, at 6°C, against 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), containing 42% (v/v) saturated ammonium sulfate solution and 4% (v/v) acetone. After equilibration, the surpersaturated medium was seeded with a TEM-1 wild-type microcrystal, and the ammonium sulfate was slowly increased to 47%. At this stage, the acetone was removed by slow evaporation. This procedure was repeated three times using, at each step, a newly formed E166Y crystal for seeding. Typical crystal size was 300 × 300 × 600 μm3. E166Y crystals are isomorphous to wild-type TEM-1 crystals (space group P212121), with cell parameters a = 43.1 Å, b = 64.4 Å, and c = 91.2 Å, and diffract to 1.73-Å resolution. Data were collected from a single crystal on a Siemens/Nicolet area detector, mounted on a four-circle goniostat. Cu-Kα x-rays were generated with a Rigaku rotating anode, operating at 40 kV and 80 mA. The crystal-to-detector distance was 12 cm, and the swing angle was 20°. The crystal was cooled at −4°C during data collection. Data frames of 0.2° oscillation range with exposure time of 60 s were collected. Data were processed with the Xengen package (Howard et al., 12.Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl. Cryst. 1987; 20: 383-387Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar) (Table 1).TABLE 1 All calculations concerning structure factors and electron density maps were done using the CCP4 programs package (Collaborative Computational Project, 6.Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Cryst. 1994; D50: 760-763Crossref Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Electron density maps and protein structures were displayed on an Evans & Sutherland ESV3/30-33 graphic system, using FRODO (Jones, 15.Jones T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 157-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Initial model corrections were manually applied according to (3Fo - 2Fc) and (Fo - Fc) difference Fourier maps computed between 8.0- and 3.0-Å resolution, using calculated structure factors from the refined wild-type structure. The resolution was extended to 2.0 Å in four steps of both simulated annealing with the X-PLOR 2.1 package (Brünger, 1990) (from 3000 to 300 K in 2.7 ps, time step of 0.025 ps) and manual corrections. Individual temperature factors were kept to 10 Å2 in the first two refinement steps and were individually refined at 2.3- and 2.0-Å resolution. Solvent molecules were included as neutral oxygen atoms when they appeared as an electron density peak four standard deviations above the mean value in a (Fo - Fc) difference Fourier map, and at a reasonable distance from polar atoms. A tetrahedral arrangement of four positive electron density peaks was interpreted as a sulfate ion, provided by the crystallization medium, which was also found in the wild-type enzyme structure (Jelsch et al., 1993). Further refinement included cycles of energy minimization, individual temperature factor refinement, solvent occupancy refinement with PROLSQ (Hendrickson and Konnert, 10.Hendrickson W.A. Konnert J.H. Srinivasan R. Biomolecular Structure, Function, Conformation and Evolution. 1. Pergamon Press, Oxford1980: 43-57Google Scholar), and model inspection in (2Fo - Fc) and (Fo - Fc) electron density maps. For the comparison of the E166Y mutant and the wild-type enzyme structures, the C-α positions of residues from strands S1 (residues 43-50), S2 (residues 56-60), and S5 (residues 259-266) of the main β-sheet were chosen to determine the superposition parameters. These strands are identical in both structures and are far from the mutation site. Rotation and translation parameters were then applied to all atoms of the E166Y mutant protein. The root mean square differences are 0.13 Å for main-chain atoms (when the 85-142 and 165-170 regions are excluded from the calculation) and 0.31 and 0.48 Å for the 85-142 and 165-170 main-chain atoms, respectively. Positional differences given in the text for whole side chains and residues are root mean square differences. The final R-factor for all reflections between 8- and 1.8-Å resolution was 0.163. The refined structure contained 194 water molecules and one sulfate ion, and the root mean square atomic positional error was estimated to be 0.14 Å from a σa plot (Read, 21.Read R.J. Acta Cryst. 1986; A42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2037) Google Scholar). The deviations from ideal geometry at the end of the refinement are given in Table 2. As in the wild-type protein structure, Met69 and Leu320 are the only residues found in high energy conformations on a Ramachandran plot.TABLE 2 The overall structure of the E166Y β-lactamase is very similar to the 1.8-Å wild-type enzyme structure (Jelsch et al., 1993). However, the E166Y mutation leads to significant structural differences in two areas: the region 165-170 (WYPELN), which is part of the Ω-loop, and residues 85-142, which move as a rigid body. This region contains helices H3(109-111), H4(119-128), and H5(132-142) and two coil regions (86-108 and 112-118). It is part of the helical domain (residues 62-212) of class A β-lactamases (secondary structure assignment from Jelsch et al.(1993)). The movement of residues 165-170 (Fig. 1A) is directly related to the point mutation at position 166 and is restricted to these residues by the salt bridges Arg164-Glu171 and Arg164-Asp179. In order to accommodate the bulkier phenol group, 166 C-α moves by 0.7 Å from its position in the wild-type structure, away from the protein core. Tyr164 OH is now at hydrogen bond distance (2.9 Å) from Ser70 O-γ compared with the 4.2-Å distance between Glu164 Oε-1 and Ser70 O-γ in the wild-type enzyme. This movement drives the displacement of Trp165 C-α and Pro167 C-α, found at 0.3 and 1.0 Å, respectively, from their positions in TEM-1. Movement of the Trp165 main-chain atoms, without significant modifications of its (φ,ψ) angles, forces the rotation of the indol ring that occupies the same steric volume. The C-α atoms of Glu168 and Leu169 move 0.5 and 0.2 Å, respectively, from their positions in the wild-type structure, but their side-chain conformations are little affected. More important changes occur for Asn170, whose C-α is displaced by 0.5 Å and its side chain by 1 Å. There is no hydrogen bond exchanged between this side-chain amide group and Tyr164 OH, in contrast to the important interaction, formed in the wild-type structure, with the Glu164 carboxylate group. These structural modifications induce minimal effects on the main-chain atoms of Ser70 and Lys73, which are shifted by 0.15 Å. However, Ser70 O-γ and Lys73 N-ξ move by 0.3 and 0.7 Å, respectively, and the amino group is now at hydrogen bond distance to Tyr164 OH (3.0 Å) (Fig. 1A). These structural modifications within the Ω-loop affect the solvatation and the hydrogen bond network within the substrate binding site. Four water molecules are lost, and two water molecules and the sulfate ion are shifted compared with the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 1B). The water molecule Wat297, considered to be the nucleophile group in the deacylation step (Strynadka et al., 25.Strynadka N.C.J. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. John K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N.G. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar; Jelsch et al., 1993, Swarén et al., 1995), is shifted by 1.5 Å but maintains hydrogen bonds to Ser70 nitrogen, Ser70 O-γ, Asn170 side-chain amide group, and Wat391. The 1-Å motion of the sulfate ion has several consequences: (i) it leads to the exclusion of Wat323 from the oxyanion hole, and of Wat404, found in the vicinity of Ser130 main-chain oxygen atom in the wild type structure, (ii) one of its oxygen atoms is now at hydrogen bond distance (2.9 Å) from Ala237 nitrogen, and (iii) it provides more space in the vicinity of the Ser130, Ser235, and Arg244 side chains in the E166Y structure, where a new water molecule (Wat518) is found. All other water molecules occupy nearly the same positions in both structures (Fig. 1B). Solvent molecules that are bound to residues of the Ω-loop move accordingly and preserve their interactions, except for the two water molecules (Wat422 and Wat472) that are expelled by the previously described Asn170 side-chain motion. However, the 1.0-Å displacement of Pro167 generates a cavity that is filled by a new water molecule. The rigid body motion of the region 85-142 is significant when comparing the wild-type and the E166Y structures, solved and refined at 1.8-Å resolution with R-factors of 0.160 and 0.163, respectively. Residues Asn132, Asn136, and Thr140, located at three consecutive turns of helix H5, are in close contact with residues 165 and 166 and are directly affected by the Ω-loop movement (Fig. 1C). Asn132, whose side chain is at van der Waals distance from the side chain of Glu164 in the wild-type structure, is displaced (main chain, 0.3 Å; side chain, 0.5 Å) as a result of the increased steric volume at position 166. Asn136, located one helix turn away, whose amide side-chain atoms form two important hydrogen bonds to the Glu164 main-chain nitrogen and oxygen atoms in the wild-type structure, moves by 0.5 Å in order to preserve these interactions in the E166Y mutant. At the C terminus of helix H5, Thr140 O-γ moves by about 0.6 Å toward Trp165 N-ε, to which it is now hydrogen-bonded (Fig. 1C). At the edges of this moving domain, residues Arg83 and Thr141, at the C termini of helices H2 and H5, respectively, and Glu89 and Arg93, in the connecting loop between helices H2 and H3, are clustered within a 4-Å radius sphere (Fig. 2). The movement of residue 141 induces the reorientation of the Arg83 side chain and the expulsion of Wat380, which was bridging Arg83 Nη-1, Glu89 Oε-1, and Thr141 O-γ in the wild-type structure. In the mutant enzyme, Arg83 Nη-1 is now hydrogen-bonded to the Thr141 main-chain oxygen atom. Electrospray mass spectrometry experiments were used to determine the molecular weight of the E166Y mutant protein and of its molecular com-plexes. This soft ionization technique generates gas phase multicharged ions directly from the solution, and it allows characterization of the covalent intermediates of the reaction (Aplin et al., 2.Aplin R.T. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. Waley S.G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 212-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The E166Y enzyme readily formed an acyl-enzyme intermediate with penicillin G. This complex (measured molecular mass of 29,318 ± 3 Da) was the only enzyme species that could be detected during the steady state of the reaction. Its formation was extremely fast, and no free mutant enzyme could be detected 10 s after the reaction was started, even at 2.5°C. The difference between the molecular mass of this complex and that of the free mutant enzyme is in excellent agreement with the molecular mass of penicillin G (334 Da). The acyl-enzyme concentration was equal to the initial E166Y protein concentration, and the determined k3 value at 37°C (0.36 s-1) is identical to the kcat value measured from steady-state enzyme kinetics. In the mass range of the antibiotic, peaks corresponding to penicillin G and to the penicilloic acid reaction product (18 mass units higher) were followed during the time course of the reaction. After 5 min of reaction time at 37°C, the only molecular species observed by ESMS were the acyl-enzyme complex (Fig. 3A), unreacted substrate, and the reaction product, penicilloic acid (Fig. 3B). When similar experiments were conducted with cephaloridin as substrate, we found that most of the enzyme was present in its free state (data not shown). The acyl-enzyme complex represented less than 10% of the total protein species. Its molecular mass indicated that the only reaction was the β-lactam cycle cleavage upon acyl-enzyme formation and that no elimination of the C-3′ substituent on the dihydrothiazine ring occurred. As previously discussed (Saves et al., 1995a), a precise quantitation cannot be achieved on species amounting to 2-10% of the total ESMS signal. The kinetic data of the E166Y and the E166Y/R164S mutant enzymes are reported in Table 3. The single E166Y mutation led to improved Km values for all substrates compared with the wild-type enzyme. However, compared with the E166Y enzyme, the E166Y/R164S double mutant enzyme discriminates between penicillin substrates (decreased Km values) and cephalosporin substrates (increased Km values). When compared with the wild-type enzyme, mutant proteins bearing the E166Y mutation display highly reduced km values, although they are higher for cephalosporin than for penicillin substrates. These effects in Km and kcat led to modified substrate spectra in both mutant enzymes, a characteristic of extended spectrum TEM-related enzymes, as exemplified by the R164S TEM-1 mutant (Table 3) (Sowek et al., 1991; Raquet et al., 1994). Taken together, these data suggest that the extended substrate spectra of these mutants arise from structural events common to all of these proteins.TABLE 3 The structural modifications observed in the E166Y TEM-1 mutant are of two types. First, the mutation at position 166 induces the optimal short-range effect required to accommodate the larger side chain. Second, it induces an unexpected long range effect, in which a large part of the protein helical domain that bears important residues for catalysis is relocated. The short range effect on the 165-170 Ω-loop region is restricted by the preceding Arg164 and the following Glu171. Their side chains are engaged in two salt bridges that are important for the conformation and the stability of the Ω-loop and for the correct location of residue 166 within the active site. The salt bridge between Arg164 and Asp179 is buried and inaccessible to solvent molecules, which increases the strength of this interaction. Three hydrogen bonds are exchanged between the Asn136 side-chain and Glu164 main-chain atoms and between Thr140 O-γ and Trp165 N-ε. Thus, the movement of the 165-170 region leads to the concerted relocation of Asn132, Asn136, and Thr140 (Fig. 1C). This rigid body motion of the H5 helix drives the displacement of the whole 85-142 region, which represents one-third of the enzyme helical domain (Fig. 4). This movement requires only a few small main-chain dihedral angle rotations and preserves all of the interactions that occur within this protein domain. The 85-142 region bears residues that delineate one side (residues 104-105, 130, 132) of the substrate binding cavity. The active site bottleneck is found between the hydroxyl groups of Ser130 and Ser235, and is precisely the binding site of the thiazolidine ring of penicillins and of the dihydrothiazine ring of cephalosporins (Fig. 4). The distance between Ser130 O-γ and Ser235 O-γ is 5.4 Å in TEM-1 (Jelsch et al., 1993). The movement of residues 85-142 in the E166Y enzyme increases this distance to 6.0 Å. As the KI of cefotaxime, measured by competition procedures, is lowered 1500-fold compared with TEM-1 (Delaire et al., 1991), we suggest that the increased active site aperture favors the better binding of cephalosporins. This is because the dihydrothiazine ring has a larger steric volume than the thiazolidine ring. Mass spectrometry measurements showed that during the steady state, the E166Y acyl-enzyme complex is the sole enzyme species with penicillin G as substrate. This indicates that the acylation rate is larger than the deacylation rate. Indeed, the determined k3 value (0.36 s-1) is 4000-fold smaller than the corresponding wild-type enzyme deacylation rate constant (1500 s-1) (Christensen et al., 5.Christensen H. Martin M.T. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1990; 266: 853-861PubMed Google Scholar). Since residue 166 is chemically involved in the deacylation step, a large decrease in k3 could arise from the different acid-base properties of Tyr compared with Glu as a proton acceptor. Within experimental errors, k3 is identical to the kcat value determined from steady-state kinetic measurements, which prevents calculation of k2. However, examination of the kcat/Km values suggests slower acylation rates with the E166Y mutant enzymes compared with the wild-type enzyme. The role of Lys73 in the acylation reaction was recently described (Swarén et al., 1995). Removal of the negative charge provided by Glu164 significantly decreases the basicity of the unprotonated Lys73 in the E166Y Michaelis complex, in line with the decrease of k2 suggested by the steady-state kinetic data (detailed electrostatic calculations will be presented elsewhere). ESMS experiments using cephaloridin showed that there is no elimination of the C-3′ substituent of the substrate forming the acyl-enzyme complex. Thus, the lower Km values with the E166Y mutant protein for cephalosporin substrates do not arise from a change in the rate-limiting step resulting from a different kinetic pathway, as was shown to occur with the PC1 enzyme (Faraci and Pratt, 8.Faraci W.S. Pratt R.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 903-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 1986). The rate-limiting step for cephalosporin hydrolysis by the wild-type enzyme is acylation (Saves et al., 1995a). A similar conclusion could be drawn for the E166Y mutant, as ESMS shows that more than 90% of the protein is found as free enzyme during the course of the reaction. However, the detection of a small amount of acyl-enzyme complex would suggest that the k2 and k3 values are of similar magnitude. The crystallographic refinement parameters indicate that the atomic positions in both structures have very little mobility, suggesting that both protein structures are representative of locked conformational states. In both enzymes, the Ω-loop conformation is severely constrained by the identical salt bridge interactions exchanged by Arg164. The features of the x-ray structures provided the basis for comparing the kinetic data of the three mutant proteins: E166Y, E166Y/R164S, and R164S (Sowek et al., 1991; Raquet et al., 1994). They were examined with special emphasis on the Ω-loop conformation and flexibility, assigning a main role to residue 164. In the TEM-1 enzyme, the R164X (except for lysine) mutation, by removing two out of the four salt bridges of the Ω-loop, will release some, but not all, of its conformational constraints. This will likely affect the relative positions of the partners involved in the deacylation step. A slight displacement of the Ω-loop residue Glu164 will decrease the deacylation rate of good TEM-1 substrates. Indeed, this rate is related both to the direction of the electrostatic potential gradient between the Glu164 carboxylate and the ester carbonyl carbon of the acyl-enzyme complex, and to its magnitude, which is very sensitive to atomic positional differences (Swarén et al., 1995). The reduction in kcat is of 10-50-fold in the TEM-related enzymes bearing the Arg164 mutation (R164S, R164H, R164S/E104K, and R164S/E240K) but is only marginally affected in the E104K and E240K single mutants (Sowek et al., 1991, Raquet et al., 1994, Petit et al., 19.Petit A. Maveyraud L. Lenfant F. Samama J-P. Labia R. Masson J-M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This proposal is consistent with the situation observed in the PC1 β-lactamase, where a single salt bridge (Arg164-Asp179) stabilizes the Ω-loop conformation. The substantial disorder of the loop resulting from the D179N mutation (Herzberg et al., 11.Herzberg O. Kapadia G. Blanco B. Smith T.S. Coulson A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9503-9509Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), led in that case to a 600-fold decrease in the kcat value for penicillin G. The movement of the 85-142 region, in the E166Y mutant enzyme structure, explains why binding is improved for cephalosporin substrates compared with the wild-type enzyme. A similar movement of the 85-142 region can be assumed to occur in the E166Y/R164S mutant protein. Interestingly, the additional R164S mutation in the E166Y enzyme has no effect with respect to the substrate spectrum (kcat/Km) for cephalosporin substrates, whereas the single R164S mutation in TEM-1 led to major kinetic differences. This paradox is explained if one assumes that the R164S mutation allows structural perturbations similar to those observed, and already achieved, in the E166Y protein. It explains why the additional R164S mutation in the E166Y enzyme is kinetically silent and offers a structural explanation of the consequences of the Arg164 mutation in the wild-type enzyme. We propose that the conformational constraints of the Ω-loop, partly controlled by residue 164, and the position of the 85-142 region are interdependent in the TEM-1 enzyme. However, in the R164X TEM-1 enzymes, this structural link would only be kinetically discernible when large substituents on the substrate molecule reach the Ω-loop residues, as is the case with third generation cephalosporin substrates (Raquet et al., 1994). The release of short contacts, achieved by the Ω-loop movement that drives the 85-142 region, accounts for the kinetic effects that are consistently found in extended spectrum TEM-related enzymes bearing the Arg164 mutation. First, the improvement of the binding of large cephalosporin substrates (i.e. ceftazidime) should increase the catalytic efficiencies for such molecules relative to penicillin substrates. kcat/Km are, indeed, 1-3 orders of magnitude larger in the R164S mutant than in the wild-type enzyme (Table 3). Second, the large kcat/Km differences found in TEM-1 within the cephalosporin substrates should level out in the R164X mutant enzymes. Indeed, the kcat/Km of cefaloridin versus ceftazidime is decreased from 3 × 104 in the TEM-1 enzyme to 33 in the R164S mutant enzyme. This property is fulfilled in all TEM mutant proteins bearing the R164X mutation (Sowek et al., 1991; Raquet et al., 1994). Mutations that occur in the vicinity of the Ω-loop residues, such as G238S, were shown to drastically reduce the deacylation rate constant (Saves et al., 1995a). Natural mutants in this position also display extended substrate spectra, and work is in progress that will further illustrate the involvement of the Ω-loop region in the molecular evolution of the TEM-1 β-lactamase. We are grateful to Martin Welch for a critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1974059031,"The yellow eye lenses of the diurnal gecko Lygodactylus picturatus contain, in addition to the usual crystallins, a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 16 kDa. It comprises 6-8% of the total water-soluble lens proteins. We here identify it as a novel type of crystallin, most closely related with cellular retinol-binding protein I (CRBP I). Because of its tiny size, we designate it as ι-crystallin. The typical endogenous ligand of CRBP is all-trans-retinol. In the gecko lens, however, the ligand of ι-crystallin turns out to be 3-dehydroretinol (vitamin A2), which causes the yellow color of this lens. The ι-crystallin•3-dehydroretinol complex absorbs shortwave radiation, supposedly improving the optical quality of the dioptric apparatus and protecting the retina against ultraviolet damage. Whereas other crystallins have been recruited from stress proteins and metabolic enzymes, ι-crystallin represents a completely new class of taxon-specific lens proteins. Also, its ligand 3-dehydroretinol represents a novel type of lens pigment."
https://openalex.org/W2025984343,"The Rous sarcoma virus protease displays a high degree of specificity and catalyzes the cleavage of only a limited number of amino acid sequences. This specificity is governed by interactions between side chains of eight substrate amino acids and eight corresponding subsite pockets within the homodimeric enzyme. We have examined these complex interactions in order to learn how to introduce changes into the retroviral protease (PR) that direct it to cleave new substrates. Mutant enzymes with altered substrate specificity and wild-type or greater catalytic rates have been constructed previously by substituting single key amino acids in each of the eight enzyme subsites with those residues found in structurally related positions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 PR. These individual amino acid substitutions have now been combined into one enzyme, resulting in a highly active mutant Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) protease that displays many characteristics associated with the HIV-1 enzyme. The hybrid protease is capable of catalyzing the cleavage of a set of HIV-1 viral polyprotein substrates that are not recognized by the wild-type RSV enzyme. Additionally, the modified PR is inhibited completely by the HIV-1 PR-specific inhibitor KNI-272 at concentrations where wild-type RSV PR is unaffected. These results indicate that the major determinants that dictate RSV and HIV-1 PR substrate specificity have been identified. Since the viral protease is a homodimer, the rational design of enzymes with altered specificity also requires a thorough understanding of the importance of enzyme symmetry in substrate selection.

This necessitates identification of key amino acids that determine substrate specificity. To identify these critical residues, we have exploited differences in structure and specificity between the related proteases from Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and HIV-1. Although these two enzymes share a 30% amino acid identity and common overall topology(1.Jaskolski M. Miller M. Rao J.K.M. Leis J. Wlodawer A.

HIV-1 protease catalyzes the cleavage not only of its own Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein sequences but also those of the native RSV protease (PR) substrates(3.Cameron C. Grinde B. Jacques P. Jentoft J.

In contrast, RSV PR has a more limited substrate range, cleaving its own, but not HIV-1 PR, polyprotein sequences. To gain insight into the basis for these differences, we identified protease residues located within 10 Å of a bound substrate positioned by analogy to x-ray crystal structures of HIV-1 PR-inhibitor complexes(5.Grinde B.

Alignment of the two enzyme structures revealed that many amino acid residues in the RSV substrate binding pockets are identical to those in the structurally equivalent positions of HIV-1 protease. However, a small number of structurally equivalent residues differ between the two proteins (Fig. 1). We hypothesized that these amino acid differences contribute to the difference in substrate preference between RSV and HIV-1 proteases. To test this idea, a number of RSV protease mutants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis that replaced one or two of these RSV residues with the structurally equivalent HIV-1 residues (3.Cameron C.

Many of these constructs were active and displayed partially altered specificity for substrate selection at one or two of the eight enzyme subsites. Consistent with this result, Sedlacek et al.(7.Sedlacek J. Fabry M. Coward J. Horejsi M. Strop P. Luftig R. Virology. 1993; 192: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) also showed that some of these changes allow for partial HIV-1-like specificity with modified peptide substrates. Recently, several of these residues have been shown to be substituted in viral mutants that arise during the development of drug resistance to HIV-1 protease inhibitors in clinical trials with AIDS patients(8.Condra J.

However, it became clear that because subsites were acting somewhat independently in substrate selection, multiple amino acid substitutions would be required to affect a complete change in enzyme specificity. In this report, multiple amino acid changes in enzyme subsites have been combined into one construct and shown to impart substantial HIV-1-like behavior upon the RSV PR.

In each case, the standard error for all experiments did not exceed 20% of the value reported. Kinetic constants were determined using the assay described above. Initial rate data from substrate saturation curves were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the NFIT program(5.Grinde B. Cameron C. Leis J. Weber I. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9481-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Correlation coefficients of the fit were greater than 0.98, and the standard deviation of the constants reported was <20%. Peptide substrates 9-12 amino acids in length were synthesized, based on cleavage sites in Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors from RSV and HIV-1. These peptides include the 8 amino acids, P4-P4′, required for efficient and specific cleavage by the retroviral protease. These residues interact with a unique array of amino acids in the protease which form the S4-S4′ subsites of the substrate binding pocket. Peptides were synthesized with an amino-terminal proline residue to prevent uncleaved substrate from reacting with fluorescamine. Peptides were solubilized in 1 mM dithioerythritol, and their concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid composition analysis. The PR I42D,I44V was constructed by our previously published mutagenesis procedure(4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, oligodeoxynucleotide 5′- GACTCTGGAGCGGACACCGTCATATCAGAGGAGGAT-3′ was annealed to PvuI linearized PR I44V and BglII/AccI gapped PR. PR I42D,I44V clones were screened for the presence of a new AspI site. PR I42D,I44V,M73V,A100L was constructed by ligating a dephosphorylated 2.6-kb EcoRI/AccI fragment from PR I42D,I44V to a 0.6-kb EcoI/AccI fragment from PR M73V, A100L(4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones were screened by digestion with AspI (I42D,I44V), SfuI (M73V), and SpeI (A100L). Finally, PR I42D,I44V,M73V,A100L, V104T,R105P,G106V, S107N was constructed by a three-way ligation with a 2.3-kb BglII/BssHII fragment from PR, a 0.6-kb BglII/AluI fragment from PR I42D,I44V, and a 0.3-kb AluI/BssHII fragment from PR V104T,R105P, G106V,S107N(4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones were screened for the presence of an AspI site (I42D,I44V), SfuI and SpeI sites (M73V,A100L), and an AgeI site (V104T,R105P,G106V,S107N). The protease gene from the above construct was also amplified using PCR with an upstream primer that included a BamHI site followed by a nucleotide sequence coding for a bovine factor Xa cleavage site. The downstream primer included a HindIII site at the carboxyl end of the protease sequence. This product was then cloned into the expression plasmid p6HRT (S. F. J. LeGrice, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH) between the BamHI and HindIII sites and replaced the HIV reverse transcriptase gene with the mutant RSV protease gene. The S38T mutation was then added to this construct using standard PCR mutagenesis procedures(4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. The final RSV(S9) has the following substitutions: PR S38T, I42D, I44V, M73V, A100L, V104T, R105P, G106V, and S107N. The I42D,I44V mutations were also introduced into the upstream or amino-terminal subunit of the dimer by ligating together the 220-base pair StuI-EcoRI fragment from the wild-type RSV covalently linked PRGGGGPR expression plasmid, the 2599-base pair EcoRI-AccI fragment from the I42D,I44V monomer expression plasmid, and the 820-base pair StuI-AccI fragment from the linked dimer expression plasmid. The I42D,I44V mutation was introduced into the downstream subunit by using PCR techniques to amplify the entire I42D,I44V gene from the monomer expression plasmid. The upstream oligodeoxynucleotide for amplification contained a StuI restriction site (5′-CCCGGCGGCGGAGGCCTAGCGATGACAATGGAACATAAAGAT-3′). The downstream oligodeoxynucleotide annealed at position 700 on the monomer expression plasmid (5′-AGCTGTGACCGTCTC-3′). This PCR amplified product was digested with BssHII and StuI and ligated into the wild-type linked-dimer plasmid between the BssHII and StuI sites. AMV protease was purified directly from virus particles as described previously(10.Alexander F. Leis J. Soltis D. Crowl R. Danho W. Poonian M. Pan Y. Skalka A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 534-542Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intact AMV was obtained from Molecular Genetic Resources (Tampa, FL). HIV-1 protease was expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded from the inclusion body fraction as described previously (11.Ridky T.W. Cameron C.E. Cameron J. Leis J. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Weber I. Harrison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4709-4717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed RSV wild-type and mutant linked-dimer, as well as the I42D,I44V nonlinked homodimer proteases, were prepared from E. coli MC1061 transformed with the temperature-sensitive λ-cI repressor plasmid, pRK248cIts, as described previously(12.Bizub D. Weber I. Cameron C. Leis J. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RSV wild-type and RSV(S9) histidine-tagged proteases were expressed in E. coli M15 pDM1.1. Cells were grown at 30°C in 4 liters of YT media, pH 7.5, to A600 = 0.6. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.5 mM and protein induced in cells for 2.5 h. Bacterial cells were pelleted, washed in 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, and suspended in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.3. Cells were lysed by addition of lysozyme to 67 μg/ml and viscosity was reduced by incubation with DNase I to 33 μg/ml in the presence of 4 mM MgCl2 at room temperature for 30 min. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the clarified supernatant was passed over a 1-ml Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) column equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.3, and washed with 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.3, 30 mM imidazole, 10% glycerol. Protease was then eluted with 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.3, 250 mM imidazole. Imidazole was removed by dialysis against 2 liters of 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.3, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol at 4°C overnight. The histidine tag was removed from the fusion protein by treatment with 100 μg of bovine factor Xa (Hematological Technologies, Essex Junction, VT) in 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.3, 0.1 M NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2. Cleavage was monitored by separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE and was usually complete after 6-h incubation at room temperature. At this point the RSV protease was maximally active and possessed the native sequence at its amino terminus. The native PR was purified by passing the digested enzyme preparation through a fresh Ni-NTA column, equilibrated with 10 mM HEPES, pH 8.3. The cleaved PR now eluted from the affinity resin with 30 mM imidazole. This eluted protease was contaminated with factor Xa, which was subsequently removed by treatment with immobilized benzamidine (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Alternatively, biotinylated Factor Xa (Boehringer Mannheim) was removed with immobilized streptavidin. The final yield of active purified PR is about 2 mg. The RSV protease is greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). Note that viral AMV and bacterially expressed RSV protease differ in primary structure by only two amino acids and are biochemically indistinguishable. We sought to develop a method of purifying active bacterially expressed RSV PR that could be used for substrate specificity and structural studies. The earlier method of purifying PR from inclusion bodies yielded pure enzyme, but had a relatively low specific activity. While this activity was sufficient for specificity studies, these preparations did not crystallize. To avoid denaturation and refolding of PR, we developed a method to purify recombinant PR from the soluble fraction of bacterial cell extracts. A polyhistidine sequence was added to the amino terminus of the PR to allow for efficient and rapid purification of enzyme (Fig. 2, lane 2). The specific activity of the histidine-tagged fusion PR was 5% that of AMV PR isolated directly from virions. However, when the polyhistidine sequence was removed by treatment with factor Xa (Fig. 2, lane 4), leaving the native NH2-terminal sequence, active RSV protease was obtained with a specific activity 75-100% that of the enzyme purified from virus. Factor Xa was removed from the PR preparation by affinity chromatography using immobilized benzamidine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The resultant protein is greater than 95% pure as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, lane 5). One contaminating protein band was detected that migrates slower than PR; it may have resulted from limited cleavage of PR at an alternate internal factor Xa site or could represent a bacterial protein. The presence of this band does not affect protease activity, and these preparations are of a sufficient purity to form crystals suitable for structural studies. A second construct was made which expresses an altered RSV PR, referred to as RSV PR(S9). This PR has nine substituted residues, including S38T, I42D, I44V, M73V, A100L, V104T, R105P, G106V, and S107N. The RSV(S9) PR was expressed, purified from the soluble fraction, and activated as described for the wild type PR. We have combined nine mutations into the RSV PR gene that introduce specific amino acid substitutions into the substrate binding pocket. The position of these residues relative to the RSV NC-PR peptide substrate is shown in Fig. 3. The S38T substitution was added to the PR, since we have confirmed that this mutation, by itself, increased the rate of catalytic activity of PR about 2-fold. When combined into a single enzyme, these multiple substitutions allow the protease to cleave four HIV-1 peptide substrates at initial rates more than 100-fold greater than wild-type RSV PR. Steady state kinetic data obtained from substrate saturation curves show that the RSV(S9) protease has Km values determined with the HIV-1 PR substrates that are 2-8-fold higher than the corresponding values for HIV-1 PR. The Km values for HIV-1 PR ranged from 30 to 100 μM, while those for RSV(S9) PR ranged between 111 and 366 μM for the same substrates (Table 1). Note that the Km values for AMV PR on the HIV-1 PR substrates could not be measured, because these peptides are not cleaved to any significant extent. Sites of cleavage were established by NH2-terminal amino acid analysis of the product peptides ((4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown). The overall catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) of RSV(S9) PR are 1.1-4.9-fold lower than those determined with the HIV-1 PR. However, substrates that are cleaved most efficiently by HIV-1 protease are also those that are cleaved most efficiently by the RSV(S9) mutant. With the RSV NC-PR reference substrate, the RSV PR(S9) enzyme resembles the HIV-1 PR more than the parental RSV enzyme. Its specific activity on this substrate is approximately 2.5 times greater than the wild-type enzyme. Its overall catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) is about 10 times higher due primarily to a sharp decrease in the Km for the NC-PR substrate. These results demonstrate that the modest specificity changes introduced by each of the single mutations can be combined to produce a highly active enzyme with a significantly altered substrate preference. Furthermore, by combining all nine amino acid substitutions into one enzyme, cleavage of the HIV-1 RT-IN, CA-NCa, and NC-p6a substrates was considerably greater than that observed with enzymes containing the same mutations as either single or double substitutions(4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is to be expected, as many of these residues contribute to more than one enzyme subsite and all have to be changed in order to affect a complete change in specificity.TABLE 1TABLE 1 There are two additional indicators that the RSV(S9) PR has substantial HIV-1 PR character. First, it is inhibited effectively by the previously described nanomolar HIV-1 PR inhibitor, KNI-272(14.Gulnik S.V. Suvorov L. Liu B. Yu B. Anderson B. Mitsuya H. Erickson J.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9282-9287Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). At inhibitor concentrations which completely block activity of both HIV-1 PR and RSV(S9) PR, wild-type AMV PR is unaffected (Fig. 4). Second, the salt dependence of RSV(S9) PR is closer to that observed with HIV-1 PR than that with RSV PR (Fig. 5). For instance, in the presence of 1 M NaCl, HIV-1 PR has 100%, RSV(S9) PR has greater than 60%, and the AMV PR has less than 20% of their respective maximal activities with the NC-PR peptide substrate.Figure 5:Effect of salt on the activity of AMV, RSV(S9), and HIV-1 PRs. PR activity was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 4, except that the amount of the NaCl in the assay was varied as indicated. □, HIV-1 PR; ▴, RSV(S9) PR; ○,AMV PR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) While RSV(S9) PR displays substantial HIV-1 PR-like substrate specificity and kinetics, complete conversion to HIV-1 PR specificity has not been reached. This is seen by differences in activity between HIV-1 and RSV(S9) proteases with HIV-1 substrates (kcat/Km values in Table 1), differences in effectiveness of the KNI-272 inhibitor (Fig. 4), and salt dependence for activity (Fig. 5). One of several possible reasons for this is that the nine amino acids substituted into the RSV PR influence substrate amino acid selection primarily in six of the eight enzyme subsites, S3 to S3′. These substitutions have limited influence on substrate selection in the S4 and S4′ subsites. An additional mutation that deletes RSV PR residues 61-63, at the base of the enzyme flaps, alters preference for amino acids interacting with the S4 and S4′ subsites to resemble that of HIV-1 PR(4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These residues are unique to the RSV enzyme, which has larger flaps than the HIV-1 PR. Unfortunately, when this deletion was combined with other RSV PR mutations, it produced an inactive enzyme. It seems likely that the removal of these residues caused a conformational change which was not tolerated in the context of the other mutations. Additional changes in the RSV(S9) PR will probably have to be made in order to accommodate the S4 and S4′ deletions. Analysis of RSV(S9) PR activities provides some insight into protease substrate recognition. One can explain the varied steady state kinetic data with different HIV-1 substrates in Table 1 by the fact that the peptide substrates each have markedly different amino acid sequences, and the (S9) mutations do not affect cleavage at each site equally. Thus, strong interactions between the enzyme and the CA-NCb, CA-NCa, and NC-p6a substrates may depend not only on differences in the S3 to S3′ subsites, but also on the S4 and S4′ subsites that were not altered in the RSV PR(S9). In contrast, RT-IN and inhibitor KNI-272 interactions do not seem to depend on changes in the S4 and S4′ subsites. The active retroviral PR is a homodimer. Therefore, each of the amino acid substitutions that has been shown to influence selection has been, in effect, a double substitution that alters specificity of at least two subsites formed by the two subunits on opposite sides of the enzyme. In order to examine the effect of substitutions in individual subunits, a catalytically active protease dimer covalently linked by four glycine residues between the carboxyl terminus of one subunit and the amino terminus of the second subunit was prepared as described previously(12.Bizub D. Weber I. Cameron C. Leis J. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4951-4958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This construct was then used to introduce the double substitution, I42D,I44V, into the separate PR subunits designated N or C for NH2-terminal half or COOH-terminal half as depicted in Fig. 6, A-D. These substitutions were chosen because they confer a change in specificity for substrate amino acids at the S2 and S2′ subsites. A homodimeric, noncovalently linked enzyme with the same amino acid substitutions in both subunits is capable of cleaving efficiently RSV NC-PR peptide substrates containing Leu substituted for either P2 Val or P2′ Ala, whereas the wild-type enzyme cleaves these substrates poorly (Fig. 7). The I42D,I44V(N) mutation introduces the appropriate changes into the coding sequences of the upstream subunit in the plasmid that expresses the linked-dimer. As expected, the resultant enzyme is capable of cleaving the NC-PR peptide substrate with the large Leu in P2 (Fig. 7), because the corresponding S2 subsite is made larger by the mutations. Additionally, the I42D,I44V(N) dimer also cleaves a peptide with Leu at the P2′ position efficiently. These results suggest that a subsite containing a single mutation can accommodate either the P2 or the P2′ amino acids allowing for the cleavage of a substrate bound in two different orientations, as depicted in Fig. 6, A-D. To verify that the enzyme is functionally symmetric, the same I42D,I44V substitutions were introduced into the carboxyl-terminal half of the linked-dimer. The enzyme produced from this clone also cleaves both the P2 Leu and the P2′ Leu-modified substrates with efficiencies equal to those seen with the I42D,I44V(N) mutant (Fig. 7). In contrast, a substrate that includes Leu in both the P2 and P2′ positions is cleaved efficiently only by the noncovalently linked PR that contains the 42 and 44 substitutions in both S2 and S2′ simultaneously. Taken together, these results indicate that the RSV protease homodimer is symmetric when not bound to a substrate and that each enzyme subunit is capable of binding equally to either half of an asymmetric substrate. This is consistent with structural data which show that substrate-based inhibitors can occur in two different conformations when bound to the HIV-1 PR (13.Fitzgerald P. McKeever B. VanMiddlesworth J.

Chem. 1991; 265: 14209-14219Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar).Figure 7:Effects of S2 subsite substitutions in different subunits of the PR dimer on cleavage of NC-PR substrates with amino acid substitutions in the P2 and/or P2′ positions. Changes in protease substrate preference caused by substitutions in the S2 enzyme subsite in either one or both subunits was determined. Enzyme activity was measured using a RSV NC-PR peptide substrate with Leu substituted in P2 (PPALS-LAMTMRR) (gray boxes), in P2′ (PPAVS-LLMTMRR) (black boxes), or in both P2 and P2′ (PPALS-LLAMTMRR) (white boxes). Activity is expressed as a percentage relative to the initial rate of cleavage of the wild-type NC-PR peptide substrate and was measured using the fluorescamine assay(4.Cameron C. Ridky T. Shulenin S. Leis J. Weber I. Copeland T. Wlodawer A. Burstein H. Bizub-Bender D. Skalka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11170-11177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PRGGGGPR is a wild-type RSV PR that has the two subunits of the homodimer linked with four Gly residues. RSV PR (I42D,I44V) is a noncovalently linked protease homodimer with substitutions in the S2 and S2′ subsites. RSV PRGGGGGPR (I42D,I44V(N)) and RSV PRGGGGGPR (I42D,I44V (C)) are covalently linked homodimers with asymmetric substitutions in either the amino or carboxyl subunits as indicated by the N and C, respectively. The activity data are summarized in Fig. 6, A-D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results presented here demonstrate that amino acids can be substituted at key residues in most of the enzyme subsites that alter RSV PR specificity. The present construct combined nine separate amino acid substitutions and produced an RSV PR that cleaves peptide substrates representing HIV-1 gag and pol gene cleavage sites. Furthermore, by using a covalently linked PR dimer, we have demonstrated that key amino acid residues can be changed in separate subunits to produce an asymmetrically substituted enzyme. This strategy can be used to create a PR, targeted to a new protein sequence, in which each enzyme subunit is custom designed to bind efficiently to one-half of the new substrate sequence. The resulting enzyme will prefer one substrate orientation over the reverse orientation. Finally, examination of structural differences between similar yet catalytically unique enzymes has advanced our understanding in a way that would not have been possible if each had been examined individually. This general approach can be extended to many other protein families to identify key enzyme residues that mediate specific protein-substrate and protein-protein interactions. We thank C.

https://openalex.org/W2123374733,"Abstract The direction of electron flow through nitrogenase is generally believed to be from the Fe protein to the P-clusters to the FeMo cofactor and then to substrate. In order to examine oxidation states of the P-clusters that might be involved in this pathway, we have constructed a form of the MoFe protein that contains a species called the MoFe cluster (Gavini, N., Ma, L., Watt, G., and Burgess, B. K.(1995) Biochemistry 33, 11842-11849) in place of FeMo cofactor. This MoFe cluster-containing protein was purified, and the presence of the cluster was confirmed by reisolation of the MoFe cluster followed by EPR spectroscopy. The protein does not reduce protons or acetylene, however, upon the addition of the Fe protein and MgATP, MgATP hydrolysis occurs at a rate 28% of the wild-type protein. As isolated in the presence of excess dithionite the MoFe cluster-containing protein is EPR silent. Upon addition of the Fe protein and MgATP a g = 1.94 EPR signal develops that integrates to about 1 spin per P-cluster. This signal only develops when both the Fe protein and MgATP are added and it arises from the P-clusters."

Finally, circular dichroism spectroscopy showed no salt-dependent changes to suggest conformational alterations that might correlate with mobility changes on high pressure liquid chromatography. We conclude therefore that Tac is monomeric under physiologic conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1858428185,"Porcine intestinal heparin was extensively digested with Flavobacterium heparinase and size-fractionated by gel chromatography. Subfractionation of the hexasaccharide fraction by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography yielded 10 fractions. Six contained oligosaccharides derived from the repeating disaccharide region, whereas four contained glycoserines from the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region. The latter structures were reported recently (Sugahara, K., Tsuda, H., Yoshida, K., Yamada, S., de Beer, T., and Vliegenthart, J. F. G.(42.Sugahara K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Yamada S. de Beer T.

In this study, the structures of one tetra- and five hexasaccharides from the repeat region were determined by chemical and enzymatic analyses as well as 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The tetrasaccharide has the hexasulfated structure typical of heparin. The five hexa- or heptasulfated hexasaccharides share the common core pentasulfated structure ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4IdoAα/GlcAβ1-4GlcN(6S)α1-4GlcAβ1- 4GlcN(NS) with one or two additional sulfate groups (ΔHexA, GlcN, IdoA, and GlcA represent 4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid, D-glucosamine, L-iduronic acid, and D-glucuronic acid, whereas 2S, 6S, and NS stand for 2-O-, 6-O-, and 2-N-sulfate, respectively). Three components have the following hitherto unreported structures: ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4GlcAβ1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4GlcAβ1-4GlcN(NS,6S), ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4IdoAα1-4GlcNAc(6S)α1-4GlcAβ1-4GlcN(NS,3S), and ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4IdoA(2S)α1-4GlcNAc(6S)α1-4GlcAβ1- 4GlcN(NS,6S). Two of the five hexasaccharides are structural variants derived from the antithrombin III-binding sites containing 3-O-sulfated GlcN at the reducing termini with or without a 6-O-sulfate group on the reducing N,3-disulfated GlcN residue. Another contains the structure identical to that of the above heptasulfated antithrombin III-binding site fragment but lacks the 3-O-sulfate group and therefore is a pro-form for the binding site. Another has an extra sulfate group on the internal IdoA residue of this pro-form and therefore can be considered to have diverged from the binding site in the biosynthetic pathway. Thus, the isolated hexasaccharides in this study include the three overlapping pairs of structural variants with an apparent biosynthetic precursor-product relationship, which may reflect biosynthetic regulatory mechanisms of the binding site. Porcine intestinal heparin was extensively digested with Flavobacterium heparinase and size-fractionated by gel chromatography. Subfractionation of the hexasaccharide fraction by anion exchange high pressure liquid chromatography yielded 10 fractions. Six contained oligosaccharides derived from the repeating disaccharide region, whereas four contained glycoserines from the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region. The latter structures were reported recently (Sugahara, K., Tsuda, H., Yoshida, K., Yamada, S., de Beer, T., and Vliegenthart, J. F. G.(42.Sugahara K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Yamada S. de Beer T.

In this study, the structures of one tetra- and five hexasaccharides from the repeat region were determined by chemical and enzymatic analyses as well as 500-MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy. The tetrasaccharide has the hexasulfated structure typical of heparin. The five hexa- or heptasulfated hexasaccharides share the common core pentasulfated structure ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4IdoAα/GlcAβ1-4GlcN(6S)α1-4GlcAβ1- 4GlcN(NS) with one or two additional sulfate groups (ΔHexA, GlcN, IdoA, and GlcA represent 4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid, D-glucosamine, L-iduronic acid, and D-glucuronic acid, whereas 2S, 6S, and NS stand for 2-O-, 6-O-, and 2-N-sulfate, respectively). Three components have the following hitherto unreported structures: ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4GlcAβ1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4GlcAβ1-4GlcN(NS,6S), ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4IdoAα1-4GlcNAc(6S)α1-4GlcAβ1-4GlcN(NS,3S), and ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4IdoA(2S)α1-4GlcNAc(6S)α1-4GlcAβ1- 4GlcN(NS,6S). Two of the five hexasaccharides are structural variants derived from the antithrombin III-binding sites containing 3-O-sulfated GlcN at the reducing termini with or without a 6-O-sulfate group on the reducing N,3-disulfated GlcN residue. Another contains the structure identical to that of the above heptasulfated antithrombin III-binding site fragment but lacks the 3-O-sulfate group and therefore is a pro-form for the binding site.

Thus, the isolated hexasaccharides in this study include the three overlapping pairs of structural variants with an apparent biosynthetic precursor-product relationship, which may reflect biosynthetic regulatory mechanisms of the binding site. Heparin is a highly sulfated, linear polysaccharide that has various biological activities such as inhibition of blood coagulation (Marcum and Rosenberg, 1.Bârzu T. Lormeau J.-C. Petitou M.

The basic polymeric structure of heparin is an alternating repeat sequence of the disaccharide units →4IdoAα/GlcAβ1→4GlcNα1→, which can be variably sulfated (for reviews see Rodén(35.Rod é n L. Lennarz W.J. The Biochemistry of Glycoproteins and Proteoglycans. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1980: 267-371Crossref Google Scholar), Gallagher and Lyon(8.Gallagher J.T. Lyon M. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 135-158Google Scholar), and Lindahl(19.Lindahl U. Lane D.A. Lindahl U. Heparin. Edward Arnold, London1989: 159-189Google Scholar)). It is synthesized on a serine residue of a protein core named “serglycin” through a specific structure, the so-called carbohydrate-protein linkage region: GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser (Lindahl and Rodén, 20.Lindahl U. Rodén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2821-2826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the principal structure of the repeating disaccharide region, known as the regular region (Casu, 4.Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), is composed of the major trisulfated disaccharide unit, →4IdoA(2-sulfate)α1→4GlcN(N,6-disulfate)α1→, undersulfation and substantial structural variability are observed in the irregular region, which is distributed along the chain flanked by the regular region and accounts for approximately one quarter of the heparin polysaccharide chain. The structural variability is often the basis of a wide variety of domain structures with a number of biological activities ascribed to heparin. Recent structural studies of the binding domains to ATIII (For review see Lindahl(1989)) and basic fibroblast growth factor (Maccarana et al., 26.Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) are the best known examples showing the relationships between the complicated fine structures and biological functions. The ATIII-binding site requires a minimal pentasaccharide sequence uniquely 3-O-sulfated on the central GlcN residue. This specific pentasaccharide has been shown to be primarily responsible for the anticoagulant activity of heparin (Lindahl et al., 21.Lindahl U. Bäckström G. Thunberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9826-9830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that the binding domain to basic fibroblast growth factor requires a 2-O-sulfated IdoA residue and N-sulfated GlcN residue(s) for its specific interaction with the growth factor. Some structural variability has been observed within both binding sequences (Lindahl et al., 22.Lindahl U. Thunberg L. Bäckström G. Riesenfeld J. Nordling K. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12368-12376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar; Yamada et al., 1993; Maccarana et al., 1993). We have been studying the basic primary structure of heparin to clarify the structural basis of its various biological activities. Previously, we demonstrated its structural variability by isolating six glycoserines from the carbohydrate-protein linkage region (Sugahara et al., 40.Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1528-1533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 1995) and a number of tetrasaccharides from the repeating disaccharide region of porcine intestinal heparin after extensive digestion with bacterial heparin lyases (Yamada et al., 41.Sugahara K. Tohno-oka R. Yamada S. Khoo K.-H. Morris H.R. Dell A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42.Sugahara K. Tsuda H. Yoshida K. Yamada S. de Beer T.

Science. 1983; 222: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated and characterized five hexasaccharide structures from the repeating disaccharide region of the same heparin preparation after extensive enzymatic digestion to investigate the structure beyond the above tetrasaccharide sequences. These included three hitherto unreported hexasaccharide structures and structural variants with an apparent biosynthetic precursor-product relationship for the ATIII-binding site. Materials-Stage 14 heparin was purchased from American Diagnostica (New York, NY) and purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography as reported previously (Sugahara et al., 1992). Heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) and purified heparitinases I (EC 4.2.2.8) and II (no EC number) were obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). Δ4,5-Glycuronate-2-sulfatase (EC 3.1.6.-), abbreviated as 2-sulfatase, and heparitinase V (no EC number) were purified from Flavobacterium heparinum (McLean et al., 29.McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 145: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and Flavobacterium sp. Hp206 (Yoshida et al., 1989), respectively. Sephadex gels were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and Bio-Gel resins were from Bio-Rad. NaB3H4 (15 Ci/mmol) was supplied by American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). 4-Methylumbelliferyl-α-L-iduronide was from Sigma, and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucuronide was from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan). Seven standard unsaturated disaccharides were prepared from heparin as reported previously (Yamada et al., 37.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Standard heparin disaccharides prepared by deaminative cleavage (Shively and Conrad, 37.Shively J.E. Conrad H.E.

Conrad, University of Illinois. β-Glucuronidase (EC 3.2.1.31) purified to homogeneity from Ampullaria (freshwater apple shell) hepatopancreas (Tsukada and Yoshino, 44.Tsukada T. Yoshino M. Comp.

Human liver α-iduronidase (EC 3.2.1.76) was purified as reported previously (Freeman and Hopwood, 7.Freeman C. Hopwood J.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Stage 14 heparin was purified by anion exchange chromatography and digested with heparinase, and the digest was fractionated into fractions a-d by gel filtration as described previously (Sugahara et al., 1995). Fractions c and d contained tetra- and disaccharides, respectively, which were derived from the repeating disaccharide region as characterized by HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyIdoAL-iduronic acidHexAhexuronic acidΔHexA or Δ4,5HexA4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acidanManr2,5-anhydromannitolΔDiHS-0SΔ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcNAcΔDiHS-6SΔ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcNAc(6-sulfate)ΔDiHS-NSΔ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcN(N-sulfate)ΔDiHS-diS1Δ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcN(N,6-disulfate)ΔDiHS-diS2Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcN(N-sulfate)ΔDiHS-diS3Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcNAc(6-sulfate)ΔDiHS-triSΔ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcN(N,6-disulfate)NS2-N-sulfate2S2-O-sulfate3S3-O-sulfate6S6-O-sulfateATIII, antithrombin III, Fr.fraction(s).

Fraction b containing mainly hexasaccharides was subfractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column (Sugahara et al., 1995) and structurally characterized in this study. Each peak was purified by rechromatography under the same conditions as the first step and desalted by gel filtration through a Sephadex G-25 column. high pressure liquid chromatography L-iduronic acid hexuronic acid 4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid 2,5-anhydromannitol Δ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcNAc Δ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcNAc(6-sulfate) Δ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcN(N-sulfate) Δ4,5HexAα(1-4)GlcN(N,6-disulfate) Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcN(N-sulfate) Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcNAc(6-sulfate) Δ4,5HexA(2-sulfate)α(1-4)GlcN(N,6-disulfate) 2-N-sulfate 2-O-sulfate 3-O-sulfate 6-O-sulfate fraction(s). Fraction b-19 (170 nmol) was incubated with 60 mIU of 2-sulfatase in a total volume of 120 μl of 6.7 mM CH3COONa, pH 6.5, containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 140 min. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 1 min, and the digest was fractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column as described below. Each isolated hexasaccharide (0.5-1.0 nmol) was digested using 1-5 mIU of heparinase, heparitinase I, II, or V, or 2-sulfatase as described previously (Sugahara et al., 1992; Yamada et al., 1994). Successive enzymatic digestion of a given hexasaccharide with 2-sulfatase and then heparitinase I was also carried out as reported (Yamada et al., 1995). Reactions were terminated by boiling for 1 min, and the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC as described below. Fractionation and analysis of unsaturated oligosaccharides were carried out by HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column using a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 basically as described previously, except that a linear gradient of NaH2PO4 was made from 16-800 mM over 90 min (Sugahara et al., 1992). Eluates were monitored by absorption at 232 nm. Capillary electrophoresis was carried out to examine the purity of each isolated fraction in a Waters capillary ion analyzer as reported previously (Sugahara et al., 1994). The electrophoretic fractions were examined by absorption at 185 nm due to carbonyl groups because its sensitivity was higher than that of detection at 232 nm (Sugahara et al., 1995). Each heparin hexasaccharide (5.0 nmol) was treated at room temperature with HNO2 at pH 1.5 for 30 min (Shively and Conrad, 1976a), and the resultant di- and/or tetrasaccharides were reduced under alkaline conditions with [3H]sodium borohydride (0.50 mCi) as reported previously (Yamada et al., 1995). Labeled oligosaccharides were separated by gel filtration chromatography on a column (1.0 × 115 cm) of Bio-Gel P-2 using 0.25 M NH4HCO3/7% propanol as an eluent. Di- and tetrasaccharide fractions were separately pooled, lyophilized at least three consecutive times to ensure complete removal of the ammonium bicarbonate, and then reconstituted in water. These fractions were separated, respectively, by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column at a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a stepwise gradient of NaH2PO4. Samples were collected at 1.0-min intervals for radioactivity measurement in an Aloka LSC-700 liquid scintillation counter. Individual disaccharide peaks were identified by comparison with authentic heparin disaccharides as reported previously (Bienkowski and Conrad, 2.Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tetrasaccharides obtained by deamination of hexasaccharides in Fr. b-15, −20, and −22 were tested for their sensitivities to α-iduronidase and β-glucuronidase to determine the isomer type of the uronic acid residue exposed at the nonreducing termini. Each [3H]tetrasaccharide (8 pmol) corresponding to approximately 4 × 103 cpm was digested using 17.7 mIU of α-iduronidase or 81.5 mIU of β-glucuronidase in a total volume of 30 μl of 20 mM NaOH-formic acid buffer, pH 3.0 (Freeman and Hopwood, 1992) or 50 mM acetic acid-NaOH buffer, pH 4.5 (Tsukada and Yoshino, 1987) at 37°C overnight. One IU of α-iduronidase or β-glucuronidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces 1 μmol of uronic acid/min from 4-methylumbelliferyl-α-L-iduronide or p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucuronide, respectively. Hexasaccharides for NMR analysis were fully sodiated using a Dowex 50-X8 (Na+ form) column (7 × 18 mm) and then repeatedly exchanged in 2H2O with intermediate lyophilization. 500-MHz 1H NMR spectra of hexasaccharides were measured on a Varian VXR-500 at a probe temperature of 26°C as reported previously (Yamada et al., 1993). Chemical shifts are given relative to sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate but were actually measured indirectly relative to acetone (δ 2.225) in 2H2O (Vliegenthart et al., 45.Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Van Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Uronic acid was determined by the carbazole method (Bitter and Muir, 3.Bitter M. Muir H. Anal. Biochem. 1962; 4: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (5218) Google Scholar). Unsaturated uronic acid was spectrophotometrically quantified based upon an average millimolar absorption coefficient of 5.5 at 232 nm (Yamagata et al., 50.Yamagata T. Saito H. Habuchi O. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1523-1535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino sugars were quantified after acid hydrolysis in 3 M HCl at 100°C for 16 h using a Beckman 6300E amino acid analyzer (Sugahara et al., 39.Sugahara K. Okamoto H. Nakamura M. Shibamoto S. Yamashina I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified stage 14 heparin from porcine intestine was exhaustively digested with heparinase and fractionated into fractions a-d by gel filtration on Cellulofine GCL-90 m (Sugahara et al., 1995). Amino sugar and uronic acid analyses showed that fraction b contained approximately 3 mol each of GlcN and HexA/mol of ΔHexA (data not shown), i.e. hexasaccharides. Fraction b was subfractionated by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column into Fr. b-1 to b-26 (Sugahara et al., 1995). Nine major fractions, Fr. b-5, −6, −10, −15, −17, −19, −20, −22, and −24, were further purified by rechromatography. They altogether accounted for 77 mol% (as ΔHexA) of the oligosaccharides obtained from fraction b. Fr. b-5, −6, and −10 contained glycoserines derived from the glycosaminoglycan-protein linkage region as reported previously (Sugahara et al., 1995). The other fractions, Fr. b-15, −17, −19, −20, −22, and −24, were subjected to structural analysis below in this study. These individual fractions gave a single peak on HPLC but were approximately 95, 99, 54, 66, 96, and 75% pure, respectively, when examined by capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Fr. b-17 contained the previously reported hexasulfated tetrasaccharide ΔHexA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S)α1-4IdoA(2S)α1-4GlcN(NS,6S) (Linker and Hovingh, 24.Linker A. Hovingh P. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 127: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) as confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, where 2S, 6S, and NS represent 2-O-, 6-O-, and 2-N-sulfation, respectively (data not shown). Apparently, this tetrasaccharide was partitioned into the hexasaccharide fraction due to its heavily sulfated structure. The amounts of the analyzed fractions isolated from 100 mg of the starting purified heparin are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1TABLE 1 The disaccharide compositions of the isolated oligosaccharide fractions were determined by digestion with heparitinase(s) and/or heparinase, followed by HPLC on an amine-bound silica column. All the above oligosaccharide fractions except for Fr. b-17 were enzymatically degraded into approximately 3 mol of disaccharide units or 1 mol each of a di- and a tetrasaccharide unit. As representative chromatograms, those obtained with Fr. b-15 and b-24 are shown in Figure 2:, Figure 3:, respectively. Fr. b-15 yielded ΔDiHS-6S, ΔDiHS-diS1, and ΔDiHS-triS upon heparitinase I digestion as shown in Fig. 2A; their recoveries were 113, 105, and 124%, respectively, when taking the UV absorbance of the parent oligosaccharide(s) in Fr. b-15 as 100% (Table 1). Thus, the major component in this fraction was a hexasulfated hexasaccharide composed of a monosulfated, a disulfated, and a trisulfated disaccharide unit. Its sensitivity to 2-sulfatase was examined to localize the ΔHexA(2S)-containing disaccharide unit ΔDiHS-triS in the hexasaccharide sequence. The enzyme acts only on the ΔHexA(2S) structure at the nonreducing end (McLean et al., 1984). When Fr. b-15 was successively digested with 2-sulfatase and then heparitinase I, it yielded ΔDiHS-6S and ΔDiHS-diS1 with recoveries of 92 and 204%, respectively, indicating that ΔDiHS-triS had been located at the nonreducing end and converted to ΔDiHS-diS1 by successive digestion (Fig. 2B). When digested with heparitinase V (Yoshida, et al., 1989), Fr. b-15 gave rise to equimolar amounts of ΔDiHS-diS1 and a presumable tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide (Fig. 2C), indicating that ΔDiHS-diS1 was derived from the other terminus, i.e. the reducing end. Therefore, the structure of the compound in Fr. b-15 is ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA-GlcNAc(6S)-HexA-GlcN(NS,6S).Figure 3:HPLC analysis of the enzyme digests of Fr. b-24. Fr. b-24 (0.25 nmol) was digested with a mixture of heparitinase I and heparinase (A), heparinase (B), heparitinase I (C), or 2-sulfatase and then heparitinase I successively (D) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the HPLC conditions, see the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The major component in Fr. b-24 accounted for 75% of the UV-absorbing materials in this fraction as judged by capillary electrophoresis (Fig. 1E). Exhaustive digestion of this fraction with a mixture of heparinase and heparitinase I yielded ΔDiHS-triS, ΔDiHS-diS1, and ΔDiHS-diS3 with recoveries of 158, 96, and 125%, respectively (Fig. 3A). Upon incubation with heparinase only, Fr. b-24 was degraded into two unsaturated components, ΔDiHS-triS and a component that eluted near the elution position of a tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide, with recoveries of 171 and 110%, respectively (Fig. 3B), whereas it was degraded by heparitinase I into two unsaturated components, ΔDiHS-diS1 and a component that eluted near the elution position of a pentasulfated tetrasaccharide, with recoveries of 100 and 106%, respectively (Fig. 3C). These results together indicate that the major component in Fr. b-24 is a pentasulfated hexasaccharide composed of equimolar amounts of three disaccharide units corresponding to ΔDiHS-triS, ΔDiHS-diS1, and ΔDiHS-diS3, and that the excess recovery of ΔDiHS-triS upon heparinase or heparinase/heparitinase I digestion was probably due to degradation of contaminating oligosaccharide(s). The sequential arrangement of the three disaccharide units in the major hexasaccharide was determined based upon the sensitivity to 2-sulfatase. When digested successively with 2-sulfatase and then heparitinase I, the presumably pentasulfated tetrasaccharide peak shifted to a position corresponding to the loss of one sulfate group on HPLC, indicating that ΔDiHS-triS had been located on the nonreducing terminal side of the major compound in Fr. b-24. Therefore, the structure of the major compound in this fraction is proposed as ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA(2S)-GlcNAc(6S)-HexA-GlcN(NS,6S). Fr. b-19 was resolved into several subcomponents by capillary electrophoresis, the major component accounting for only 54% of the UV-absorbing materials in this fraction (Fig. 1B), but it was not possible to fractionate it preparatively into its subcomponents. Therefore, it was first digested with 2-sulfatase and then the digest was analyzed by HPLC. The 2-sulfatase treatment resulted in a peak shift of 8 min of 61% of the parent compound on HPLC, indicating that the major product lost one sulfate group (data not shown). The major product, designated as Fr. b-19S, was isolated and subjected to structural analysis. The yield was 167 nmol/100 mg of the starting heparin. It was degraded by heparitinase I, yielding almost exclusively ΔDiHS-diS1 (Table 1). Therefore, the major component in Fr. b-19S was deduced to be a hexasulfated hexasaccharide composed of 3 mol of the disulfated disaccharide unit corresponding to ΔDiHS-diS1, i.e. ΔHexA-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA-GlcN(NS,6S). Consequently, the structure of the major component in the parent fraction b-19 was ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA-GlcN(NS,6S). Heparitinase I digestion of both Fr. b-20 and −22 resulted in two unsaturated components, the trisulfated disaccharide ΔDiHS-triS and a component that eluted near the elution position of the tri- or tetrasulfated tetrasaccharide (data not shown). Recoveries of the di- and tetrasaccharide components from Fr. b-20 or −22 were 109 and 62% or 122 and 106%, respectively (Table 1). The lower recoveries of the presumable tetrasaccharide components of these fractions compared with those of their counterpart disaccharides suggested that the excess disaccharides were derived from minor components in these fractions consistent with the results of capillary electrophoresis. The presumable tetrasaccharide components from both Fr. b-20 and −22 were resistant to heparinase and heparitinases I and II (data not shown), probably due to the 3-O-sulfation of the reducing GlcN as reported previously for the ATIII-binding site-derived tetrasaccharides (Yamada et al., 1993). The presumable tetrasaccharides were co-chromatographed on HPLC with the authentic tetrasaccharides containing 3-O-sulfated GlcN residue (Yamada et al., 1993), demonstrating that the tri- and tetrasulfated tetrasaccharides derived from Fr. b-20 and −22 were identical to ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S)-GlcA-GlcN(NS, 3S) and ΔHexA-GlcNAc(6S)-GlcA-GlcN(NS, 3S,6S), respectively. Sensitivities of the compounds in Fr. b-20 and −22 to 2-sulfatase were examined to characterize the sequential arrangement of the constituent di- and tetrasaccharide units. After 2-sulfatase digestion, Fr. b-20 and −22 gave a single peak on HPLC, which eluted approximately 10 min earlier than the corresponding parent compound, indicating that the major compound in each fraction had a sulfate group on the C-2 position of the ΔHexA residue at the nonreducing terminus. Therefore, the structures of the major compounds in Fr. b-20 and −22 were ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA-GlcNAc(6S)-GlcA-GlcN(NS,3S) and ΔHexA(2S)-GlcN(NS,6S)-HexA-GlcNAc(6S)-GlcA-GlcN(NS,3S,6S), respectively. To identify the internal uronic acid residues in the hexasaccharides of the isolated fractions, nitrous acid degradation products of each fraction were analyzed by HPLC. Bacterial lyase treatment converts the original structures of internal uronic acid, GlcA and IdoA in the oligosaccharides into the common 4,5-unsaturated, 4-deoxy-α-L-threo-hex-4-enepyranosyluronic acid. In contrast, nitrous acid treatment preserves the original uronic acid structures despite loss of an N-sulfate group and production of an artificial structure, anhydromannitol, at the reducing end of the resultant oligosaccharides (Shively and Conrad, 1976a, 1976b). The resultant di- and/or tetrasaccharide(s) from each hexasaccharide fraction were isolated by gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-2 and were analyzed by HPLC. These fractions obtained from Fr. b-15, −20, or −22 were confirmed to contain a disaccharide and a tetrasaccharide component as judged from their elution positions on HPLC (data not shown) (Bienkowski and Conrad, 1985). The tetrasaccharide component presumably derived from the reducing side of each of these original hexasaccharides was subjected to digestion with human liver α-iduronidase (Freeman and Hopwood, 1992) and Ampullaria β-glucuronidase (Tsukada and Yoshino, 1987) to identify the uronic acid residues at the nonreducing termini. After α-iduronidase digestion, a part (40, 57,"

U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) 1The abbreviation used is: snRNAsmall nuclear RNA. is a highly conserved, abundantly transcribed, stable RNA species that plays a crucial role in the processing of premature mRNA within the spliceosome(1.Berget S.M. Robberson B.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 691-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2.Reddy R. Busch H. Birnstiel M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor snRNPs.

Although the precise function of U6 within the spliceosome has not been clearly defined, evidence is mounting that it may be involved in the catalytic active site(5.Brow D.A. Guthrie C. Nature. 1989; 337: 14-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 6.Madhani H.D. Guthrie C. Cell. 1992; 71: 803-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7.Wolff T. Bindereif A. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1377-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), cleaving at exon/intron junctions. U6 is unique from the other four major U-rich spliceosomal RNAs (U1, U2, U4, and U5) in that it is transcribed by RNA polymerase III rather than RNA polymerase II(8.Kunkel G.R. Maser R.L. Calvet J.P Pederson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8575-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9.Reddy R. Henning D. Das G. Harless M. Wright D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 75-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it obtains a γ-monomethylphosphate 5′ cap rather than a trimethylguanosine 5′ cap (10.Singh R. Reddy R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8280-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and it has not been shown to require a cytoplasmic phase as part of its maturation. In addition, whereas other snRNA genes contain proximal sequence elements and distal sequence enhancers within their promoters, only U6 contains an essential TATA box that mediates polymerase specificity and defines the initiating nucleotide(11.Lobo S.M. Hernandez N. Cell. 1989; 58: 55-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 12.Hernandez N. McKnight S. Yamamoto K. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 281-313Google Scholar). small nuclear RNA. The U6 snRNA gene not only has features distinct from other snRNA genes but also has features distinct from other class III genes. Unlike the vast majority of class III genes (e.g. 5S, tRNA, EBER, adenovirus VA RNA), which have essential cis-acting promoter elements located intragenically(13.Willis I.M. Eur J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the U6 promoter lies entirely upstream from the initiating nucleotide(14.Kunkel G.R. Pederson T. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 15.Das G. Henning D. Wright D. Reddy R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the promoter of U6 defines an exact start site and will initiate and elongate in a sequence-independent fashion until it reaches the class III termination signal, a string of 4-6 thymine residues. These unique features of the U6 gene allow it to be exploited for intracellular RNA delivery as part of ribozyme-, antisense-, antigene-, or aptamer-encoding gene therapy strategies(16.Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other U-rich snRNA genes are being investigated for similar purposes. Given the potential use of U6 and other snRNA genes as gene-targeting RNA expression vectors, as well as the emergence of data implicating U6 as a key element within the spliceosome, more information is needed on regulatory mechanisms controlling the intracellular expression of various snRNA genes. Despite their diversity in polymerase specificity, promoter structure, and transcription factor requirements, snRNAs are maintained in relatively fixed proportions to one another intracellularly. The regulatory mechanisms that underlie snRNA homeostasis are still largely unknown. Although evidence for snRNA gene regulation has been reported during embryogenesis (17.Stefanovic B. Marzluff W.F. Gene Exp. 1994; 4: 1-18PubMed Google Scholar) and following partial hepatectomy(18.Ray R. Panda C. Chakraborty B. Mukherji S. Chaudhury K. Roychoudhury J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), few studies have addressed more general mechanisms accounting for snRNA homeostasis(3.Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Birnstiel M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor snRNPs. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 38-70Google Scholar, 19.Mangin M. Ares M. Weiner A.M. Science. 1985; 229: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To address this need, our studies focused on the following questions relating to U6 snRNA expression: (a) Do intracellular regulatory mechanisms exist that respond to altered U6 transcript levels?; (b) Are U6 regulatory mechanisms independent of or linked to expression of other snRNA genes? and (c) Are such mechanisms invoked by changes in transcript levels, rates of U6 snRNA synthesis, or U6 promoter activity? By transiently transfecting U6 gene constructs into human cell lines, we provide evidence of a regulatory mechanism that acts to prevent U6 RNA overexpression, similar to that previously described for U1 RNA (19.Mangin M. Ares M. Weiner A.M. Science. 1985; 229: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This mechanism appears to act primarily through a tightly regulated post-transcriptional enhancement of U6 degradation and be relatively specific for U6 RNA. These results suggest that the use of the U6 gene for gene-targeting strategies may not affect the levels of other snRNA but may lead to transient dose-dependent down-regulation of endogenous U6 snRNA. Plasmids containing the normal human U6 gene or a mutant sequence with bases +25 to +55 replaced by an XhoI restriction site were generously provided by G. Kunkel and T. Pederson(14.Kunkel G.R. Pederson T. Genes & Dev. 1988; 2: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 20.Kunkel G.R. Pederson T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7371-7379Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The mutant U6 sequence was modified further by site-directed mutagenesis at bases +86 and +88 to create a unique NsiI restriction site, as described previously(16.Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The internal XhoI/NsiI sequence of this mutant U6 gene was then replaced by a synthetic 38-base pair duplex fragment having no homology to the native U6. The resulting gene, referred to as U6ON, encodes an 82-nucleotide hybrid transcript, sharing only the first 25 and the last 19 nucleotides with native U6. Both U6 and U6ON expression constructs were cloned within pGEM1 plasmids (Promega, Madison, WI). The human embryonic kidney cell line, 293, and the human breast cancer cell line, MDA-453 (ATCC, Rockville, MD), were transfected by electroporation (Bio-Rad) with 5-40 μg of U6ON, U6, or promoterless plasmid control DNA. Cell viability after transfection, ectopic gene expression, and native U6 levels were comparable between the two cell lines. 293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium with Earle's basic salt solution and 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin in 5% CO2 incubators. MDA-453 cells were cultured in Leibovitz L-15 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin in the absence of CO2. Total cellular RNA was isolated 48, 72, 96, or 120 h post-transfection by 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction at pH 5.5 followed by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation (21.Ullrich A. Shine J. Chirgwin J. Pictet R. Tischer E. Rutter W. Goodman H. Science. 1977; 196: 1313-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of RNA/lane were electrophoresed in 8% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gels, electroblotted onto nylon filters, and UV cross-linked for 2 min as described previously(16.Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Probes to detect native U6 or U6ON RNA were made by random priming of an 800-base pair BamHI/EcoRI fragment taken from the U6 or U6ON plasmid, respectively. Probes to detect 7sk and 5S RNA were also made by random priming from plasmids generously provided by R. Reddy. After hybridization and autoradiography, snRNA levels were quantitated by scanning densitometry. Intracellular half-lives of snRNAs were measured after halting total cellular transcription with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) administered to culture medium 48 h after transfection with 5-40 μg of the U6 or U6ON gene. At 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h after actinomycin D treatment, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and total cell RNA was extracted with guanidinium isothiocyanate. Northern blotting was performed as described above to quantitate U6, U6ON, and other snRNA transcript levels. Half-life values were estimated assuming a first-order model of RNA degradation. The feasibility of using specific regulatory elements from the U6 gene to create a chimeric gene capable of abundant nuclear expression of sequence-specific RNA has previously been reported(16.Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This study uses one such chimeric gene, U6ON, along with an unmodified U6 gene to explore regulation of endogenous U6 gene expression. Fig. 1 illustrates the dose-dependent (Fig. 1A) and post-transfection time-dependent (Fig. 1B) down-regulation of endogenous U6 snRNA with increasing expression of U6ON RNA. At low U6ON transfection doses (5 μg/107 cells), U6 snRNA levels are near their normal steady-state levels, and U6ON RNA is only modestly expressed. However, as U6ON transfection doses increase to 20-40 μg/107 cells, U6 snRNA levels drop markedly in association with a sharp rise in U6ON expression. Because both the U6ON and the U6 probes were radiolabeled to equal specific activity, it is notable that the U6ON RNA band density at 40-μg transfection dose is similar to the U6 band density at 0-μg transfection dose and that summing the U6 and U6ON bands at intermediate doses gives rise to nearly constant total levels of U6-promoted transcripts. Transfection doses greater than 40 μg/107 cells were not analyzed because they resulted in unacceptable levels of cell death. We have previously demonstrated the kinetic profile of U6ON expression to be a rapid rise to steady-state within the first 12 h post-transfection, maintenance of steady-state levels 12-48 h post-transfection, and a slow decline in U6ON RNA levels 48-168 h post-transfection(16.Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In clear correspondence with this profile, U6 snRNA down-regulation is observed both at 24 and 48 h post-transfection, with recovery occurring as the level of U6ON expression decreases 48-120 h post-transfection. Fig. 1B illustrates these time-dependent complimentary changes in U6 and U6ON RNA levels following transient transfection of 293 cells with 20 μg of U6ON. No such changes in U6 snRNA levels are seen when cells were transfected with promoterless plasmid control DNA. As in Fig. 1A, the sum of the U6 and U6ON band intensities at each time point results in nearly constant levels of total U6-promoted transcripts. To test whether these complimentary changes in U6 snRNA levels were specific to U6 or indicative of a more general effect on RNA metabolism induced by U6ON expression, levels of other class II and class III snRNA were monitored in the presence of U6ON. Fig. 2 demonstrates the lack of any significant change in U1, U3, 7sk, or 5S RNA levels resulting from increasing expression of U6ON. In addition, as U6ON RNA levels decline 48-120 h after transfection, no compensatory changes are noted in 7sk or U1, snRNAs arising from genes with promoter structures very similar to U6. To search for interruption of spliceosomal function or general alterations in RNA metabolism, levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and c-myc mRNA were assessed by Northern blotting of agarose gels. No significant changes in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or c-myc mRNA levels were noted following U6ON transfection, nor was there any detectable evidence of dysregulated mRNA splicing in the form of premature mRNA species of lower mobility. As well, co-transfection of a β-HCG expression vector showed no decline in β-HCG protein expression in the presence of U6ON (22.Noonberg, S. B. (1994) Intracellular Generation of RNA Oligonucleotides for Antisense and Triplex Gene Regulation. Ph.D. thesis, University of California, BerkeleyGoogle Scholar). Thus, based on these transient transfection assays, the regulatory effects of high level U6ON expression appear specific to the U6 gene. Despite the lack of dose-dependent or time-dependent effects of U6ON expression on 7sk, a gene that shares the same polymerase specificity, 5′ cap, general promoter structure, and subcellular localization with U6, we explored further the possibility that U6 down-regulation results from transcription factor quenching by U6ON. Fig. 3 illustrates the results of an experiment in which MDA-453 cells were transfected with 40 μg of linearized U6ON plasmid, closed circular U6ON plasmid, truncated plasmid (wherein the promoter and first half of the gene is retained and the termination sequence removed), or promoterless plasmid control DNA. The first three ectopic U6 genes have identical promoter constructs but differ in their inherent capacity for U6ON expression (closed circular > linear ≫ truncated). Therefore, if the large number of exogenously introduced U6ON promoters were merely binding and saturating requisite transcription factors and preventing them from binding to native chromosomal U6 promoters, then each of these ectopic U6 genes should equally down-regulate endogenous U6 snRNA levels relative to control DNA. As shown in Fig. 3, this phenomenon did not occur. U6 snRNA down-regulation was most apparent in the lane marked U6ON, where U6ON expression was highest. (Note that the truncated transcript was too small to be pelleted by GITC extraction/cesium chloride centrifugation(23.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.19Google Scholar)). Thus, U6 down-regulation appears to be more a function of the intracellular levels of U6-promoted transcripts than a function of the intracellular levels of U6 promoters. Given that U6 snRNA has been shown to be a highly stable transcript with a half-life value estimated at ∼24 h(24.Sauterer R. Feeney R. Zieve G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 344-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25.Terns M. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it is consistent that the near total down-regulation of U6 (seen in Fig. 1A, lane 5, and Fig. 3, lane 2) could not be explained solely by a decrease in the initiation rate of endogenous U6. Even in the extreme case of complete cessation of U6 initiation following U6ON transfection, 25% of U6 snRNA would be expected 48 h post-transfection. To test an alternate hypothesis that U6 down-regulation is being mediated primarily by a decrease in transcript stability rather than a decrease in transcript production, U6 snRNA half-life was measured in the presence of increasing levels of U6ON expression. In Fig. 4A, 293 cells were transfected with 20 μg of U6ON and then treated with actinomycin D at 48 h to halt total cellular transcription. The steady-state level of various snRNAs is shown at 0 h, and at subsequent time points the intensity of each snRNA band declines in accordance with its individual intracellular rate of degradation. At the onset of actinomycin D exposure (0 h), consistent with results shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 3, U6 snRNA levels are reduced (relative to other snRNAs) in the presence of high U6ON RNA expression. For 7sk, U1, and U3 snRNAs, stable and highly abundant transcripts with half-lives comparable with that of U6 snRNA (3.Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Birnstiel M.L. Structure and Function of Major and Minor snRNPs. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1988: 38-70Google Scholar, 24.Sauterer R. Feeney R. Zieve G. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 344-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), there is no apparent reduction in stability resulting from U6ON expression. In contrast, U6 stability is markedly reduced, with scanning densitometry suggesting an 8-fold reduction in intracellular half-life (from ∼24 to ∼3 h). As expected, U6ON, missing all known protein binding sites (aside from the La protein) and capacity for 3′ hybridization with U4, demonstrates a half-life of only ∼1 h. Fig. 4B demonstrates that this decrease in U6 snRNA half-life can be titrated back toward higher values by decreasing the dose of transfected U6ON. The near normal levels of U6 snRNA after a 5-μg U6ON transfection dose (Fig. 1A) and after 96 h post-transfection (Fig. 1B) provide internal consistency to these results. It is interesting to note that although the half-life of U6 appears highly dependent upon levels of U6ON, the half-life of U6ON appears independent of its own level expression as well as of total U6 snRNA levels. U6ON half-life after a 5-μg transfection is nearly identical to that following a 20-μg transfection. Because these observations suggest that U6 transcript levels are at least in part regulated by changes in U6 snRNA degradation, a similar set of transfection experiments was performed using an unmodified ectopic U6 gene to explore further the relationship between U6 snRNA levels and U6 snRNA half-life. Analogous to experiments transfecting the U6ON gene (Fig. 1A), cells were transfected with increasing doses of the unmodified U6 gene, and Northern blotting was performed to measure total U6 RNA levels. As shown in Fig. 5A, transfections of up to 40 μg of the U6 gene failed to significantly alter the total cellular level of U6 RNA. Furthermore, with increasing U6 transfection dosage a progressive increase in U6 RNA degradative products (bands appearing below the full-length U6 RNA band) was clearly detectable. Using 5′- and 3′-specific labeled antisense oligonucleotide probes, we attempted to determine whether this degradation was occurring predominantly from the 5′ or 3′ end of the U6 RNA; however, these results were inconclusive, suggesting that U6 RNA degradation was not occurring by unidirectional exonuclease activity (data not shown). Additional actinomycin D transcription arrest experiments were performed to detect alterations in U6 RNA stability associated with transfection of the unmodified U6 gene. As shown in Fig. 5B, at the highest gene transfection dose (40 μg/107 cells) U6 RNA half-life was found to be only 1-2 h, corresponding to a >10-fold decrease in U6 RNA stability from normal values. As in previous experiments, U1 and 7sk RNA retain their stability. Interestingly, in Fig. 4A U6 is down-regulated at time 0 and degrades rapidly from this level, whereas in Fig. 5B, it degrades rapidly from steady-state levels at time 0. If a first-order model of RNA degradation is assumed, then these differences in initial U6 RNA levels do not affect half-life determinations. This study attempted to identify mechanisms regulating intracellular U6 snRNA. Our results indicate that U6, much like U1 (19.Mangin M. Ares M. Weiner A.M. Science. 1985; 229: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), is capable of compensatory regulation of its snRNA product using a servo-mechanism triggered by supranormal U6 promoter activity and accumulation of U6-promoted RNA. Contrary to initial expectations, the most profound cellular response to introducing increasing doses of an active U6 promoter is not a decrease in endogenous U6 transcript production but rather an increase in endogenous U6 transcript degradation. This response does not reflect general cellular injury, metabolic interferences, or ribonuclease saturation but instead represents a specific mechanism regulating total U6 RNA that does not substantially affect other spliceosomal or nonspliceosomal snRNAs. Cells with considerably reduced levels of U6 RNA (and increased levels of U6ON RNA) 48 h post-transfection were phenotypically indistinguishable from cells with normal levels of U6 RNA. Over this brief time span, none of the transfected cell populations showed any morphological or biochemical evidence of toxicity or abnormal splicing of either glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or c-myc mRNA. In preliminary experiments to examine the long term effects of U6ON expression and U6 RNA down-regulation, we stably transfected the U6ON gene into MDA-453 cells under the selective pressure of G418 (data not shown). The majority of G418-resistant clones did not sustain cell division sufficient for RNA isolation. However, of the cell colonies that survived and amplified, U6 RNA levels were normal with only very low levels of detectable U6ON expression. No colonies with U6ON overexpression or U6 down-regulation could be isolated. These preliminary findings suggest that although transient U6 down-regulation may be compatible with survival, the cell may not be able to continue to function normally with U6 RNA at subnormal levels and/or subnormal stability. Given the important function of U6 RNA within the spliceosome, it is reasonable that cells have evolved a servo-mechanism based on U6 RNA degradation to prevent an excess accumulation of this critical snRNA species relative to others in the spliceosome complex. Based on the normal half-life of U6 RNA (∼24 h), it would be difficult to down-regulate cellular levels simply by decreasing the rate of U6 RNA. For example, even with complete halting of endogenous U6 transcript initiation, at least 25% of normal steady-state U6 RNA would still be present after 48 h. In contrast, by reducing U6 RNA stability, intracellular U6 RNA levels can be modulated with a more rapid feedback response. Additional study, however, is necessary to explore the possibility that unobserved regulatory pathways exist that modulate the rate of U6 RNA initiation. The molecular mechanisms mediating the rates of U6 RNA degradation are still unclear. U6 RNA stability is thought to be dependent upon its 5′ cap, 3′ U-rich tail, and capacity for self and/or U4 hybridization(25.Terns M. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26.Shumayatsky P. Wright D. Reddy R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4756-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One hypothesis that could only partially explain our observations is saturation of the U6 capping enzyme and/or substrates, resulting in a population of uncapped and unstable U6 RNA. If such an enzyme or substrate were in limiting supply then the presence of increasing levels of U6ON RNA, which is at least partially capped(16.Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), would likely compete with endogenous U6 RNA capping in a dose-dependent fashion. Three facts support the hypothesis that U6ON enhances U6 RNA degradation by saturating the U6 capping mechanism. Firstly, the observed 8-fold reduction in U6 half-life in the presence of U6ON corresponds perfectly to the half-life value obtained when uncapped U6 RNA are microinjected into oocytes(25.Terns M. Dahlberg J.E. Lund E. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 26.Shumayatsky P. Wright D. Reddy R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4756-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Secondly, unlike capping of mRNA and other U-rich snRNA, the capping of U6 RNA is not coupled to U6 transcription(27.Gupta S. Singh R. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9491-9495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thirdly, endogenous U6 capping activity has been found to be a saturable enzymatic mechanism(28.Shimba S. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12419-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inconsistencies with this hypothesis include the lack of destabilization of 7sk RNA (which acquires the same γ-monomethylphosphate cap (29.Gupta S. Busch R. Singh R. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19137-19142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and shares at least one essential component with the U6 capping mechanism(28.Shimba S. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12419-12423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and the first-order (as opposed to biphasic) destabilization of U6 RNA. A second mechanistic hypothesis invokes another saturable, stabilizing protein factor that associates with U6 RNA within its first 25 or its last 19 nucleotides (those common to both U6 and U6ON). Whereas the La protein(30.Rinke J. Steitz J. Cell. 1982; 29: 149-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), which transiently binds the U-rich 3′ end of U6 (and presumably U6ON), fits this description, the lack of any U6ON effect on 5S or 7sk transcript levels or stability make it an unlikely candidate. The decreased stability of U6 RNA in the presence of a large transfection dose of the unmodified ectopic U6 gene could have arisen from a saturation of available U4 RNA for hybridization; however, the U6ON gene has the internal portion of U6 replaced with a sequence that is incompatible with U4 hybridization, and, therefore, this explanation cannot fully account for the reduction in U6 RNA stability. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of destabilization. This report demonstrates the utility of modified snRNA gene constructs in exploring cellular mechanisms regulating endogenous snRNA homeostasis. It also provides additional information on potential limitations to the use of snRNA promoters to deliver high levels of short sequence-specific RNA for gene regulation purposes. In our initial report(16.Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we overestimated the number of copies/cell of RNA that could be delivered by such a system because we failed to recognize the extent to which normal U6 was down-regulated in the presence of U6ON. We now recognize that as U6ON RNA levels increase, U6 RNA levels fall to keep the total number of U6-promoted transcripts relatively constant, as has also been seen with U1(19.Mangin M. Ares M. Weiner A.M. Science. 1985; 229: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The existence of such cellular servo-mechanisms may present serious limitations to the use of snRNA promoters for long term gene therapy strategies by resulting in cellular toxicity that is unintended or not due to the sequence-specific snRNA insert. However, the lack of toxicity under short term experimental conditions indicates that these gene expression systems may be effective for transient intracellular production of ribozymes or antisense or triplex-forming RNA, which could serve as useful research tools for investigating gene function and regulation. We are grateful to Drs. Thoru Pederson and Gary Kunkel for supplying the U6 gene and the U6/XhoI mutant and to Dr. Ram Reddy for supplying the 5S and 7sk genes and for helpful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W1520049999,"GM2 activator protein is a protein cofactor which stimulates the enzymatic hydrolysis of both GalNAc and NeuAc from GM2. We have previously isolated two cDNA clones, GM2 activator cDNA and GM2A cDNA, for human GM2 activator protein (Nagarajan, S., Chen, H.-C., Li, S.-C., Li, Y.-T., and Lockyer, J. M.(1992) Biochem. J. 282, 807-813). GM2A mRNA is an RNA alternative splicing product that contains exons 1, 2, 3, and intron 3 of the genomic DNA sequence of GM2 activator protein (Klima, H., Tanaka, A., Schnabel, D., Nakano, T., Schröder, M., Suzuki, K., and Sandhoff, K.(1991) FEBS Lett. 289, 260-264). GM2A cDNA encodes a protein (GM2A protein) containing 1-109 of the 160 amino acids of human GM2 activator protein, plus a tripeptide (VST) encoded by intron 3 at the COOH terminus. Thus, GM2A protein can be regarded as a form (truncated version) of GM2 activator protein. We have expressed GM2A cDNA in Escherichia coli using pT7-7 as the vector. The recombinant GM2A protein was purified to an electrophoretically homogeneous form and was found to stimulate the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2 by clostridial sialidase, but not the hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A. Like GM2 activator protein, GM2A protein also specifically recognized the terminal GM2 epitope in GalNAc-GD1a and stimulated the hydrolysis of only the external NeuAc from this ganglioside by clostridial sialidase. These results enabled us to discern the enzymatic hydrolyses of GalNAc and NeuAc from the GM2 epitope and established that the NeuAc recognition domain of GM2 activator protein is located within amino acids 1-109. The presence of GM2A mRNA in human tissues and the selective stimulation of NeuAc hydrolysis by GM2A protein indicate that this activator protein may be involved in the catabolism of GM2 through the asialo-GM2 pathway. GM2 activator protein is a protein cofactor which stimulates the enzymatic hydrolysis of both GalNAc and NeuAc from GM2. We have previously isolated two cDNA clones, GM2 activator cDNA and GM2A cDNA, for human GM2 activator protein (Nagarajan, S., Chen, H.-C., Li, S.-C., Li, Y.-T., and Lockyer, J. M.(1992) Biochem.

It has been well established that the catabolism of ganglioside GM2 1The abbreviations used are: GM2II3NeuAcGgOse3CerGM3II3NeuAcLacCerGalNAc-GD1aIV4GalNAc, IV3NeuAc,II3NeuAcGgOse4CerGA2GgOse3CerPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. requires the assistance of a protein cofactor called GM2 activator protein(1.Li Y.-T.

Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of GM2 activator protein has been shown by the presence of an autosomal recessive genetic disease, the AB variant of Tay-Sachs disease, which is caused by the deficiency or the defect of GM2 activator protein(3.Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3979-3983Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 4.Hechtman P. Gordon B.A. Ng Ying Kin N.M.K. Pediatr.

In addition to GM2 activator protein, four other activator proteins for the catabolism of glycosphingolipids have been reported. These four activator proteins are derived from the proteolytic processing of a single precursor protein, prosaposin(6.O'Brien J.S. Kretz K.A. Dewji N. Wenger D.A. Esch F. Fluharty A.L. Science. 1988; 241: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 7.Fürst W. Machleidt W. Sandhoff K. Biol. Chem.

(Tokyo). 1989; 105: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and have been named saposin A, B, C, and D according to their placements from the amino terminus of the prosaposin(9.Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Saposin B is also known as a nonspecific activator protein and has been found to have a detergent-like activity which stimulates the hydrolyses of various glycolipids by different glycosidases(10.Li S.-C. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6588-6591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the five activator proteins, only GM2 activator protein is derived from a separate gene(11.Burg J. Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Solomon E. Swallow D.M. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1985; 49: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We have isolated two distinct cDNA clones for human GM2 activator protein(12.Nagarajan S. Chen H.-C. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Lockyer J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One of them, GM2 activator cDNA, which has also been isolated by others(13.Schröder M. Klima H. Nakano T. Kwon H. Quintern L.E. Gärtner S. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 14.Xie B. McInnes B. Neote K. Lamhonwah A.-M. Mahuran D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 177: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), encodes almost the entire amino acid sequence of the native GM2 activator protein isolated from human kidney (15.Fürst W. Schubert J. Machleidt W. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The other clone, GM2A cDNA, which was reported only by us, has an identical 5′-terminal sequence as that of GM2 activator cDNA from nucleotides 1 to 302, but different for the next 346 nucleotides toward the 3′ end. Klima et al.(16.Klima H. Tanaka A. Schnabel D. Nakano T. Schröder M. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. FEBS Lett. 1991; 289: 260-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) isolated the genomic DNA which covered 94% of GM2 activator cDNA, and identified the presence of three introns and four exons. The last exon, exon 4, spanned the segment coding for the carboxyl terminus of GM2 activator protein and the entire 3′-untranslated region of the GM2 activator cDNA. Comparing the sequence of GM2A cDNA with this genomic DNA, we found that the last 346 nucleotides of GM2A cDNA were identical to the sequence of 5′ end of intron 3 (the exons and the introns are defined based on GM2 activator mRNA). Thus, GM2A mRNA is an alternative splicing product of GM2 activator RNA in which the potential 5′ splicing site between exon 3 and intron 3 is not subjected to the splicing process. As shown in Fig. 1, the coding region of GM2 activator cDNA contains the end portion of exon 1, all of exons 2 and 3, and the front portion of exon 4. While the coding region of GM2A cDNA contains the identical exon 1, 2, and 3 as in GM2 activator cDNA, and a stretch of 9 nucleotides encoding a tripeptide, VST, at the COOH terminus which is derived from intron 3. This 9-nucleotide sequence is immediately followed by a stop codon. II3NeuAcGgOse3Cer II3NeuAcLacCer IV4GalNAc, IV3NeuAc,II3NeuAcGgOse4Cer GgOse3Cer polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. It has been postulated that the function of GM2 activator protein is to extract a single GM2 molecule from the micelles and to present the substrate-activator complex to β-hexosaminidase A(17.Conzelmann E. Sandhoff K. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), or to lift GM2 from biological membranes where the sugar chain of GM2 molecules may be shielded by other complex lipids with larger headgroups(18.Meier E.M. Schwarzmann G. Fürst W. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1879-1887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Fürst W. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have shown that the action of GM2 activator protein in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A may be due to its ability to recognize and interact with the branched trisaccharide of GM2, the GM2 epitope(19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This view is further supported by the finding that GM2 activator protein also stimulates the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2 by clostridial sialidase(19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the selective hydrolysis of only the terminal NeuAc residue in GalNAc-GD1a, we postulated that GM2 activator protein can specifically recognize the GM2 epitope in this ganglioside (20.Li S.-C. Wu Y.-Y. Sugiyama E. Taki T. Kasama T. Casellato R. Sonnino S. Li Y-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24246-24251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since the amino acid sequence encoded by GM2A cDNA consists of the segment of GM2 activator protein from amino acid residues 1 to 109 and an additional tripeptide sequence VST at the COOH terminus, the protein encoded by GM2A cDNA (GM2A protein) can be regarded as a truncated form of GM2 activator protein. It is, therefore, important to compare the specificity of GM2A protein with that of GM2 activator protein. We have produced the recombinant GM2A protein and found that this activator protein possesses only one of the two known activities of GM2 activator protein. GM2 from Tay-Sachs brain (21.Svennerholm L. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1972; 6: 464-474Google Scholar) and the radioactive GM2(22.Radin N.S. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 28: 300-306Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23.Uda Y. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. McKibbin J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 5194-5200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as previously reported. The recombinant GM2 activator protein and the recombinant saposin B were produced in Escherichia coli as described previously(19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.-C. J.

GalNAc-GD1a was isolated from the total ganglioside mixture of bovine brain(25.Acquotti D. Cantu L. Ragg E. Sonnino S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).

A 23-mer peptide, PFKEGTYSLPKSEFVVPDLELPS-amide, which is identical to amino acids 106-128 of the mature GM2 activator protein, was synthesized using a solid phase peptide synthesizer (Milligen 9050) by the Core Laboratories of Louisiana State University Medical Center. The fragment of GM2A cDNA, which encodes amino acids 1-109 of the human GM2 activator protein plus the tripeptide VST at the COOH terminus, was obtained by polymerase chain reaction using GM2A-KS Bluescript as template. The upstream primer was: 5′-CGC-TCT-AGA-CGG-ATC-CCA-TAT-GTT-TTC-CTG-GGA-TAA-CTG-TGA-T-3′ and the downstream primer was 5′-TCA-TCT-AGA-GGA-TCC-AAG-CTT-AGC-CAC-AGG-GGT-AAC-GCT-CTC-3′. This cDNA fragment was subcloned into pT7-7 expression vector at BamHI and HindIII sites, and was verified for its sequence. The recombinant GM2A protein was expressed and purified according to the method described previously(19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The production of GM2A protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE of Laemmli (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207123) Google Scholar) using silver staining and by Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-GM2 activator antibodies(5.Hirabayashi Y. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified GM2A protein was confirmed by a gas-phase peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems Model 477A). Each ganglioside substrate in micellar form was incubated with the appropriate enzyme and the designated activator protein in a final volume of 100 μl at 37°C. For the conversion of GM2 into GA2, 40 μM GM2 was incubated with 10 units of clostridial sialidase in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 5.5, in the presence of activator protein. For the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GalNAc-GD1a, 20 μM GalNAc-GD1a was used. For quantitative analysis of the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2, the incubation conditions were identical to that described above, except three different concentrations of [3H]GM2 were used. For the hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2, 20 μM GM2 was incubated at 37°C with 0.2 units of β-hexosaminidase A in 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.6, in the presence of the indicated amount of an activator protein. The quantitative analysis of the conversion of GM2 to GM3 was carried out by using [3H]GM2 as substrate at the indicated concentrations and measuring the release of [3H]GalNAc. For analyzing the reaction products by TLC, the reaction was stopped by heating the tube in a bath of boiling water for 3 min, followed by adsorption of gangliosides on C18 beads as described previously(27.Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The beads were then extracted by 0.5 ml of methanol and followed by 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v)(27.Williams M.A. McCluer R.H. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 266-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The extracts were combined, dried, and analyzed by TLC using the following solvents: chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, v/v/v) for the separation of GM2 and GM3; chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v) for the separation of GM2 and GA2; methyl acetate, 1-propanol, chloroform, methanol, 0.25% KCl (25:20:20:20:17) for the separation of GalNAc-GM1a, GalNAc-GM1b, GalNAc-GA1, and GalNAc-GD1a. The plates were sprayed with diphenylamine reagent (28.Harris, G., MacWilliams, I. C. (1954) Chem. & Ind. (Lond.), 249Google Scholar) and heated at 110°C for 15-20 min to reveal the glycosphingolipids. When [3H]GM2 was used, the reaction mixtures were evaporated to dryness under vacuum, then redissolved in 1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:7) and passed through a DEAE-cellulose column (0.5 × 4 cm) which had been equilibrated with the same solvent. The column was washed with 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:7) and then eluted with 5 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:7) containing 20 mM sodium acetate. The breakthrough and the eluted fractions were separately collected, evaporated to dryness, dissolved in 0.5 ml of water, and mixed with 5 ml of Universol. The radioactivity was measured by using a Packard 1600CA liquid scintillation counter. As in the case of the recombinant GM2 activator protein(19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the recombinant GM2A protein produced in E. coli was also found to accumulate in the inclusion bodies. The same scheme used for the extraction, refolding, and purification of the recombinant GM2 activator protein (19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the preparation of the recombinant GM2A protein. As shown in the SDS-PAGE profile (Fig. 2), the purified recombinant GM2A protein (lane 2) moved at the position corresponding to 13.5 kDa, the calculated molecular size of GM2A protein. It is considerably smaller than the recombinant GM2 activator protein (Fig. 2, lane 3). The identity of GM2A protein was also verified by the microsequencing of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence. In Western blot analysis, GM2A protein was also recognized by the polyclonal antibodies against GM2 activator protein(5.Hirabayashi Y. Li Y.-T. Li S.-C. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our previous results indicate that GM2 activator protein can stimulate the hydrolysis of both GalNAc and NeuAc from GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A and clostridial sialidase, respectively, and that it may be able to recognize the branched trisaccharide structure GalNAcβ1→4(NeuAcα2→3)Gal-, the GM2 epitope(19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since GM2A protein contains only the NH2-terminal 109 amino acids of GM2 activator protein without the COOH terminus 110-160 amino acids which were derived from exon 4, it would be important to examine whether or not this short version of the activator protein possesses the two known biological activities expressed by GM2 activator protein. The TLC analysis of the conversion of GM2 to GA2 (Fig. 3A) showed that, as in the case of GM2 activator protein (lane 4), GM2A protein (lane 5) also stimulated the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2 by clostridial sialidase. However, GM2A protein was found to be slightly less effective than GM2 activator protein. In order to compare the stimulatory potency of these two activator proteins, quantitative analysis was performed using [3H]GM2 at three different substrate concentrations instead of triplicates of one concentration. As shown in Fig. 3B, at all three substrate concentrations tested, the conversion of GM2 to GA2 was greatly enhanced by the presence of 2.5 μM of either GM2 activator protein or GM2A protein. GM2A protein was about 20% less effective than GM2 activator protein. Previously we have shown that GM2 activator protein specifically recognized and stimulated the hydrolysis of the NeuAc residue in the GM2 epitope of GalNAc-GD1a by clostridial sialidase(20.Li S.-C. Wu Y.-Y. Sugiyama E. Taki T. Kasama T. Casellato R. Sonnino S. Li Y-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24246-24251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the possible recognition of the same NeuAc residue in GalNAc-GD1a by GM2A protein. As shown in Fig. 4, GM2A protein did preferentially stimulate the hydrolysis of the external NeuAc in GalNAc-GD1a. In the presence of 2.5 μM GM2A protein, the clostridial sialidase produced GalNAc-GM1a as the major product and GalNAc-GA1 as the minor product from GalNAc-GD1a (Fig. 4A, lane 6). The same products were produced from GalNAc-GD1a by the clostridial sialidase in the presence of 2.5 μM GM2 activator protein as seen in Fig. 4A, lane 5. The products GalNAc-GM1a, GalNAc-GM1b, and GalNAc-GA1 were analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry as described previously(20.Li S.-C. Wu Y.-Y. Sugiyama E. Taki T. Kasama T. Casellato R. Sonnino S. Li Y-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24246-24251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The strict specificity of GM2 activator protein and GM2A protein toward the hydrolysis of the terminal NeuAc from GalNAc-GD1a was further demonstrated by the comparison of this result with that of the parallel experiments carried out in the presence of 10 or 20 μM saposin B. The concentrations of saposin B were chosen according to our previous experience(20.Li S.-C. Wu Y.-Y. Sugiyama E. Taki T. Kasama T. Casellato R. Sonnino S. Li Y-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24246-24251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Our results clearly showed that in addition to GalNAc-GM1a and GalNAc-GA1, GalNAc-GM1b was also produced from GalNAc-GD1a in the presence of saposin B (Fig. 4A, 20 μM in lane 7 and 10 μM in lane 8). This indicates that saposin B can stimulate the hydrolyses of both NeuAc residues from GalNAc-GD1a. Since the concentrations of saposin B used in Fig. 4A were much higher than that of the two other activator proteins, we repeated the experiment using 20 μM of each activator protein. As shown in Fig. 4B, in the presence of GM2A protein (lane 2′) or GM2 activator protein (lane 3′), only GalNAc-GM1a and GalNAc-GA1 were produced. However, in the presence of saposin B (lane 1′), GalNAc-GM1b was also produced in addition to GalNAc-GM1a and GalNAc-GA1. These results suggest that GM2 activator protein and GM2A protein have the same specificity in recognizing the external NeuAc residue of GalNAc-GD1a. It is of interest to note that in the presence of 10 μM saposin B (Fig. 4A, lane 8), slightly more GalNAc-GM1a was produced than GalNAc-GM1b, while in the presence of 20 μM saposin B (Fig. 4A, lane 7), the reverse was observed. Thus, the concentration of saposin B appeared to influence the ratio of GalNAc-GM1a to GalNAc-GM1b produced from GalNAc-GD1a. In contrast, the production of only GalNAc-GM1a in the presence of GM2 activator protein or GM2A protein was not affected by the activator protein concentration. In spite of being different in their molecular sizes (18.5 kDa for GM2 activator protein and 13.5 kDa for GM2A protein), both GM2 activator protein and GM2A protein were able to stimulate the hydrolysis of the same NeuAc from GalNAc-GD1a. The above results strongly suggest that GM2A protein is also able to recognize the NeuAc residue in the GM2 epitope and its mode of action in stimulating the liberation of NeuAc from GM2 by clostridial sialidase is identical to that of GM2 activator protein. In view of the facts that the amino acid sequence of GM2A protein (except VST) is identical to the sequence of GM2 activator protein from 1 to 109 and that both proteins have the same stimulatory activity for the hydrolyses of the NeuAc from GM2 and GalNAc-GD1a, it is logical to assign the NeuAc recognition domain of GM2 activator protein to be within amino acids 1-109. As shown in Fig. 5A, while GM2 activator protein was an effective activator for the enzymatic hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2 (0.5 μM in lane 3, and 2.5 μM in lane 4), GM2A protein did not stimulate the hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A (0.5 μM in lane 5 and 2.5 μM in lane 6). The inability of GM2A protein to stimulate the conversion of GM2 to GM3 was further confirmed by examining the reaction at three different substrate concentrations (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that whatever enables GM2 activator protein to exert the stimulatory activity toward the hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A is absent in GM2A protein. It is reasonable to conclude that, in GM2 activator protein, the portion of the peptide sequence encoded by exon 4 may govern the recognition of the GalNAc residue in GM2 epitope and/or contribute to the formation of the essential conformation required for the specific recognition of the GalNAc residue. Thus, the 51 amino acids at the COOH terminus of GM2 activator protein must be crucial to make the GalNAc residue accessible to β-hexosaminidase A. The functional importance of the COOH-terminal segment of GM2 activator protein is supported by the fact that a case of type AB Tay-Sachs disease was found to be caused by a Arg → Pro mutation at the exon 4 coding region(29.Schröder M. Schnabel D. Hurwitz R. Young E. Suzuki K. Sandhoff K. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The Arg → Pro mutation may disrupt the tertiary structure of GM2 activator protein which is vital for its activity and/or stability. Although our results suggest that amino acids 1-109 of GM2 activator protein is sufficient for the stimulation of the cleavage of NeuAc from GM2 by clostridial sialidase and the 51 amino acids at the COOH terminus is essential for the stimulation of GalNAc cleavage from GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A, it is not possible at this point to ascertain if GM2 activator protein requires a simultaneous interaction with both GalNAc and NeuAc residues in the GM2 epitope for the stimulation of hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2. The fact that GM2 activator protein is not as effective in stimulating the hydrolysis of GA2 as that of GM2 by β-hexosaminidase A (19.Wu Y.-Y. Lockyer J.M. Sugiyama E. Pavlova N.V. Li Y-T. Li S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16276-16283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Li S.-C. Hirabayashi Y. Li Y.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6234-6240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the binding of both the NeuAc and the GalNAc residues in the GM2 epitope may be necessary for the action of GM2 activator protein on the hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2. We have synthesized a 23-mer peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”) which covers amino acids 106 through 128 of the GM2 activator protein. This segment of the peptide is encoded mostly by exon 4. The synthetic 23-mer peptide showed neither the stimulatory activity for the hydrolysis of GalNAc nor for the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2. When this peptide was mixed with GM2A protein, it did not enable GM2A protein to stimulate the hydrolysis of GalNAc from GM2. Taken together, our results indicate that the recognition of both the NeuAc and GalNAc residues in the GM2 epitope is a unique function of GM2 activator protein. As in the case of GM2 activator protein, GM2A protein also requires the hydrophobic lipid moiety of the substrate to express the stimulatory activity, since the oligosaccharide derived from GM2 was not hydrolyzed by β-hexosaminidase A or clostridial sialidase in the presence of GM2A protein. As reported previously, GM2A mRNA was found in both human placenta and fibroblasts, although in a much lower abundance than the mRNA of GM2 activator protein(12.Nagarajan S. Chen H.-C. Li S.-C. Li Y.-T. Lockyer J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This suggests that the existence of an alternative splicing for GM2 activator RNA may be physiologically important. Nature may use the alternative splicing of GM2 activator RNA to direct the catabolism of GM2. The production of GM2 activator mRNA or GM2A mRNA should lead to the production of GM2 activator protein or GM2A protein, respectively. In the presence of GM2 activator protein, the catabolism of GM2 may preferentially go through the cleavage of GalNAc residue, which is a well established pathway for the catabolism of GM2. This pathway explains the biochemical bases of Tay-Sachs diseases caused by the deficiency or the defect of β-hexosaminidase A, or GM2 activator protein. However, in the presence of GM2A protein the catabolism of GM2 might shift to a possible alternate pathway, GM2→GA2, since GM2A protein can only stimulate the hydrolysis of NeuAc from GM2 by clostridial sialidase, but not the hydrolysis of GalNAc. This would mean that the control of the production of GM2 activator mRNA and GM2A mRNA could be the branching point to direct the GM2 hydrolysis to GM2→GM3 or GM2→GA2 pathways. The possible in vivo pathway for the conversion of GM2 to GA2 has been proposed by Riboni et al.(31.Riboni L. Caminiti A. Bassi R. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in studies on the Neuro2a cell line. The authors suggested that the GA2 pathway was carried out by a specific sialidase which could convert GM2 to GA2. It has also been suggested by Fingerhut et al.(32.Fingerhut R. Van Der Horst G.T.J. Verheijen F.W. Conzelmann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the degradation of gangliosides by lysosomal sialidase also required an activator protein. The question of the physiological role of GM2A protein will remain unanswered until the native GM2A protein is isolated. By SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis, we have observed the presence of a protein band corresponding to 13 kDa which reacted with the antibody against GM2 activator protein in the partially purified placental GM2 activator protein preparation. At the present time, the isolation of GM2A protein is hampered by the lack of an assay method which can distinguish GM2A protein from GM2 activator protein."

This region contains a transactivation domain function (AF-1), which can synergize with AF-2, located in the ligand binding domain (reviewed in (14.Keaveney M. Stunnenberg H.G. Baverle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. 2. Birkhauser, Boston1995: 182-242Google Scholar)). In this report we demonstrate that RXRα and RXRβ differentially transactivate the RXRE from the rat CRBP II promoter in NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells but similarly in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. We have tested a series of chimeric receptors to elucidate the domains responsible for the differences in transcriptional activation. Our results showed that both the A/B and D domains are involved in dictating the output of the cell-dependent transcriptional response. Hence, these two regions cooperate with each other and potentially with other cell-specific factors to maintain the specificity of the response, thus providing the functional elements necessary for eliciting subtype-specific and cell type-specific transcriptional regulation. The reporter construct CRBPII(2)tk-luc, containing two copies of the CRBP II RXRE in front of the thymidine kinase promoter driving the luciferase coding sequence, was described previously(9.Medin J. Minucci S. Driggers P. Lee I. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; . 105: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RSVH-2RIIBP(7.Marks M.S. Hallenbeck P.L. Nagata T. Segars J.H. Appella E.

The RXRα clone was a generous gift from Drs. Ron Evans and David Mangelsdorf(12.Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ono E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Five-part chimeric receptors were created from the original cDNAs coding for RXRα and RXRβ(7.Marks M.S. Hallenbeck P.L.

The sites used were either existing restriction sites or sites created by PCR introducing silent mutations. All sites and regions were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). Each chimeric exchange was made in regions of high conservation, and no novel amino acids were introduced. PCR fragments were first cloned into pCRscript (Stratagene) and sequenced utilizing an ABI DNA sequencer. Subcloning was then performed in pSP72 to characterize the constructs by in vitro transcription-translation(6.Hallenbeck P.L. Marks M.S. Lippoldt R.E. Ozato K. Nikodem V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Following confirmation, the full-length chimeric genes were cleaved from the pSP72 construct by digestion with HindIII/HpaI and cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector RSVneo cleaved with HindIII/HpaI, resulting in replacement of the neo sequence with that of the receptors. When it was necessary to clone into the HincII site, the HpaI site in pSP72 was eliminated by insertion of an oligonucleotide containing SmaI, DraI, and SnaB1 restriction sites, and one of them was utilized to clone in the HpaI site of RSVneo(6.Hallenbeck P.L. Marks M.S. Lippoldt R.E. Ozato K. Nikodem V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5572-5576Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For the RXRα receptor the restriction sites used to make the five-part chimeras were a HindIII site (artificially created) at base pair (bp) 85 of the original cDNA, a PvuII site at bp 560, a HincII site at bp 738, an XbaI site at bp 818, a BamHI site at bp 964, and a HpaI site at bp 1532. The chimeric parts were named α1, α2, α3, α4, and α5 (see Fig. 2). The correct PvuII site for RXRα was selected by partial digestion. RXRΔαα[ααα] was made by deleting the region between the HindIII site and PvuII site of the RXRα construct and replacing it with the AUG start codon and 12 nucleotides upstream from position 315 of RXRα. For the RXRβ receptor, the corresponding sites used were the HindIII site created by PCR immediately upstream of the native NcoI site at bp 155, a PvuII site at bp 400, a HincII site at bp 578, an XbaI site at bp 652, a BamHI site at bp 808, and the HpaI site at bp 1360. The chimeric parts were named β1, β2, β3, β4, and β5 (see Fig. 2). Transfections into NIH 3T3 cells were performed as described(20.Hallenbeck P.L. Phyillaier M. Nikodem V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3825-3828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, for NIH 3T3 cells 10 μg of reporter plasmid was electroporated into 4.4 × 106 cells with 12.5 μg of native or chimeric receptor plasmid. Following the transfections, the cells were cultured for 60 h with 1 μM 9cRA (a gift from Dr. Arthur Levin at Hoffmann-La Roche). P19 cells were transfected by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described(22.Dey A. Minucci S. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8191-8201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following an overnight incubation with the DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture, 9cRA (1 μM) was added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h in the presence of the hormone. After lysing the cells, luciferase activity assays were performed as described (21.Minucci S. Zand B. Dey A. Marks M. Nagata T. Grippo J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 360-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and normalized by utilizing a β-galactosidase expression vector included in the transfection. Results represent the average of a minimum of three independent transfections performed in duplicate. Several reports have suggested that there may be RXR subtype-specific differences in 9cRA-dependent transcriptional activation on particular response elements(11.Nagpal S. Sanders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri N. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 12.Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ono E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 19.Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 6: 2349-2360Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We compared the transcriptional activation mediated by RXRα and RXRβ in transient transfection assays in NIH 3T3 cells cotransfected with either receptor and a reporter construct containing the luciferase reporter gene linked to the CRBP II RXRE and the thymidine kinase basal promoter (Fig. 1). In the presence of 9cRA, RXRα was 20-fold more efficient in transactivating the CRBP II response element than RXRβ. Western immunoblot analysis performed after transfection of RXRα and RXRβ constructs containing C termini tagged with flag epitope demonstrated that the difference in transcriptional activation could not be attributed simply to differences in the levels of expression of these receptors (data not shown). We also examined the transcriptional activation in P19 cells. Interestingly, both RXRα and RXRβ showed very similar levels of transcriptional activation in P19 cells (Fig. 1). In order to better understand the structural requirements underlying the differences in transcriptional activation observed in NIH 3T3 cells, we constructed a series of chimeras between these two receptors (Fig. 2). Each receptor was subdivided into five parts. Parts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 correspond to the A/B, C, N and C termini of D, and the E domain, respectively. The expected molecular masses for the chimeric receptors were demonstrated following separation of in vitro transcription-translation products by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Finally, the functional integrity of each receptor was confirmed by transfection of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells. Each chimera in P19 cells showed comparable levels of transcriptional activation, differing less than 2-fold, in the presence of 9cRA on the CRBP II response element (Fig. 3). Next, we tested each chimera in NIH 3T3 cells to identify the functional determinants responsible for the differences between the two receptors (Fig. 4). As shown in Fig. 1, RXRα was approximately 20-fold more active than RXRβ under identical conditions of transfection (compare lane 1 with 2 in Fig. 4A). This difference was independent of part 2 (the C domain) since the exchange of the RXRα part 2 with the corresponding part 2 of RXRβ (RXRαβ[ααα]) was as efficient as the RXRα (compare lane 1 with 15 in Fig. 4A). Similarly, the RXRβ part 2 substituted for the RXRα part 2 in the context of the RXRβ receptor (RXRβα[βββ]) (compare lane 2 with 9). This result was expected, since the two receptors are more than 95% homologous in the C domain corresponding to DBD (Fig. 2A). However, it was not possible to completely rule out any involvement of part 2, since RXRββ[ααα] gave lower transactivation than RXRβα[ααα] (compare lane 13 with 14), suggesting that the C domain may contribute to optimal folding. In agreement with a previous report(23.Chen H. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), our results point out that the A/B domain of RXRα is absolutely required for achieving the high level of transcriptional activation observed with RXRαα[ααα], since, when partially deleted (RXRΔαα[ααα]), a 4-fold decrease in transcriptional activation was observed (Fig. 4A, compare lane 1 with 3). In addition, the A/B domain (part 1) of RXRβ could not functionally substitute for that of RXRα (RXRβα[ααα]) (compare lane 1 with 13). These results confirm an earlier report (19.Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 6: 2349-2360Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar) suggesting that the A/B domain of RXRα, but not RXRβ, exhibits a transcriptional activating function (AF-1). The A/B domain of RXRα, however, was not sufficient to induce the high level of 9cRA-dependent reporter activation observed with RXRαα[ααα], when linked to the C terminus (D and E domains, parts 3, 4, 5) of RXRβ (RXRαα[βββ]) (Fig. 4A, compare lane 6 with 1). In addition, the C terminus of RXRα mediated slightly elevated transactivation above the levels found for RXRβ, when linked to the RXRβ A/B domain (RXRββ[ααα]) (compare lane 2 with 14). Taken together, these results imply that both the A/B domain and the C terminus of RXRα are necessary for high transcriptional activation of the CRBP II RXRE in NIH 3T3 cells. Next, we defined the functional part of the RXRα C terminus involved in the observed effects by testing chimeras that exchanged both the D (parts 3 and 4) and E (part 5) domains. When the E domain of RXRβ was switched with that of RXRα, the resultant chimera, RXRαα[ααβ] gave nearly the equivalent amount of transcriptional activity as RXRαα[ααα] (compare lane 7 with 1). Therefore, the E domain does not appear to contribute to the observed receptor subtype specificity. Several lines of evidence derived from our experiments suggest that the D domain (containing chimeric parts 3 and 4) and the A/B domain are critical for the proper functioning of RXRα in NIH 3T3 cells. When the D domain of RXRαα[ααβ] is replaced by the D domain of β, RXRαα[βββ], the reporter activity decreases about 75% (compare lane 7 with 6). Furthermore, the D domain of RXRα functioned less efficiently when linked to the RXRβ A/B domain (compare lane 8 with 13). Thus, the maximum effect was only observed when the A/B and the D domains were both from RXRα (compare lane 6 with 7 and lane 7 with 12). Taking into account that the E domains are fully exchangeable, these results strongly imply that the D and A/B domains function in concert to achieve optimal transcriptional activation in NIH 3T3 cells. Based on these results, we further dissected the D domain to identify the portion responsible for this effect. Region D includes the A box and ends at the N terminus of the E domain (Fig. 2, B and C). The A box is a seven-residue region that was originally shown to be critical for binding of the orphan receptor NGFI-B to its response element(14.Keaveney M. Stunnenberg H.G. Baverle P.A.

Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The resolution of the three-dimensional structure of the RXR DBD has shown that the A box is included in a helical region beginning after the second zinc finger of the DBD(25.Lee M. Sem D.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1994; 260: 1117-1121Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). This helix includes also the so-called T box that forms a dimerization interface critical in the binding of homo- and heterodimeric DBDs to some response elements(14.Keaveney M. Stunnenberg H.G. Baverle P.A. Inducible Gene Expression. 2. Birkhauser, Boston1995: 182-242Google Scholar, 15.Glass C. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Zechel C. Shem X-Q. Chambon P.

Science. 1994; 260: 1117-1121Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). New chimeras, which exchanged the N terminus, including the A box (part 3), or the C-terminal region (part 4) of the D domain (Fig. 2C), were tested for their transcriptional activation. When part 4 of RXRβ was used to replace the corresponding portion in RXRα (RXRαα[αβα]), less than 2-fold reduction in overall reporter activity was observed (compare lanes 1 and 4 in Fig. 4A). However, a more dramatic effect was seen when part 3 of RXRβ was substituted for the analogous region of RXRα (RXRαα[βαα]). Although the transactivation in the presence of hormone was reduced less than 2-fold (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 1 and 5), a 10-fold increase in transactivation in the absence of hormone was detected (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 5). Interestingly, this increase in basal activity occurred only when part 3 of the β receptor was substituted for the same part in a receptor containing RXRα A/B domain (RXRαα[βββ]) and not when linked to the RXRβ A/B domain (RXRβα[βββ]) (compare lanes 6 and 9 in Fig. 4B). In addition, when the E domain (part 5) of the α receptor was substituted by the E domain of the β receptor (RXRαα[ααβ]), an increase of basal activity, although weaker than the chimeras described above, was observed (compare lane 7 with 1, Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the hormone-independent enhancement of basal activity observed in these chimeras demonstrates the functional interaction of the D domain and to some degree the E domain with the A/B domain. Therefore, regions 3 in the D domain and the E domain must be from RXRα to achieve repression of the N-terminal AF-1 in the absence of hormone (Fig. 4A, lane 1). The importance of the RXRα part 3 for 9cRA-dependent maximal activity in NIH 3T3 cells, in the absence of an increase in basal activity, was also demonstrated using chimeras containing the RXRβ A/B domain. When construct 11 (RXRβα[βαβ]) was tested in NIH 3T3 cells, an 8-fold 9cRA-dependent induction was observed (Fig. 4A, lane 11). However, when part 3 of this construct was replaced with the corresponding part from RXRα (RXRβα[ααβ]), a further increase of the reporter activity (up to 70-fold 9cRA-dependent induction) was observed (lane 12 compared with lane 11). Although the levels of reporter activity observed in the presence of RXRβα[ααβ] is much lower than the levels observed with RXRαα[ααβ], the latter containing the A/B domain of RXRα, it demonstrates again the importance of part 3. The fact that the D domain of RXRα is involved in both the inhibition of AF1 in the absence of hormone and in hormone-dependent inducibility adds to the growing list of regulatory functions attributed to this region. Other than the T and A boxes, immediately 3′ of the A box is a 70-amino acid region, which has been shown to be responsible for the divergent transcriptional activities between the RARα, -β, and -γ subtypes in response to various retinoids (25.Lee M. Sem D.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1994; 260: 1117-1121Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The data presented here also support the conclusion that there is an AF1 present in RXRα but not in RXRβ(11.Nagpal S. Sanders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri N. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 19.Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 6: 2349-2360Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Chen and Privalsky (23.Chen H. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have provided evidence that RXRα binds to the CRBP II RXRE as a tetramer, while the A/B domain of RXRβ is involved in inhibiting the tetrameric binding of RXRβ to the CRBP II response element. Differences in DNA binding properties between the receptors have been invoked as the cause for the different transactivation levels observed in SL-2 cells(23.Chen H. Privalsky M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that, in addition to the intrinsic DNA binding properties of the receptors, interactions with a cell-specific factor(s) or cell type-specific post-translational modifications may be involved, given the differences in response mediated by RXRα and RXRβ observed in P19 and NIH 3T3 cells. Finally, it should be emphasized that, although this study addresses the activities of RXR homodimers, a differential role of RXR subtypes and cell type-specific differences in transcriptional activation might also be found in the regulation of gene expression mediated by RXR heterodimerization with other nuclear receptors."
