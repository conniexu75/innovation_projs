https://openalex.org/W3015035400,"PD-1 plus CTLA-4 blockade is highly effective in advanced-stage, mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient (dMMR) colorectal cancers, yet not in MMR-proficient (pMMR) tumors. We postulated a higher efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in early-stage colon cancers. In the exploratory NICHE study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03026140), patients with dMMR or pMMR tumors received a single dose of ipilimumab and two doses of nivolumab before surgery, the pMMR group with or without celecoxib. The primary objective was safety and feasibility; 40 patients with 21 dMMR and 20 pMMR tumors were treated, and 3 patients received nivolumab monotherapy in the safety run-in. Treatment was well tolerated and all patients underwent radical resections without delays, meeting the primary endpoint. Of the patients who received ipilimumab + nivolumab (20 dMMR and 15 pMMR tumors), 35 were evaluable for efficacy and translational endpoints. Pathological response was observed in 20/20 (100%; 95% exact confidence interval (CI): 86-100%) dMMR tumors, with 19 major pathological responses (MPRs, ≤10% residual viable tumor) and 12 pathological complete responses. In pMMR tumors, 4/15 (27%; 95% exact CI: 8-55%) showed pathological responses, with 3 MPRs and 1 partial response. CD8+PD-1+ T cell infiltration was predictive of response in pMMR tumors. These data indicate that neoadjuvant immunotherapy may have the potential to become the standard of care for a defined group of colon cancer patients when validated in larger studies with at least 3 years of disease-free survival data."
https://openalex.org/W3014990176,"To disseminate research, scholars once relied on university media services or journal press releases, but today any academic can turn to Twitter to share their published work with a broader audience. The possibility that scholars can push their research out, rather than hope that it is pulled in, holds the potential for scholars to draw wide attention to their research. In this manuscript, we examine whether there are systematic differences in the types of scholars who most benefit from this push model. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which there are gender differences in the dissemination of research via Twitter. We carry out our analyses by tracking tweet patterns for articles published in six journals across two fields (political science and communication), and we pair this Twitter data with demographic and educational data about the authors of the published articles, as well as article citation rates. We find considerable evidence that, overall, article citations are positively correlated with tweets about the article, and we find little evidence to suggest that author gender affects the transmission of research in this new media."
https://openalex.org/W3012822000,"Abstract Cellular immunity is critical for controlling intracellular pathogens, but individual cellular dynamics and cell–cell cooperativity in evolving human immune responses remain poorly understood. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) represents a powerful tool for dissecting complex multicellular behaviors in health and disease 1,2 and nominating testable therapeutic targets 3 . Its application to longitudinal samples could afford an opportunity to uncover cellular factors associated with the evolution of disease progression without potentially confounding inter-individual variability 4 . Here, we present an experimental and computational methodology that uses scRNA-seq to characterize dynamic cellular programs and their molecular drivers, and apply it to HIV infection. By performing scRNA-seq on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from four untreated individuals before and longitudinally during acute infection 5 , we were powered within each to discover gene response modules that vary by time and cell subset. Beyond previously unappreciated individual- and cell-type-specific interferon-stimulated gene upregulation, we describe temporally aligned gene expression responses obscured in bulk analyses, including those involved in proinflammatory T cell differentiation, prolonged monocyte major histocompatibility complex II upregulation and persistent natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic killing. We further identify response features arising in the first weeks of infection, for example proliferating natural killer cells, which potentially may associate with future viral control. Overall, our approach provides a unified framework for characterizing multiple dynamic cellular responses and their coordination."

https://openalex.org/W3012758303,"While polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are poised to be translated into clinical practice through prediction of inborn health risks1, a strategy to utilize genetics to prioritize modifiable risk factors driving heath outcome is warranted2. To this end, we investigated the association of the genetic susceptibility to complex traits with human lifespan in collaboration with three worldwide biobanks (ntotal = 675,898; BioBank Japan (n = 179,066), UK Biobank (n = 361,194) and FinnGen (n = 135,638)). In contrast to observational studies, in which discerning the cause-and-effect can be difficult, PRSs could help to identify the driver biomarkers affecting human lifespan. A high systolic blood pressure PRS was trans-ethnically associated with a shorter lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.03[1.02–1.04], Pmeta = 3.9 × 10−13) and parental lifespan (hazard ratio = 1.06[1.06–1.07], P = 2.0 × 10−86). The obesity PRS showed distinct effects on lifespan in Japanese and European individuals (Pheterogeneity = 9.5 × 10−8 for BMI). The causal effect of blood pressure and obesity on lifespan was further supported by Mendelian randomization studies. Beyond genotype–phenotype associations, our trans-biobank study offers a new value of PRSs in prioritization of risk factors that could be potential targets of medical treatment to improve population health. Cross-biobank analysis reveals that polygenic risk scores (PRS) for hypertension and obesity are associated with shorter lifespan, serving as a proof-of-principle that PRS could pinpoint causal risk factors that affect long-term health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3014346297,"Doublecortin like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is an understudied kinase that is upregulated in a wide range of cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, little is known about its potential as a therapeutic target. We used chemoproteomic profiling and structure-based design to develop a selective, in vivo-compatible chemical probe of the DCLK1 kinase domain, DCLK1-IN-1. We demonstrate activity of DCLK1-IN-1 against clinically relevant patient-derived PDAC organoid models and use a combination of RNA-sequencing, proteomics and phosphoproteomics analysis to reveal that DCLK1 inhibition modulates proteins and pathways associated with cell motility in this context. DCLK1-IN-1 will serve as a versatile tool to investigate DCLK1 biology and establish its role in cancer. A highly selective inhibitor of the DCLK1/2 kinases is used to uncover the consequences of DCLK1 inhibition on viability, phosphosignaling and the transcriptome in patient-derived organoid models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W3014321121,"Natural organisms use a four-letter genetic alphabet that makes available 64 triplet codons, of which 61 are sense codons used to encode proteins with the 20 canonical amino acids. We have shown that the unnatural nucleotides dNaM and dTPT3 can pair to form an unnatural base pair (UBP) and allow for the creation of semisynthetic organisms (SSOs) with additional sense codons. Here, we report a systematic analysis of the unnatural codons. We identify nine unnatural codons that can produce unnatural protein with nearly complete incorporation of an encoded noncanonical amino acid (ncAA). We also show that at least three of the codons are orthogonal and can be simultaneously decoded in the SSO, affording the first 67-codon organism. The ability to incorporate multiple, different ncAAs site specifically into a protein should now allow the development of proteins with novel activities, and possibly even SSOs with new forms and functions. Systematic characterization of codons using the unnatural base pair dNaM·dTPT3 leads to the discovery of nine new functional codon–anticodon pairs, three of which are shown to be orthogonally decoded by ribosomes and allow incorporation of up to three noncanonical amino acids in Escherichia coli."

https://openalex.org/W3015188018,"Background Predicting which children will go on to develop mental health symptoms as adolescents is critical for early intervention and preventing future, severe negative outcomes. Although many aspects of a child’s life, personality, and symptoms have been flagged as indicators, there is currently no model created to screen the general population for the risk of developing mental health problems. Additionally, the advent of machine learning techniques represents an exciting way to potentially improve upon the standard prediction modelling technique, logistic regression. Therefore, we aimed to I.) develop a model that can predict mental health problems in mid-adolescence II.) investigate if machine learning techniques (random forest, support vector machines, neural network, and XGBoost) will outperform logistic regression. Methods In 7,638 twins from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden we used 474 predictors derived from parental report and register data. The outcome, mental health problems, was determined by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Model performance was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Although model performance varied somewhat, the confidence interval overlapped for each model indicating non-significant superiority for the random forest model (AUC = 0.739, 95% CI 0.708–0.769), followed closely by support vector machines (AUC = 0.735, 95% CI 0.707–0.764). Conclusion Ultimately, our top performing model would not be suitable for clinical use, however it lays important groundwork for future models seeking to predict general mental health outcomes. Future studies should make use of parent-rated assessments when possible. Additionally, it may not be necessary for similar studies to forgo logistic regression in favor of other more complex methods."
https://openalex.org/W3014239648,"Dysfunction of the circadian rhythm is one of most common nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), but the molecular role of the circadian rhythm in PD is unclear. We here showed that inactivation of brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1) in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,4,5-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice resulted in obvious motor functional deficit, loss of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), decrease of dopamine (DA) transmitter, and increased activation of microglia and astrocytes in the striatum. Time on the rotarod or calorie consumption, and food and water intake were reduced in the Bmal1−/− mice after MPTP treatment, suggesting that absence of Bmal1 may exacerbate circadian and PD motor function. We observed a significant reduction of DANs (~35%) in the SNpc, the tyrosine hydroxylase protein level in the striatum (~60%), the DA (~22%), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid content (~29%), respectively, in MPTP-treated Bmal1−/− mice. Loss of Bmal1 aggravated the inflammatory reaction both in vivo and in vitro. These findings suggest that BMAL1 may play an essential role in the survival of DANs and maintain normal function of the DA signaling pathway via regulating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W3014144099,"Growing evidence suggests that the efficacy of immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) is associated with the immune microenvironment within the tumor. We aimed to explore radiologic phenotyping using a radiomics approach to assess the immune microenvironment in NSCLC. Two independent NSCLC cohorts (training and test sets) were included. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis was used to determine the tumor microenvironment, where type 1 helper T (Th1) cells, type 2 helper T (Th2) cells, and cytotoxic T cells were the targets for prediction with computed tomographic (CT) radiomic features. Multiple algorithms were in the modeling followed by final model selection. The training dataset comprised 89 NSCLCs and the test set included 60 cases of lung squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. A total of 239 CT radiomic features were used. A linear discriminant analysis model was selected for the final model of Th2 cell group prediction. The area under the curve value of the final model on the test set was 0.684. Predictors of the linear discriminant analysis model were skewness (total and outer pixels), kurtosis, variance (subsampled from delta [subtraction inner pixels from outer pixels]), and informational measure of correlation. The performances of radiomics on test set of Th1 and cytotoxic T cell were not accurate enough to be predictable. A radiomics approach can be used to interrogate an entire tumor in a noninvasive manner and provide added diagnostic value to identify the immune microenvironment of NSCLC, in particular, Th2 cell signatures."
https://openalex.org/W3014915090,"The purpose was to determine the role of AMPK activation in the renal metabolic response to sepsis, the development of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and on survival. In a prospective experimental study, 167 10- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) and human proximal tubule epithelial cells (TEC; HK2) were exposed to inflammatory mix (IM), a combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Renal/TEC metabolic fitness was assessed by monitoring the expression of drivers of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), the rates of utilization of OXPHOS/glycolysis in response to metabolic stress, and mitochondrial function by measuring O2 consumption rates (OCR) and the membrane potential (Δψm). Sepsis/IM resulted in AKI, increased mortality, and in renal AMPK activation 6-24 hours after CLP/IM. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) or metformin during sepsis improved the survival, while AMPK inhibition with Compound C increased mortality, impaired mitochondrial respiration, decreased OCR, and disrupted TEC metabolic fitness. AMPK-driven protection was associated with increased Sirt 3 expression and restoration of metabolic fitness. Renal AMPK activation in response to sepsis/IM is an adaptive mechanism that protects TEC, organs, and the host by preserving mitochondrial function and metabolic fitness likely through Sirt3 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3014393611,"Anecdotal evidence from philanthropic fundraisers shows that virtual reality (VR) technology increases empathy and can influence people toward pro-environmental behavior. Non-profit organizations are increasingly marketing their causes using virtual reality and they report increased donations when VR technology is employed. In VR, users are immersed in situations intended to feel more like the real world through technology, such as 360° video viewed through 3D headsets that block out visual and auditory distractions. The framing of the message as either positive or negative has long shown to have an effect on behavior, although consensus on the impact of framing has not been reached in relation to encouraging contributions to public goods. This paper focuses on field experiments used to investigate the effects of varying degrees of visual immersion and positive versus negative message framing on respondents' contributions to a conservation charity. Participants were exposed to a five-minute underwater film about coral reefs and the importance of protecting them. We employed a 2x2 experimental design using 3D head-mounted displays comparing 360° film footage vs. unidirectional film and a positive message vs. a negative message. After watching the film, each participant completed a short questionnaire and had the opportunity to donate to a marine conservation charity. In addition, we tested a control treatment where no video was observed. The video was filmed in Indonesia which is host to some of the world's most biodiverse reefs that are under great threat from human activity. We also conducted the study in Indonesia, sampling a total of 1006 participants from the Bogor city area and tourists on the island of Gili Trawangan-which is popular for scuba diving and snorkeling. We find significant differences in observed behavior and reported emotions between all treatments compared to the control condition. Among the tourist sample, we find significant differences between the 360° film with a negative message which garnered significantly larger average donation amounts compared to the unidirectional film with both positive and negative framing. Overall, we can infer from these studies that virtual reality is an effective way to raise awareness of environmental threats and encourage behavioral action, especially when tailored to target groups. New technology, such as the VR head-mounted display, is highly effective at attracting interest which is an important point to encourage organizations to invest in new technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3014178253,"Bile acids (BAs) have been implicated in regulation of intestinal epithelial signaling and function. This study aimed to investigate the effects of hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) on intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and explore the underlying mechanisms. IPEC-J2 cells and weaned piglets were treated with HDCA and the contributions of cellular signaling pathways, BAs metabolism profiles and gut bacteria were assessed. In vitro, HDCA suppressed IPEC-J2 proliferation via the BAs receptor FXR but not TGR5. In addition, HDCA inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway, while knockdown of FXR or constitutive activation of AKT eliminated the inhibitory effects of HDCA, suggesting that FXR-dependent inhibition of PI3K/AKT pathway was involved in HDCA-suppressed IPEC-J2 proliferation. In vivo, dietary HDCA inhibited intestinal expression of proliferative markers and PI3K/AKT pathway in weaned piglets. Meanwhile, HDCA altered the BAs metabolism profiles, with decrease in primary BA and increase in total and secondary BAs in feces, and reduction of conjugated BAs in serum. Furthermore, HDCA increased abundance of the gut bacteria associated with BAs metabolism, and thereby induced BAs profiles alternation, which might indirectly contribute to HDCA-suppressed cell proliferation. Together, HDCA suppressed intestinal epithelial cell proliferation through FXR-PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, accompanied by alteration of BAs metabolism profiles induced by gut bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3014314962,"Over the past 20 years, various identifiers of cellular senescence have been used to quantify the abundance of these cells in different tissues. These include classic markers such as p16, senescence-associated β-gal, and γH2AX, in addition to more recent markers (Sudan Black B and HMGB1). In vivo data on the usefulness of these markers in skeletal muscle are very limited and inconsistent. In the present study, we attempted to identify senescent cells in frozen human skeletal muscle biopsies using these markers to determine the effects of age and obesity on senescent cell burden; however, we were only able to assess the abundance of DNA-damaged nuclei using γH2AX immunohistochemistry. The abundance of γH2AX+ cells, including satellite cells, was not higher in muscle from old compared to young individuals; however, γH2AX+ cells were higher with obesity. Additionally, terminally differentiated, postmitotic myofiber nuclei from obese individuals had elevated γH2AX abundance compared to muscle from lean individuals. Analyses of gene expression support the conclusion that the elevated DNA damage and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype are preferentially associated with obesity in skeletal muscle. These data implicate obesity as a larger contributor to DNA damage in skeletal muscle than aging; however, more sensitive senescence markers for human skeletal muscle are needed to determine if these cells are in fact senescent."
https://openalex.org/W3015182586,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by attack on oligodendrocytes within the central nervous system (CNS). Despite widespread use of immunomodulatory therapies, patients may still face progressive disability because of failure of myelin regeneration and loss of neurons, suggesting additional cellular pathologies. Here, we describe a general approach for identifying specific cell types in which a disease allele exerts a pathogenic effect. Applying this approach to MS risk loci, we pinpoint likely pathogenic cell types for 70%. In addition to T cell loci, we unexpectedly identified myeloid- and CNS-specific risk loci, including two sites that dysregulate transcriptional pause release in oligodendrocytes. Functional studies demonstrated inhibition of transcriptional elongation is a dominant pathway blocking oligodendrocyte maturation. Furthermore, pause release factors are frequently dysregulated in MS brain tissue. These data implicate cell-intrinsic aberrations outside of the immune system and suggest new avenues for therapeutic development. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W3014372870,"Growth-mediated feedback between synthetic gene circuits and host organisms leads to diverse emerged behaviors, including growth bistability and enhanced ultrasensitivity. However, the range of possible impacts of growth feedback on gene circuits remains underexplored. Here we mathematically and experimentally demonstrated that growth feedback affects the functions of memory circuits in a network topology-dependent way. Specifically, the memory of the self-activation switch is quickly lost due to the growth-mediated dilution of the circuit products. Decoupling of growth feedback reveals its memory, manifested by its hysteresis property across a broad range of inducer concentration. On the contrary, the toggle switch is more refractory to growth-mediated dilution and can retrieve its memory after the fast-growth phase. The underlying principle lies in the different dependence of active and repressive regulations in these circuits on the growth-mediated dilution. Our results unveil the topology-dependent mechanism on how growth-mediated feedback influences the behaviors of gene circuits. Synthetic circuit-host interactions affect the performance synthetic biology systems. Analysis of two bi-stable switch circuits reveals differential effects of host growth on circuit memory, which is dependent on the network topology of the circuit."
https://openalex.org/W3014712910,"Although liquid biopsies offer many advantages over tissue biopsies, they are not yet standard practice. An important reason for the lack of implementation is the unavailability of well standardized techniques and guidelines, especially for pre-analytical conditions which are an important factor causing the current sensitivity issues. To overcome these limitations, we investigated the effect of several pre-analytical conditions on the concentration of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and cellular genomic DNA (gDNA) contamination. Urine samples from healthy volunteers (HVs) and cancer patients were collected and processed according to specific pre-analytical conditions. Our results show that in samples with a relatively small volume more than 50% of the cfDNA can be found in the first 50 mL of the urine sample. The total DNA concentration increased again when samples were collected more than 3.5 hours apart. Adding preservative to urine samples is recommended to obtain high concentrations of cfDNA. To remove the cellular content, high speed centrifugation protocols as 4,000g 10min or 3,000g 15min are ideal for urine collected in cfDNA Urine Preserve (Streck). Although this study was a pilot study and needs to be confirmed in a larger study population, clear trends in the effect of several pre-analytical conditions were observed."

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the PCEPA on sex workers' access to health, violence, and sex worker-led services.MethodsLongitudinal data were drawn from a community-based cohort of ~900 cis and trans women sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. Multivariable logistic regression examined the independent effect of the post-PCEPA period (2015-2017) versus the pre-PCEPA period (2010-2013) on time-updated measures of sex workers' access to health, violence supports, and sex worker/community-led services.ResultsThe PCEPA was independently correlated with reduced odds of having access to health services when needed (AOR 0.59; 95%CI: 0.45-0.78) and community-led services (AOR 0.77; 95%CI: 0.62-0.95). Among sex workers who experienced physical violence/sexual violence or trauma, there was no significant difference in access to counseling supports post-PCEPA (AOR 1.24; 95%CI: 0.93-1.64).ConclusionSex workers experienced significantly reduced access to critical health and sex worker/community-led services following implementation of the new laws. Findings suggest end-demand laws may exacerbate and reproduce harms of previous criminalized approaches to sex work in Canada. This study is one of the first globally to evaluate the impact of end-demand approaches to sex work. There is a critical evidence-based need to move away from criminalization of sex work worldwide to ensure full labor and human rights for sex workers. Findings warn against adopting end-demand approaches in other cities or jurisdictions."
https://openalex.org/W3014199639,"Cancer treatment generally involves drugs used in combinations. Most previous work has focused on identifying and understanding synergistic drug-drug interactions; however, understanding antagonistic interactions remains an important and understudied issue. To enrich for antagonism and reveal common features of these combinations, we screened all pairwise combinations of drugs characterized as activators of regulated cell death. This network is strongly enriched for antagonism, particularly a form of antagonism that we call 'single-agent dominance'. Single-agent dominance refers to antagonisms in which a two-drug combination phenocopies one of the two agents. Dominance results from differences in cell death onset time, with dominant drugs acting earlier than their suppressed counterparts. We explored mechanisms by which parthanatotic agents dominate apoptotic agents, finding that dominance in this scenario is caused by mutually exclusive and conflicting use of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Taken together, our study reveals death kinetics as a predictive feature of antagonism, due to inhibitory crosstalk between cell death pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3014597830,"Cultural competency describes interventions that aim to improve accessibility and effectiveness of health services for people from ethnic minority backgrounds. Interventions include interpreter services, migrant peer educators and health worker training to provide culturally competent care. Very few studies have focussed on cultural competency for migrant service use in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). Migrants and refugees in Thailand and Malaysia report difficulties in accessing health systems and discrimination by service providers. In this paper we describe stakeholder perceptions of migrants' and health workers' language and cultural competency, and how this affects migrant workers' health, especially in Malaysia where an interpreter system has not yet been formalised.We conducted in-depth interviews with stakeholders in Malaysia (N = 44) and Thailand (N = 50), alongside policy document review in both countries. Data were analysed thematically. Results informed development of Systems Thinking diagrams hypothesizing potential intervention points to improve cultural competency, namely via addressing language barriers.Language ability was a core tenet of cultural competency as described by participants in both countries. Malay was perceived to be an easy language that migrants could learn quickly, with perceived proficiency differing by source country and length of stay in Malaysia. Language barriers were a source of frustration for both migrants and health workers, which compounded communication of complex conditions including mental health as well as obtaining informed consent from migrant patients. Health workers in Malaysia used strategies including google translate and hand gestures to communicate, while migrant patients were encouraged to bring friends to act as informal interpreters during consultations. Current health services are not migrant friendly, which deters use. Concerns around overuse of services by non-citizens among the domestic population may partly explain the lack of policy support for cultural competency in Malaysia. Service provision for migrants in Thailand was more culturally sensitive as formal interpreters, known as Migrant Health Workers (MHW), could be hired in public facilities, as well as Migrant Health Volunteers (MHV) who provide basic health education in communities.Perceptions of overuse by migrants in a health system acts as a barrier against system or institutional level improvements for cultural competency, in an already stretched health system. At the micro-level, language interventions with migrant workers appear to be the most feasible leverage point but raises the question of who should bear responsibility for cost and provision-employers, the government, or migrants themselves."
https://openalex.org/W3014943232,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been hypothesized to be a result of the interplay between genetic predisposition and increased vulnerability to early environmental insults. Mitochondrial dysfunctions appear also involved in ASD pathophysiology, but the mechanisms by which such alterations develop are not completely understood. Here, we analyzed ASD primary fibroblasts by measuring mitochondrial bioenergetics, ultrastructural and dynamic parameters to investigate the hypothesis that defects in these pathways could be interconnected phenomena responsible or consequence for the redox imbalance observed in ASD. High levels of 4-hydroxynonenal protein adducts together with increased NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphateoxidase) activity and mitochondrial superoxide production coupled with a compromised antioxidant response guided by a defective Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 pathway confirmed an unbalanced redox homeostasis in ASD. Moreover, ASD fibroblasts showed overactive mitochondrial bioenergetics associated with atypical morphology and altered expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes and dynamics-regulating factors. We suggest that many of the changes observed in mitochondria could represent compensatory mechanisms by which ASD cells try to adapt to altered energy demand, possibly resulting from a chronic oxinflammatory status."
https://openalex.org/W3014537054,"Background MicroRNA (miR)s are promising diagnostic biomarkers of cancer. Recent next generation sequencer (NGS) studies have found that isoforms of micro RNA (isomiR) circulate in the bloodstream similarly to mature micro RNA (miR). We hypothesized that combination of circulating miR and isomiRs detected by NGS are potentially powerful cancer biomarker. The present study aimed to investigate their application in esophageal cancer. Methods Serum samples from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and age and sex matched healthy control (HC) individuals were investigated for the expression of miR/isomiRs using NGS. Candidate miR/isomiRs which met the criteria in the 1st group (ESCC = 18 and HC = 12) were validated in the 2nd group (ESCC = 30 and HC = 30). A diagnostic panel was generated using miR/isomiRs that were consistently confirmed in the 1st and 2nd groups. Accuracy of the panel was tested then in the 3rd group (ESCC = 18 and HC = 18). Their use was also investigated in 22 paired samples obtained pre- and post-treatment, and in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAD) and high‐grade dysplasia (HGD). Results Twenty-four miR/isomiRs met the criteria for diagnostic biomarker in the 1st and 2nd group. A multiple regression model selected one mature miR (miR-30a-5p) and two isomiRs (isoform of miR-574-3p and miR-205-5p). The index calculated from the diagnostic panel was significantly higher in ESCC patients than in the HCs (13.3±8.9 vs. 3.1±1.3, p<0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves of the panel index was 0.95. Sensitivity and specificity were 93.8%, and 81% in the 1st and 2nd groups, and 88.9% and 72.3% in the 3rd group, respectively. The panel index was significantly lower in patients with EAD (6.2±4.5) and HGD (4.2±1.7) than in those with ESCC and was significantly decreased at post-treatment compared with pre-treatment (6.2±5.6 vs 11.6±11.5, p = 0.03). Conclusion Our diagnostic panel had high accuracy in the diagnosis of ESCC. MiR/isomiRs detected by NGS could serve as novel biomarkers of ESCC."
https://openalex.org/W3014140793,"In fission yeast and plants, RNA processing and degradation contribute to heterochromatin silencing, alongside conserved pathways of transcriptional repression. It has not been known whether similar pathways exist in metazoans. Here, we describe a pathway of silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans somatic cells, in which the highly conserved RNA-binding complex LSM2-8 contributes selectively to the repression of heterochromatic reporters and endogenous genes bearing the Polycomb mark, histone H3K27me3. This acts by degrading selected transcripts through the XRN-2 exoribonuclease. Disruption of the LSM2-8 pathway leads to mRNA stabilization. Unlike previously described pathways of heterochromatic RNA degradation, LSM2-8-mediated RNA degradation does not target nor require H3K9 methylation. Intriguingly, loss of this pathway coincides with a localized reduction in H3K27me3 at lsm-8-sensitive loci. We have thus uncovered a mechanism of RNA degradation that selectively contributes to the silencing of a subset of H3K27me3-marked genes, revealing a previously unrecognized layer of post-transcriptional control in metazoan heterochromatin. Mattout et al. show that the nuclear LSM2-8 complex acts with the exonuclease XRN-2 to degrade transcripts of H3K27me3-marked genes, thus facilitating gene silencing."

This knowledge can be used for drug re-purposing, or by physicians to evaluate a patient's condition and co-morbidity risk. Here, we look at differential gene expression obtained from microarray technology for patients diagnosed with various diseases. Based on this data and cellular multi-scale organization, we aim to uncover disease--disease links, as well as disease-gene and disease--pathways associations. We propose neural networks with structures inspired by the multi-scale organization of a cell. We show that these models are able to correctly predict the diagnosis for the majority of the patients.

We have previously demonstrated that ZFHX3 is SUMOylated at three or more lysine residues. Here, we investigated which enzymes regulate ZFHX3 SUMOylation and whether SUMOylation modulates ZFHX3 stability and function. We found that SUMO1, SUMO2, and SUMO3 each are conjugated to ZFHX3. Multiple lysine residues in ZFHX3 were SUMOylated, but Lys-2806 was the major SUMOylation site, and we also found that it is highly conserved among ZFHX3 orthologs from different animal species. Using molecular analyses, we identified the enzymes that mediate ZFHX3 SUMOylation; these included SUMO1-activating enzyme subunit 1 (SAE1), an E1-activating enzyme; SUMO-conjugating enzyme UBC9 (UBC9), an E2-conjugating enzyme; and protein inhibitor of activated STAT2 (PIAS2), an E3 ligase. Multiple analyses established that both SUMO-specific peptidase 1 (SENP1) and SENP2 deSUMOylate ZFHX3. SUMOylation at Lys-2806 enhanced ZFHX3 stability by interfering with its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.

Members of this family typically couple electron transfer to generate a transmembrane proton or sodium gradient. The water solubility of FdsABG formate dehydrogenase greatly simplifies its biochemical study. Whereas the protein does not pump cations, it does contain redox-active centers that have been lost in other members of the superfamily over the course of evolution, including a bis(enedithiolate) molybdenum center that is the site of the fully reversible oxidation of formate to CO2. As such, FdsABG is thought to represent, along with a separate hydrogenase and membrane-integral ion channel, an evolutionarily primitive, functional module of NADH dehydrogenases. The FdsA, FdsB, and FdsG subunits have strong sequence homology to corresponding subunits in the cytosol-exposed arm of the membrane-integral and proton-pumping NADH dehydrogenase (3Friedebold J.

The close homology between FdsA and Nqo3 extends to the presence of a histidine ligand to one of the Fe4S4 clusters. The C terminus of FdsA, containing the molybdenum center, also has an ∼60% sequence similarity to the structurally characterized FdhF formate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli, with cysteine, Cys-378, equivalent to the molybdenum-coordinating selenocysteine, Sec-140, in FdhF (13Boyington J.C.

This C-terminal domain is also present in Nqo3, although the molybdenum center has been lost over the course of evolution. The FdsB subunit has ∼45% sequence identity to the Nqo1 subunit of the T. thermophilus NADH dehydrogenase and, like Nqo1, contains an Fe4S4 cluster, FMN, and a binding site for NADH/NAD+. As demonstrated here, it also possesses an N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain that lacks the typical iron-sulfur cluster and the disulfide bond of thioredoxin. The FdsG subunit has ∼34% sequence identity to the Nqo2 subunit of the T. thermophilus NADH dehydrogenase and possesses an Fe2S2 cluster. Under physiological conditions, electrons enter the FdsABG holoenzyme at the molybdenum center in the reductive half of the catalytic cycle and depart at the FMN in the oxidative half-reaction, with electron transfer between the two sites (thought to be separated by ∼55 Å (9Hille R.

Because FdsB- and FdsG-like domains are found in all members of the NADH dehydrogenase superfamily (12Efremov R.G. Baradaran R. Sazanov L.A.

Here, we present the structure of FdsBG complex and characterize its kinetic properties. Previously, the FdsBG homologous, stand-alone complex of NADH dehydrogenase from Paracoccus denitrificans has been characterized and shown to be capable of NADH oxidation (15Yano T. Sled' V.D. Ohnishi T. Yagi T.

We therefore set out to characterize the electron transfer reaction of the FdsBG complex from C. necator. The recombinant expression of C. necator FdsABG holoenzyme in E. coli produces not only monomeric and dimeric holoenzyme, but also significant amounts of FdsBG complex (16Yu X. Niks D. Ge X. Liu H. Hille R. Mulchandani A. Synthesis of formate from CO2 gas catalyzed by an O2-tolerant NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase and glucose dehydrogenase.Biochemistry. 2019; 58 (30839197): 1861-186810.1021/acs.biochem.8b01301Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A similar observation was reported for the expression of Rhodobacter capsulatus FdsABG holoenzyme (17Hartmann T. Leimkühler S. The oxygen-tolerant and NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase from Rhodobacter capsulatus is able to catalyze the reduction of CO2 to formate.FEBS J. 2013; 280 (24034888): 6083-609610.1111/febs.12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To streamline the purification of FdsBG complex, we redesigned the FdsABG holoenzyme expression system to produce only FdsBG complex with two different N-terminal tags on FdsG, His6-linker-His6 and Twin-Strep® tag. The resulting constructs produce FdsBG complexes that are substantially identical in their NADH/NAD+ redox activity and their ability to crystallize. A detailed description of the two constructs and the purification of the overexpressed FdsBG complexes is provided under “Experimental procedures.” We first examined the EPR signals attributable to the complex's two iron-sulfur centers. Upon extended incubation of FdsBG complex with dithionite, two signals are observed (Fig. 1A, black trace). The first signal is seen at liquid nitrogen temperatures with g-values of g1,2,3 = 2.000, 1.948, and 1.920 and line widths of 1.4, 1.7, and 1.6 mT, 3The abbreviations used are: mTmilliteslasRMSDroot mean square deviation2Dtwo-dimensionalODoptical densityPDBProtein Data BankICP-OESinductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometryMWCOmolecular weight cuf-off. respectively. These values are in good agreement with those described previously for the cluster designated as Fe/S1 for the FdsABG holoenzyme (Fig. 1B, blue dashed trace) (6Niks D. Duvvuru J. Escalona M. Hille R.

The second signal is detected below 20 K with g-values of g1,2,3 = 2.039, 1.955, and 1.891 and line widths of 4.5, 1.4, and 5.3 mT, respectively (Fig. 1B, red dashed trace). This cluster has not been described previously in the holoenzyme (6Niks D. Duvvuru J. Escalona M. Hille R. Spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the molybdenum-containing, NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha.J. Biol.

In the homologous FdsBG complexes from NADH dehydrogenase (Aquifex aeolicus NuoEF or T. thermophilus Nqo1·2), only EPR signals of the Fe2S2 clusters are detectable above 77 K, whereas those for the Fe4S4 clusters appear only below 50 K (18Ohnishi T. Ohnishi S.T. Salerno J.C. Five decades of research on mitochondrial NADH-quinone oxidoreductase (complex I).Biol. Chem. 2018; 399 (30243012): 1249-126410.1515/hsz-2018-0164Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The g-values g1,2,3 = 2.004, 1.945, and 1.917 for the N1a Fe2S2 cluster of the 24-kDa subunit of respiratory complex I from bovine mitochondria (the homolog to FdsG) are in excellent agreement with the Fe/S1 signal. Accordingly, we assign the Fe/S1 signal to the Fe2S2 cluster of FdsG (19Reda T. Barker C.D. Hirst J. Reduction of the iron-sulfur clusters in mitochondrial NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) by EuII-DTPA, a very low potential reductant.Biochemistry. 2008; 47 (18651753): 8885-889310.1021/bi800437gCrossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The signal assigned to the N3 Fe4S4 cluster in the NADH dehydrogenase system, with g-values of g1,2,3 = 2.037, 1.945, and 1.852, is also in good agreement with the Fe/S5 signal of the FdsBG complex. Therefore, we assign the Fe/S5 signal to the Fe4S4 cluster of FdsB. We had initially assigned the Fe/S1 signal to the His-coordinated Fe4S4 cluster contained in the FdsA subunit of the FdsABG holoenzyme (6Niks D. Duvvuru J. Escalona M. Hille R. Spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the molybdenum-containing, NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase from Ralstonia eutropha.J. Biol.

We note that the Fe/S5 signal has very similar g-values to that reported for the previously observed Fe/S3, although the Fe/S5 line widths are considerably broader (see the g1 and g3 features of red and blue EPR spectra, centered around the dashed lines in Fig. 1C). However, the Fe/S3 cluster has been shown to be magnetically coupled to the molybdenum center and must accordingly arise from the Fe4S4 cluster proximal to the molybdenum center in FdsA. Therefore, the Fe/S5 signal must be a newly identified signal. The assignment of the Fe/S5 signal to the Fe4S4 cluster of the FdsB subunit is strengthened by the below described structure of the FdsBG complex and by our previously published structural model of the FdsABG holoenzyme (9Hille R. Hall J. Basu P. The mononuclear molybdenum enzymes.Chem. Rev. 2014; 114 (24467397): 3963-403810.1021/cr400443zCrossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). This model places the Fe4S4 cluster in the proximity of FdsA in the intact holoenzyme and in the electron path between the molybdenum and FMN. It is likely that the large line widths, in conjunction with the relatively low level of reduction and overlapping g-values with Fe/S3, obscured its detection in the earlier work with the holoenzyme. It is also possible that the presence of additional, higher-potential clusters in the FdsA subunit prevents the reduction of the Fe/S5 cluster in the holoenzyme. We further characterized the FdsBG complex by determining its structure by X-ray crystallography to 2.3 Å resolution (Fig. 2, B–E). The final phased electron density allowed us to build nearly all residues of the FdsBG heterodimer (for data and refinement statistics see Table S1). The heterodimer has dimensions of 82 × 64 × 62 Å, and the two heterodimers of the asymmetric unit are related by a noncrystallographic rotation of ∼179° (Fig. 2A). The axis of rotation passes through the interface formed by the N-terminal thioredoxin-like domains of the two FdsB molecules of the asymmetric unit (residues 3B–104B, where the superscript B indicates that the residue belongs to FdsB). The unusual relationship of the two FdsBG complexes in the asymmetric unit notwithstanding, their structures are nearly identical, with an RMSD of 0.35 Å for all the atoms of the 661 residues of the core of the 735-amino acid FdsBG complex. Each FdsBG complex contains two iron-sulfur clusters (one Fe2S2 and one Fe4S4 cluster), one FMN, and one K+ ion. The final model also contains 498 water molecules. For the detailed analysis of the structural differences between FdsBG complex and its homologous subcomplex from NADH dehydrogenase, we used the recently published, high-resolution structure from A. aeolicus, NuoEF complex (20Schulte M. Frick K. Gnandt E. Jurkovic S. Burschel S. Labatzke R. Aierstock K. Fiegen D. Wohlwend D. Gerhardt S. Einsle O. Friedrich T.

The NuoE subunit is homologous to the Nqo1 and FdsG subunits, and the NuoF subunit is homologous to the Nqo2 and FdsB subunits (Fig. 3, A and B). Except for the N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain (residues 3B–104B), the FdsB subunit structure is highly similar to that of the NuoF subunit of the A. aeolicus NADH dehydrogenase (RMSD of 1.48 Å for 394 Cα atoms). Like NuoF, FdsB contains a Rossmann-like fold (residues 138B–332B, also classified as Complex I_51K domain (21Marchler-Bauer A. Bo Y. Han L. He J. Lanczycki C.J. Lu S. Chitsaz F. Derbyshire M.K.

Song J.S. et al.CDD/SPARCLE: functional classification of proteins via subfamily domain architectures.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (27899674): D200-D20310.1093/nar/gkw1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar)), a ubiquitin-like domain (residues 338B–423B), and a four-helical bundle (residues 426B–511B, NADH_4Fe-4S domain). The Rossmann-like fold contains the FMN-binding site, and the C-terminal four-helical bundle contains the Fe4S4 cluster (22Hinchliffe P. Sazanov L.A. Organization of iron-sulfur clusters in respiratory complex I.Science. 2005; 309 (16051796): 771-77410.1126/science.1113988Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). In the Rossmann-like domain, the main structural differences between the FdsB and NuoF subunits are in loops that are solvent-exposed. The only loop with a structural difference that is buried in the complex is positioned between the bound FMN and the Fe2S2 cluster of the FdsG subunit (183B–190B loop), thus enabling the Fe2S2 cluster to be ∼0.2 Å closer to the FMN in the FdsBG complex than in the NuoEF complex (Fig. 4A). The ubiquitin-like domain of FdsB is tilted toward the FMN bound in the Rossmann-like domain. This tilt toward the FMN propagates into the four-helical bundle domain, resulting in an ∼0.2-Å distance closer between the FMN and the Fe4S4 cluster compared with that seen in the NuoEF complex (Fig. 4B). The Fe4S4 cluster is located in a hydrophobic environment close to the surface and is coordinated by Cys-443B, Cys-446B, Cys-449B, and Cys-489B (Fig. 2E). The N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of FdsB is structurally similar to the C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of FdsG (RMSD 1.97 Å for 71 Cα atoms of the core of the domain). However, unlike the domain in FdsG, that in FdsB has lost its capacity to bind an Fe2S2 cluster due to mutation of the corresponding cysteines to proline, alanine, serine, and phenylalanine, respectively (Pro-10B, Ala-15B, Ser-45B, and Phe-49B). The structure of the FdsG subunit is also highly similar to the NuoE subunit of T. thermophilus NADH dehydrogenase. Like NuoE, FdsG consists of an N-terminal four-helical bundle (residues 29G–74G) and a C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain (residues 79G–159G). The domains are separated by a 4-amino-acid-long linker, around which the two domains are hinged by ∼26° compared with NuoE. This domain arrangement is stabilized by a K+ ion, which is held in place by residues from both domains (His-71G, His-112G, and Glu-123G; Fig. 4C). Although the N-terminal domains of FdsG and NuoE consist of a four-helical bundle, the first helix of FdsG packs in parallel to the second and third helix, whereas in NuoE it runs across the interface formed by these two helices (Fig. 4C). The C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of FdsG is structurally similar to the N-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of FdsB but contains a spinach ferredoxin-like Fe2S2 cluster (22Hinchliffe P. Sazanov L.A. Organization of iron-sulfur clusters in respiratory complex I.Science. 2005; 309 (16051796): 771-77410.1126/science.1113988Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The Fe2S2 cluster is located in a hydrophobic environment close to the surface and is coordinated by Cys-86G, Cys-91G, Cys-127G, and Cys-131G (Figs. 2D and 3B). Compared with Nqo2, FdsG's and NuoE's thioredoxin-like domains are truncated at their C termini and are missing a disulfide bond (Fig. 3B). Two helices of FdsG's four-helical bundle interact with the surface of the Rossmann-like domain of FdsB, similar to the interactions seen in the NuoEF interface (Fig. 4D). The C-terminal thioredoxin-like domain of FdsG binds to the same surfaces of the ubiquitin-like domain and Rossmann-like domain of FdsB as in the NuoEF complex. However, the different positioning of the ubiquitin and of the 183B–190B loop results in the Fe2S2 cluster of FdsG being an additional ∼1.0 Å farther from the Fe4S4 cluster compared with the respective clusters in the NuoEF complex (Fig. 4, E and F). With an edge-to-edge distance of nearly 21 Å, direct electron transfer between the Fe2S2 cluster and Fe4S4 cluster is unlikely to be kinetically significant. However, both clusters are within 12 Å of the isoalloxazine ring of FMN (Fig. 4E), which evidently mediates electron equilibration between the two iron-sulfur clusters. Whereas the Fe4S4 cluster of FdsB is clearly a part of the electron transport chain between the molybdenum center of FdsA and the FMN of FdsB, the Fe2S2 cluster of FdsG lies off-path and appears to function as a temporary repository for electrons in the course of electron egress out of the flavin (see “Discussion”). The FMN is bound by a network of interactions in an extended, solvent-accessible cavity that also accommodates NAD+/NADH. The isoalloxazine ring of FMN is within 12 Å of each iron-sulfur cluster. The C8-methyl of the dimethylbenzene moiety of the flavin points toward the Fe4S4 cluster, and the N5-containing edge faces the Fe2S2 cluster, whereas the ribityl phosphate tail extends away from both iron-sulfur clusters (Fig. 4E). The direct and water-mediated interactions between the FMN isoalloxazine ring and the ribityl phosphate tail with FdsB's Rossmann-like fold are conserved in the high-resolution structures of other members of the NADH oxidoreductase family (14Shomura Y.

In the absence of the FdsA subunit, which contains five iron-sulfur clusters and a molybdenum active site, the UV-visible spectrum of the isolated FdsBG complex is dominated by the spectral features of the FMN centered around 350 and 450 nm (Fig. 6A, red spectrum). In addition, a feature around 550 nm, attributed to the Fe4S4 and Fe2S2 clusters of the FdsBG complex, is significantly more pronounced due to the lack of interference of the additional iron-sulfur clusters present in the FdsABG holoenzyme (6Niks D.

Methods Data from the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) and Pain Effects Scale (PES) were compared between 51 NMOSD and 85 MS patients. Each score was compared in each disease group with or without clinical abnormalities. Since almost no MS patients are without brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities, volumetry analysis by the Lesion Segmentation Tool and statistical parametric mapping 12 were added to obtain total lesion volume and intracranial volume in MS patients, and the correlations between total lesion volume/intracranial volume and each score were investigated. Results Compared to the MS group, the NMOSD group showed a higher PES score (median, 15.0 vs. 7.0, P = 0.045), no difference in MFIS, and an increased percentage of patients with extended spinal cord lesions (58.8% vs. 8.2%, P < 0.001). Moreover, NMOSD and MS patients with extended spinal cord lesions tended to demonstrate higher PES scores than those without. A positive correlation between MFIS and PES were found in patients with NMOSD and MS. On the other hand, MS patients showed a higher percentage of brain abnormalities (80.4% vs. 97.6%, P = 0.001) and a positive correlation between total lesion volume/intracranial volume and MFIS (Spearman’s ρ = 0.50, P = 0.033). Conclusions The origin of fatigue may be associated with spinal cord lesions causing pain in NMOSD patients, but with brain lesions in MS patients."

Studies with recombinant MHV strains that differ in the gene encoding the spike protein have demonstrated that the spike has a role in MHV pathogenesis and retrograde axonal transport. Fusion peptides (FPs) in the spike protein play a key role in MHV pathogenesis. In a previous study of the effect of deleting a single proline residue in the FP of a demyelinating MHV strain, we found that two central, consecutive prolines are important for cell–cell fusion and pathogenesis. The dihedral fluctuation of the FP was shown to be repressed whenever two consecutive prolines were present, in contrast to the presence of a single proline in the chain. Using this proline-deleted MHV strain, here we investigated whether intracranial injection of this strain can induce optic neuritis by retrograde axonal transport from the brain to the retina through the optic nerve. We observed that the proline-deleted recombinant MHV strain is restricted to the optic nerve, is unable to translocate to the retina, and causes only minimal demyelination and no neuronal death.

Altered fusogenicity consequently alters viral spread and pathogenicity.

Viruses can reach and spread to proximal oligodendrocytes and myelin via anterograde axonal transport, resulting in demyelination in spinal cord white matter.

In the optic nerve, the parental demyelinating strains MHV-A59 and RSA59 cause inflammation, demyelination, and axonal loss (i.e. optic neuritis), in contrast to the nondemyelinating parental MHV-2 and RSMHV2 strains (11Shindler K.S.

The study demonstrated the ability of demyelinating MHV strains, but not nondemyelinating strains, to induce optic neuritis and axonal injury by retrograde axonal transport. Also, RSA59, in contrast with RSMHV2, can infect retinal ganglion cell (RGC) bodies in the retina following intracranial inoculation, and at the chronic stage, RSA59-infected mice show significant loss of RGCs (13Singh M.

Whether retrograde transport of MHV to induce optic neuritis and damage RGCs depends on the capability of a virus to cause cell–cell fusion is not known. Here we compared the incidence and phenotype of optic neuritis after inoculation with fusiogenic RSA59 (PP) and its fusion-deficient, proline-mutated RSA59 (P) strain and assessed retrograde axonal transport and RGC loss. RSA59 (PP), with direct capability of cell–cell fusion, was able to reach the optic nerve and RGCs whereas fusion-deficient RSA59 (P) was not. Four-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice were intracranially inoculated with 50% LD50 doses of RSA59 (PP) and its mutated recombinant strain RSA59 (P). Optic nerves and whole eyes were harvested, fixed, and sectioned. To detect the presence of viral antigens in the optic nerve, immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibody using an avidin–biotin–peroxidase assay with the substrate 3,3′ Diaminobenzidine. Images of immunostained optic nerves from mock-infected, RSA59 (PP)–infected, and RSA59 (P)–infected mice were taken with a ×40 objective. At days 3 and 6 p.i., no viral staining was observed in mock-infected mice (Fig. 1, a and d). At day 3 p.i., 100% of mice infected with RSA59 (PP) were positive for viral antigen staining in the optic nerve, whereas ∼75% of RSA59 (P)–infected mice were positive for the same (Fig. 1, b and c). No significant difference was found in the area of viral antigen staining between both strains (Fig. 1g) at day 3 p.i. At day 6 p.i., 100% infection was found in both infected strains (Fig. 1, e and f); however, the area of viral antigen staining was higher in RSA59 (PP)– compared with RSA59 (P)–infected mice (Fig. 1h). At day 6 p.i., viral antigen in RSA59 (PP)–infected mice was spread throughout the optic nerve, whereas in RSA59 (P)–infected mice, the viral antigen spread was restricted to individual cells and meninges. To determine whether the two strains could induce inflammation in the optic nerve, paraffin sections of the optic nerve were stained with H&E to evaluate the presence of inflammatory cells as a sign of optic neuritis. Both RSA59 (PP) (75% of infected mice) and RSA59 (P) (50% of infected mice) virus strains induced optic neuritis (Fig. 2, b and c), which was not present in mock-infected mice (Fig. 2a). In previous studies, most inflammatory cells in the optic nerve were found to be microglia/macrophages (11Shindler K.S. Chatterjee D. Biswas K. Goyal A. Dutt M. Nassrallah M. Khan R.S. Das Sarma J. Macrophage-mediated optic neuritis induced by retrograde axonal transport of spike gene recombinant mouse hepatitis virus.J. Neuropathol. Exp.

To confirm similar findings here, optic nerve sections were immunostained with anti-Iba-1 antibody. In optic nerves from mice infected with RSA59 (PP) or RSA59 (P) (Fig. 2, e and f), a significant number of Iba1+ inflammatory cells (a microglia/macrophage marker) were present compared with controls (Fig. 2d). There was no significant difference in the number and distribution of Iba1+ cells between mice infected with RSA59 (PP) and RSA59 (P) (Fig. 2g). Because viral antigen was detected in the optic nerve, we further investigated whether both viral strains have the capability to traffic to RGC bodies from the site of inoculation (brain) in a retrograde manner. Whole eyes from mock-, RSA59 (PP)–, and RSA59 (P)–infected mice were isolated, serially sectioned, immunostained with anti-N antibody, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Images were captured at ×40 magnification to look for viral antigen–positive staining in the RGC layer. Interestingly, viral antigens were detected in ∼75% of RSA59 (PP)–infected mouse eyes at day 3 p.i. and in all RSA59 (PP)–infected mouse retinas at day 6 p.i. (Fig. 3, b and e), whereas no viral antigen was detected in RSA59 (P)–infected (Fig. 3, c and f) mouse retinas, similar to mock infection (Fig. 3, a and d), at 3 and 6 days p.i. At day 3 p.i., RSA59 (PP) viral antigen was predominantly found in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), whereas at day 6 p.i., it spread through all layers of the retina. A significant difference was found in the area of viral antigen staining between RSA59 (PP) and RSA59 (P) strains at days 3 p.i. and 6 p.i. (Fig. 3, g and h). Microglia constitute a prominent part of the residential glial population in the retina. During maturation, they acquire their topographical distribution between the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and outer plexiform layer (OPL) in the retina (15Santos A.M. Calvente R. Tassi M. Carrasco M.C. Martín-Oliva D. Marín-Teva J.L. Navascués J. Cuadros M.A. Embryonic and postnatal development of microglial cells in the mouse retina.J. Comp. Neurol. 2008; 506 (18022954): 224-23910.1002/cne.21538Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To examine potential topographical changes after infection, 20-μm-thick cryopreserved sections were cut and immunofluorescently labeled with anti-Iba-1. Retinas from mock-infected mice showed resting ramified microglia in the IPL and OPL with only a minimal presence in the GCL (Fig. 4a). In eyes from RSA59 (PP)–infected mice, the population of microglia/macrophages was found to migrate and increase specifically in the GCL (Fig. 4b). However, in RSA59 (P)–infected mouse retina, the microglia/macrophages seen in the GCL were comparatively less than in RSA59 (PP)–infected mice (Fig. 4, c and d). Across all retinal layers, there was a trend toward fewer total numbers of microglia/macrophages in mice infected with RSA59 (P) compared with RSA59 (PP)–infected mice at day 6 p.i., although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 4e). In previous studies, mice infected with RSA59 showed chronic-stage demyelination in the optic nerve (11Shindler K.S. Chatterjee D. Biswas K. Goyal A. Dutt M. Nassrallah M. Khan R.S. Das Sarma J. Macrophage-mediated optic neuritis induced by retrograde axonal transport of spike gene recombinant mouse hepatitis virus.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2011; 70 (21572336): 470-48010.1097/NEN.0b013e31821da499Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To evaluate demyelination in this study, optic nerve sections were stained with LFB. At the chronic stage (day 30 p.i.), no demyelination was observed in mock-infected mouse optic nerves (Fig. 5a). However, 62.5% of optic nerves showed prominent demyelination (Fig. 5d) when mice were infected with RSA59 (PP), whereas little or no demyelination was observed in RSA59 (P)–infected mouse optic nerves (Fig. 5, g and j). To evaluate inflammation at the chronic stage, optic nerve sections were stained with H&E. RSA59 (PP)–infected mouse optic nerves exhibited inflammation at day 30 p.i. (Fig. 5e), whereas little or no inflammation was found in mice infected with RSA59 (P) (Fig. 5h) or in mock-infected mice (Fig. 5b). We characterized the inflammatory cells by staining optic nerve sections with anti-Iba1. At day 30 p.i., resting ramified microglia were found in mock-infected mouse optic nerves (Fig. 5c). However, phagocytotic microglia/macrophage accumulation was found in numerous RSA59 (PP)–infected (Fig. 5f) mouse optic nerves, but in RSA59 (P)–infected (Fig. 5i) mice, it was only found occasionally. Quantification of this staining showed that there was a significant increase in the total number of microglia/macrophages in RSA59 (PP)–infected compared with mock-infected and RSA59 (P)–infected optic nerves (Fig. 5k). Demyelinating optic neuritis induced by RSA59 has been shown previously to induce neuronal damage with RGC loss (13Singh M. Khan R.S. Dine K. Das Sarma J. Shindler K.S. Intracranial inoculation is more potent than intranasal inoculation for inducing optic neuritis in the mouse hepatitis virus-induced model of multiple sclerosis.Front. Cell Infect. Microbiol. 2018; 8 (30234031): 31110.3389/fcimb.2018.00311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To examine whether the proline-mutated strain RSA59 (P) can cause RGC loss at day 30, retinas from mock-infected, RSA59 (PP)–infected, and RSA59 (P)–infected mice were isolated and labeled with anti-Brn3a (an RGC marker), and RGCs were counted in 12 standardized fields. Mice infected with RSA59 (PP) had a significant decrease in RGC number compared with mock-infected mice (Fig. 6, a and b), whereas infection with RSA59 (P) led to no significant difference in RGC numbers compared with mock-infected mice (Fig. 6, c and d). A previous study demonstrated that deletion of one proline in the fusion peptide of spike in the fusogenic MHV strain RSA59 reduced its ability to cause cell–cell fusion in vitro (8Singh M. Kishore A. Maity D. Sunanda P. Krishnarjuna B. Vappala S. Raghothama S. Kenyon L.C. Pal D. Das Sarma J. A proline insertion-deletion in the spike glycoprotein fusion peptide of mouse hepatitis virus strongly alters neuropathology.J. Biol.

In addition, the proline-mutated strain RSA59 (P) showed reduced acute-stage dissemination of viruses in the brain and spinal cord and reduced chronic-stage demyelination in the white matter of the spinal cord (8Singh M. Kishore A. Maity D. Sunanda P. Krishnarjuna B. Vappala S. Raghothama S. Kenyon L.C. Pal D. Das Sarma J. A proline insertion-deletion in the spike glycoprotein fusion peptide of mouse hepatitis virus strongly alters neuropathology.J. Biol.

The results of this study, comparing optic nerve and RGCs, reveal that the proline-mutated strain RSA59 (P) leads to reduced optic nerve inflammation and demyelination, suggesting significant consequences of differential virus replication and distribution compared with RSA59 (PP) infection. It is also evident from this study that RSA59 (PP), which contains the WT fusion peptide, causes severe RGC loss, similar to previous studies of RSA59 (8Singh M. Kishore A. Maity D. Sunanda P. Krishnarjuna B. Vappala S. Raghothama S. Kenyon L.C. Pal D. Das Sarma J. A proline insertion-deletion in the spike glycoprotein fusion peptide of mouse hepatitis virus strongly alters neuropathology.J. Biol.

Thus, these results demonstrate a key role of dual prolines in the fusion peptide of spike in mediating pathology in optic neuritis. This is likely due to effects of the fusion peptide on the ability of the virus to be transported along neuronal axons. Indeed, the presence of viral antigen in the eyes of RSA59 (PP)–infected mice suggests that retrograde axonal transport of the virus from the site of inoculation occurred. In contrast, the lack of viral antigen in the retina of RSA59 (P)–infected mice suggests that a single-proline mutant strain of RSA59 was not capable of traveling into the eye. Although viral antigen was found in the optic nerve of RSA59 (P)–infected mice, the absence of viral antigen in the eye suggests a reduced ability of RSA59 (P) to cause cell–cell fusion, further reducing the degree of retrograde axonal transport. Demyelinating strain RSA59 (PP) successfully induced optic nerve inflammation as well as demyelination (11Shindler K.S. Chatterjee D. Biswas K. Goyal A. Dutt M. Nassrallah M. Khan R.S. Das Sarma J. Macrophage-mediated optic neuritis induced by retrograde axonal transport of spike gene recombinant mouse hepatitis virus.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2011; 70 (21572336): 470-48010.1097/NEN.0b013e31821da499Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and RGC loss (13Singh M. Khan R.S. Dine K. Das Sarma J. Shindler K.S. Intracranial inoculation is more potent than intranasal inoculation for inducing optic neuritis in the mouse hepatitis virus-induced model of multiple sclerosis.Front. Cell Infect. Microbiol. 2018; 8 (30234031): 31110.3389/fcimb.2018.00311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), in accordance with our previous studies. Optic nerve inflammation was also evident in RSA59 (P)–infected optic nerves in this study, but the degree of demyelination and RGC loss was not significant in RSA59 (P)–infected mice compared with mock-infected mice. In addition, inflammation in the ganglion cell layer of RSA59 (PP)–infected mouse retinas at the acute stage was comparatively more than in RSA59 (P)–infected mice. Thus, the results further support a key role of the fusion peptide in virus-induced neuroinflammation and demyelination. This may be a secondary effect because of reduced axonal transport of the virus or due to other direct effects of the mutated fusion peptide, which remain to be elucidated in future studies. Together, our results suggest that lack of cell–cell fusion in the case of RSA59 (P) could play a major role in RGC loss induced during optic neuritis. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a mutation known to reduce the ability of RSA59 (P) to cause cell–cell fusion also reduces its trafficking and infection to the RGC layer. This loss of pathologic function is likely governed by loss of proline, altering the rigidity and stability of the spike protein structure during fusion, as shown in a previous study (8Singh M. Kishore A. Maity D. Sunanda P. Krishnarjuna B. Vappala S. Raghothama S. Kenyon L.C. Pal D. Das Sarma J. A proline insertion-deletion in the spike glycoprotein fusion peptide of mouse hepatitis virus strongly alters neuropathology.J. Biol.

From our previous study, it is evident that deletion of one proline from the fusion peptide may destabilize the spike protein, which may result in impaired fusogenicity (8Singh M. Kishore A. Maity D. Sunanda P. Krishnarjuna B. Vappala S. Raghothama S. Kenyon L.C. Pal D. Das Sarma J. A proline insertion-deletion in the spike glycoprotein fusion peptide of mouse hepatitis virus strongly alters neuropathology.J. Biol.

Also, this single proline mutation results in reduced replication and spread of RSA59 (P). The interaction of the virus with axonal transport machinery needs to be further investigated. It has been suggested to either hijack cargo proteins to move along microtubules or to be transported inside vesicles or directly interact with microtubules. How the virus enters and exits neurons is also not yet clear, but there is a possibility that the virus may gain access to nerve endings due to traumatic disruption at the site of inoculation. The presence of viral antigen in the RGC layer found here is consistent with our prior study suggesting that the virus travels through retrograde axonal transport (11Shindler K.S. Chatterjee D. Biswas K. Goyal A. Dutt M. Nassrallah M. Khan R.S. Das Sarma J. Macrophage-mediated optic neuritis induced by retrograde axonal transport of spike gene recombinant mouse hepatitis virus.J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2011; 70 (21572336): 470-48010.1097/NEN.0b013e31821da499Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Although infection in RGCs alone cannot exclude hematogenous spread as an alternative mechanism for retrograde transport, the distinct timing and amount of viral spread between the optic nerve (seen by day 3 p.i.) and the retina (seen by day 6 p.i.) suggest retrograde axonal transport to be the more likely mechanism of transport. From the above proline insertion–deletion study, it is evident that proline, a single amino acid, may serve as an important entity in the fusion peptide of MHV, required for efficient retrograde axonal transport and demyelination. Dissecting the minimal essential motif of the spike protein fusion peptide may enable us to design a mimetic peptide to set the stage for competition to reduce virus-induced neuroinflammation and RGC loss. Overall, our data suggest that the presence of two consecutive prolines plays a major role in preventing spread of the virus to postsynaptic targets (RGCs). Four-week-old MHV-free C57BL/6J male mice (In Vivo Biosciences) were used for the experiment. All procedures were carried out in accordance with ethical guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Kolkata. The animal protocols adhered to the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control And Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), India. A proline-mutated recombinant virus RSA59 (P) engineered from RSA59 (PP), both expressing enhanced GFP, was used as described in a previous study (8Singh M. Kishore A. Maity D. Sunanda P.

The desired viruses were diluted from stock solution using 0.75% PBS/BSA, and a final volume of 20 μl of diluted virus was inoculated intracranially. The virus was injected directly into the brain by syringe needle through the skull posterior to the orbits near the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Upon intracranial inoculation, the virus infected neurons in regions containing RGC axonal projections, including the LGN in the thalamus (Fig. 7) (11Shindler K.S. Chatterjee D. Biswas K. Goyal A.

Animals were euthanized using isoflurane and perfused with 1× PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and tissues were harvested at days 3 and 6 p.i. for acute-stage analysis and at day 30 p.i. for chronic-stage study. 4–6 mice were used per infection type per day post-infection, as indicated in the figure legends. For mock infection, 3 mice per day post-infection were used and inoculated with 0.75% PBS/BSA. At days 3, 6, and 30 p.i., optic nerves and eyes were isolated from mock-infected as well as MHV-infected mice. For paraffin sectioning, optic nerves and eyes were post-fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, processed, and embedded with paraffin. For cryosectioning, eyes were post-fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, processed in 10% and 30% sucrose solution, embedded in OCT medium (Tissue Tek, Hatfield, PA), sectioned sagittally with the help of a cryotome (Thermo Scientific) to 20-μm thickness, and mounted on charged glass slides. Right eyes were collected for immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections with viral nucleocapsid antigen, whereas left eyes were collected for immunofluorescence on cryosections with Iba1. 5-μm-thick optic nerve sections were cut and stained with H&E, and additional sections of day 30 p.i. optic nerves were stained with LFB to detect myelin damage. Serial cross-sections of optic nerves and eyes were stained using the avidin–biotin–immunoperoxidase technique (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) with 3,3′ diaminobenzidine as substrate and anti-Iba1 (Wako Chemicals, catalog no. 019-19741) and anti-N (nucleocapsid protein of MHV-JHM, monoclonal clone 1-16-1, kindly provided by Julian Leibowitz, Texas A&M, College Station, TX) as primary antibodies. Frozen tissue sections were washed with PBS at room temperature to remove cryomatrix. Tissues then were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1 m glycine in PBS to reduce nonspecific cross-linking, followed by 10-min incubation at room temperature with 1 mg/ml NaBH4 in PBS to reduce autofluorescence. Slides were washed with PBS and incubated with blocking serum containing PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 2.5% goat serum. The sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary anti-Iba1 antibody diluted in blocking serum, washed, and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor 568–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) diluted in PBS with goat serum for 2 h at room temperature. All incubations were carried out in a humidified chamber. After washing with PBS, sections were mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing mounting medium (Vectashield) and imaged using a Nikon eclipse Ti2 microscope. The images were processed with Fiji (ImageJ 1.52g) software. Anti-viral antigen staining was quantified as described previously using Fiji (ImageJ 1.52g) software (8Singh M. Kishore A. Maity D.

Briefly, five fields of each optic nerve tissue section were captured at ×40 magnification and analyzed. Four to five optic nerve sections per mouse per infection were used to measure the area of staining. Similarly, four to five sections of retina, each from medial to peripheral per mouse per infection, were scanned at the highest magnification of ×40. The RGB images were color-deconvoluted into three different colors to separate 3,3′ Diaminobenzidine-specific staining. To ensure that all labeled cells were selected, a threshold value was defined for each image. The magnitude of staining was defined as the area of staining and plotted. Each dot in a graph represents the average value of the captured frames from each mouse. To ensure error-free data collection, the entire quantification procedure was performed by two investigators and read in a blinded manner. The magnitude of Iba1+ microglia/macrophage activation was defined as the number of Iba1+ cells present in the total area. Four to five optic nerve tissue sections per mouse per infection were randomly selected to count the total number of Iba1+ cells. Similarly, four to five slices of immunofluorescently labeled retina, from medial to peripheral per mouse per infection, were selected to count the total number of Iba1+ cells and number of Iba1+ cells present in the GCL layer. To determine the total white matter area and areas with myelin loss in day 30 RSA59 (PP) and RSA59 (P) p.i. mice, four to five LFB-stained optic nerve sections from each mouse were randomly selected and analyzed using Fiji software (ImageJ 1.52g) (8Singh M.

Retinas were then isolated and washed three times with 1× PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at −70 °C. Retinas were incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% goat serum and 2% Triton X-100) for 4 h at room temperature.

https://openalex.org/W3015066556,"Background & aims In our previous study, a Seesaw model was proposed for the fluctuation of crucial anti- (IL-10) and pro-inflammatory (Il-6 & IL-17A) cytokines through vitamin D3. In this paper, however, it is intended to extend the mentioned model by assessing the expression mRNA levels of IL-27 and TGF-β1 as well as the changes of plasma levels of IL-27, TGF-β1, IL-17A, IL-10, and IL-6 after treatment by vitamin D3. Method Venous blood samples were drawn from Healthy Participants (HP, n = 25) and First-Degree Relative Participants (FDRP, n = 25) as control groups and Multiple Sclerosis Participants (MSP, n = 25) before and after eight weeks of supplementation with 50000 IU vitamin D3. The mRNA expression and plasma concentrations were gauged by using Real-Time PCR and ELISA assay, respectively. Results The mRNA surfaces of IL-27, as well as TGF-β1, were up-regulated. However, the plasma levels of TGF-β1, IL-17A, and IL-6 were significantly different among the three groups. In addition, the plasma levels of IL-27, TGF-β1, IL-10, IL-17A, and IL-6 significantly changed following the administration of vitamin D3. Conclusion The findings of this paper illustrate that anti-inflammatory cytokines could have a key role in immunomodulatory functions due to their anti-inflammatory functions. To conclude, this might contribute to preventing the pathophysiological process of MS. Also, the proposed model could be used as a preventive way on disposed people to multiple sclerosis, particularly in first degree relatives of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3014672470,"We present a two-stage methodology called Positions and Covering (P&C) to solve the two-dimensional bin packing problem (2D-BPP). The objective of this classical combinatorial NP-hard problem is to pack a set of items (small rectangles) in the minimum number of bins (larger rectangles). The first stage is the key-point of the Positions and Covering, where for each item, it is generated in a pseudo-polynomial way a set of valid positions that indicate the possible ways of packing the item into the bin. In the second stage, a new set-covering formulation, strengthen with three sets of valid inequalities, is used to select the optimal non-overlapping configuration of items for each bin. Experimental results for the P&C method are presented and compared with some of the best algorithms in the literature for small and medium size instances. Furthermore, we are considering both cases of the 2D-BPP, with and without rotations of the items by 90°.

https://openalex.org/W3014742589,"Clinical applications of oocytes cryopreservation include preservation of future fertility of young cancer patients, substitution of embryo freezing to avoid associated legal and ethical issues, and delaying childbearing years. While the outcome of oocyte cryopreservation has recently been improved, currently used vitrification method still suffer from increased biosafety risk and handling issues while slow freezing techniques yield overall low success. Understanding better the mechanism of cryopreservation-induced injuries may lead to development of more reliable and safe methods for oocyte cryopreservation. Using the mouse model, a microarray study was conducted on oocyte cryopreservation to identify cryoinjuries to transcriptionally active genome. To this end, metaphase II (MII) oocytes were subjected to standard slow freezing, and then analyzed at the four-cell stage after embryonic genome activation. Non-frozen four-cell embryos served as controls. Differentially expressed genes were identified and validated using RT-PCR. Embryos produced from the cryopreserved oocytes displayed 200 upregulated and 105 downregulated genes, associated with the regulation of mitochondrial function, protein ubiquitination and maintenance, cellular response to stress and oxidative states, fatty acid and lipid regulation/metabolism, and cell cycle maintenance. These findings reveal previously unrecognized effects of standard slow oocyte freezing on embryonic gene expression, which can be used to guide improvement of oocyte cryopreservation methods."
https://openalex.org/W3014805463,"As survival of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) exceeds 90%, limiting therapy-related toxicity has become a key challenge. Cardio-metabolic dysfunction is a challenge during and after childhood ALL therapy. In a single center study, we measured triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) levels at diagnosis and assessed the association with BMI, early therapy response, on-therapy hyperlipidemia and the toxicities; thromboembolism, osteonecrosis and pancreatitis. We included 127 children (1.0–17.9 years) all treated according to the NOPHO ALL2008 protocol. Dyslipidemia was identified at ALL-diagnosis in 99% of the patients, dominated by reduced HDL levels (98%) and mild hypertriglyceridemia (61%). Hypertriglyceridemia was not associated with body mass index (P = 0.71). Five percent of patients had mild hypercholesterolemia, 14% had mild hypocholesterolemia, 13% had decreased and 1% elevated LDL-levels. Increased TG and TC levels at ALL-diagnosis were not associated with any on-therapy lipid levels. Lipid levels and BMI were not associated to MRD after induction therapy; However, BMI and hypercholesterolemia were associated with worse risk group stratification (P<0.045 for all). The cumulative incidence of thromboembolism was increased both for patients with hypo- (20.0%) and hypercholesterolemia (16.7%) compared to patients with normal TC levels (2.2%) at diagnosis (P = 0.0074). In conclusion, dyslipidemic changes were present prior to ALL-therapy in children with ALL but did not seem to affect dysmetabolic traits during therapy and were not predictive of on-therapy toxicities apart from an association between dyscholesterolemia at time of ALL-diagnosis and risk of thromboembolism. However, the latter should be interpreted with caution due to low number in the groups."

https://openalex.org/W3014956445,"Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (or gliptins), a class of antidiabetic drugs, have recently been shown to have protective actions in the central nervous system. Their cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are largely unknown. In the present study, two structurally different gliptins, sitagliptin and vildagliptin, were examined for their therapeutic actions in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) in mice. Early post-CCI treatment with sitagliptin, but not vildagliptin, significantly reduced body asymmetry, locomotor hyperactivity, and brain lesion volume. Sitagliptin attenuated post-CCI microglial deramification in the ipsilateral dorsolateral (DL) striatum, while vildagliptin had no effect. Sitagliptin also reduced striatal expression of galectin-3 and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1(MCP-1), and increased the cortical and striatal levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 on the ipsilateral side. These data support a differential protective effect of sitagliptin against TBI, possibly mediated by an anti-inflammatory effect in striatum to preserve connective network. Both sitagliptin and vildagliptin produced similar increases of active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in blood and brain. Increasing active GLP-1 may not be the sole molecular mechanisms for the neurotherapeutic effect of sitagliptin in TBI."
https://openalex.org/W3014439405,"We previously reported that maternal nutrient restriction (NR) inhibited ureteric branching, metanephric growth, and nephrogenesis in the rat. Here we examined whether folic acid, a methyl-group donor, rescues the inhibition of kidney development induced by NR and whether DNA methylation is involved in it. The offspring of dams given food ad libitum (CON) and those subjected to 50% food restriction (NR) were examined. NR significantly reduced ureteric tip number at embryonic day 14, which was attenuated by folic acid supplementation to nutrient restricted dams. At embryonic day 18, glomerular number, kidney weight, and global DNA methylation were reduced by NR, and maternal folic acid supplementation again alleviated them. Among DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), DNMT1 was strongly expressed at embryonic day 15 in CON but was reduced in NR. In organ culture, an inhibitor of DNA methylation 5-aza-2 '-deoxycytidine as well as medium lacking methyl donors folic acid, choline, and methionine, significantly decreased ureteric tip number and kidney size mimicking the effect of NR. In conclusion, global DNA methylation is necessary for normal kidney development. Folic acid supplementation to nutrient restricted dams alleviated the impaired kidney development and DNA methylation in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3014553439,"Hallux valgus is a serious medical concern for classical ballet dancers. Although it is well-known that progression of hallux valgus is related to inappropriate movement techniques in classical ballet, the kinematic relationship between the degree of hallux valgus and ballet techniques has not been substantiated. To develop proper training methods that prevent progression of hallux valgus, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between the degree of hallux valgus and movement techniques in classical ballet. Seventeen female classical ballet dancers at the advanced college-level participated in this study. Kinematic analysis of standing and plié in the first position was conducted via video capture technique. The Pearson product-moment correlation analysis was performed to examine the degree of hallux valgus and the following three kinematic variables: (1) the extent to which turnout is forced by other joints in the lower extremity than the hip joint, (2) the direction difference between the knee and toe in the transverse plane, and (3) the pelvis obliquity angle. Among these kinematic variables, we found a significant correlation between the hallux valgus angle and the pelvis obliquity angle during plié (P = .045). The greater the hallux valgus angle, the greater the retroversion of the pelvis, a result which was contrary to our prediction. We present the first evidence that the degree of hallux valgus correlates with kinematics in a very basic technique of classical ballet."
https://openalex.org/W3014554116,"Objective The objective of this study was to clarify the types and prevalence of, and the risk factors for, the adverse events that occur in patients receiving anti-dementia drugs. Methods A questionnaire survey was conducted. The respondents were pharmacists who were dispensing anti-dementia drugs. The pharmacists responded to questions about patients who were receiving anti-dementia drugs delivered to them at home by the pharmacists. The survey questions included questions about whether or not the patients experienced adverse reactions to the drugs, about the patients’ background characteristics, about the numbers of drugs the patients were taking when the pharmacists first visited the patients at home, and about the pharmacists’ assessments of the appropriateness of the use of the anti-dementia drugs. Results Data were collected on 3712 patients from 1673 pharmacies in a nationwide survey. Anti-dementia drugs had been prescribed to 863 of these patients; and 801 (92.8%) of these 863 patients were 75 years of age or older, and. confirmed adverse events occurred in 170 (21%) of these 863 patients. The most common adverse event was excitation/anxiety, at 45.1%. A multivariate analysis found that polypharmacy (10 or more types of drugs per day) (P = 0.030), inappropriate use (P = 0.002), and irregular medication use (P = 0.034) were risk factors. Interpretation In order to avoid adverse events when using anti-dementia drugs, doctors and pharmacists should carefully examine the prescribing of multiple medications, assess the applicability of the use of anti-dementia drugs, and investigate how to best manage patients’ drug use."
https://openalex.org/W3014564847,"The creation of urban farms in complex urban built environments may create suitable local conditions for vector mosquitoes. Urban farms have been implicated in the proliferation of mosquitoes in Africa, but there is a dearth in the knowledge of their role in the proliferation of mosquitoes elsewhere. In this study, we surveyed two urban farms in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Our results show that urban farms provide favorable conditions for populations of vector mosquito species by providing a wide range of essential resources such as larval habitats, suitable outdoor resting sites, sugar-feeding centers, and available hosts for blood-feeding. A total of 2,185 specimens comprising 12 species of mosquitoes were collected over 7 weeks. The results varied greatly according to the urban farm. At the Wynwood urban farm, 1,016 specimens were collected but were distributed only between 3 species; while the total number of specimens collected at the Golden Glades urban farm was 1,168 specimens comprising 12 species. The presence of vector mosquitoes in urban farms may represent a new challenge for the development of effective strategies to control populations of vector mosquito species in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3014252931,"There is evidence that emotion induced during encoding impairs associative memory (e.g., Bisby, Horner, Bush, & Burgess, 2018), yet the effect of post-encoding emotion (particularly positive emotion) on associative memory remains largely unclear. Two experiments were conducted to examine the effect of post-encoding positive emotion on associative memory for English vocabulary. In Experiment 1, high school students memorized Chinese definitions of a list of English words, immediately recalled the Chinese definitions, watched a neutral or comic video, and took a delayed memory test 25 minutes after encoding. The result showed a significant impairing effect of post-encoding positive emotion on memory for Chinese definitions. In Experiment 2, primary school students encoded English words with their associative pictures, took an immediate test where, on each trial, they were asked to choose the correct English word that matches a picture. Following the test, they watched a neutral or comic video, and took a memory test 10 minutes after encoding. Consistent with Experiment 1, Experiment 2 showed an impairing effect of positive emotion. Taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that post-encoding positive emotion can impair associative memory, providing important implications for acquisition of vocabulary of English as a foreign language."
https://openalex.org/W3014313735,"The prevalence of overweight and obesity is high among preschool age (3–5 years) children in South Africa, and children in urban low-income settings are particularly at risk. A better understanding of how parents or caregivers of young children perceive children’s weight and size, as well as contextual factors influencing perceptions, is needed to inform interventions. The aim of this study was to examine how parents of preschool children in Soweto, South Africa, view childhood obesity, and to situate these perspectives in the context of the home environment in which preschool age children in Soweto live. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 16 parents in four neighbourhoods of Soweto. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis following a contextualist approach. Three themes were developed: growing differently, the ‘right’ way to be, and weight is not health. These themes capture parents’ views on complex and reportedly inevitable causes of obesity, ideas about acceptable and preferred body sizes, and the low priority of weight per se compared to health. The findings suggest that childhood obesity prevention in South Africa needs to be done in a non-stigmatising way that recognises environmental and contextual factors, such as parents’ limited sense of agency in relation to their children’s health and weight, and concrete resource constraints. Environmental barriers to healthy behaviours need to be addressed in order to overcome the coexisting challenges of childhood undernutrition and obesity in urban low-income South African settings."
https://openalex.org/W3014613858,"Vermicompost application has been shown to promote plant growth, alter the rhizosphere microbiome, and suppress plant pathogens. These beneficial properties are often attributed to the activity of vermicompost-associated microorganisms. However, little is known about the microbial shifts that occur in the rhizosphere after vermicompost application. To better understand the impact of vermicompost treatments on the assembly of rhizosphere bacterial communities, 16S rDNA communities of vermicompost and rhizospheres of each peat- and soil-grown tomatoes were profiled after conventional fertigation, irrigation without additional nutrients, and addition of three different vermicompost-extracts. The full dataset consisted of 412 identified genera, of which 317 remained following stringent quality filtration. Tomato rhizosphere microbiome responses to treatments were complex and unique between peat and soil growth substrates. Direct colonization of vermicompost-origin taxa into rhizospheres was limited, with genera Photobacterium and Luteimonas colonizing peat rhizospheres, genera Truepera, Phenylobacterium, and Lysinibacillus colonizing soil rhizospheres, and genus Pelagibius appearing in both soil and peat rhizospheres. Further patterns of differential abundance and presence/absence between treatments highlight vermicompost-mediated effects on rhizosphere microbiome assembly as an interplay of rhizosphere medium, direct colonization of vermicompost-origin taxa and vermicompost-induced shifts in the rhizosphere microbial community. This exploratory analysis is intended to provide an initial look at 16S community composition of vermicompost and the effects of vermicompost treatment on the rhizosphere microbiome assembly to highlight interactions of potential merit for subsequent investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3014847596,"Basidiomycete fungi are a rich source of natural products with a diverse array of potentially exploitable bioactivities. Two dimeric sesquiterpenes, bovistol B (1) and D (2), and one monomeric sesquiterpene, strossmayerin (7), were isolated from the culture filtrate of the basidiomycete fungus Coprinopsis strossmayeri. The structures were determined through a combination of MS and 1D/2D NMR spectroscopic techniques. Likely monomeric precursors, identified on the basis of HRMS analysis, allow a plausible biosynthetic pathway to be proposed for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2, involving the dimerisation of the monomer through a hetero-Diels-Alder mechanism. A gene cluster, including a putative sesquiterpene 1–11 cyclase, was identified through phylogenetic and RNA-seq analysis, and is proposed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of 1 and 2."
https://openalex.org/W3014953462,"This study used constitutive CD226 gene knockout (KO) mice as a model to investigate the functions and mechanisms of CD226 in megakaryocyte (MK) maturation and platelet activation. Although CD226 deficiency did not cause MK polyploidization or platelet granule abnormalities, increased MK counts were detected in the femora bone marrow (BM) and spleen of CD226 KO mice. Particularly, CD226 KO mice have a more extensive membrane system in MKs and platelets than wild-type (WT) mice. We also demonstrated that CD226 KO mice displayed increased platelet counts, shortened bleeding time, and enhanced platelet aggregation. CD226 KO platelets had an increased mature platelet ratio compared to the control platelets. In addition, the observed reduction in bleeding time may be due to decreased nitric oxide (NO) production in the platelets. Platelet-specific CD226-deficient mice showed similar increased MK counts, shortened bleeding time, enhanced platelet aggregation, and decreased NO production in platelets. Furthermore, we performed middle cerebral artery occlusion-reperfusion surgery on WT and CD226 KO mice to explore the potential effect of CD226 on acute ischemia-reperfusion injury; the results revealed that CD226 deficiency led to significantly increased infarct area. Thus, CD226 is a promising candidate for the treatment of thrombotic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3015123223,"Long-term administration of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was effective in prevention of colorectal cancer, whereas the efficacy of this compound in other cancer types, including breast cancer, has been less convincingly documented. Indeed, the antimetastatic effect of low-dose ASA was observed only in the early intravascular phase of metastasis of breast cancer. In the present work, we characterized the effects of long-term treatment with ASA on the late phase of pulmonary metastasis in a mouse orthotopic 4T1 breast cancer model. Mice were treated with ASA at a dose of 12 mg·kg-1 of body weight daily starting one week prior to inoculation of 4T1 breast cancer cells, and the treatment was continued throughout progression of the disease. ASA administration decreased platelet TXB2 production in ex vivo assays but did not change thrombin-induced platelet reactivity. Although the number of metastases in the lungs remained unchanged in ASA-treated mice, infiltration of inflammatory cells was increased concomitantly with higher G-CSF and serotonin concentrations in the lungs. Pulmonary NO production was compromised compared to control 4T1 mice. ASA treatment also evoked an increase in platelet and granulocyte counts and decreased systemic NO bioavailability along with increased markers of systemic oxidant stress such as higher GSSG/lower GSH concentrations in RBC. Analysis of eicosanoids in stirred blood demonstrated that administration of ASA at a dose of 12 mg·kg-1 to cancer-bearing mice had an effect beyond inhibition of platelet COX-1, suggesting long-term treatment with low-dose aspirin is not a selective murine platelet COX-1/TXA2 pathway inhibitor in cancer-bearing mice. In summary, quite surprisingly, long-term treatment with low-dose ASA administered until the advanced phase of breast cancer in a murine orthotopic model of 4T1 breast cancer negatively affected the phenotype of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W3015016156,"Cognitive abilities underpin many of the behavioural decisions of animals. However, we still have very little understanding of how and why cognitive abilities vary between individuals of the same species in wild populations. In this study, we assessed the associative learning abilities of wild chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) across two troops in Namibia with a simple operant conditioning task. We evaluated the ability of individuals to correctly associate a particular colour of corn kernels with a distasteful flavour through repeated presentations of two small piles of corn dyed different colours, one of which had been treated with a non-toxic bitter substance. We also assessed whether individual variation in learning ability was associated with particular phenotypic traits (sex, social rank and neophilia) and states (age and prior vigilance). We found no evidence of learning the association either within each trial or across trials, nor any variation based on individuals’ phenotypes. This appeared to be due to a high tolerance for bitter foods leading to similar acceptance of both palatable and unpalatable kernels. Earlier avoidance of the bitter kernels during pilot trials suggests this higher tolerance may have been largely driven by a drought during the experiments. Overall, our findings highlight the potential influence of current environmental challenges associated with conducting cognitive tests of animals in the wild."
https://openalex.org/W3014295131,"IL-17A and IL-17F cytokines are important regulators of acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). However, contrary effects of these cytokines in inflammatory diseases have been reported. To investigate the effects of donor-derived IL-17A and IL-17F on GVHD, we made use of single (Il17a-/- or Il17f-/-) and double deficient (Il17af-/-) allogeneic donor CD4+ T cells. We could demonstrate that transplantation of Il17af-/- CD4+ donor T cells led to aggravated GVHD. However, this phenotype was not observed after transplantation of single, Il17a-/- or Il17f-/-, deficient CD4+ T cells, suggesting redundant effects of IL-17A and IL-17F. Moreover, Il17af-/- cell recipients showed an increase of systemic IFNγ, indicating a heightened pro-inflammatory state, as well as infiltration of IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T cells in the recipients’ intestinal tract. These recipients exhibited significant gut leakage, and markedly macrophage infiltration in the gastrointestinal epithelial layer. Moreover, we saw evidence of impaired recovery of gut epithelial cells in recipients of Il17af-/- CD4+ T cells. In this study, we show that IL-17A/F double deficiency of donor CD4+ T cells leads to accelerated GVHD and therefore highlight the importance of these cytokines. Together, IL-17 cytokines might serve as a brake to an intensified Th1 response, leading to the exacerbated gut damage in acute GVHD."
