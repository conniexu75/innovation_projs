https://openalex.org/W2105558714,"Influential theories of human emotion argue that subjective feeling states involve representation of bodily responses elicited by emotional events. Within this framework, individual differences in intensity of emotional experience reflect variation in sensitivity to internal bodily responses. We measured regional brain activity by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an interoceptive task wherein subjects judged the timing of their own heartbeats. We observed enhanced activity in insula, somatomotor and cingulate cortices. In right anterior insular/opercular cortex, neural activity predicted subjects' accuracy in the heartbeat detection task. Furthermore, local gray matter volume in the same region correlated with both interoceptive accuracy and subjective ratings of visceral awareness. Indices of negative emotional experience correlated with interoceptive accuracy across subjects. These findings indicate that right anterior insula supports a representation of visceral responses accessible to awareness, providing a substrate for subjective feeling states."
https://openalex.org/W2097651998,"The tumor suppressor p53, one of the most intensely investigated proteins, is usually studied by experiments that are averaged over cell populations, potentially masking the dynamic behavior in individual cells. We present a system for following, in individual living cells, the dynamics of p53 and its negative regulator Mdm2 (refs. 1,4-7): this system uses functional p53-CFP and Mdm2-YFP fusion proteins and time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. We found that p53 was expressed in a series of discrete pulses after DNA damage. Genetically identical cells had different numbers of pulses: zero, one, two or more. The mean height and duration of each pulse were fixed and did not depend on the amount of DNA damage. The mean number of pulses, however, increased with DNA damage. This approach can be used to study other signaling systems and suggests that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop generates a 'digital' clock that releases well-timed quanta of p53 until damage is repaired or the cell dies."

https://openalex.org/W2105192692,"Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) influences heart rate, coronary artery caliber, endothelial integrity, and lymphocyte recirculation through five related high affinity G-protein-coupled receptors. Inhibition of lymphocyte recirculation by non-selective S1P receptor agonists produces clinical immunosuppression preventing transplant rejection but is associated with transient bradycardia. Understanding the contribution of individual receptors has been limited by the embryonic lethality of the S1P1 knock-out and the unavailability of selective agonists or antagonists. A potent, S1P1-receptor selective agonist structurally unrelated to S1P was found to activate multiple signals triggered by S1P, including guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding, calcium flux, Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and stimulation of migration of S1P1- but not S1P3-expressing cells in vitro. The agonist also alters lymphocyte trafficking in vivo. Use of selective agonism together with deletant mice lacking S1P3 receptor reveals that agonism of S1P1 receptor alone is sufficient to control lymphocyte recirculation. Moreover, S1P1 receptor agonist plasma levels are causally associated with induction and maintenance of lymphopenia. S1P3, and not S1P1, is directly implicated in sinus bradycardia. The sustained bradycardia induced by S1P receptor non-selective immunosuppressive agonists in wild-type mice is abolished in S1P3-/- mice, whereas S1P1-selective agonist does not produce bradycardia. Separation of receptor subtype usage for control of lymphocyte recirculation and heart rate may allow the identification of selective immunosuppressive S1P1 receptor agonists with an enhanced therapeutic window. S1P1-selective agonists will be of broad utility in understanding cell functions in vitro, and vascular physiology in vivo, and the success of the chemical approach for S1P1 suggests that selective tools for the resolution of function across this broad lipid receptor family are now possible.

Many of the physiologically relevant functions occur in the low nanomolar range, including activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (12Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32363-32370Google Scholar, 13Igarashi J. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36281-36288Google Scholar), vasorelaxation (14Dantas A.P.V. Igarashi J. Michel T. Am. J.

A. 2003; 100: 10907-10912Google Scholar). Free plasma levels of S1P are tightly regulated by protein binding to albumin and high density lipoprotein to avoid the deleterious effects of systemic S1P receptor subtype activation at high concentrations of ligand, such as bradycardia and coronary artery vasospasm (3Ohmori T.

The choice of S1P, through its receptors, as an acute regulator of the number of blood lymphocytes may represent an interesting evolutionary choice by the immune system, which evolved after the circulatory system. The pleiotropic responses to S1P, mediated by distinct receptor subtypes in a tissue-specific manner, require the definition of the minimal receptor activation and minimal signals necessary and sufficient to regulate these key physiological functions. Advances in understanding the contribution of individual receptors has been limited by the current unavailability of selective agonists or antagonists. Although S1P2 and S1P3 were successfully deleted in mice (16Ishii I. Friedman B. Ye X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J.A. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol.

Acta. 2002; 1582: 222-227Google Scholar), due to the failure of vascular maturation. New tools that elucidate biological functions of receptor subtypes are needed.S1P receptor function in the immune system has experimental advantages in approaching selective S1P receptor function at vascular interfaces. The maintenance of efficient immune responses depends upon maximizing the probabilities of T lymphocytes encountering their cognate antigens (7Rosen H. Sanna M. Alfonso C. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 195: 160-177Google Scholar). The dispersed anatomy of the immune system requires recirculation of naive lymphocytes, which emerge from their organs of primary lymphopoiesis (thymus and bone marrow), traversing the blood, entering secondary lymphoid organs across high endothelium, and finally crossing sinus-lining endothelium to return to the blood stream via lymph and thoracic duct (19Gowans J.L. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1975; 17: 97-98Google Scholar, 20Gowans J.L. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1971; 41: 1-3Google Scholar, 21Gowans J.L. Steer H.W. Ciba. Found. Symp. 1980; 71: 113-126Google Scholar, 22Gowans J.L. Transplant Proc. 1991; 23: 7-8Google Scholar). S1P receptors play a critical role as the molecular gatekeeper regulating lymphocyte recirculation. Relatively non-selective S1P receptor agonists active on S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 but not S1P2, such as the phosphate-ester of the immunomodulatory prodrug FTY720, induce rapid lymphopenia by inhibiting the egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes into lymph (9Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.-J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Google Scholar), as well as from thymus into blood (11Rosen H. Alfonso C. Suhr C. McHeyzer-Williams M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10907-10912Google Scholar, 23Yagi H. Kamba R. Chiba K. Soga H. Yaguchi K. Nakamura M. Itoh T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 2000: 1435-1444Google Scholar). Inhibition of lymphocyte egress is associated with clinically useful immunosuppression in both transplantation and autoimmune disease models (24Brinkmann V. Pinschewer D. Chiba K. Feng L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 49-52Google Scholar, 25Brinkmann V. Pinschewer D.D. Feng L. Chen S. Transplantation. 2001; 72: 764-769Google Scholar, 26Brinkmann V. Chen S. Pinschewer D. Nikolova Z. Hof R. Transplant. Proc. 2001; 33: 530-531Google Scholar). Pleiotropic responses at low nanomolar plasma concentrations is seen in this system, because FTY720 mediates both lymphopenia and a transient dose-dependent bradycardia on initial dosing in humans (27Budde K. Schmouder R. Nashan B. Brunkhorst R. Lucker P. Mayer T. Brookman L. Nedelman J. Skerjanec A. Bohler T. Neumayer H. Am. J. Transplant. 2003; 3: 846-854Google Scholar). The therapeutic window for S1P receptor agonists may therefore depend on the association of single receptors with critical functions.We have combined a chemical approach with the use of S1P receptor null mice to help define receptor selectivity. We chose a chemical approach for S1P1, because of the absence of the knock-out. Published data on FTY720 phosphonate (respective IC50 values for human S1P1 (8.2 nm), S1P2 (>10,000 nm), S1P3 (151 nm), S1P4 (33 nm), and S1P5 (178 nm)) suggested that S1P1 is responsible for inhibition of lymphocyte egress (9Mandala S.

Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Google Scholar), a fact that was subsequently strengthened by structure-activity correlations among a collection of semi-selective S1PR agonists (43Doherty G. Forrest M.

We now show that the discovery of selective S1P receptor agonists is useful in demonstrating that selective biochemical signals can regulate complex in vivo biology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESS1P Receptor AgonistsAFD-(R) was the kind gift of Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland, Volker Brinkmann). 5-(4-Phenyl-5-trifluoromethylthiophen-2-yl)-3-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-(1,2,4)-oxadiazole was purchased from Maybridge (Tintagel, Cornwall).Cells and PlasmidsCHO cells stably expressing human S1P receptors (hS1P) hS1P1, hS1P2, hS1P3, hS1P4, and hS1P5, were kindly provided by Danilo Guerini (Novartis Pharma).Membrane PreparationsMembranes were prepared from CHO cells expressing human or murine S1P1, S1P2, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5, for use in ligand and [35S]GTPγS binding studies as described previously (9Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.-J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Google Scholar) and suspended in Buffer B with 15% glycerol and stored at -80 °C.Agonist AssaysMeasurements of [35S]GTPγS Binding—Serial dilutions of S1P (diluted in 4% BSA) or SEW2871 (diluted in Me2SO) were added to membranes (1–10 μg of protein/well) and assayed as described (9Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.-J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Google Scholar).Measurements of Ca+ Flux—Calcium flux assays in the Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR; Molecular Devices) format were performed as described (9Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.-J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Google Scholar). The assay was initiated by transferring an equal volume of ligand to the cell plate, and calcium flux was recorded over a 3-min interval. Cellular response was quantitated as maximal peak height by averaging triplicate wells and expressing as percent response relative to S1P activation without pretreatment. Spleen cells, after lysis of erythrocytes with 0.17 m NH4Cl, were separated by adherence to tissue-culture plastic and adherent (stromal cells, macrophages, and neutrophils), and non-adherent (lymphocytes) were assayed for calcium flux in response to SEW2871 or S1P or ionomycin separately. Fluorescence intensity is an absolute measure of fluorescence emission upon laser excitation. Flow cytometric measurement of calcium flux was performed on cells isolated by teasing apart lymph nodes to single cell suspensions, followed by loading with Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Cell-permeant fluorescence dye 3, calcium binding, 1 μm at 4 × 108 viable cells/ml). Cells were then labeled with non-activating antibodies to CD4 (CD4-PE, BD Pharmingen) and CD8 (CD8-PE), respectively, in the presence of propidium iodide. Absolute fluorescence intensity over a four-log scale is the standard method for comparisons of fluorescence intensity by FACS. Agonist challenge with 1 μm SEW2871, S1P, or ionomycin (Sigma) at 37 °C was performed in a temperature-controlled FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience, Mountain View, CA). FACS events were collected using CELLQUEST software (BD Bioscience), and then analyzed with FLOWJO (Treestar, San Carlos, CA). FACS events were collected for 30 s, and then ionomycin, S1P, or SEW2871 were added and events were collected for an additional 10 min. The ratio fluorescence at 420 nm to that at 510 nm was used to measure calcium flux of propidium iodide-negative cells.Western Blotting of S1P-activated KinasesControl CHO cells and the CHO cells stably transfected with human S1P1 or S1P3 were cultured to 50% confluence on 6-well plate in complete RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h and stimulated with SEW2871 diluted to various concentrations in the serum-free medium with 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA. At 5 min, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 125 mm NaCl, 20 mm CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting after separation on 10% SDS-PAGE using mouse monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody (sc-7383; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Akt antibody (BD Biosciences). Total ERK1 and ERK2 were detected using a rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal anti-ERK antibody (sc-94; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and total Akt was detected using a rabbit affinity-purified polyclonal anti-Akt1 antibody (BD Biosciences). Band intensities corresponding to pERK1, pERK2, and pAkt were quantitated by imaging (Kodak 1D Scientific Imaging Systems). Amounts of pERK1/2 and pAkt were normalized for the total amounts of ERK1/2 and Akt. Primary lymph node lymphocytes were teased from the peripheral and mesenteric nodes of C57 BL6 mice kept rigorously at 4 °C. Cells were warmed to 37 °C, stimulated for 5 min with S1P or SEW2871 (50 nm and 500 nm), or 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate or vehicle, and Akt and ERK phosphorylation was determined as above.Assay of S1P Receptors-dependent Cell MigrationCell adhesion and migration assays were performed as follows. Cells expressing CHO, CHO-S1P1, or CHO-S1P3 were starved overnight in regular medium without fetal bovine serum prior to migration assay. Cell migration assays were performed using modified Boyden chambers (tissue culture-treated, 6.5-mm diameter, 10-μm thickness, 8-μm pores, Transwell®; Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) containing polycarbonate membranes coated on the underside of the membrane with 5 μg/ml fibronectin in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C, rinsed once with PBS, and then placed into the lower chamber containing 500 μl of migration buffer (RPMI with 0.5% BSA; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Serum-starved cells were removed from culture dishes with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 mm EDTA and 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 0.01% trypsin, washed twice with migration buffer, and then resuspended in Migration buffer (106 cells/ml). 75,000 cells were then added to the top of each migration chamber and allowed to migrate to the underside of the top chamber for 3 h in the presence or absence of either S1P or SEW2871 (100 nm or 1 μm), which had been added to the lower chamber. The non-migratory cells on the upper membrane surface were removed with a cotton swab, and the migratory cells attached to the bottom surface of the membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with propidium iodide (1 μg/ml) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The number of migratory cells per membrane was evaluated by looking at five different fields with an inverted microscope using a 40× objective. Each determination represents the average of three individual wells. In control experiments, cell migration on vehicle control was less than 0.01% of the total cell population.Pharmacokinetic AnalysisAll samples were analyzed after CHCl3 extraction, evaporation to dryness, and redissolution in 0.1 ml of CHCl3, followed by splitless injection on an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph. Sample detection was carried out by using a 5973 mass-selective detector with single ion monitoring at 440 m/z for SEW2871 and 372 m/z for a spiked and structurally related internal standard, SEW2898. Limit of quantitation was 0.4 ng/μl in plasma, based on spikes into human serum. Sample amounts were determined by comparison to a standard curve, R2 = 0.99. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma levels was performed by using PK Solutions 2.0 software (Summit Research Services, Montrose, CO).Induction of Lymphopenia in MiceC57BL6 or S1P3-/- mice (16Ishii I. Friedman B. Ye X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J.A. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33697-33704Google Scholar) or their S1P3+/+ litter mate controls were gavaged with increasing doses of SEW2871 or vehicle (10% Me2SO/25% Tween 20 v/v), and blood collected into EDTA tubes (BD Biosciences). Full blood counts were determined by veterinary autoanalyzer calibrated for mouse blood (H2000, CARESIDE, Culver City, CA) at times stated as described previously (9Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.-J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Google Scholar). All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.HistologyC57Bl/6 mice were gavaged with 0.1 ml of vehicle or SEW 2871 (10 mg/kg). Sixteen hours later, mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes were fixed in 10% formalin in PBS and paraffin-embedded, and 5-μm sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were acquired by Metamorph software on an Olympus AX70 microscope.Measurement of Heart Rate in Conscious MiceEffects on heart rate in S1P3-/- or wild type littermates or C57BL6 controls were measured by ECG analysis in conscious mice using the ANONYmouse ECG screening system (MouseSpecifics, Boston, MA), before and after injection of the non-selective S1P receptor agonist AFD-(R) or vehicle control. No difference between WT littermates and C57BL6 mice were seen.RESULTSHigh Throughput Screening Identifies S1P1-selective Agonists—Published binding studies on hS1P1 with FTY720 and FTY-P (9Mandala S.

Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Google Scholar), as well as mutagenesis and modeling with natural ligand S1P (28Parrill A.L. Wang D. Bautista D.L. Van. Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J. Baker D.L.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 309-317Google Scholar), suggested a two-site binding model. The hydrophobic-aromatic residues bind within receptor transmembrane domains and the ligand headgroups form salt bridges with glutamate and arginine side chains. Specifically, FTY720 has a measurable IC50 (300 nm) for S1P1 that is enhanced 1000-fold by the enantioselective addition of the phosphate ester (9Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E.

FTY720 binding implies that G-protein-coupled receptor privileged structures, structurally unrelated to S1P, could likely access the transmembrane site as agonists, with sequence differences between receptor subtypes making the discovery of selective agonists probable (30Rosen H. Liao J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 461-468Google Scholar). Indeed, such agents, including the featured compound in this report, have previously been identified and characterized (43Doherty G.

Unlike S1P, it has no solubilizing or charged headgroups. S1P showed 50% maximal receptor activation in the GTPγS binding assays (EC50) of 0.4 ± 0.24 nm (mean ± S.D.; n = 6) on human S1P1 (hS1P1), whereas EC50 values for SEW2871 on hS1P1 were 13 ± 8.58 nm (mean ± S.D.; n = 3) (Fig. 1B). Like S1P, SEW2871 was a full agonist with levels of receptor activation comparable to S1P (Fig. 1B). Although S1P is a non-selective agonist with EC50 values (mean ± S.D.) of 3.8 ± 3.5 nm (hS1P2; n = 4), 0.6 ± 0.35 nm (hS1P3; n = 6), 67 ± 13 nm (hS1P4; n = 4), 0.5 ± 0.39 nm (hS1P5; n = 3) on the respective human receptors, SEW2871 was inactive at 10,000 nm on hS1P2, hS1P3, hS1P4, and hS1P5 (Fig. 1C).We confirmed full selective agonism for hS1P1 alone in the ligand-dependent calcium flux assay (Fig. 1D) for SEW2871 in stably transfected CHO cell lines, with no significant activation of hS1P2–5 (Fig. 1D) up to ≥ 10 μm. We found evidence for selective but full agonism of murine S1P1 (mS1P1), EC50 = 20.7 nm (Fig. 2A), with no activity at 10 μm on mS1P2–5 (Fig. 2B). EC50 values for S1P on the transiently transfected murine receptors S1P1–5 were 1.4 nm (mS1P1), 2.0 nm (mS1P2), 2.3 nm (mS1P3), 75 nm (mS1P4), and 16 nm (mS1P5), respectively. Identical selectivity was seen both in membranes of CHO cells transiently transfected with the respective murine receptors and assayed for agonism in GTPγS binding assays, as well as in intact cells in calcium flux assays (Fig. 2C). Pretreatment with 30 ng/ml pertussis toxin in the GTPγS assay fully inhibited GTPγS binding induced by either S1P or SEW2871, confirming that SEW2871 is also acting through the Gi-coupled receptor.Fig. 2SEW2871 is a selective agonist for mS1P1 receptor. A, S1P and SEW2871 activation of mS1P1 receptor. CHO cell membranes expressing transiently transfected mS1P1 receptor were tested for agonism in a GTPγS binding assay. SEW2871 (open squares) was compared with the physiological ligand S1P (closed squares) and results normalized to percentage of GTPγS induced at maximal S1P concentrations. EC50 values were 20.7 nm for SEW2871 and 1.4 nm for S1P. B, SEW2871 is not an agonist on mS1P2–5. CHO cell membranes transiently expressing one of mS1P2–5 were assayed for ligand-induced GTPγS binding. Responses to S1P (see figure for symbol key) are shown at 10 and 100 nm for: mS1P2, mS1P3, mS1P4, and mS1P5, respectively. SEW2871 had no effect on mS1P2, mS1P3, mS1P4, and mS1P5 at concentrations up to 10 μm. C, comparison of calcium flux stimulation on the murine S1P receptors by 100 nm S1P (black columns) or SEW2871 (gray column) by FLIPR. (Only mS1P1 showed a significant calcium flux to SEW2871.) Fluorescence intensity is intended as the absolute measure of fluorescence emission upon laser excitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We also compared kinase phosphorylation in response to S1P and SEW2871 stimulation in both S1P1 and S1P3 CHO cell lines (Table I). Substantial ligand concentration-dependent pAKT and pERK1 signals were induced by SEW2871 in S1P1 but not S1P3 CHO cells, whereas modest phosphorylation of pERK2 was also seen. In contrast, S1P activated kinases in both cell lines equally (not shown).Table IS1P1-mediated Akt and ERK1/2 phosphorylation The -fold increases from the control Me2SO-treated cells are shown.SEW2871pAktpERK2pERK1S1P1-CHOS1P3-CHOS1P1-CHOS1P3-CHOS1P1-CHOS1P3-CHOnm54.7×1.9×1.5×1.1×4.2×NDaND, not detected5012.1×1.7×1.8×0.6×4.7×ND50013.8×1.7×1.8×1.1×5.8×NDa ND, not detected Open table in a new tab The multiple signals induced by SEW2871 are sufficient to replicate complex functional responses of S1P through S1P1. In a Transwell migration assay, SEW2871 (Fig. 3B) and S1P (Fig. 3E) induced equivalent cell migration in vivo in S1P1-CHO cells with obvious morphology for stimulation of cytoskeletal rearrangements. Minimal cell migration or cytoskeletal reorganization occurred in response to either S1P or SEW2871 in untransfected CHO cells (<0.01% of cell migrated) (Fig. 3, A and D), whereas S1P3 CHO cells migrated and changed shape in response to S1P (Fig. 3C) but not SEW2871 (Fig. 3F), confirming the selectivity of SEW2871. Despite its structural dissimilarities to S1P, and lack of headgroups, SEW2871 is a selective low nanomolar full agonist of S1P1 in all biochemical parameters and one complex cellular behavior tested, and could potentially be usefully studied in vivo.Fig. 3Migration assay on S1P1- and S1P3-expressing cells in response to S1P and SEW2871. CHO, CHO-S1P1, and CHO-S1P3 cells were assayed in a cell migration assay on Transwell membranes upon stimulation with 100 nm S1P (A–C) or 1 μm SEW2871 (D–F"

https://openalex.org/W2118852675,"We developed a method for systematically comparing gene expression patterns across organisms using genome-wide comparative analysis of DNA microarray experiments. We identified analogous gene expression programs comprising shared patterns of regulation across orthologous genes. Biological features of these patterns could be identified as highly conserved subpatterns that correspond to Gene Ontology categories. Here, we demonstrate these methods by analyzing a specific biological process, aging, and show that similar analysis can be applied to a range of biological processes. We found that two highly diverged animals, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, implement a shared adult-onset expression program of genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism, DNA repair, catabolism, peptidolysis and cellular transport. Most of these changes were implemented early in adulthood. Using this approach to search databases of gene expression data, we found conserved transcriptional signatures in larval development, embryogenesis, gametogenesis and mRNA degradation."

The sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor-signaling pathway is believed to have potent effects on cell trafficking in the immune system. To determine the precise role of the S1P1 receptor on T-cells, we established a T-cell-specific S1P1 knock-out mouse. The mutant mice showed a block in the egress of mature T-cells into the periphery. The expression of the S1P1 receptor was up-regulated in mature thymocytes, and its deletion altered the chemotactic responses of thymocytes to sphingosine 1-phosphate. The results indicated that the expression of the S1P1 receptor on T-cells controls their exit from the thymus and entry into the blood and, thus, has a central role in regulating the numbers of peripheral T-cells.

To begin to address the physiologic function of the S1P1 receptor and sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling in T-cells, we have generated a T-cell-specific mouse knock-out of the S1P1 receptor using the Cre/loxP system. Our results with these mice reveal a crucial role for the S1P1 receptor in the egress of mature T-cells from the thymus into the circulation. Generation of the S1P1loxP/loxP Lck-Cre Mice—We previously generated the S1P1loxP/loxP mice (12Allende M.L. Yamashita T. Proia R.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 3665-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) carrying the S1P1 gene modified by two loxP sequences flanking exon 2. To specifically delete the S1P1 receptor from T-cells, S1P1loxP/loxP mice were bred with an Lck-driven Cre transgenic mouse strain, provided by Dr. J. D. Marth (27Orban P.C. Chui D. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6861-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). S1P1loxP/loxP mice carrying the Lck-Cre gene (TCS1P1KO) and littermate S1P1loxP/loxP mice (controls) were genotyped by PCR using Lck-Cre-specific primers: lck1 on the lck-proximal promoter, 5′CCTCCTGTGAACTTGGTGCTTGAG; lck2 on the Cre coding region, 5′TGCATCGACCGGTAATGCAG. To identify the S1P1 wild type (S1P1WT) and floxed alleles (S1P1loxP) by PCR, the following primers were used: P1, 5′GAGCGGAGGAAGTTAAAAGTG; P2, 5′CCTCCTAAGAGATTGCAGCAA. P1 and P2 amplify an approximately 250-bp fragment for the S1P1loxP allele and a 200-bp fragment for the S1P1WT allele. Lymphocyte Analysis—T-cells were purified from 6-8-week-old thymi and spleens using magnetic beads coated with the anti-CD90.2 antibody (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) according to the manufacturer's instructions. B-cells were purified using MACS B220 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Whole blood counts were determined in the Department of Laboratory Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. Real-time PCR—Total RNA was purified from T-cells and B-cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Mouse S1P1 receptor mRNA was quantified by real time PCR on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was used as an internal control. Flow Cytometry—Thymus, spleen, peripheral lymph nodes (lingual, axillary, bronchial, and inguinal), mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches from 6-10-week-old mice were dissected and mechanically disaggregated. Single cell suspensions were obtained using a 40-μm cell strainer. Red blood cells were removed by NH4Cl lysis. Cells were diluted in 1% BSA-phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with anti-FcγR antibody (BD Biosciences) to block the binding of conjugated antibodies to FcγR. Cells then were incubated with the proper antibodies on ice for 30 min and then washed and analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur (BD Biosciences). The antibodies, phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled anti-CD3ϵ, PE-Cy5-labeled anti-CD4, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-CD62L were obtained from BD Biosciences. PE-conjugated anti-CD8 antibody was purchased from Beckman Coulter (Fullerton, CA). For S1P1 staining, anti-CD4- and anti-CD8-labeled cells were permeabilized using the Cytofix-Perm kit (BD Biosciences) followed by incubation with a rabbit anti-human S1P1 C-terminal polyclonal antibody, followed by an FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. As a control, the S1P1 antibody was incubated with a blocking peptide before the addition to the cells. For staining of blood lymphocytes, peripheral blood was collected, red cells were lysed, and cells were stained with FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 (BD Biosciences) and PE-conjugated anti-CD3. Immunohistochemistry—Frozen sections (12 μm) were fixed in cold acetone and stained with specific antibodies followed by fluorescent secondary antibodies and then were visualized. Hamster anti-mouse CD3 and rat anti-mouse B220 were obtained from BD Biosciences. FITC-conjugated anti-hamster IgG and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. Intrathymic Labeling of Thymocytes—Thymocytes were labeled as previously described (25Yagi H. Kamba R. Chiba K. Soga H. Yaguchi K. Nakamura M. Itoh T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Scollay R.G. Butcher E.C. Weissman I.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1980; 10: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with Avertin (Sigma). The chest cavity was opened and 10 μl of 1 mg/ml FITC in phosphate-buffered saline was injected per thymus lobe. Then, the skin overlying the chest wall was closed using surgical clips. After 20 h, mice were sacrificed to harvest thymus and spleen. Cells were stained for PE-conjugated anti-CD3 antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. In general, 60-90% of the CD3+ thymocytes were FITC-labeled using this technique. The percentage of recent thymic emigrants in spleens was expressed as the number of CD3+ FITC+ cells per 5 × 105 splenocytes normalized by the fraction of thymocytes labeled in each particular mouse. Chemotaxis Assay—The response of mouse thymocytes toward sphingosine 1-phosphate was studied using 6.5-mm Transwell inserts with a 5-μm pore size (Corning, Cambridge, MA). A thymocyte cell suspension (100 μl at 1 × 107/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium plus 0.4 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA (Sigma) (medium + fatty acid-free BSA) was added to each insert in a well containing 600 μl of a solution of sphingosine 1-phosphate (Avanti) prepared in medium + fatty acid-free BSA. Wells containing medium + fatty acid-free BSA without sphingosine 1-phosphate were used as controls. After 3 h at 37 °C, cells in the wells were harvested, counted, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Generation and Characterization of T-cell-specific S1P1 Knock-out Mice—To specifically delete the S1P1 receptor in T-cells, S1P1loxP/loxP mice (12Allende M.L. Yamashita T. Proia R.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 3665-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) were crossed with Lck-Cre transgenic mice (Fig. 1). Lck-Cre transgenic mice express the Cre recombinase under the control of the Lck proximal promoter, which drives the Cre expression specifically in immature thymocytes (27Orban P.C. Chui D. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6861-6865Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 29Hennet T. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12070-12074Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mice with a T-cell-specific knock-out of the S1P1 receptor (TCS1P1KO mice) appeared normal at birth and as adults and were fertile. A specific and substantial reduction of S1P1 receptor mRNA expression in T-cells of TCS1P1KO mice was confirmed by real time PCR. The S1P1 receptor mRNA expression level in thymocytes of TCS1P1KO mice was found to be reduced by more than 90% (Fig. 2A) compared with control littermates. A reduction of S1P1 receptor mRNA was not seen in B-cells of TCS1P1KO mice (Fig. 2A). In fact, the S1P1 mRNA expression level in splenic B-cells showed a slight increase compared with controls, although the increase was not statistically significant. TCS1P1KO Mice Have Decreased Numbers of T-cell Lymphocytes in Blood and in Peripheral Lymphoid Organs—Peripheral blood cell counts demonstrated a significant reduction of lymphocytes in TCS1P1KO mice (Fig. 2B), whereas the absolute cell numbers of other leukocyte populations were not affected (data not shown). In particular, the percentage of T-cells (CD3+ lymphocytes) in the blood of TCS1P1KO mice was significantly depressed compared with controls (Fig. 2C). As would be expected with the deficiency of T-cells, the percentage of circulating B-cells (B220+ lymphocytes) was increased in the TCS1P1KO mice (percentage of circulating B220+ lymphocytes in control mice, 34 + 8; in TCS1P1KO mice, 61 + 18; n = 4). Spleens from the TCS1P1KO mice had a significantly decreased percentage of CD3+ cells (Fig. 2D) as well as CD4+ and CD8+ cells (data not shown) compared with spleens from control mice. Immunostaining of sections from adult spleens revealed substantially fewer T-cells in the follicles and in the red pulp (Fig. 3, A-D) in TCS1P1KO mice. B-cells found in the follicles and marginal zone appeared to be unaffected in spleens from TCS1P1KO mice (Fig. 3, A-D). Compared with controls, the TCS1P1KO mice exhibited a significant reduction in the number of CD3+ cells in peripheral lymph nodes and a still lesser reduction of CD3+ cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 2D). A slight reduction was observed in Peyer's patches in TCS1P1KO mice although it was not statistically significant (Fig. 2D). Sections of peripheral lymph nodes from TCS1P1KO mice showed that the follicles contained greatly decreased numbers of T-cells (Fig. 3, E and F), whereas B-cells appeared unaffected. Together, the results indicate that T-cells were substantially and specifically depleted in blood and in secondary lymphoid organs of TCS1P1KO mice. Mature T-cells Accumulate in the TCS1P1KO Thymus—To determine whether the absence of the S1P1 receptor was affecting thymocyte differentiation, we analyzed T-cell subpopulations in the thymus. The T-cell-specific deletion of the S1P1 receptor resulted in an overall increase in the proportion of mature thymocytes. Thymi from TCS1P1KO mice contained a higher proportion of mature single positive CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ cells and a decreased proportion of the less mature CD4+CD8+ double positive cells compared with controls. There was not a significant change in the level of immature double negative CD4-CD8- thymocytes (Fig. 4, A and B). The percentages of the relatively mature CD3high (Fig. 4, C and D) and CD62Lhigh (Fig. 4, E and F) thymocytes were also increased in TCS1P1KO mice relative to controls. High expression of these markers is characteristic of fully mature thymocytes with potential for thymic emigration (30Gabor M.J. Godfrey D.I. Scollay R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2010-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 31Lee C.K. Kim K. Welniak L.A. Murphy W.J. Muegge K. Durum S.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 1360-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In particular, single positive CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ cells from TCS1P1KO mice expressed higher levels of CD62L than controls (Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, no differences were observed in CD62L expression on the less mature double positive CD4+CD8+ cells from TCS1P1KO mice compared with controls (Fig. 4, E and F). The results indicate that TCS1P1KO thymocytes have the ability to mature but that these mature T-cells accumulate in the thymus. Histological analysis of thymi from TCS1P1KO mice indicated that the overall architecture of the organ was intact (Fig. 5, A and B). The TCS1P1KO thymi showed enlarged medullary areas with increased CD3 expression compared with control sections (Fig. 5, C and D) consistent with an accumulation of mature T-cells. Impaired Thymic Emigration in TCS1P1KO Mice—To determine whether the reduction of T-cells in the periphery was the result of impaired emigration from the thymus, we injected FITC into the thymus to trace recent thymic emigrants. FITC binds to proteins on the cell surface of thymocytes, which retain the modification after thymocytes exit the thymus and migrate to the periphery (30Gabor M.J. Godfrey D.I. Scollay R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2010-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Twenty h following the intrathymic FITC injection, the number of recent thymic emigrants in the spleen of TCS1P1KO mice (identified as PE-CD3+FITC+ cells) was found to be significantly reduced by about 60% compared with controls (Fig. 6B). The reduced number of recent thymic emigrants substantiates a defect in emigration of mature T-cells from thymus to the periphery in the TCS1P1KO mice. Up-regulation of the S1P1 Receptor on Mature Thymocytes—We analyzed the expression level of the S1P1 receptor in normal thymocytes by flow cytometry using a polyclonal antibody against S1P1. The results revealed that mature, single positive CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ thymocytes expressed substantially higher levels of S1P1 receptor protein compared with less mature double positive CD4+CD8+ thymocytes (Fig. 6A). Next we determined the relative responses of single positive CD4+CD8- and CD4-CD8+ and double positive CD4+CD8+ thymocytes to sphingosine 1-phosphate in a chemotaxis assay. A significantly higher ratio of mature single positive to less mature double positive cells was found in the lower chamber of the chemotaxis apparatus when it contained sphingosine 1-phosphate compared with medium alone. This response to sphingosine 1-phosphate was lost in TCS1P1KO thymocytes (Fig. 6C). The S1P1 receptor is expressed on diverse cell and tissue types suggesting that the signaling pathway mediated by this receptor may be involved in multiple physiological processes. Earlier results from gene-targeted mice had revealed an essential role for the S1P1 receptor in endothelial cells in regulating the formation of stable blood vessels (11Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T. Mi Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 12Allende M.L. Yamashita T. Proia R.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 3665-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). The results presented here demonstrate that the S1P1 receptor on T-cells has a crucial function in the process by which T-cells exit from the thymus and enter the blood. With the T-cell-specific deletion of the S1P1 receptor, mature T-cells accumulated in the thymus. Intrathymic labeling of thymocytes provided direct evidence that emigration of mature thymocytes was impaired in TCS1P1KO mice. As a result of the defect in thymic exit, much lower numbers of T-cells were found in the secondary lymphoid organs compared with controls. Thymocyte egress is known to require a Gαi signaling pathway. Mice expressing the catalytic subunit of pertussis toxin in thymocytes (an inhibitor of the Gαi pathway) accumulate mature T-cells in the thymus (32Chaffin K.E. Perlmutter R.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), thus resembling the phenotype of the TCS1P1KO mice. Because the S1P1 receptor signals exclusively through Gαi, the pertussis toxin inhibition of thymocyte egress is likely to be at least partially caused by a block in the S1P1 receptor signaling pathway. We have shown that the S1P1 receptor level is up-regulated in mature single positive thymocytes relative to less mature double positive thymocytes. Also, we determined that sphingosine 1-phosphate increased the ratio of mature single positive thymocytes to less mature double positive thymocytes in a chemotaxis assay and that this response is mediated by the S1P1 receptor. Together, these results are consistent with a role for receptor expression in regulating the thymic exit process. S1P1 receptor signaling may control the emigration of T-cells from the thymus either directly or indirectly. Sphingosine 1-phosphate levels are known to be very high (0.1-1 μm) in the blood relative to various tissues (33Yatomi Y. Ozaki Y. Ohmori T. Igarashi Y. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 64: 107-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and may directly stimulate the migration of mature thymocytes out of the thymus via a sphingosine 1-phosphate-directed chemotactic response. Indeed, sphingosine 1-phosphate, via signaling through the S1P1 receptor, previously has been shown to be a chemotactic factor for a variety of cell types including T-lymphocytes (8Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 17Graeler M. Shankar G. Goetzl E.J. J.

Alternatively, sphingosine 1-phosphate may regulate the responses of thymocytes to thymic chemokines important for retention or emigration. Sphingosine 1-phosphate has been demonstrated to regulate the chemotactic responses of T-cells to chemokines in a concentration-dependent manner (17Graeler M. Shankar G. Goetzl E.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4084-4087Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 35Honig S.M. Fu S. Mao X. Yopp A. Gunn M.D. Randolph G.J. Bromberg J.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The S1P receptor agonist FTY720, after phosphorylation by a sphingosine kinase, binds to 4 of the 5 S1P receptors, including S1P1, and causes the redistribution of lymphocytes from the circulation to secondary lymphoid tissues (19Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T. Hiestand P. Foster C.A. Zollinger M. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21453-21457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar, 22Mandala S. Hajdu R. Bergstrom J. Quackenbush E. Xie J. Milligan J. Thornton R. Shei G.J. Card D. Keohane C. Rosenbach M. Hale J. Lynch C.L. Rupprecht K. Parsons W. Rosen H. Science. 2002; 296: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). In the thymus, FTY720 at low doses and within a short period of time triggers a maturation of single positive cells to a late medullary phenotype and, ultimately, causes an inhibition of T-cell emigration without changes in the total single positive cell numbers (26Rosen H. Alfonso C. Surh C.D. McHeyzer-Williams M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10907-10912Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). With prolonged FTY720 treatment, mice show an increase in mature single positive cells in the thymus and a block in emigration of T-cells to the periphery (25Yagi H. Kamba R. Chiba K. Soga H. Yaguchi K. Nakamura M. Itoh T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These results with FTY720 point to an important role of S1P receptors in regulating T-cell trafficking in the thymus and in the periphery. However, it has not been clear which S1P receptors mediate these effects; S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors all respond to phosphorylated FTY720. Also unknown are which cells might be targeted. S1P receptor signaling might regulate trafficking directly within lymphocytes or via alterations in the endothelium. The similarity of the thymic phenotype of TCS1P1KO mice with mice after prolonged treatment with FTY720 would be consistent with a model where phosphorylated FTY720 exerts an effect via an interaction with the S1P1 receptor on T-cells. However, our data with the T-cell specific knock-out of S1P1 raises the possibility that FTY720 actions may actually be the result of an inhibition of the S1P1 receptor-signaling pathway, possibly by desensitization caused by constant stimulation with the agonist. In general, early desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors occurs rapidly after agonist exposure and involves phosphorylation and sequestration of the receptor (36Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). In fact, sphingosine 1-phosphate induces S1P1 receptor internalization into a perinuclear endosomal compartment (37Liu C.H. Thangada S. Lee M.J. Van Brocklyn J.R. Spiegel S. Hla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1179-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A more acute inhibition process, which involves a decrease in receptor presence on the cell surface because of down-regulation or internalization and lysosomal degradation, may be observed after a prolonged agonist exposure (36Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar). In summary, our data are consistent with a model where the S1P1 receptor in maturing thymocytes is a key regulator of T-cell egress from the thymus (Fig. 6D). The regulated expression of S1P1 receptor levels may control responsiveness to the high levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate in blood, which selectively induces mature T-cell migration to the periphery. Similarities between the process of lymphocyte egress from the thymus and lymph nodes suggest that the latter process might also be dependent on the S1P1 receptor on lymphocytes."

These inclusion bodies are often immunoreactive for Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and are implicated in the pathology of ALS. On the basis of this and a similar clinical presentation of symptoms in the familial (fALS) and sporadic forms of ALS, we sought to investigate the possibility that there exists a common disease-related aggregation pathway for fALS-associated mutant SODs and wild type SOD1. We have previously shown that oxidation of fALS-associated mutant SODs produces aggregates that have the same morphological, structural, and tinctorial features as those found in SOD1 inclusion bodies in ALS. Here, we show that oxidative damage of wild type SOD at physiological concentrations (∼40 μm) results in destabilization and aggregation in vitro. Oxidation of either mutant or wild type SOD1 causes the enzyme to dissociate to monomers prior to aggregation. Only small changes in secondary and tertiary structure are associated with monomer formation. These results indicate a common aggregation prone monomeric intermediate for wild type and fALS-associated mutant SODs and provides a link between sporadic and familial ALS.

Although ALS is predominately a sporadic disease, ∼10% of cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and a subset of these fALS cases are caused by mutations in the SOD1 gene (1Majoor-Krakauer D. Willems P.J. Hofman A. Clin. Genet. 2003; 63: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The gene product of SOD1, cytoplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes the disproportionation reaction of superoxide radicals (1Majoor-Krakauer D. Willems P.J. Hofman A. Clin. Genet. 2003; 63: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). There are several lines of evidence that SOD1 mutations result in a gain, rather than loss of function that causes ALS. For instance, some fALS-associated mutant SOD1s retain full enzymatic activity (2Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8292-8296Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In addition, SOD1 knock-out mice lack ALS symptoms, whereas transgenic mice expressing the fALS-associated mutant G93A SOD1 develop ALS-like symptoms despite expression of endogenous mouse SOD1 (3Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Lastly, overexpression of human wild type SOD1 fails to alleviate symptoms in this transgenic mouse model for ALS (3Bruijn L.I. Houseweart M.K. Kato S. Anderson K.L. Anderson S.D. Ohama E. Reaume A.G. Scott R.W. Cleveland D.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). One hypothesis of the gain of function of SOD1 is that misfolding of the mutant alters the catalytic mechanism to allow production of oxidants such as peroxynitrite (4Estevez A.G. Crow J.P. Sampson J.B. Reiter C. Zhuang Y. Richardson G.J. Tarpey M.M. Barbeito L. Beckman J.S. Science. 1999; 286: 2498-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar) and possibly hydrogen peroxide (5Yim M.B. Kang J.H. Yim H.S. Kwak H.S. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These reactive nitrogen and oxygen species cause toxicity by accumulated damage to proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids. Another major hypothesis is toxicity caused by intracellular aggregation of SOD1. SOD1 inclusion bodies, which also react with anti-ubiquitin antibodies, are a common pathological finding in motor neurons and neighboring astrocytes of ALS patients (6Watanabe M. Dykes-Hoberg M. Culotta V.C. Price D.L. Wong P.C. Rothstein J.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These two hypotheses, however, are not mutually exclusive when considering that oxidative modification of proteins may contribute to aggregation and protease resistance. Protein aggregates are a common pathological feature of many neurological disorders (7Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar), including Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases. In each case, misfolding and aggregation appears to be linked to cytotoxicity (7Caughey B. Lansbury P.T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). Similarly, the aggregation propensity of mutant SOD1s may be the mechanism by which over 100 disparate mutations cause a common ALS phenotype. SOD1 aggregates may be inherently toxic or cause motor neuron toxicity by sequestering chaperones and blocking proper functioning of the proteasome (8Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of either the chaperone Hsp70 (9Bruening W. Roy J. Giasson B. Figlewicz D.A. Mushynski W.E. Durham H.D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) or the ubiquitin E3 ligase Dorfin (10Niwa J. Ishigaki S. Hishikawa N. Yamamoto M. Doyu M. Murata S. Tanaka K. Taniguchi N. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36793-36798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) preserves the viability of cells expressing fALS mutant SOD1s by decreasing the number of intracellular SOD1 aggregates. Understanding the details of the biophysical pathway by which SOD1 aggregation occurs might then yield avenues for novel therapeutics for ALS. To carry out such an investigation, we previously developed a physiologically relevant cell-free model of SOD1 aggregation (11Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). As a natural free radical scavenger and metalloprotein, SOD1 in motor neurons is exposed to greater oxidative stress than other proteins. Based on this occupational hazard, as well as the long half-life (12Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Becher M.W. Pardo C.A. Lee M.K. Xu Z.S. Thinakaran G. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Price D.L. Hoffman P.N. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and high concentration of SOD1 in motor neurons (13Pardo C.A. Xu Z. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we proposed that SOD1 is especially susceptible to oxidation-induced aggregation in motor neurons. Indeed, it has been shown that ALS patients display higher levels of oxidative stress than age-matched controls (14Ferrante R.J. Browne S.E. Shinobu L.A. Bowling A.C. Baik M.J. MacGarvey U. Kowall N.W. Brown Jr., R.H. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2064-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) and transgenic mouse models for fALS also show higher levels of oxidized SOD1 (15Andrus P.K. Fleck T.J. Gurney M.E. Hall E.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In our cell-free model, we used metal-catalyzed oxidation (MCO), a physiologically relevant process, to induce oxidative stress. MCO may represent the major cause of SOD1 aggregation in vivo, because it is the major source of hydroxyl radicals in vivo, it has been implicated as a major cause of protein modification in aging, and it marks proteins for degradation (16Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that fALS-associated mutants of SOD1 were extremely prone to form visible aggregates upon oxidation compared with wild type protein (11Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Examination of the morphology, structure, and tinctorial properties of these aggregates demonstrated their similarity to those found in intracellular inclusion bodies seen in ALS patients and in cell lines. ALS inclusion bodies are not stained with the amyloid dye Congo Red (17Okamoto K. Hirai S. Yamazaki T. Sun X.Y. Nakazato Y. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 129: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and are all composed of a mixture of granular aggregates and some thick fibers (18Koide T. Igarashi S. Kikugawa K. Nakano R.

Neurosci. 2003; 26: 267-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). Examination of SOD1 aggregates produced in our model system by electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and dye binding demonstrated that they had identical properties with in vivo aggregates. Finally, the in vitro aggregates had circular dichroism spectra consistent with nonspecific aggregation seen in vivo (11Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the same model to dissect the kinetics of the SOD1 aggregation pathway. SALS and fALS have similar clinical features, and inclusion bodies are seen in both forms of the disease (22Piao Y.S. Wakabayashi K. Kakita A. Yamada M. Hayashi S. Morita T. Ikuta F. Oyanagi K. Takahashi H. Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Hyaline-like inclusion bodies that are SOD1 immunoreactive are typical of fALS (23Cleveland D.W. Rothstein J.D. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar), whereas skein-like inclusion bodies, which can be SOD1 immunoreactive (24Chou S.M. Han C.Y. Wang H.S. Vlassara H.

We find that SOD1, normally a dimeric enzyme, dissociates to monomers prior to aggregation for both wild type and mutant proteins. This dissociation is accompanied by minimal changes in the secondary structure of SOD1. This common intermediate suggests a common pathway for the aggregation of mutant and wild type SOD1 and provides a mechanistic link between sporadic and familial ALS. In Vitro Aggregation of SOD1—Wild type SOD1 from human erythrocytes and all of the other reagents were from Sigma. Mutant human SOD1s were prepared as reported previously (11Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). MCO reactions consisted of 10-100 μm SOD1, 4 mm ascorbic acid, and 0.2 mm CuCl2 in 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, whereas control reactions were 10-100 μm SOD1 in buffer. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 24-48 h. Right Angle Light Scattering—Scattering measurements were made with a Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set to 350 nm. All of the samples were vortexed prior to measurement to dislodge aggregates. 8-Anilino-1-napthalene-sulfonic Acid (ANS) Binding—Oxidized and control SOD1 were incubated for 30 min with 20 μm ANS before measuring emission spectrum with excitation at 372 nm. The signal was integrated from 400 to 600 nm. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)—Data were collected with a DynaPro Protein Solutions DLS module at 37 °C, 10-s averaging time. MCO reactions for either 40 μm wild type SOD1 or 10 μm mutant SOD1 (A4V) were initiated by the addition of CuCl2. Consecutive measurements (>10) were used for the regularization analysis by DYNAMICS software. Autocorrelation coefficients for each of the minimum 10 measurements for each time point were averaged and normalized to a maximum of 2 and a minimum of 1 for comparability. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation was performed at 20 °C on a Beckman XLI analytical ultracentrifuge using an AN50-Ti rotor. Sedimentation equilibrium runs using six-channel charcoal-Epon cells were performed for 24 h prior to data acquisition. Molecular weight determinations involved global analysis of data acquired at five different speeds using Beckman XL-I software where absorbance versus radial position data were fitted to the sedimentation equilibrium equation using non-linear least squares techniques. The partial specific volume and density of the sample were calculated using the program SEDENTERP from the amino acid sequence and buffer composition, respectively. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)—Differential scanning calorimetric studies were performed using a Nano DSC (Calorimetry Sciences, Provo, UT). Samples of 10 μm oxidized and control SOD1 were concentrated to 30 μm (∼1 mg/ml) using Amicon membrane concentrators (15-kDa molecular mass cut off). DSC traces of 1 mg/ml fresh, oxidized, and control SOD1s in 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, were obtained sequentially. The identical solution without protein was used as a reference. Both sample and reference solutions were degassed at 4 °C before scanning from 20 to 120 °C at 1 °C/min. Circular Dichroism (CD)—The CD spectra of oxidized and unoxidized SOD1 were recorded on an Aviv Circular Dichroism Spectrometer Model 62 DS at 25 °C in a 1-mm path length cell using 1 nm band width. Tryptophan Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements were taken on a Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorescence spectrophotometer with excitation wavelength set to 280 nm and a band pass of 4 nm. Capillary Liquid Chromatography MS/MS—SOD1 (30 μm) was incubated with 2 mm ascorbate, 25 μm copper, 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at 37 °C for 24 h. The protein was reduced and alkylated with dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, diluted, and then digested with trypsin (25:1 substrate to enzyme ratio) at 38 °C for 50 h and analyzed by capillary liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Peptides were analyzed using a Q-TOF Ultima mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) coupled to a capillary high pressure liquid chromatography. The fraction of the sample that did not bind to the C18 column (mostly guanidine HCl) was redirected to the waste. Peptides eluted by acetonitrile were ionized by electrospray, and peptide ions were automatically selected and fragmented in a data-dependent acquisition mode. Data base searching was done with Mascot (Matrix Science). Wild Type SOD1 Is Aggregation-prone under Oxidative Stress—Protein aggregation is inherently a highly concentration-dependent process. To ensure the physiological relevance of our in vitro aggregation system, we used neurophysiological concentrations of SOD1. Kurobe et al. (27Kurobe N. Suzuki F. Okajima K. Kato K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 187: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) found that the SOD1 content of erythrocytes is 0.95 ± 0.07 μg of SOD1/mg hemoglobin, which translates to a molar concentration of 10 μm (based on normal values for mean corpuscular hemoglobin and volume (28Noble J. Noble: Textbook of Primary Care Medicine. 3rd Ed. Mosby, St. Louis, MO2001: 1089Google Scholar)). The concentration of SOD1 is ∼4.5 times greater in brain than in erythrocytes (27Kurobe N. Suzuki F. Okajima K. Kato K. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1990; 187: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), corresponding to a concentration of 45 μm. Intracellular SOD1 concentration in motor neurons may be even higher (13Pardo C.A. Xu Z. Borchelt D.R. Price D.L. Sisodia S.S. Cleveland D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the 0-100 μm concentration range. MCO of SOD1 at neutral pH was used to induce aggregation. The concentration dependence of the aggregation reaction measured by right angle light scattering is shown in Fig. 1A. At low concentrations of SOD1, light scattering from both oxidized and control samples were comparable to buffer, indicating that protein aggregates were absent. Increasing SOD1 concentrations caused the appearance of large visible aggregates (>350 nm diameter) in oxidized but not in control samples where scattering remains at buffer base-line levels. Light scattering levels were proportional to SOD1 concentrations; however, the absolute scattering intensity from 100 μm oxidized SOD1 is significantly lower (∼30%) than the scattering intensity from only 10 μm zinc-deficient SOD1 (11Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The amount of scattered light is proportional to both the size and number of aggregates, so there must be either fewer or smaller aggregates in the case of wild type holo-SOD1 than zinc-deficient SOD1. These data suggest that the aggregation propensity of wild type SOD1 is lower than that of zinc-deficient SOD1 or fALS-associated SOD1 mutants. ANS fluorescence is a selective probe of the molten globule state of a protein and is proportional to hydrophobic surface area available for binding fluorophores (29Kuwajima K. Proteins. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). The fluorescence enhancement due to ANS-aggregate interactions is shown in Fig. 1B. ANS shows a slight increase in fluorescence in the MCO buffer over the control buffer in the absence of SOD1 (0 μm SOD1), and ANS fluorescence increases with concentration of unoxidized SOD1, possibly because of minimal binding to native SOD1. These effects, however, are small compared with the large increase in fluorescence upon binding SOD1 aggregates. The increase observed (Fig. 1B) is a sensitive indicator of the amount of aggregated protein and parallels the increase in right angle light scattering (Fig. 1A). Fig. 2 shows the DSC thermogram obtained for the thermal denaturation of both oxidized and unoxidized SOD1. The DSC trace of freshly prepared SOD1 (solid line) shows two endothermic transitions with Tm = 102 and 85 °C. The higher temperature transition is dominant and corresponds to the heat denaturation of the fully metallated SOD1, whereas the lower transition is representative of partially metallated SOD1 (30Stathopulos P.B. Rumfeldt J.A. Scholz G.A. Irani R.A. Frey H.E. Hallewell R.A. Lepock J.R. Meiering E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7021-7026Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Unoxidized SOD1 (dashed line), incubated at 37 °C overnight in Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, produced a DSC trace that is qualitatively similar to that of the freshly prepared sample. The proportion of metal-deficient SOD1 increases, and the beginning of a high temperature transition is visible at 100 °C. However, the high temperature transition is largely masked by a very large exotherm centered at 110 °C, which is probably the result of aggregation. Thus, there are some changes to the SOD1 structure upon incubation at 37 °C. Oxidized SOD1 shows a large exothermic transition in the DSC trace from 55 to 78 °C, which is indicative of an in situ aggregation event commencing at a temperature 50 °C lower than that for unoxidized SOD1. An endothermic transition corresponding to the thermal denaturation of partially metallated SOD1 at 83 °C is also observed, but the magnitude of this transition is difficult to determine accurately because of base-line instability above 80 °C. No evidence of a transition at Tm = 102 °C corresponding to native SOD1 was observed for the oxidized SOD1. Taken as a whole, these results indicate that metal-catalyzed oxidation of wild type SOD1 yields a species that is less stable and more aggregation-prone but only aggregates at high concentrations (>40 μm). SOD1 Dimers Dissociate to Monomers prior to Aggregation—Cu,Zn-SOD1 is present in eukaryotes ubiquitously as a stable dimer, held together with hydrophobic contacts (31Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). To investigate the kinetics of SOD1 aggregation, we used DLS and regularization analysis to deconvolute the autocorrelation decay curves and obtain multiple species fits. The molecular weight was then extracted by volume shape hydration. We found that unoxidized SOD1 has a hydrodynamic radius of 2.54 nm, corresponding to a molecular mass of 35.4 kDa, or approximately the sequence molecular mass of the dimer (data not shown). When studying the kinetics of aggregate formation using DLS, the regularization results indicate that SOD1 is initially dimeric as expected (Fig. 3, 2 min). Upon oxidation for 30 min (Fig. 3, 30 min), however, the mass-weighted regularization results show the major species to be 1.94-nm particles, corresponding to a molecular mass of 17 kDa, or approximately the monomer molecular mass. After 140 min (Fig. 3, 140 min), the appearance of large particles (>100 nm) dominates the regularization analysis. Normalized autocorrelation coefficient curves representative of each time point are shown in Fig. 3, bottom panel. Longer correlation times are indicative of smaller diffusion coefficients (larger particles). An overlay of the autocorrelation coefficients for different time points clearly shows an initial decrease in correlation time (smaller particles) followed by an increase. Equivalent results were obtained using the fALS mutant A4V SOD1 (Supplemental Fig. 1). Analysis of kinetic data for DLS thus indicates the formation of SOD1 monomers as an intermediate prior to aggregation. Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was used to determine the molecular weight of oxidized and unoxidized SOD1. Sedimentation equilibrium data at rotor speeds of 20,000-45,000 rpm in 5,000 increments was fit globally using the Beckman XL-I software package. Representative data for oxidized and unoxidized wild type SOD1 at 35,000 rpm are shown in Fig. 4. The weight-averaged molecular mass of unoxidized SOD1 was 30,649 Da (95% confidence interval 30,200-31,098 Da), which is close to the fully metallated molecular mass (31,950 Da). Oxidized SOD1, however, has a weight-averaged molecular mass of 27,299 Da (95% confidence interval 26,880-27,716 Da), only 85.3% of the fully metallated dimer molecular mass. The data for oxidized SOD1 can also be described by a monomer-dimer equilibrium with Kd = 1.8 × 10-5m. Analysis of analytical ultracentrifugation data for the FALS mutant G93A SOD1 yielded a weight-averaged molecular mass of 30,517 Da (95% confidence interval 30,037-30,998 Da) for the control and 27,683 Da (95% confidence interval 27,184-28,181 Da) for the oxidized G93A SOD1 sample (Supplemental Fig. 2). Again, the data for oxidized G93A SOD1 could be described by a monomer-dimer equilibrium with Kd = 1.2 × 10-5m. Soluble unoxidized SOD1 samples are stable dimers for both wild type and G93A mutant SOD1 (Kd is too small to measure by analytical ultracentrifugation), whereas both wild type and G93A mutant SOD1 probably exist as a combination of monomers and dimers upon oxidation. Based on the micromolar dissociation constant of the oxidized SOD1s and the normal cellular concentrations in motor neurons (>40 μm), a significant fraction of the oxidized proteins should be monomeric in vivo. Minor Changes to Conformation of SOD1 upon Oxidation—We have observed that SOD1 becomes aggregation-prone and becomes at least partially monomeric upon MCO. High resolution structure determination (x-ray crystallography, NMR) is usually reliant upon high protein concentration, much higher than those at which oxidized SOD1 will precipitate. To elucidate the changes to SOD1 structure upon oxidation, we utilized CD to evaluate changes in secondary structure and tryptophan fluorescence to study changes in tertiary structure (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). The CD spectra of oxidized and freshly prepared wild type SOD1 are almost identical (Fig. 5A). Thus, there is little change in secondary structure in SOD1, which is composed of a β-barrel and two metal ion binding loop regions that may contribute to a CD signal. Tryptophan fluorescence, a highly environmentally sensitive fluorophore, is comparable in oxidized and control SOD1 (Fig. 5B). There is no change in the emission maximum and little change in intensity, indicating that the tryptophan residue is in a very similar chemical environment in the oxidized and unoxidized forms of SOD1. Mapping of Oxidative Modification Sites—We have previously shown that histidine residues of SOD1 are selectively modified by MCO (11Rakhit R. Cunningham P. Furtos-Matei A. Dahan S. Qi X.F. Crow J.P. Cashman N.R. Kondejewski L.H. Chakrabartty A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47551-47556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the sites of oxidative modification. Liquid chromatography-MS/MS results of oxidized and unoxidized SOD1 are summarized in Fig. 6 and in Supplemental Table I. Three active site histidine modifications are observed (His-48, His-80, and His-120), well in keeping with the idea that MCO produces modifications local to metal binding sites (16Stadtman E.R. Oliver C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2005-2008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, two non-active site modifications (His-110 and Phe-20) are also observed, suggesting that there may be additional transient metal binding sites in SOD1. This site may be part of a weak non-active site copper binding motif comprising residues 109-111 (32Liu H. Zhu H. Eggers D.K. Nersissian A.M. Faull K.F. Goto J.J. Ai J. Sanders-Loehr J. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8125-8132Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Phe-20, normally buried in the hydrophobic core of the SOD1 β-barrel, is also modified, indicating that even though the secondary structure of SOD1 changes little upon oxidation, there is sufficient loosening of the structure to allow solvent access.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been proposed to be critical in tissue repair mechanisms resulting from radiation injury. Previously, we showed that interruption of TGF-beta signaling by deletion of Smad3 results in resistance to radiation-induced injury. In the current study, a small molecular weight molecule, halofuginone (100 nm), is demonstrated by reporter assays to inhibit the TGF-beta signaling pathway, by Northern blotting to elevate inhibitory Smad7 expression within 15 min, and by Western blotting to inhibit formation of phospho-Smad2 and phospho-Smad3 and to decrease cytosolic and membrane TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaRII). Attenuation of TbetaRII levels was noted as early as 1 h and down-regulation persisted for 24 h. Halofuginone blocked TGF-beta-induced delocalization of tight junction ZO-1, a marker of epidermal mesenchymal transition, in NMuMg mammary epithelial cells and suggest halofuginone may have in vivo anti-fibrogenesis characteristics. After documenting the in vitro cellular effects, halofuginone (intraperitoneum injection of 1, 2.5, or 5 microg/mouse/day) efficacy was assessed using ionizing radiation-induced (single dose, 35 or 45 Gy) hind leg contraction in C3H/Hen mice. Halofuginone treatment alone exerted no toxicity but significantly lessened radiation-induced fibrosis. The effectiveness of radiation treatment (2 gray/day for 5 days) of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors grown in C3H/Hen was not affected by halofuginone. The results detail the molecular effects of halofuginone on the TGF-beta signal pathway and show that halofuginone may lessen radiation-induced fibrosis in humans."

The inositol acylation is essential for the generation of mature GPI capable of attachment to proteins. However, the acyl group is usually absent from GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on the cell surface due to inositol deacylation that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) soon after GPI-anchor attachment. Mammalian GPI inositol-deacylase has not been cloned, and the biological significance of the deacylation has been unclear. Here we report a GPI inositol-deacylase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line established by taking advantage of resistance to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and the gene responsible, which was termed PGAP1 for Post GPI Attachment to Proteins 1. PGAP1 encoded an ER-associated, 922-amino acid membrane protein bearing a lipase consensus motif. Substitution of a conserved putative catalytic serine with alanine resulted in a complete loss of function, indicating that PGAP1 is the GPI inositol-deacylase.

Many eukaryotic cell surface proteins with various functions are anchored to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GPI-APs, GPI-anchored proteins; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; ALDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DAF, decay-accelerating factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter.

Biol. & Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 409-417Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) on mammalian cells are usually sensitive to bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC), leading to the release of the protein portions. Therefore, PI-PLC is often used as a tool to determine whether proteins are GPI-anchored. In contrast, precursors of the GPI-anchor present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are resistant to PI-PLC due to an acyl chain linked to the 2-position of inositol (4Hirose S. Prince G.M. Sevlever D. Ravi L. Rosenberry T.L. Ueda E. Medof M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16968-16974Google Scholar). The inositol ring of GPI is acylated at an early step in GPI biosynthesis by the action of PIG-W protein, an acyltransferase that adds a palmitoyl chain to the inositol of glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol, the second intermediate in the pathway (5Murakami Y. Siripanyapinyo U. Hong Y. Kang J.Y. Ishihara S. Nakakuma H. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4285-4295Google Scholar). The inositol acylation is critical for the attachment of GPI to proteins, because mutant cells defective in PIG-W express only very low levels of GPI-APs (5Murakami Y. Siripanyapinyo U. Hong Y. Kang J.Y. Ishihara S. Nakakuma H. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4285-4295Google Scholar). It is very likely that the acyl group is required for a later step in the pathway when “bridging” ethanolamine phosphate, which links GPI to the protein, is added to the third mannose to generate mature GPI. Soon after the attachment of GPI to proteins, the inositol is usually deacylated in the ER and becomes sensitive to PI-PLC (6Chen R. Walter E.I. Parker G. Lapurga J.P. Millan J.L. Ikehara Y. Udenfriend S. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9512-9517Google Scholar). Human erythrocytes represent an exception, in which the inositol remains acylated, and all the GPI-APs are resistant to PI-PLC (7Walter E.I. Roberts W.L. Rosenberry T.L. Ratnoff W.D. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1030-1036Google Scholar, 8Deeg M.A. Humphrey D.R. Yang S.H. Ferguson T.R. Reinhold V.N. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18573-18580Google Scholar, 9Rudd P.M. Morgan B.P.

A possible reason for the lack of deacylation in human erythrocytes is that GPI-APs bearing three acyl chains are more stably associated with the membrane than those bearing two acyl chains, and thus the maintenance of GPI-APs during the long life of erythrocytes is ensured. The enzyme involved in inositol deacylation of GPI-APs has not been characterized. Furthermore, the reason why the deacylation usually occurs is unclear. In order to identify a gene for the GPI inositol-deacylase, we isolated a mutant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line defective in inositol deacylation and cloned the gene responsible, PGAP1 (for Post GPI Attachment to Proteins 1). Rat PGAP1 is an ER membrane protein with a catalytic serine-containing motif that is conserved in a number of lipases. Cells and Culture—Wild-type CHO-K1, 3B2A (10Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Google Scholar), and C10 cells (see below for characterization) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml G418 (3B2A and C10 cells only). To establish an RD3 rescued cell line, C10 cells were electroporated with 20 μg of linearized pME-Puro-PGAP1 for the expression of PGAP1, selected in Ham's F-12 medium with 5 μg/ml of puromycin for 1 week, and cloned by limiting dilution. Plasmids—The plasmids pME-Py (an expression vector with a polyoma origin of replication), pME-Py-FLAG-ALDH (ALDH, microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase) (11Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1407-1420Google Scholar), and pME-Py-GST-FLAG-hPIG-M were described previously (12Maeda Y. Tanaka S. Hino J. Kangawa K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2475-2482Google Scholar, 13Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Harris C.L. Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kinoshita K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 250-261Google Scholar). A plasmid pME-Puro-PGAP1 was constructed by subcloning the XhoI/XbaI fragment of pME-Py-PGAP1 into the XhoI/XbaI site of pME-Puro. To fuse a FLAG tag at the N terminus of PGAP1, the rat DPM2 cDNA of pME-Py-FLAG-rDPM2 was replaced with a cDNA of PGAP1 whose start codon was replaced by a SalI recognition sequence. A glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged PGAP1 was constructed in a similar way using pME-Py-GST-rDPM2. We termed these plasmids pME-Py-FLAG-PGAP1 and pME-Py-GST-PGAP1, respectively. To obtain the Bst1p expression vector pME-Py-BST1, we amplified BST1 with the primers 5′-GCGGCCGCCACCATGGGTATCAGGAGATTAGTTAGTGTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTAGACTAATGTATTGTTTCGAAAAATAGCAAC-3′ (reverse) from a Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA library, and we cloned it into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The BST1 was sequenced and subcloned into the NotI/XbaI site of pME-Py. We substituted serine 174 in PGAP1 with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis using a Quick Change Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). After sequencing, the ClaI/BglI fragment of the mutated plasmid was used to replace the corresponding part of the wild-type pME-Py-PGAP1 to obtain pME-Py-PGAP1 (S174A). To construct pME-Puro-FLAG-folate receptor 1 (FR1), we amplified the human FR1 sequence with primers 5′-CCAGAAGCTTGCTCAGACAAGGATTGCATGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGAGTGCGGCCGCTAGCTGAGCAGCCACAGCAGCA-3′ (reverse) from human cDNA library. The HindIII/NotI-cut fragment was subcloned into HindIII/NotI-cut pME-Puro-FLAG-CD59 to replace CD59 with FR1. Establishment of a GPI Inositol-deacylase-defective Cell Line, C10—3B2A cells (107) were treated with 0.4 mg/ml ethyl methanesulfonate for 1 day, followed by a 6-day culture without ethyl methanesulfonate. Cells were treated with 1 unit/ml PI-PLC (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C, and the PI-PLC-resistant cells were enriched by auto-MACS (Miltenyi Biotec) using biotinylated anti-CD59 (5H8) and anti-DAF (IA10) antibodies and cloned by limiting dilution. Cloning of PGAP1 cDNA—C10 cells (1.2 × 108) were mixed with 360 μg each of a rat C6 glioma cDNA library (10Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol.

After 1 day, cells (107/ml) were treated with 25 mg/ml Pronase (Sigma) in Opti-MEM I for 2 h at 37 °C. Transfected cells were resuspended in Opti-MEM I at 2 × 107/ml 1.5 days after the Pronase treatment, treated with 1 unit/ml of PI-PLC for 1 h at 37 °C, and then stained with a biotinylated anti-CD59 antibody (5H8) and phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Biomeda). Approximately 6,000 cells with low negative CD59 staining were collected using a cell sorter (FACS-Vantage, BD Biosciences). Plasmids (2 × 105 clones) were recovered from these cells by Hirt's method (14Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Google Scholar). Pooled plasmids (15 μg) were transfected with 45 μg of pcDNA-PyT(ori-) plasmids into 1.8 × 108 C10 cells, as described above, in 9 cuvettes. After another cycle of cell sorting and plasmid recovery, the plasmids were electroporated into Escherichia coli and fractionated to 576 pools (20-30 clones/pool). One of these pools restored PI-PLC sensitivity in C10 cells, and 3 positive colonies were obtained from this pool. Human PGAP1 cDNA—Human PGAP1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using forward (5′-CTCGAGCCACCATGTTTCTTCACTCAGTTAATCTCTG-3′) and reverse (5′-GCGGCCGCTTACATAAAGTTGCATAATGCATGG-3′) primers. The primers were designed based on the sequences of FLJ12377 (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number AK022439) and IMAGE:1676930 (3′) (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number AI076615), respectively. PI-PLC Sensitivity Assay—Cells (106) were treated with or without 50 μl of 1 unit/ml PI-PLC in Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) for 1-1.5 h at 37 °C. The cells were stained for CD59 and DAF and analyzed with a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).

Horiguchi Y. van der Goot F.G. Sugimoto N. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5047-5056Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfected cells (106) were treated with or without 100 μl of 1 unit/ml PI-PLC for 1 h at 37 °C, lysed in 1 ml of 2% Triton X-114 (Nacalai Tesque) in Opti-MEM I for 10 min on ice, and then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with vigorous mixing. The cell lysates were separated into aqueous and detergent phases by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C. FLAG-tagged CD59 was immunoprecipitated from each fraction using anti-FLAG beads (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. Alkaline Hydroxylamine Treatment of FLAG-FR1—3B2A and C10 cells were transfected with FLAG-FR1 expression plasmid. After 2 days, cells (106) were treated with or without 1 m hydroxylamine (Sigma) in 0.1 m triethylamine, pH 11.5, overnight at 4 °C. After neutralization, the membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, washed, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS by sonication, treated with or without 3 units/ml of PI-PLC for 1.5 h at 37 °C. FLAG-FR1 proteins were subjected to Triton X-114 partitioning and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting as described above. Subcellular Localization of PGAP1—CHO cells (4 × 107) transfected with pME-Py-FLAG-PGAP1 were fractionated, and the activities of plasma membrane, Golgi, and ER marker enzymes were assayed as described previously (16Maeda Y. Tomita S. Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4920-4929Google Scholar). FLAG-PGAP1 was extracted and immunoprecipitated from each fraction using anti-FLAG beads and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. The intensities of the FLAG-PGAP1 bands were quantified using a LAS1000 image analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Pulse-chase Analysis of DAF—C10 and RD3 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, pulse-labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Amersham Biosciences) for 10 min at 37 °C, and then chased with cold 1.5 mm methionine and 1.2 mm cysteine for 0-60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.6 ml of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing “complete protease inhibitor mixture” (Roche Applied Science). DAF was immunoprecipitated using a monoclonal anti-DAF antibody (IA10) and protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). 35S-Labeled DAF was separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and analyzed using a BAS 1000 analyzer (Fujifilm). Membrane Orientation of PGAP1 Protein—CHO cells were transiently transfected with pME-Py-GST-PGAP1 or pME-Py-GST-FLAG-hPIG-M and replated on gelatin-coated coverslips after 1 day of culture. After 2 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and then incubated in 40 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 20 min. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. For complete permeabilization, 0.1% Triton X-100 was added to the blocking solution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane, cells were incubated in 5 μg/ml digitonin (Wako) for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with a rabbit anti-BiP antibody (ABR) or goat anti-GST antibody (Amersham Biosciences) followed by rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Chemicon) or Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes) antibodies. The cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope (BX-50, Olympus) equipped with a CCD camera (VB-6010, Keyence). Establishment of a PI-PLC-resistant Cell Line, C10—To identify a GPI inositol-deacylase, we established a cell line whose surface GPI-APs were not released by PI-PLC, because GPI-APs on the cell surface would become resistant to PI-PLC if the cells lacked a GPI inositol-deacylase. We mutagenized 3B2A cells, CHO-K1-derived cells expressing CD59 and DAF (10Nakamura N. Inoue N. Watanabe R. Takahashi M. Takeda J. Stevens V.L. Kinoshita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15834-15840Google Scholar), treated them with PI-PLC, and enriched the cells whose CD59 and DAF were resistant to PI-PLC by repeated Magnetic Cell Sorting. We obtained eight clones after limiting dilution and used a mutant cell line, termed C10, in the following experiments. We confirmed the PI-PLC resistance of C10 cells by FACS. The intensities of CD59 and DAF on C10 mutant cells were similar to those of wild-type 3B2A cells and were not affected by PI-PLC treatment (Fig. 1A, a and b), whereas the intensities on 3B2A cells were decreased by 90-95% (c and d). We further confirmed the PI-PLC resistance of the FLAG-tagged CD59 (FLAG-CD59) extracted from C10 cells by Triton X-114 partitioning (Fig. 1B). Most of the mature FLAG-CD59 from 3B2A cells was partitioned into the detergent phase without PI-PLC treatment (lanes 3 and 4), whereas the majority of the mature FLAG-CD59 was partitioned into the aqueous phase after treatment with PI-PLC (lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, a major part of the FLAG-CD59 proteins from C10 cells was partitioned into the detergent phase even after PI-PLC treatment (lanes 6 and 8). The smaller amount of mature FLAG-CD59 in C10 cells suggested that the maturation of FLAG-CD59 was affected in these mutant cells (see below for further results). We found two bands of smaller molecular size (arrows a and b). Band a was detected in both cell lines and was hydrophilic (lanes 3 and 7). It may be FLAG-CD59 that failed to become GPI-anchored due to the overexpression. Band b was hydrophobic, PI-PLC resistant, and only seen in C10 mutant cells (lanes 6 and 8). This would be an immature GPI-anchored FLAG-CD59 bearing acylated inositol. To obtain evidence that the PI-PLC resistance of GPI-APs on C10 mutant cells is indeed due to the inositol acylation, we eliminated the acyl chain by treating C10 cells with alkaline hydroxylamine (17Toutant J.P. Roberts W.L. Murray N.R. Rosenberry T.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 503-508Google Scholar) and then tested whether GPI-APs became PI-PLC-sensitive. We transfected C10 and 3B2A cells with FLAG-tagged FR1, GPI-AP. Some of the FLAG-FR1 was lost after alkaline hydroxylamine treatment, most likely because FR1 with GPI-anchor having diacylglycerol was released and because FR1 with GPI-anchor having alkylacylglycerol remained membrane-bound. We analyzed PI-PLC sensitivity of the remaining FLAG-FR1 by Triton X-114 partitioning. Although FLAG-FR1 on alkali buffer-treated C10 cells was resistant to PI-PLC (Fig. 2, lanes 5-8), the majority of FLAG-FR1 became PI-PLC-sensitive after alkaline hydroxylamine treatment (lanes 1-4). FLAG-FR1 on 3B2A was sensitive to PI-PLC without alkaline hydroxylamine treatment as expected (lanes 9-12). These results support that the inositol acylation of GPI-APs on C10 mutant cells was the basis for PI-PLC resistance. Expression Cloning and Characterization of PGAP1 cDNA—To obtain cDNAs that rescued the defect in C10 mutant cells, we transfected C10 mutant cells with a rat cDNA library, collected PI-PLC-sensitive cells with a cell sorter, and recovered the plasmids. This plasmid pool was used for the second round of enrichment. We finally obtained three clones with the same insert size and restriction profile, suggesting that these plasmids were derived from the same clone. We termed the gene PGAP1. We established a C10-derived cell line, termed RD3, which stably expressed PGAP1. The PI-PLC sensitivity of CD59 on RD3 cells was slightly higher than that of 3B2A wild-type cells (Fig. 3A, b and c), indicating that PGAP1 rescued the defect in C10 mutant cells. The hypersensitivity of RD3 to PI-PLC may be due to the overexpression of PGAP1. The PGAP1 cDNA restored PI-PLC sensitivity on seven other mutant clones, indicating that all eight mutant cells were defective in PGAP1 gene (data not shown). The PGAP1 cDNA consisted of 3260 bp, and the longest open reading frame, spanning nucleotides 21-2789, encoded 922 amino acid residues (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number AB116149; Fig. 3B). The nucleotide sequence around the start codon agreed well with Kozak's rule. We found a lipase consensus motif with a putative catalytic serine (Prosite ID, PS00120), suggesting that PGAP1 is the deacylase (Fig. 3B). A hydropathy profile of the predicted amino acid sequence suggested that PGAP1 has multiple transmembrane regions (Fig. 3C). Analysis by using a TMHMM program predicted six transmembrane regions (Fig. 3B). The lipase motif resided in a large hydrophilic region after the first transmembrane domain near the N terminus. Regarding the human homologue, we found that the sequence of the first 591 amino acids of the hypothetical protein FLJ12377 was 90% identical with that of PGAP1. However, the predicted sequence of the C-terminal portion was not similar to PGAP1, and the entire sequence was shorter than that of PGAP1. The C-terminal sequence of FLJ12377 was found in genomic sequence of human PGAP1 gene (NCBI data base), suggesting that it was a product of alternative splicing. We also found ESTs whose sequences are homologous to the C-terminal portion of PGAP1. To obtain the full-length sequence of the human homologue, we amplified it from a human cDNA library by PCR and determined the sequence (DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number AB128038). The identity of the predicted amino acid sequences of human and rat PGAP1 was 90%, and their lipase consensus sequences were identical (Fig. 3B). S. cerevisiae Bst1p Is an Orthologue of PGAP1—We searched the data bases for homologues of PGAP1 and found an S. cerevisiae homologue of PGAP1 that was known as BST1 (Fig. 3B, DDBJ/GenBank™/EMBL accession number NC_001138) (18Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Google Scholar, 19Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Google Scholar). The amino acid identity of rat PGAP1 and yeast Bst1p was 18%, and the lipase consensus sequence was conserved. To examine whether BST1 was a functional homologue, we transiently transfected C10 mutant cells with BST1 cDNA and tested the PI-PLC sensitivity. We found a partial restoration of the PI-PLC sensitivity of the transfectants, indicating that Bst1p is an orthologue of PGAP1 (Fig. 4b). ER Localization and Membrane Orientation of PGAP1 Protein—We fused FLAG or GST at the N terminus of PGAP1, and we examined whether they restore the PI-PLC sensitivity of C10 mutant cells. Both FLAG- and GST-tagged PGAP1 restored the deacylase activity (data not shown). To determine the intracellular localization of PGAP1, we transfected CHO cells with FLAG-PGAP1 cDNAs, fractionated the cell lysate by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and quantified the activities of membrane marker enzymes. The plasma membrane and Golgi markers were fractionated into fractions 1 and 2 (Fig. 5B), and the ER marker was fractionated into fractions 3-5 (Fig. 5C). FLAG-PGAP1 was determined by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting and showed a similar distribution to the ER marker (Fig. 5C). Thus, PGAP1 is an ER resident protein. We determined the membrane orientation of PGAP1. Because the acyl group on the inositol moiety of GPI is oriented toward the ER lumen, if PGAP1 is the deacylase, the lipase motif would be oriented to the luminal side. If this is true, the N terminus of PGAP1 would be found on the cytoplasmic side of the ER. To examine this, we transiently transfected GST-PGAP1 cDNAs into CHO cells (Fig. 6A), treated the cells with digitonin for selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane or with Triton X-100 for permeabilization of both the plasma and ER membranes, and stained the cells for the GST tag (green) and BiP (red). To confirm the reliability of the experiment, we used PIG-M, which was double-tagged with GST and FLAG at the N terminus. The cytoplasmic orientation of the GST-FLAG-tag on PIG-M was established previously (13Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Harris C.L. Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kinoshita K. Kinoshita T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 250-261Google Scholar). The GST tag of PGAP1 was detected in the digitonin-treated cells (Fig. 6A-a), and the staining pattern and intensity were not significantly changed when cells were permeabilized with Triton X-100 (Fig. 6A-c). In contrast, BiP was only stained after treatment with Triton X-100 as expected (Fig. 6A, b and d). The staining profile of the GST-FLAG-PIG-M transfectants was similar to that of the GST-PGAP1 transfectants (Fig. 6B), indicating that the N terminus of PGAP1 resides on the cytoplasmic side and that the lipase motif is oriented to the luminal side of the ER. Site-directed Mutagenesis of a Putative Catalytic Serine—To address whether the lipase motif in PGAP1 is functional, we substituted the putative catalytic serine 174 with alanine (termed PGAP1(S174A)). We transiently transfected C10 mutant CHO cells with FLAG-tagged wild-type or S174A PGAP1 in combination with FLAG-tagged ALDH to normalize the transfection efficiencies. We immunoprecipitated the FLAG-tagged proteins and analyzed them by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting under reducing conditions (Fig. 7A). The ratios of FLAG-PGAP1 to FLAG-ALDH were similar, indicating a normal expression level of PGAP1(S174A). The C10 mutant cells transfected with wild-type FLAG-PGAP1 were sensitive to PI-PLC-like 3B2A cells (Fig. 7B, a and c), whereas C10 cells transfected with FLAG-PGAP1(S174A) were still resistant to PI-PLC like those transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 7B, b and d). These results indicate that the putative catalytic serine 174 is required for the activity of PGAP1. Thus, we concluded that PGAP1 is the GPI inositol-deacylase itself. The Inositol Deacylation Is Important for the ER-to-Golgi Transport of GPI-APs—We investigated the role of the inositol deacylation of GPI-APs. The observation that an immature form of FLAG-CD59 accumulated in C10 cells (band b in Fig. 1B) suggested that the inositol deacylation was important for the maturation of GPI-APs. To test this idea, we analyzed the maturation of DAF using a pulse-chase labeling experiment. The ER form of DAF (∼45 kDa) is transported to the Golgi and accepts multiple O-glycans and modification of the N-glycan to become mature DAF (75 kDa). In C10 mutant cells, the amount of mature DAF gradually increased with a slow decrease in the amount of the ER form of DAF during the chase period (Fig. 8A, lanes 1-5). In contrast, in RD3 rescued cells, the increase in the mature DAF and decrease in the ER form of DAF were faster than those in C10 mutant cells (lanes 6-10). Parental 3B2A cells showed basically the same kinetics as RD3 cells (data not shown). Quantification of the data showed that the C10 mutant cells had a clear delay in the maturation of DAF; half the DAF matured within 20 min in RD3 rescued cells, while 60 min was required in C10 cells (Fig. 8B), indicating that the defect in the inositol deacylation affects the maturation of DAF. The molecular sizes of the mature DAF in C10 and RD3 cells were similar. Therefore, the extent of the glycosylation was not affected. We then analyzed total DAF in the whole cell lysates by Western blotting and found a significant accumulation of the ER form of DAF in C10 cells (Fig. 8C). These results indicate that the inositol deacylation is important for the maturation of GPI-APs. Maturation of DAF and CD59 requires the ER-to-Golgi transport followed by glycosylation in the Golgi. Because the extent of the glycosylation was not affected, we concluded that the inositol deacylation is important for the ER-to-Golgi transport of GPI-APs. The biosynthesis of GPI-APs can be separated into two phases. In the first phase, the immediate precursor of the GPI-anchor is synthesized and attached to the proteins, resulting in the generation of precursor GPI-APs. In the second phase, both the GPI and protein portions of the precursor GPI-APs are modified during transport from their site of generation in the ER to the cell surface. More than 20 genes involved in the first phase have been cloned and characterized, whereas little is known about the genes involved in the second phase. We have reported a number of genes in the first phase as PIG (for phosphatidylinositol glycan) genes, such as PIG-A, PIG-B, etc. (20Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Google Scholar). Here we report the first mammalian gene involved in the second phase. Because the second phase consists of events occurring after the attachment of the GPI-anchor to proteins, we termed this gene PGAP1. The major findings in the present study are as follows: 1) that PGAP1 encodes an ER-associated GPI inositol-deacylase, thereby providing a molecular basis for the report that inositol deacylation occurs in the ER soon after the generation of GPI-APs (6Chen R. Walter E.I. Parker G. Lapurga J.P. Millan J.L. Ikehara Y. Udenfriend S. Medof M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9512-9517Google Scholar); and 2) that inositol deacylation is important for efficient ER-to-Golgi transport of GPI-APs. A Role for Inositol Deacylation in the ER-to-Golgi Transport of GPI-APs—In PGAP1-deficient mutant cells, the ER-to-Golgi transport of DAF as measured by the generation of O-glycosylated Golgi form of DAF was clearly delayed. The time necessary for 50% of DAF to mature was 20 min in wild-type cells, while it was 60 min in the mutant cells. In S. cerevisiae, the BST1 gene is homologous to PGAP1 (18Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Google Scholar). PI-PLC sensitivity in PGAP1-deficient CHO cells was partially restored by transfection of BST1, showing that Bst1p is a functional homologue of PGAP1. Consistent with this result, maturation of Gas1p, a GPI-anchored protein whose maturation is dependent upon the transport to the Golgi (21Horvath A. Sutterlin C. Manning-Krieg U. Movva N.R. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3687-3695Google Scholar), was delayed in bst1-deleted yeast (19Vashist S. Kim W. Belden W.J. Spear E.D. Barlowe C. Ng D.T. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 355-368Google Scholar), like DAF in C10 mutant cells. BST1 (Bypass of Sec Thirteen 1) gene was identified by screening mutations that suppress lethality caused by down-regulation of SEC13 gene, a gene for a component of COPII vesicle coatmers (18Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Google Scholar). In sec13 mutant cells, normally deacylated GPI-APs may not be incorporated into COPII vesicles and may accumulate in the ER, possibly around the zone where COPII vesicles are generated. The fact that the simultaneous defect in BST1 rescued the lethality caused by down-regulation of SEC13 suggested that inositol-acylated GPI-APs may have been transported from the ER via some alternative way. Emp24p (22Muniz M. Nuoffer C. Hauri H.P. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 925-930Google Scholar) and Erp1p (23Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Solari R.C. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Google Scholar), members of p24 family, are thought to be components of cargo receptors for GPI-anchored protein Gas1p in S. cerevisiae. Both emp24 and erp1 mutations are also sec13 bypass (18Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Google Scholar, 23Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Solari R.C. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Google Scholar). Taken together with a fact that surface transport of GPI-APs is essential for growth of S. cerevisiae, it is suggested that association of GPI-APs with their cargo receptors that would cause accumulation of GPI-APs in the ER is involved in the lethal effect of sec13 mutation. It is therefore possible that the molecular basis of sec13 bypass by bst1 mutation is that the acyl chain remaining on inositol of GPI-APs in bst1 mutant yeast might interfere with the efficient association with the cargo receptors, resulting in a lack of accumulation of GPI-APs. Thus, Bst1p/PGAP1-mediated inositol deacylation may be required for efficient incorporation of GPI-APs into COPII transport vesicles through the association with the cargo receptors. GPI Inositol Deacylation in Trypanosoma brucei Versus Mammals/S. cerevisiae—In mammalian cells and the yeast S. cerevisiae, an acyl chain is added to the 2-position of inositol early in the GPI biosynthetic pathway (24Costello L.C. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8599-8603Google Scholar). The acylation is mediated by PIG-W in mammalian cells (5Murakami Y. Siripanyapinyo U. Hong Y. Kang J.Y. Ishihara S. Nakakuma H. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4285-4295Google Scholar) and by Bwt1p, the PIG-W orthologue, in S. cerevisiae (25Umemura M. Okamoto M. Nakayama K. Sagane K. Tsukahara K. Hata K. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23639-23647Google Scholar). The acceptor substrate for these acyltransferases is glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol (26Stevens V.L. Zhang H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31397-31403Google Scholar, 27Doerrler W.T. Ye J. Falck J.R. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27031-27038Google Scholar). Once added, the acyl chain remains until transfer of GPI to proteins. In African trypanosomes, T. brucei, inositol acylation and deacylation reactions are more complex, differ from those in mammalian and yeast systems, and differ between the bloodstream and procyclic forms. In T. brucei, the acyl chain is added one step later, because it is first added to mannosyl-glucosaminyl-phosphatidylinositol (28Guther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Google Scholar, 29Smith T.K. Cottaz S. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6476-6482Google Scholar). However, the palmitoyl chain can be removed and added again at any of the later steps (28Guther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Google Scholar). The direct precursor of the GPI-anchor in bloodstream parasites is not acylated, whereas in procyclic form parasites, the direct GPI-anchor precursor is acylated. GPIdeAc gene that partially accounts for inositol deacylase activity in T. brucei has been cloned (30Guther M.L. Leal S. Morrice N.A. Cross G.A. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4923-4934Google Scholar). GPIdeAc consisting of 558 amino acids has an N-terminal signal peptide but not a transmembrane domain. It is homologous to mammalian acyloxyacyl hydrolase that removes fatty acids from bacterial lipopolysaccharides. GPIdeAc is much smaller than PGAP1 and has no significant sequence homology with PGAP1. GPIdeAc is hydrophilic whereas PGAP1 has multiple transmembrane domains. Therefore, GPIdeAc and PGAP1 are not homologous. We found a sequence that has significant homology with PGAP1 in the T. brucei genome data base. Cloning and knock out or knock down of this gene are required to determine whether it is an inositol deacylase that accounts for the inositol deacylation activity remaining in the GPIdeAc knock out T. brucei (30Guther M.L. Leal S. Morrice N.A. Cross G.A. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4923-4934Google Scholar). We thank Kojiro Nakamura, Fumiko Ishii, and Keiko Kinoshita for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2027252278,"Cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is crucial for the structural integrity of tissues and epithelial-mesenchymal interactions mediating organ morphogenesis1,2. Here we describe how the loss of a cytoplasmic multi-PDZ scaffolding protein, glutamate receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP1), leads to the formation of subepidermal hemorrhagic blisters, renal agenesis, syndactyly or polydactyly and permanent fusion of eyelids (cryptophthalmos). Similar malformations are characteristic of individuals with Fraser syndrome and animal models of this human genetic disorder, such as mice carrying the blebbed mutation (bl) in the gene encoding the Fras1 ECM protein3,4. GRIP1 can physically interact with Fras1 and is required for the localization of Fras1 to the basal side of cells. In one animal model of Fraser syndrome, the eye-blebs (eb) mouse, Grip1 is disrupted by a deletion of two coding exons. Our data indicate that GRIP1 is required for normal cell-matrix interactions during early embryonic development and that inactivation of Grip1 causes Fraser syndrome–like defects in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2111631843,"Bites by Loxosceles spiders can produce severe clinical symptoms, including dermonecrosis, thrombosis, vascular leakage, hemolysis, and persistent inflammation. The causative factor is a sphingomyelinase D (SMaseD) that cleaves sphingomyelin into choline and ceramide 1-phosphate. A similar enzyme, showing comparable bioactivity, is secreted by certain pathogenic corynebacteria and acts as a potent virulence factor. However, the molecular basis for SMaseD toxicity is not well understood, which hampers effective therapy. Here we show that the spider and bacterial SMases D hydrolyze albumin-bound lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), but not sphingosylphosphorylcholine, with Km values (∼20–40 μm) well below the normal LPC levels in blood. Thus, toxic SMases D have intrinsic lysophospholipase D activity toward LPC. LPC hydrolysis yields the lipid mediator lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a known inducer of platelet aggregation, endothelial hyperpermeability, and pro-inflammatory responses. Introduction of LPA1 receptor cDNA into LPA receptor-negative cells renders non-susceptible cells susceptible to SmaseD, but only in LPC-containing media. Degradation of circulating LPC to LPA with consequent activation of LPA receptors may have a previously unappreciated role in the pathophysiology of secreted SMases D.

Strikingly, while SMaseD is not found elsewhere in the animal kingdom, a similar enzyme is produced as an exotoxin by some pathogenic bacteria, notably Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, Corynebacterium ulcerans, and Arcanobacterium (formerly Corynebacterium) hemolyticum (8Soucek A.

C. pseudotuberculosis causes lymphadenitis in animals but is also pathogenic for humans, while C. ulcerans and A. hemolyticum are pathogens of pharyngitis and other human infections (11Lipsky B.A. Goldberger A.C. Tompkins L.S. Plorde J.J. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1982; 4: 1220-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar); in no case is the molecular basis for virulence known (12Songer J.G. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 156-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The SMaseD from C. pseudotuberculosis, also named SM-specific phospholipase D (PLD), is an essential virulence determinant that contributes to the persistence and spread of the bacteria within the host (13McNamara P.J. Bradley G.A. Songer J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Loxosceles and C. pseudotuberculosis SMases D have the same molecular mass (31–32 kDa) and share about 30% sequence similarity (see “Results”). In model systems, the spider and bacterial enzymes provoke remarkably similar pathophysiological effects, including platelet aggregation, endothelial hyperpermeability, complement-dependent hemolysis, and neutrophil-dependent skin necrosis (4Forrester L.J.

Immunology. 2002; 107: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite decades of study it remains unclear how SMaseD can elicit such a wide variety of biological effects, particularly, since ceramide 1-phosphate is not known as a signaling molecule. In contrast to ceramide, which may reorganize lipid microdomains and associated signaling complexes (17Gulbins E. Kolesnick R. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7070-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 18van Blitterswijk W.J. Van Der Luit A.H. Veldman R.J. Verheij M. Borst J. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), ceramide 1-phosphate is a bilayer-preferring phospholipid that is unlikely to significantly perturb membrane structure. Furthermore, mammalian cells treated with SMaseD from either Loxosceles deserta or C. pseudotuberculosis do not convert newly formed ceramide 1-phosphate to ceramide nor does SMaseD treatment affect membrane permeability or cell viability (19Feldhaus M.J. Weyrich A.S. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4285-4293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Subbaiah P.V. Billington S.J. Jost B.H. Songer J.G. Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1574-1580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Given the lack of understanding of SMaseD bioactivity, we set out to re-examine the substrate specificity and cellular effects of the enzyme. Our interest was stirred by a report of more than 30 years ago, showing that partially purified SMaseD from C. pseudotuberculosis (ovis) can catalyze the release of choline from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) but not from phosphatidylcholine (PC) (21Soucek A. Michalec C. Souckova A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). LPC is an abundant plasma component and removal of its choline headgroup yields lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), now known as a pleiotropic lipid mediator acting on specific G protein-coupled receptors in numerous cell types (22Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 23Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y. Lynch K.R. Moolenaar W. Pyne S. Tigyi G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Yet, the possibility that degradation of plasma LPC might contribute to SMaseD toxicity has received little attention to date. On the other hand, the reported Km value for LPC was very high, ∼8 mm (21Soucek A. Michalec C. Souckova A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), suggesting that LPC is not a physiological substrate; moreover, LPC hydrolysis by partially purified SMaseD preparations could well be due to contaminating lyso-PLD activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that the spider and bacterial SMases D have intrinsic lyso-PLD activity toward albumin-bound LPC and that expression of functional LPA receptors is necessary and sufficient for at least some of the biological responses to SMaseD. Our results suggest that degradation of circulating LPC to LPA, with consequent activation of LPA receptors in cells of the circulatory and vascular systems, may significantly contribute to SMaseD-mediated pathogenicity. Cell Culture and Materials—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were exposed to serum-free DMEM for 24 h prior to experimentation, unless indicated otherwise. All phospholipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids Inc. (Alabaster, AL) at the highest purity grade available. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and monoclonal anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody were from Sigma. Secondary antibodies (rabbit anti-mouse and swine anti-rabbit) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Dako (Glostrup, Denmark). Highly purified PLD (57 kDa) from S. chromofuscus (24Geng D. Chura J. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12195-12202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Mary F. Roberts (Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA). Recombinant SMaseD from Loxosceles laeta—Recombinant SMaseD (SMase I) from L. laeta was produced as described previously (7Fernandes Pedrosa Mde F. Junqueira de Azevedo Ide L. Goncalves-de-Andrade R.M. Van Den Berg C.W. Ramos C.R. Ho P.L. Tambourgi D.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, mature L. laeta enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein, including a His6-tag at the N terminus and a 4-amino acid linker. The cells were collected by centrifugation and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer (300 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and disrupted by French pressure. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden, 1.0 × 6.4 cm), and the recombinant protein was eluted with buffer (300 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.8 m imidazole). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Stock solutions were prepared in PBS at 1.0 mg of protein/ml. Recombinant SMaseD from C. pseudotuberculosis—Recombinant C. pseudotuberculosis SMaseD was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein composed of the mature enzyme with a 33-amino acid N-terminal extension containing a His6-tag (10McNamara P.J. Cuevas W.A. Songer J.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recombinant enzyme was purified from the soluble fraction of cell lysates on TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech). SMaseD was eluted from the resin in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole at greater than 95% purity. Choline Release Assay—SMaseD/PLD enzymatic activity was estimated by determining choline liberated from exogenously added phospholipid substrates, using a fluorimetric assay modified from Tokumura et al. (25Tokumura A. Majima E. Kariya Y. Tominaga K. Kogure K. Yasuda K. Fukuzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39436-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In the standard assay, the substrate was diluted in 100 μl of DMEM or HEPES-buffered saline (HBS; 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). SM and PC substrates were applied as liposomes, whereas the lysophospholipids were complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml). After SMaseD/PLD addition, the reaction was left to proceed for 20 min at 37 °C. By adding 10 μl of a second assay mixture, the liberated free choline was oxidized (in 10 min) to betaine, and the H2O2 concomitantly generated was determined by fluorimetry. The second reaction mixture consisted of 1 unit/ml choline oxidase (Sigma), 0.06 unit/ml horseradish peroxidase, and 50 μm 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)propionic acid in HBS. The second reaction was left to proceed for 10 min. Fluorescence of the oxidized substrate was measured at an excitation of 320 nm and emission of 405 nm using a 96-well plate reader. SMaseD-induced choline release from LPC proceeded at a constant rate for at least 1 h at 37 °C, with the rate being proportional to the enzyme concentration. LPA1 cDNA and Retroviral Transduction—Human LPA1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number U78192) was amplified by PCR using primers carrying 5′ XhoI + HA/3′ NotI sites. N-terminally HA-tagged and C-terminally green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused LPA1 receptor cDNAs were cloned into retroviral LZRS-IRES-Neo. Recombinant retrovirus produced in Phoenix packaging cells was used to infect rat B103 neuroblastoma cells or human HEK293 cells, essentially as described previously (26Van Leeuwen F.N. Olivo C. Grivell S. Giepmans B.N. Collard J.G. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 400-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). After 48 h, transduced cells were selected in medium containing 1.0 mg/ml G418. Correct expression of LPA1 was confirmed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. LPA Receptor Internalization—HEK293 cells stably transfected with GFP-LPA1 receptor cDNA were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. After treatment with agonist, cells were washed and coverslips were mounted with vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). GFP-LPA1 receptors were visualized by confocal microscopy. The secreted SMases D from L. laeta (Lox-SMaseD) (7Fernandes Pedrosa Mde F. Junqueira de Azevedo Ide L. Goncalves-de-Andrade R.M. Van Den Berg C.W. Ramos C.R. Ho P.L. Tambourgi D.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 298: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and C. pseudotuberculosis (Cp-SMaseD) (10McNamara P.J. Cuevas W.A. Songer J.G. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) have the same molecular mass (31–32 kDa) and share 32% sequence similarity and 20% identity, including a conserved N-terminal histidine residue required for the enzymatic activity of Cp-SMaseD (see Supplemental Fig. 1, for sequence alignment, and Ref. 27Tachedjian M. Krywult J. Moore R.J. Hodgson A.L. Vaccine. 1995; 13: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite being de facto PLDs, both SMases D are unique in that they show no homology to other phospholipid-metabolizing enzymes, and along with the broad specificity PLD from S. chromofuscus (28Yang H. Roberts M.F. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2958-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), they lack the conserved HKD sequence motif that characterizes the PLD superfamily (29Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 58-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the recombinant Lox- and Cp-SMases D catalyze the release of choline from SM but not PC, whereas the unrelated PLD from S. chromofuscus (Sc-PLD) cleaves both SM and PC (Fig. 1A). The intrinsic lyso-PLD activity of the recombinant SMases D was then assessed using 1-oleoyl-LPC and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC or lyso-SM) as substrates; SPC is a normal plasma constituent (30Liliom K. Sun G. Bunemann M. Virag T. Nusser N. Baker D.L. Wang D.A. Fabian M.J. Brandts B. Bender K. Eickel A. Malik K.U. Miller D.D. Desiderio D.M. Tigyi G. Pott L. Biochem. J. 2004; 355: 189-197Crossref Google Scholar) that would yield the potent lipid mediator sphingosine 1-phosphate following choline release. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), the spider and bacterial SMases D were both capable of liberating choline from albumin-bound LPC in physiological medium, thereby producing LPA (as confirmed by thin layer chromatography analysis). Surprisingly, SPC did not serve as a substrate for either SMaseD, even when SPC was applied at supra-physiological concentrations (50 μm, i.e. 3 orders of magnitude above normal plasma levels (30Liliom K. Sun G. Bunemann M. Virag T. Nusser N. Baker D.L. Wang D.A. Fabian M.J. Brandts B. Bender K. Eickel A. Malik K.U. Miller D.D. Desiderio D.M. Tigyi G. Pott L. Biochem. J. 2004; 355: 189-197Crossref Google Scholar)) (Fig. 1B; only at still higher concentrations, some hydrolysis of SPC by Cp-SMaseD was observed, ∼10% of that for LPC; data not shown). We further observed that both SMases D were capable of hydrolyzing naturally occurring ether-linked LPC (1-O-hexadecylglycero-3-phosphocholine or “lyso-platelet-activating factor”) thereby producing alkyl-LPA, the most potent platelet-activating form of LPA (31Haserueck N. Erl W. Pandey D. Tigyi G. Ohlmann P. Ravanat C. Gachet C. Siess W. Blood. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar); the unnatural alkyl-lysophospholipid Et-18-OCH(3) (1-octadecyl-2-methylglycero-3-phosphocholine; 50 μm) was not hydrolyzed by either SMaseD nor did it act as an inhibitor (data not shown). Many secreted phospholipases, including Sc-PLD and mammalian lyso-PLD (25Tokumura A. Majima E. Kariya Y. Tominaga K. Kogure K. Yasuda K. Fukuzawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39436-39442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), are dependent on calcium for their activity. In contrast, SMaseD-induced LPC hydrolysis has an absolute requirement for magnesium rather than calcium, since enzyme activity was abolished in the presence of EDTA but not EGTA, when assayed in buffer containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ as the only divalent metal ions (Fig. 1C). By varying the LPC concentration, we determined that the spider and bacterial SMases D have an apparent Km value for 1-oleoyl-LPC of 44.4 ± 2.5 μm and 21.8 ± 3.0 μm, respectively (Fig. 2). Of note, these Km values are severalfold lower than the physiological LPC levels in human plasma (approximately 150 μm; (32Subbaiah P.V. Chen C.H. Bagdade J.D. Albers J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5308-5314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Croset M. Brossard N. Polette A. Lagarde M. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar)), implying that LPC serves as a bona fide physiological substrate. For Lox-SMaseD, the apparent Vmax for LPC was 212 ± 6 nmol/min/mg of protein; for Cp-SMaseD, the Vmax value was 68 ± 2 nmol/min/mg of protein (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results indicate that the spider and bacterial SMases D possess Mg2+-dependent lyso-PLD activity toward acyl- and alkyl-LPC, but not toward SPC, with both enzymes showing similar catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km, if Vmax is considered an approximation of kcat). For comparison, the estimated efficiency of SMaseD for LPC hydrolysis is approximately 1 order of magnitude lower than that of mammalian lyso-PLD or “autotaxin” (Km = 250 μm and Vmax = 9 mmol/min/mg (34Umezu-Goto M. Kishi Y. Taira A. Hama K. Dohmae N. Takio K. Yamori T. Mills G.B. Inoue K. Aoki J. Arai H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar)). We next examined the responsiveness of mammalian cells to SMaseD. While the nonspecific Sc-PLD can trigger diverse signaling events (35Moolenaar W.H. Kruijer W. Tilly B.C. Verlaan I. Bierman A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 36van Dijk M.C. Postma F. Hilkmann H. Jalink K. van Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 386-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the SMases D failed to induce cellular responses under the same conditions. When preincubated with albumin-LPC complexes, however, the SMases D exhibited biological activity as evidenced by the induction of MAP kinase activity and cellular shape changes, consistent with SMaseD hydrolyzing extracellular LPC to receptor-active LPA. To prove this directly, we used rat B103 neuroblastoma cells that lack endogenous LPA receptors. Fig. 3 shows that SMaseD failed to activate MAP kinase (ERK1/2) in native B103 cells, either in the presence or absence of albumin-LPC. After forced expression of the prototypic LPA1 receptor in these cells, both SMases D mimicked LPA in activating MAP kinase, but only when preincubated with albumin-LPC (Fig. 3). Likewise, SMaseD mimicked LPA in inducing rapid cytoskeletal contraction in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, a typical RhoA-mediated response that also underlies LPA-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction (22Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 37Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Vermeer M.A. Van Hinsbergh V.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: E127-E133PubMed Google Scholar); but again, SMaseD acted only in the presence of albumin-LPC (see Supplemental Fig. 2). Ligand activation of transmembrane receptors causes their internalization from the cell surface. As illustrated in Fig. 4, LPA triggers rapid internalization of its cognate receptors in stably transfected HEK293 cells; at 20–30 min following LPA addition, nearly all receptors were found intracellularly. In contrast, SMaseD alone did not affect LPA receptor localization in LPC-free medium. Upon incubation in albumin/LPC-containing medium, however, SMaseD induced efficient LPA receptor internalization albeit with somewhat slower kinetics than those observed with LPA (Fig. 4). Collectively, these results indicate that (i) SMaseD-mediated hydrolysis of albumin-bound LPC yields receptor-active LPA; and (ii) LPA receptor expression is necessary and sufficient for cellular susceptibility to SMaseD, provided that the cellular microenvironment contains albumin-LPC. Thus, when SMaseD comes into contact with blood, it will provoke the hydrolysis of albumin-bound LPC to generate LPA. Through activation of its cognate G protein-coupled receptors, LPA evokes a host of biological and pathophysiological responses in numerous cell types, including those of the circulatory and vascular systems (22Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 23Chun J. Goetzl E.J. Hla T. Igarashi Y. Lynch K.R. Moolenaar W. Pyne S. Tigyi G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 38Siess W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). LPA levels in whole blood are normally very low, but the lipid accumulates during blood clotting to promote wound healing processes (39Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 40Sano T. Baker D. Virag T. Wada A. Yatomi Y. Kobayashi T. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21197-21206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, aberrant accumulation of LPA in blood may have deleterious effects, including endothelial barrier dysfunction (37Nieuw Amerongen G.P. Vermeer M.A. Van Hinsbergh V.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: E127-E133PubMed Google Scholar), intravascular coagulation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells such as neutrophils (31Haserueck N. Erl W. Pandey D. Tigyi G. Ohlmann P. Ravanat C. Gachet C. Siess W. Blood. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 38Siess W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41Fueller M. Wang de A. Tigyi G. Siess W. Cell Signal. 2003; 15: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 42Hashimoto T. Yamashita M. Ohata H. Momose K. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 91: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), responses that are strongly reminiscent of those to SMaseD in vivo. It is also of note that LPA stimulates Ca2+ entry into human erythrocytes (43Yang L. Andrews D.A. Low P.S. Blood. 2000; 95: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with subsequent exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface. 2K. de Jong and F. A. Kuypers, personal communication. SMaseD likewise induces PS exposure in erythrocytes and this apparent loss of plasma membrane asymmetry is thought to contribute to complement-dependent hemolysis (16Tambourgi D.V. Sousa Da Silva M. Billington S.J. Goncalves De Andrade R.M. Magnoli F.C. Songer J.G. Van Den Berg C.W. Immunology. 2002; 107: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The potential role of lyso-PLD activity in the hemolytic action of SMaseD obviously warrants further study. Unlike envenomation by a Loxosceles spider bite, infections such as lymphadenitis caused by C. pseudotuberculosis result not only from the toxic effects of SMaseD per se but also from bacterial dissemination to host tissues such as the lymph nodes. A SMaseD-deficient mutant of C. pseudotuberculosis is unable to disseminate from the site of inoculation (13McNamara P.J. Bradley G.A. Songer J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and a popular theory is that vascular hyperpermeability caused by SMaseD, shown here to be likely a result of LPA production, aids in the escape of bacteria into the lymphatic system and subsequent spread to regional lymph nodes (44Batey R.G. Aust. Vet. J. 1986; 63: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In conclusion, by building on early but largely overlooked evidence (21Soucek A. Michalec C. Souckova A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 227: 116-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated here that spider and bacterial SMases D have intrinsic lyso-PLD activity toward albumin-bound LPC and thereby generate bioactive LPA. To be consistent with phospholipase terminology, SMaseD should therefore be renamed “SM- and LPC-specific PLD.” Our data thus provide, at least in part, a mechanistic explanation for the multiple biological responses to SMaseD observed in vivo. To what extent the hydrolysis of SM to ceramide 1-phosphate in the plasma membrane of target cells may cooperate with the concurrent generation of extracellular LPA to mediate pathogenicity remains an open question, although a recent report suggests that ceramide 1-phosphate may indirectly activate cytosolic phospholipase A2 leading to arachidonic acid release (45Pettus B.J.

https://openalex.org/W2094820755,"Genome sequencing projects have focused attention on the problem of discovering the functions of protein domains that are widely distributed throughout living species but which are, as yet, largely uncharacterized. One such example is the PIN domain, found in eukaryotes, bacteria, and Archaea, and with suggested roles in signaling, RNase editing, and/or nucleotide binding. The first reported crystal structure of a PIN domain (open reading frame PAE2754, derived from the crenarchaeon, Pyrobaculum aerophilum) has been determined to 2.5 Å resolution and is presented here. Mapping conserved residues from a multiple sequence alignment onto the structure identifies a putative active site. The discovery of distant structural homology with several exonucleases, including T4 phage RNase H and flap endonuclease (FEN1), further suggests a likely function for PIN domains as Mg2+-dependent exonucleases, a hypothesis that we have confirmed in vitro. The tetrameric structure of PAE2754, with the active sites inside a tunnel, suggests a mechanism for selective cleavage of single-stranded overhangs or flap structures. These results indicate likely DNA or RNA editing roles for prokaryotic PIN domains, which are strikingly numerous in thermophiles, and in organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They also support previous hypotheses that eukaryotic PIN domains participate in RNAi and nonsense-mediated RNA degradation.

They also support previous hypotheses that eukaryotic PIN domains participate in RNAi and nonsense-mediated RNA degradation. The explosive growth of whole genome sequencing efforts, and the discovery that a large proportion of the assumed gene products are of unknown or poorly understood function, has focused attention on new approaches to assigning function. In the absence of sufficient sequence similarity to clearly infer homology with already characterized proteins, a variety of bioinformatic approaches have been used to obtain functional clues. These include, for example, analyses of genome location (seeking potential operons), phylogenetic profiling, and observations of gene fusions in different species (1Marcotte E.M. Pellegrini M. Thompson M.J. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1999; 402: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 2von Mering C. Huynen M. Jaeggi D. Schmidt S. Bork P. Snel B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 258-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). An alternative, complementary, approach is to use analyses of protein three-dimensional structure to derive functional insights, because three-dimensional structure is conserved in evolution much more strongly than sequence. This provides a rationale for a number of structural genomics initiatives (3Goulding C.W. Apostol M. Anderson D.H. Gill H.S. Smith C.V. Kuo M.R. Yang J.K. Waldo G.S. Suh S.W. Chauhan R. Kale A.

As part of a pilot structural genomics project aimed at the discovery of biological function, we have focused on gene products from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum, an organism whose complete genome sequence was published recently (7Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). A whole-genome comparison of P. aerophilum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, two organisms with very different, and in a sense extreme, lifestyles, led us to identify a set of 250 pairs of orthologous genes that are both widely distributed in nature and are shared by these two organisms. Among these were a set of four genes from P. aerophilum (PAE0151, PAE0285, PAE0337, and PAE2754) and four from M. tuberculosis (Rv0065, Rv0549, Rv0960, and Rv1720) that have since been clustered at NCBI as part of COG4113, with members drawn from Archaea, cyanobacteria, actinobacteria and α-proteobacteria (Table I). These are now annotated in Pfam as PIN domains.Table ITaxonomy and makeup of COG4113TaxaOrganismProteinsα-ProteobacteriaSinorhizobium melilotiSMA0545ActinobacteriaM. tuberculosisRv0065, Rv0549, Rv0960, Rv1720CyanobacteriaSynechocystis sp.SLL1225Nostoc sp.ALL5132CrenarchaeotaP. aerophilumPAE0151, PAE0285, PAE0337, PAE2754Sulfolobus solfataricusSSO0798, SSO1243, SSO1493, SSO1786 SSO1914, SSO1922, SSO1970EuryarchaeotaP. horikoshiiPH0098, PH0389 Open table in a new tab PIN domains, named for their homology with the N-terminal domain of the pili biogenesis protein (PIN, PilT N terminus) (8Wall D. Kaiser D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), comprise a very large family of proteins with representatives in all three kingdoms of life. They are classified in the Pfam data base (www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam) as PF01850, currently with more than 340 members. Functional annotation of the PIN domains is equivocal. They were initially thought to function in signaling (9Noguchi E. Hayashi N. Azuma Y. Seki T. Nakamura M. Nakashima N. Yanagida M. He X. Mueller U. Sazer S. Nishimoto T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5595-5605Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but a recent bioinformatic analysis of nearly 100 PIN domain sequences identified a set of five conserved acidic residues and a sixth conserved position where there is either a serine or threonine residue. This has led to a suggested exonuclease function (10Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R888-R890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, for example, the Caenorhabditis elegans PIN domain, smg-5, and the yeast PIN domain, NMD4p, are postulated to be ribonucleases that bind to helicases as part of the machinery for RNA degradation via the RNAi and nonsense-mediated RNA degradation (NMD) 1The abbreviations used are: NMD, nonsense-mediated degradation; COG, cluster of orthologous groups; PAE2754, protein encoded by open reading frame number 2754 from P. aerophilum; MAD multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; SeMet, seleno-methionine; DAO, d-amino acid oxidase; r.m.s.d., root mean square difference. 1The abbreviations used are: NMD, nonsense-mediated degradation; COG, cluster of orthologous groups; PAE2754, protein encoded by open reading frame number 2754 from P. aerophilum; MAD multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; SeMet, seleno-methionine; DAO, d-amino acid oxidase; r.m.s.d., root mean square difference. pathways (10Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R888-R890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In Archaea and thermophilic bacteria, PIN domains have been associated with a possible role in DNA repair. A recent analysis of conserved gene context across fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes revealed, in most Archaea and some thermophilic bacteria, a previously unrecognized cluster of genes containing DNA polymerases, helicases, nucleases, and many conserved hypothetical open reading frames, one of which is a PIN domain clustering in COG1848 (11Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Grishin N.V. Rogozin I.B. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 482-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This suggested a new DNA repair system in these organisms. DNA repair, and particularly mismatch repair, in thermophiles is a vexing question. The absence of key mismatch repair enzymes such as MutS and MutL, which are highly conserved in mesophiles from Escherichia coli to humans, has been suggested to result in “mutator” lifestyles for some thermophiles (7Fitz-Gibbon S.T. Ladner H. Kim U.J. Stetter K.O. Simon M.I. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), in which adaptive mutations enable the organism to adapt to stress or extreme environments (12Makarova K.S. Aravind L. Galperin M.Y. Grishin N.V. Tatusov R.L. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 608-628PubMed Google Scholar). Also absent from many of the fully sequenced thermophilic genomes are several well conserved nucleotide excision repair enzymes. The discovery of a new DNA repair operon in Archaea addresses this question and by implicating PIN domains as part of this operon adds another piece of functional evidence for this large protein family. Here we present the first crystal structure of a PIN domain, from the crenarchaeon P. aerophilum. The protein, the gene product of open reading frame PAE2754, proves to be a distant structural homologue of T4 RNase H and other exonucleases, despite insignificant sequence identity. Strict conservation of the active site residues suggests that this PIN domain is indeed an exonuclease. We have confirmed this functional hypothesis in vitro. This has important implications both for archaeal DNA editing and for the role of PIN domains in eukaryotic RNA editing. It is also an illustration of the power of structural genomics whereby deep phylogenetic lineages are apparent at the structural level and lead directly to functional characterization of proteins of previously unknown function or with equivocal and/or general functional annotation. Protein Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—The predicted open reading frame PAE2754 was amplified from genomic DNA by PCR, subcloned into the expression vector pPROeX (Invitrogen), transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, and expressed as an N-terminal His6-tagged protein. Purification involved a heat step, in which incubation for 40 min at 80 °C denatured a large fraction of the E. coli proteins, followed by Ni2+ affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography, as described (13Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Two site-specific mutations, L65M and L80M, were designed and introduced to facilitate structure determination by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD) methods using the selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein. The single mutants were individually made and tested for expression and crystallization, followed by the double mutant L65M/L80M. Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The double mutant was stable at 80 °C suggesting that the structure was not significantly destabilized by these mutations. The plasmid encoding the double mutant was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain DL41(DE3) and grown in LeMaster medium with SeMet as the only methionine source. The SeMet-substituted double mutant protein (SeMet-PAE2754_MM) was then purified as above. Both native PAE2754 and SeMet-PAE2754_MM were crystallized as described (13Arcus V.L. Backbro K. Roos A. Baker E.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60 (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) and flash-cooled for data collection by soaking in cryoprotectant (mother liquor plus 10% glycerol) immediately prior to placement in a stream of cold N2 gas at 110 K. Structure Determination and Refinement—Native PAE2754 x-ray diffraction data to 2.5-Å resolution were collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven, on beamline X8C (λ = 1.0000 Å). MAD data at two wavelengths were collected for SeMet-PAE2754_MM at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory, beamline 9-1. The data were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38252) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table II. The structure of PAE2754_MM was determined by single anomalous diffraction using a single SeMet data set at λ = 0.9794 Å. This is not where the anomalous differences are maximized for selenium, but this was necessary because the “remote” wavelength data set proved to be of poor quality due to crystal decay (data were initially collected at two wavelengths in accordance with Ref. 15Gonzalez A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Using SOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1755-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), a total of 17 out of a possible 24 selenium sites (from the 8 monomers in the crystal asymmetric unit) were located, based on anomalous differences. These gave initial phases to 2.8 Å with a figure of merit of 0.18 and a Z-score of 20.6. The phases were improved using maximum likelihood density modification via RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Successful improvement of the phases was dependent on user-defined non-crystallographic symmetry elements based on the initial selenium positions.Table IIData collection, structure solution, and refinement statisticsParametersNativeSeMet-PAE2754_MMA.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and refinement with CNS (21Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16918) Google Scholar). Due to the relatively low resolution of the data, non-crystallographic symmetry was included as a restraint in all refinement cycles, and weighted experimental phases from RESOLVE were also included at all stages. The final PAE2754_MM structure was then used as a molecular replacement model for the native data, and this structure was completed using 5 cycles of model building and refinement. Refinement statistics for both models are given in Table II. In Vitro Exonuclease Assays—An 18-bp primer (5′-CGCGCCGTTGCTATCTCC-3′) was annealed to a 54-bp primer (5′-ATTGAGAAATTCACGGCGNNKATANNKNNKGTTNNKGGAGATAGCAACGGCGCG-3′; where N = T, G, A, C; and K = T, G) to form double-stranded DNA with a 36-bp, 5′–3′ single-stranded, randomized overhang. 200 pm DNA was then mixed with 200 pm PAE2754 in 20 mm NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2 (MgCl2 was omitted from the negative control) and incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped at different time points by the addition of formamide gel loading buffer (80% v/v formamide, 10 mm EDTA), followed by freezing at -20 °C. Samples were run on a 20% polyacrylamide-urea denaturing minigel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. Samples were also prepared in the same way using MnCl2 as the metal ion source. Crystal Structure of PAE2754—The crystal structure of the protein encoded by the open reading frame PAE2754 from P. aerophilum was solved at 2.8-Å resolution, as a selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled double mutant, incorporating two Leu → Met mutations, that was constructed to facilitate phasing by MAD methods. This derivative structure was then refined to give a final R-factor of 0.226 (Rfree = 0.279). The native structure was then solved by molecular replacement and refined at 2.5 Å resolution to a final R-factor of 0.250 (Rfree = 0.305). The resulting model has good stereochemistry (Table II) with 92% of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot. The PAE2754 monomer forms a single domain in which the 133-residue polypeptide is folded as an α/β/α stack, with a central twisted parallel β-sheet of five short strands (Fig. 1). The strand order is 32145, and the twist of the sheet is such that the outer strands, which involve just three residues each, are oriented at 160° with respect to each other. Between strand 2 and strand 3, helices α2 and α3 pack in an antiparallel manner to form a long protrusion that extends orthogonally from the α/β/α stack. Hydrophobic cores above and below the central β-sheet stabilize the α/β/α stack, and a third hydrophobic mini-core is formed below the stack by the orthogonal packing of helices α4 and α5. These hydrophobic cores are highly populated by Ala, Leu, and Val residues, which compose no less than 40% of the PAE2754 sequence. Dynamic light scattering measurements show that PAE2754 forms a tetramer in solution, and accordingly the 12 monomers in the crystal asymmetric unit are organized as three tetramers (eight monomers in the asymmetric unit are organized as two tetramers for PAE2754_MM). The tetramer is best described as a dimer of dimers (Fig. 2). An extensive dimer interface is formed by the 2-fold related packing of a nearly continuous region of sequence between residues 32 and 94, spanning helices α2, α3, and α4. This interface buries 1440 Å2 of surface area (19% of the total monomer surface) and is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, marked by a striking interdigitation of many large hydrophobic side chains. There are just six hydrogen bonds between the two protein chains, all centered around the stacked histidine aromatic rings at the center of the interface. The tetramer is formed by the association of two dimers via a relatively small interface, in which the C terminus of helix α2 from one monomer contacts the N terminus of helix α6 from another. Stabilizing interactions at this interface are modest and include a salt bridge between Arg-48 from one monomer and Asp-110 and Glu-112 from another. The backbone carbonyl group from Arg-48 also hydrogen-bonds across the interface to the amide group of Arg-111. Although only 450 Å2 of surface area per monomer is buried on formation of this interface, the cooperative association of two dimers buries in total 4 × 450 = 1800 Å2. There is also a diagonally stabilizing interaction across the tetramer whereby a chloride ion linearly coordinates two arginine residues. The chloride lies at the center of a sphere of charged side chains that include Arg-48 (chain A), Glu-112 and Lys-116 (chain B), Glu-112 and Lys-116 (chain C), and Arg-48 (chain D). Residues that are conserved across COG4113 (Figs. 2 and 3) are clustered in a pocket formed at the C-terminal end of the β-sheet and the N termini of helices α2 and α6. This arrangement brings together four conserved acidic residues (Asp-8, Glu-38, Asp-92, and Asp-110 in PAE2754) that point into the pocket and create a highly negatively charged hole. Two other conserved residues on either side of Asp-110, Thr-108, and Leu-112, also flank the acidic pocket with Thr-108 being hydrogen-bonded to Asp-8. In the PAE2754 dimer (Fig. 2), the two acidic pockets are ∼20 Å apart and are separated by an intriguing structure formed by the one remaining fully conserved residue, Tyr-91; the two Tyr-91 side chains lie adjacent at the dimer interface, with their aromatic rings parallel and 6 Å apart. Upon formation of the tetramer, the four active site pockets lie in the interior of a tunnel with restricted access via two openings on opposite sides of the tetramer (Fig. 2). Adjacent lysine and glutamic acid residues (Lys-45 and Glu-46) from each monomer flank the entrances to the tunnel. Structural Comparisons—A DALI search (22Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar) using the monomer structure as a search model gave no significant matches to structures in the Protein Data Bank. The best structural match was to a porcine d-amino acid oxidase (DAO) (23Miura R. Setoyama C. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Mizutani H. Miyahara I. Hirotsu K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with a Z-score of 3.3, a root mean square difference (r.m.s.d.) in atomic positions of 3.9 Å for 97 Cα positions, and 8% sequence identity. The topological match between PAE2754 and DAO in the overlaid region was relatively good, with matches for all the major elements of secondary structure in PAE2754 except α4, although DAO does have two large insertions of 90 amino acids (between α2 and α3) and 110 amino acids (between β4 and β5). DAO has an FAD cofactor whose nucleotide component binds into the hole where the active site is hypothesized for PAE2754. This appeared to support the PIN domain annotation of “possible nucleotide-binding protein” from the major data bases and was also consistent with the RNase hypothesis of Clissold and Ponting (10Clissold P.M. Ponting C.P. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: R888-R890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A second match to the ADP binding domain of trimethylamine dehydrogenase (24Barber M.J. Neame P.J. Lim L.W. White S. Matthews F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6611-6619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where the nucleotide was similarly orientated, added weight to this hypothesis. Perhaps more significant, however, was the presence in the top 10 DALI structural matches of the T4 RNase H structure (25Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This also has low DALI scores (Z = 2.8, r.m.s.d. = 3.6 Å over 84 amino acids and 10% sequence identity), and the topological matches between PAE2754 and T4 RNase H were significantly poorer than for DAO, with no matches for α1, α2, α4, or α7 of PAE2754. What was striking, however, was the observation that residues that are conserved across COG4113, including the acidic residues at the putative active site, aligned structurally with similar residues in T4 RNase H that are involved in Mg2+ binding and catalysis (Fig. 4). Furthermore, these residues are also conserved across a large family of related prokaryotic exonucleases. This led us to test Mg2+ binding and DNase activity in vitro. Thus, although the fold of PAE2754 is most closely related to domains that bind ADP or FAD, suggesting nucleotide binding as part of its core function, sequence conservation at the active site predicts that PAE2754 (along with the many other PIN domains) belongs to the T4 RNase H family of exonucleases (26Andreeva A. Howorth D. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J.P. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D226-D229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, once the superposition of T4 RNase H on to the PAE2754 structure could be established, it became clear that other members of the exonuclease family, including the exonuclease domain of TaqDNA polymerase (27Eom S.H.

A time course incubation clearly shows PAE2754 has a Mg2+-dependent exonuclease activity (see Fig. 5). This experiment was repeated with Mn2+ in place of Mg2+ with equivalent results (data not shown), but no activity was seen in the absence of a suitable divalent cation. These initial tests show that the cleavage of single-stranded DNA by PAE2754 is slow and requires equimolar amounts of DNA, Mg2+, or Mn2+ and protein to provide catalysis. The sluggish reaction may be the result of the non-optimal substrate and/or the non-optimal temperature of the assay; we presume that the optimal temperature for this enzyme is 95–100 °C. Assays to determine substrate specificity and the optimal temperature are the subject of ongoing work. Putative Active Site—The four conserved acidic residues in each monomer, Asp-8, Glu-38, Asp-92, and Asp-110, are clustered together in a surface pocket, facing into the tunnel through the center of the tetramer. Two of these residues, Asp-8 and Asp-110, are at the N termini of helices α1 and α6, respectively, and their carboxylate groups are fixed in place by typical helix N-cap hydrogen bonds (with Ala-11 NH and Tyr-113 NH). This is reminiscent of the first Mg2+ site in the Pyrococcus furiosus FEN-1 endo/exonuclease (29Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), where both the Asp residues that directly coordinate the Mg2+ ion are fixed at helix N termini. It seems likely, by analogy, that the Mg2+ site in PAE2754 may be similarly pre-organized, with Asp-8 and Asp-110 directly coordinating the metal. Asp-92 could also coordinate a metal ion bound in this way, either directly or indirectly via a water molecule, but Glu-38 is more remote (6 Å away). If two Mg2+ ions are bound, as is the case in T4 ribonuclease H, the flap exonucleases, and many other exo- and endonucleases and polymerases, it is likely that Glu-38 would participate in binding the second Mg2+ ion. If this is so, the distance between the two Mg2+ ions will be somewhere between the ∼4 Å seen in the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (31Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) and the ∼8 Å seen in the T5 5′-exonuclease (32Ceska T.A. Sayers J.R. Stier G. Suck D. Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The invariant threonine residue, Thr-108, is a candidate for involvement in catalysis but is fairly well buried, hydrogen-bonded to Asp-8 Oδ-2 and Asp-110 NH, and it is difficult to see how it can play any direct role. Two other hydroxyl-containing residues, Ser-10 and Thr-89, which are almost fully conserved, are also adjacent to the metal site where they are fully exposed in the central tunnel and could play a role in catalysis or binding. Two other features of the active site region seem likely to be important. First, the pairwise, parallel, stacking (Fig. 2) of the aromatic rings of the conserved Tyr-91 residues on the inner surface of the central tunnel suggests"

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad1 and Rad10 proteins form a stable complex with DNA structure-specific endonuclease activity (1Tomkinson A.E. Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tappe N.J. Friedberg E.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 860-862Google Scholar, 2Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C. Science. 1994; 265: 2082-2085Google Scholar). During the removal of DNA lesions by nucleotide excision repair (NER), 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; GST, glutathione S-transferase; SSA, single strand annealing; hRad52, human Rad52; yRad52, yeast Rad52. Rad1-Rad10 complex makes the 5′ incision in a bubble structure generated as a result of localized unwinding of the damaged DNA (2Bardwell A.J. Bardwell L. Tomkinson A.E. Friedberg E.C.

A stable interaction with the DNA damage recognition protein Rad14 appears to mediate the specific recruitment of Rad1/Rad10 to the damaged strand (4Guzder S. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8903-8910Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike the other members of the RAD3 epistasis group that constitute the yeast NER pathway, the RAD1 and RAD10 genes also participate in specialized forms of mitotic recombination including the single strand annealing (SSA) pathway of recombination between direct sequence repeats and the integration of plasmid DNA into homologous chromosomal sequences (reviewed in Ref. 5Praksash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Google Scholar). In mammalian NER, XPF/ERCC1, the equivalent of Rad1/Rad10, interacts with XPA, the equivalent of Rad14, and makes the 5′ incision in the damaged strand (6Park C.H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J.

Similar to its yeast counterpart, XPF/ERCC1 is multifunctional, participating in intrachromosomal recombination between direct sequence repeats, the repair of DNA interstrand cross-links, and gene targeting (13Niedernhofer L.J.

Although the XPF/ERCC1 endonuclease removes non-homologous single strand tails during targeted homologous recombination and SSA (17Adair G.M. Rolig R. Moore-Faver D. Zabelshansky M. Wilson J.H. Nairn R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5552-5561Google Scholar), a recent study (13Niedernhofer L.J. Essers J. Weeda G. Beverloo B. de Wit J. Muijtens M. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Google Scholar) has revealed that XPF/ERCC1 is still required for gene targeting even when the targeting construct is homologous with the genomic locus. At the present time it is not known how XPF/ERCC1 is recruited to the specific recombination intermediates generated during SSA and targeted homologous recombination. In yeast, the majority of DNA double strand breaks are repaired by recombinational repair pathways mediated by the products of genes in the RAD52 epistasis group (18Symington L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 630: 630-670Google Scholar, 19Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 159-201Google Scholar). Within this epistasis group, inactivation of the RAD52 gene results in the most severe phenotype (18Symington L. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 630: 630-670Google Scholar, 19Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 159-201Google Scholar). Interestingly, genetic studies have implicated Rad52 in the same types of specialized mitotic recombination, SSA and homology-dependent integration of plasmid DNA, as the Rad1/Rad10 endonuclease (20Sugawara N. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 563-575Google Scholar, 21Fishman-Lobell J. Rudin N. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1291-1303Google Scholar). Although inactivation of vertebrate RAD52 homologs does not significantly affect cellular sensitivity to agents that cause DNA double-strand breaks, these mutant cell lines are defective in the targeting of DNA molecules to homologous chromosomal loci, although to a lesser extent than that observed in yeast rad52 mutants (22Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Eukaryotic Rad52 protein contains a conserved N-terminal domain that binds to DNA and self-associates to form a heptameric ring structure (24Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S.

Ishitani R. Fukai S. Nureki O. Shibata T. Yokoyama S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 359-371Google Scholar). Consistent with their role in SSA, both human (h) and yeast (y) Rad52 proteins promote the renaturation of complementary DNA single strands (28Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R.

In this study, we provide evidence that the function of the XPF/ERCC1 DNA structure-specific endonuclease is modulated by a direct interaction with hRad52. These results reveal a novel role for hRad52 in recombination and suggest a mechanism for the targeting and activation of the XPF/ERCC1 endonuclease in recombination reactions. Fractionation of HeLa Extract by Immunoaffinity Chromatography with XPF Antibody—XPF antibodies (NeoMarkers, 50 μg) and anti-His6 antibodies (Clontech, 50 μg) were coupled to protein A beads (Invitrogen, 50 μl) as described (30Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). The beads were incubated with cell-free extract (500 μg, total protein) from HeLa cells (31Manley J.L. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C in 500 μl of Buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12.5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After washing the beads with 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, bound proteins were eluted in a stepwise fashion with 50 μl of Buffer A containing 0.2, 0.5, 1 m KCl and then 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.0. Aliquots (10 μl) of the eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, and XPF, ERCC1, and hRad52 were detected by immunoblotting. ERCC1 antibodies were from Neomarkers, and hRad52 antibodies (32Chen G. Yuan S.-S.F. Liu W. Xu Y. Arlinghaus R. Baltimore D. Gasser P.J. Park M.S. Sung P. Lee E.Y.-H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12748-12752Google Scholar) were a gift from Dr. Eva Lee. Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were lysed in Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate) and a final concentration of 20 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Clarified lysates (2 mg) were incubated with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences, 20 μl) and either anti-hRad52 rabbit antiserum (2 μl), pre-immune antiserum (2 μl), anti-XPF antiserum (2 μl), or anti-ERCC1 antiserum (2 μl, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washing with Buffer B, immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and XPF was detected by immunoblotting. Purification of Recombinant hRad52—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring pET28b-hRad52 that encodes hRad52 with a C-terminal His6 tag were grown in Terrific Broth (33Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R. Morre D. Seidman J. Smith A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 3Google Scholar) and induced with 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside for 5 h at 30 °C. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 600 mm KCl, containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin) using a French press. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min), ammonium sulfate (0.32 g/ml) was added to the cleared lysate. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 30 min) and then resuspended in Buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing the mixture of protease inhibitors. The conductivity of the protein solution was adjusted to that of 100 mm KCl with Buffer C and then mixed with nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) pre-equilibrated with Buffer C containing 100 mm KCl and 50 mm imidazole. After being poured into a column, the beads were washed extensively with the same buffer, followed by the sequential elution of bound hRad52 with 200 and 500 mm imidazole in Buffer C containing 100 mm KCl. Fractions containing hRad52 were loaded onto an 8-ml Source S column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient from 100 to 600 mm KCl in Buffer C. Nearly homogenous hRad52 (∼11 mg from a 1-liter culture) was stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. The hRad52 open reading frame was subcloned from pET28b-hRad52 into pTAG (34Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-868Google Scholar) to generate the plasmid pTAG-hRad52 that expresses full-length hRad52 as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Fragments of the hRad52 open reading frame that encode the N-terminal domain (residues 1–176) and the remainder (residues 177–418) of hRad52 were introduced into pTAG to generate the plasmids, pTAG-hRad52N and pTAG-hRad52C, that express the hRad52 fragments as GST fusion proteins. Plasmids encoding GST and GST-hRad52 fusion proteins were introduced into BL21(DE3) cells. When cultures grown at 25 °C reached A600 ∼0.8, 1 mm isopropylthiogalactoside was added, and growth continued for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in Buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA) containing the mixture of protease inhibitors, and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min), the lysate was rocked for 1 h with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed extensively with Buffer D. Bound proteins were eluted with Buffer C containing 10 mm reduced glutathione. Fractions containing either GST or GST fusion proteins were stored at -80 °C. Purification of Recombinant yRad52—His-tagged yRad52 was purified from E. coli as described previously (35Song B. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15895-15904Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant XPF/ERCC1—The XPF-ERCC1 complex was overexpressed in and purified from E. coli as described (36Kuraoka I. Kobertz W.R. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Essigmann J.M. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26632-26636Google Scholar), except the cobalt column was omitted and Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences) was used for the gel filtration step. Approximately 3 μg of nearly homogenous XPF-ERCC1 complex was obtained from a 1-liter culture. In Vitro Transcription and Translation—The plasmids pTB-E1 and pTB-F that encode ERCC1 and XPF, respectively (11Bessho T. Sancar A. Thompson L.H. Thelen M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3833-3837Google Scholar), were used as templates to synthesize 35S-labeled ERCC1 and XPF by coupled in vitro transcription and translation using the T7 Quick-coupled TnT kit from Promega. Pull-down Assays—Glutathione-Sepharose beads (10 μl) and purified recombinant XPF/ERCC1 (13 pmol) were incubated with either GST-hRad52 (25 pmol) or GST (25 pmol) in 250 μl of Buffer D (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) with or without 20 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed extensively with Buffer D. Proteins were released from the beads by the addition of SDS sample buffer followed by incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. After separation by SDS-PAGE, ERCC1 and XPF were detected by immunoblotting. Glutathione-Sepharose beads, GST fusion proteins and in vitro translated ERCC1 and XPF were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as described above. Labeled proteins that bound to the beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and then detected by PhosphorImaging analysis (Amersham Biosciences). DNA Substrates—Thd following oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon: Ya, 5′-ACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCGGAGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCTGCAGTGGCTT-3′, and Yb, 5′-CCTAACAGTACTTGATCAGAGCTCTTCGAGAATTTTACCGAGCTCGAATTCACTGGCCGTCGTTTTACAACGT-3′. The underlines in Ya and Yb are complementary. Ya (200 pmol) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 6000 Ci/mmol) by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Labeled Ya was annealed with Yb (400 pmol) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA by heating at 70 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The splayed arm substrate was purified after electrophoresis through a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel as described previously (11Bessho T. Sancar A. Thompson L.H. Thelen M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3833-3837Google Scholar). Endonuclease Assay—XPF-ERCC1 complex (0.4 pmol) was pre-incubated on ice for 5 min with the indicated amount of hRad52 (0–4.4 pmol) in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4.5% glycerol, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol in a final volume of 10 μl. After the addition of labeled DNA substrate (3 fmol), reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Reactions were stopped by the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 2 mm. After phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, reaction products were separated by denaturing PAGE. Labeled oligonucleotides in the dried gel were detected and quantitated by PhosphorImaging analysis (Amersham Biosciences). Single Strand Annealing—The assay (reaction volume 50 μl) was performed essentially as described (37Krejci L. Song B. Bussen W. Rothstein R. Mortensen U.H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40132-40141Google Scholar). For reactions containing both XPF/ERCC1 (0.5 pmol) and hRad52 or yRad52 (3.6 pmol), the proteins were preincubated on ice for 5 min. For zero time point samples, the reaction components were mixed directly in stop buffer. Specific Association between XPF/ERCC1 and hRad52 in Human Cell Extracts—To identify proteins that associate with XPF/ERCC1, we fractionated a HeLa cell extract by immunoaffinity chromatography with either anti-XPF antibodies or anti-His6 antibodies as the ligand. As expected, both XPF and ERCC1 were specifically retained by the anti-XPF beads and detected in the 1 m KCl and 0.2 m glycine eluates by immunoblotting (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lanes 7 and 8). Interestingly, hRad52 was detected in the 1 m KCl eluate from the anti-XPF beads (Fig. 1A, lane 3) but not in an equivalent fraction from either the anti-His6 beads (Fig. 1A, lane 7) or protein A-agarose beads alone (data not shown). To provide further evidence for a specific association between XPF/ERCC1 and hRad52, we fractionated a HeLa nuclear extract by hRad52 affinity chromatography. ERCC1 specifically bound to the hRad52 beads and was eluted by the same ionic conditions that disrupted the association between hRad52 and the anti-XPF beads (data not shown). Because both the XPF-ERCC1 complex and hRad52 bind to DNA, their association in the affinity chromatography experiments may have been mediated by DNA in the extract. To examine this issue, proteins were immunoprecipitated from a HeLa cell extract in the presence of ethidium bromide to disrupt DNA-protein interactions (Fig. 1B). As expected, XPF was immunoprecipitated by XPF antibodies and by antibodies specific for its partner protein, ERCC1 (Fig. 1B). In accord with the affinity chromatography experiments, XPF was specifically co-immunoprecipitated by hRad52 antibody (Fig. 1B). Together these results strongly suggest that XPF/ERCC1 and hRad52 stably associate under physiological conditions. Direct Physical Interaction between the DNA Binding Domain of hRad52 and the XPF Subunit of the XPF-ERCC1 Complex—To determine whether there is a direct interaction between hRad52 and XPF/ERCC1, we performed pull-down assays with purified recombinant XPF/ERCC1 (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and GST-hRad52. XPF/ERCC1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads liganded by GST-hRad52 but not to beads liganded by GST (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 2 and 3). A similar result was obtained when the pull-down assays were carried out in the presence of ethidium bromide (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5) confirming that the association between XPF/ERCC1 and hRad52 is not mediated by DNA. The interaction of hRad52 with the subunits of the XPF-ERCC1 complex was examined in pull-down assays using in vitro translated polypeptides. Labeled XPF bound to GST-hRad52 beads but not to either GST-yRad52 or GST beads alone (Fig. 2C, lanes 2–4). In contrast, no specific binding of in vitro translated ERCC1 to GST-hRad52 beads was observed (data not shown). To map the region of hRad52 that interacts with XPF, we expressed and purified the N- and C-terminal domains of hRad52 as GST fusion proteins. XPF bound to full-length hRad52 and its N-terminal domain but not to the C-terminal domain (Fig. 2D). Together, these results demonstrate that XPF/ERCC1 and hRad52 physically interact in a species-specific reaction that is mediated by the XPF subunit of the XPF-ERCC1 complex and the N-terminal DNA binding domain of hRad52. hRad52 Stimulates the DNA Structure-specific Endonuclease Activity of XPF/ERCC1—To elucidate the functional consequences of the interaction between hRad52 and XPF/ERCC1, the effect of purified hRad52 (Fig. 3A, lane 2) on the nuclease activity of XPF/ERCC1 was examined. In these assays we used the preferred DNA substrate of XPF/ERCC1, a splayed arm structure formed that is cleaved by XPF/ERCC1 at the duplex/single strand junction releasing the 3′ single-stranded tail (3Davies A.A.

Pre-incubation of the DNA substrate with increasing amounts of hRad52 progressively inhibited XPF/ERCC1 nuclease activity (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–7). In contrast, pre-incubation of XPF/ERCC1 with the same amounts of hRad52 before mixing with the DNA substrate stimulated nuclease activity (Fig. 3B, lanes 10–13). Maximal stimulation occurred at a ratio of about 6 hRad52 molecules to 1 XPF-ERCC1 complex (Fig. 3B). Further increases in the amount of hRad52 progressively reduced nuclease activity (data not shown). At the optimum ratio, hRad52 enhanced the initial rate of endonucleolytic cleavage catalyzed by XPF/ERCC1 about 3-fold (Fig. 3C). Because hRad52 forms a heptameric ring (24Stasiak A.Z. Larquet E. Stasiak A. Muller S. Engel A. van Dyck E. West S.C. Egelman E.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 337-340Google Scholar, 25Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Google Scholar), these results suggest that a single XPF/ERCC1 heterodimer interacts with the hRad52 heptamer to yield a ternary complex that has increased nuclease activity. To provide further support for this model, we examined the effect of yRad52, which has similar biochemical properties to hRad52 but does not appear to bind XPF (Fig. 2C). In contrast to hRad52 (Fig. 3B, lanes 10–13), pre-incubation of XPF/ERCC1 with increasing amounts of yRad52 inhibited nuclease activity (Fig. 3D, lanes 5–8). Thus, the increased endonuclease activity of XPF/ERCC1 is dependent upon a specific physical interaction with hRad52. Because Rad52 is a DNA-binding protein, we considered the possibility that the interaction of hRad52 with XPF/ERCC1 may change the DNA substrate specificity of this endonuclease. A duplex Y structure was not cleaved by XPF/ERCC1 either with or without hRad52 (data not shown). In contrast, hRad52 did stimulate the weak cleavage activity of XPF/ERCC1 on a duplex substrate with a 3′ single strand flap, but the degree of stimulation was similar to that observed with the preferred splayed arm substrate (data not shown). Thus, under the reaction conditions used, hRad52 does not seem to alter DNA substrate specificity of XPF/ERCC1. XPF/ERCC1 Attenuates the DNA Strand Annealing Activity of hRad52—The ability of eukaryotic Rad52 to bind to single strand DNA and to promote the annealing of complementary DNA single strands (25Shinohara A. Shinohara M. Ohta T. Matsuda S. Ogawa T. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 145-156Google Scholar, 28Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because XPF/ERCC1 interacts with the DNA binding domain of hRad52, we examined whether this interaction modulates the ability of hRad52 to anneal complementary DNA single strands. As expected (28Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Google Scholar, 29Reddy G. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 377: 53-59Google Scholar), both hRad52 and yRad52 promoted the annealing of complementary DNA single strands, whereas XPF/ERCC1 had no significant annealing activity (Fig. 4). Interestingly, pre-incubation with XPF/ERCC1 markedly attenuated the strand annealing activity of hRad52 (Fig. 4) but had no effect on strand annealing by yRad52 (Fig. 4). Thus, inhibition of hRad52-mediated strand annealing is dependent upon a specific physical interaction with XPF/ERCC1, suggesting that the binding of hRad52 to DNA and to XPF/ERCC1 are mutually exclusive. Taken together our results provide evidence that hRad52 and XPF/ERCC1 form a stable ternary complex that cleaves specific recombination intermediates. During NER, protein-protein interactions with XPA and RPA position XPF/ERCC1 to make the 5′ incision in the damaged DNA strand (6Park C.H. Bessho T. Matsunaga T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the recruitment and activation of XPF/ERCC1 in homology-dependent recombination reactions have not been identified. Here we have shown an association between XPF/ERCC1 and hRad52 in human cell extracts and demonstrated a direct interaction between XPF and the N-terminal DNA binding domain of hRad52.

The yeast Rad1/Rad10 endonuclease removes non-homologous 3′ single strand tails from recombination intermediates that would otherwise prevent completion of the recombination event (39Fishman-Lobell J. Haber J.E. Science. 1992; 258: 480-484Google Scholar, 48Ivanov E.L. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2245-2251Google Scholar). Similar studies with Chinese hamster ovary ercc1 mutant cell lines have provided evidence that the XPF-ERCC1 complex also participates in intrachromosomal recombination between direct sequence repeats and removes non-homologous single strand tails in homology-mediated gene targeting events (15Sargent R.G. Rolig R.L. Kilburn A.E. Adair G.M. Wilson J.H. Nairn R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13122-13127Google Scholar, 17Adair G.M. Rolig R. Moore-Faver D. Zabelshansky M. Wilson J.H. Nairn R.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5552-5561Google Scholar). However, more recently, it was found that ERCC1 is also essential for targeted gene replacement in mouse ES cells even when the ends of the targeting construct are homologous with the genomic locus (13Niedernhofer L.J. Essers J. Weeda G. Beverloo B. de Wit J. Muijtens M. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that XPF/ERCC1 plays a critical role in the processing of a different type of recombination intermediate that does not have a non-homologous single strand tail, namely the heteroduplex intermediate that is generated as a result of stalled branch migration during gene targeting (13Niedernhofer L.J. Essers J. Weeda G. Beverloo B. de Wit J. Muijtens M. Odijk H. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Kanaar R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6540-6549Google Scholar). Based on the biochemical properties of eukaryotic Rad52 (28Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10729-10734Google Scholar, 29Reddy G. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 377: 53-59Google Scholar), it has been assumed that it would be involved in the annealing of complementary DNA single strands to generate the DNA structures that are subsequently recognized and cleaved by Rad1/Rad10 in yeast and XPF/ERCC1 in mammalian cells. Although our studies do not exclude the involvement hRad52 in the strand annealing reaction, they have revealed a novel and unexpected role for Rad52 at a different and later stage in these pathways, the cleavage of recombination intermediates. Specifically we have shown that hRad52 and XPF/ERCC1 form a stable complex in human cell extracts. Because formation of this ternary complex not only enhances the structure-specific endonuclease activity of XPF/ERCC1 but also inhibits DNA binding by hRad52, we suggest that the role of hRad52 in the ternary complex is to recruit, via protein-protein interactions, the DNA structure-specific endonuclease to specific recombination intermediates generated during SSA and in gene targeting. We thank Dr. Rick Wood for the XPF/ERCC1 expression plasmid and purification protocol, Dr. Eva Lee for hRad52antibodies, and Wendy Bussen for assistance with the strand annealing assay. We are grateful to Dr. Sang Eun Lee for discussions and critical review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2012362519,"The cysteine proteinase cathepsin B has been implicated in tumor progression by virtue of its increased mRNA and protein levels, as well as its localization at the invading front of the tumor. In this study, we examined whether blocking cathepsin B expression in human glioblastoma SNB19 cells affects angiogenesis. Stable transfectants of human glioblastoma cells with a plasmid containing antisense cathepsin B cDNA showed decreased migration rates in wound- and spheroid-migration assays. Analysis showed a reduction in VEGF protein and MMP-9 activity in the cathepsin B antisense cDNA-transfected cells. Regarding angiogenesis in vitro, we found that the conditioned medium of glioblastoma cells with downregulated cathepsin B expression reduced cell-cell interaction of human microvascular endothelial cells, resulting in the disruption of capillary-like network formation. Furthermore, a marked reduction in microvasculature development was seen in an in vivo dorsal air sac assay of glioblastoma cells with downregulated cathepsin B expression. Taken together, these results provide evidence that inhibition of cathepsin B expression can suppress glioblastoma-induced neovascularization."
https://openalex.org/W1985349122,"The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the main causative agents of respiratory tract infections. At present, clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae often exhibit decreased susceptibility toward β-lactams, a phenomenon linked to multiple mutations within the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). PBP2x, one of the six PBPs of S. pneumoniae, is the first target to be modified under antibiotic pressure. By comparing 89 S. pneumoniae PBP2x sequences from clinical and public data bases, we have identified one major group of sequences from drug-sensitive strains as well as two distinct groups from drug-resistant strains. The first group includes proteins that display high similarity to PBP2x from the well characterized resistant strain Sp328. The second group includes sequences in which a signature mutation, Q552E, is found adjacent to the third catalytic motif. In this work, a PBP2x from a representative strain from the latter group (S. pneumoniae 5259) was biochemically and structurally characterized. Phenotypical analyses of transformed pneumococci show that the Q552E substitution is responsible for most of the reduction of strain susceptibility toward β-lactams. The crystal structure of 5259-PBP2x reveals a change in polarity and charge distribution around the active site cavity, as well as rearrangement of strand β3, emulating structural changes observed for other PBPs that confer drug resistance to Gram-positive pathogens. Interestingly, the active site of 5259-PBP2x is in closed conformation, whereas that of Sp328-PBP2x is open.

Consequently, S. pneumoniae has evolved to employ the same protein in two distinct mechanisms of antibiotic resistance. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a commensal, Gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the upper respiratory tract in humans and is responsible for over one million deaths per year, mostly among the elderly and young children in developing countries. S. pneumoniae is a leading cause of community-acquired respiratory infections including pneumonia, acute otitis, and sinusitis as well as invasive infections such as bacteremia and meningitis (1Appelbaum P.C. Clin. Infect. Dis. 2002; 34: 1613-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). β-Lactam antibiotics are presently the most widely used molecules employed in the fight against pneumococcal infection. However, since the introduction of penicillin in the late 40s, β-lactam-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae have emerged in various locations and have now spread worldwide (2McCormick A.W. Whitney C.G. Farley M.M. Lynfield R. Harrison L.H. Bennett N.M. Schaffner W. Reingold A. Hadler J. Cieslak P. Samore M.H. Lipsitch M. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The S. pneumoniae bacterium is surrounded by a thick cell wall of which the main component is the peptidoglycan, a highly cross-linked mesh that is essential for bacterial cell division and protection from osmotic shock and lysis (3Holtje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptidoglycan synthesis occurs through a biosynthetic pathway that is initiated in the bacterial cytoplasm; the last steps occur on the periplasmic side of the bacterial membrane. The cytoplasmic steps of the pathway are catalyzed by Mur enzymes and result in the synthesis of lipid II molecules, which harbor the peptidoglycan building units and are subsequently translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane (4van Heijenoort J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The final steps of synthesis, namely the polymerization of the glycan chains and their reticulation, are catalyzed by the glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activities of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PBP, penicillin-binding protein; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration; MICCTX, MIC for cefotaxime; MICPenG, MIC for penicillin G; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; TP, transpeptidase.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4418-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In S. pneumoniae, six PBPs have been identified and classified on the basis of their sequence similarities (7Hakenbeck R. Briese T. Ellerbrok H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 8Ghuysen J.M. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 37-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). High molecular mass PBPs are bifunctional (class A) enzymes harboring glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase (TP) activities or monofunctional enzymes (class B) with only the TP activity. Finally, a low molecular mass PBP displays a d,d-carboxypeptidase activity. The TP activity of PBPs is responsible for cross-linking of peptidoglycan glycan chains through the formation of peptidic bridges (5Ghuysen J.M. Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 372-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). β-Lactam antibiotics specifically inhibit the TP activity by acylating the active site serine (9Jamin M. Damblon C. Millier S. Hakenbeck R. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These molecules are specific toward the TP domain because of the structural analogy between the β-lactam ring and the d-alanyl-d-alanine peptidoglycan moiety, the natural substrate of the PBPs. The inhibition of the TP activity causes a disruption in cell wall synthesis that often leads to cell death (10Waxman D.J. Strominger J.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 825-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). β-Lactam resistance in S. pneumoniae is a consequence of the generation of mosaic pbp genes, which result from intra- and interspecies recombination with sequences from related streptoccoci (11Coffey T.J. Dowson C.G. Daniels M. Zhou J. Martin C. Spratt B.G. Musser J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2255-2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Such genes encode PBPs harboring tens of substitutions spread throughout the entire protein (12du Plessis M. Bingen E. Klugman K.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Nagai K. Davies T.A. Jacobs M.R. Appelbaum P.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1273-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), leading to a loss of affinity for the antibiotics. Three of the streptococcal PBPs, namely PBP2x, PBP2b, and PBP1a, have been shown to be modified in penicillin-resistant strains isolated in a clinical setting (12du Plessis M. Bingen E. Klugman K.P. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 14Asahi Y. Takeuchi Y. Ubukata K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1252-1255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PBP2x, one of the two monofunctional high molecular mass PBPs in S. pneumoniae, is described as the primary PBP target in β-lactam-resistant strains (15Laible G. Hakenbeck R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6986-6990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Grebe T. Hakenbeck R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 829-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The appearance of a mosaic PBP2x is thus the first event occurring in the development of antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae (17Laible G. Spratt B.G. Hakenbeck R. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1993-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We performed an analysis of 89 PBP2x sequences isolated from well characterized pneumococcal clinical isolates and found that they can be classified, based on cluster analysis, into three groups. The first group contains sequences closely related to the one isolated from the susceptible strain R6 (18Hoskins J. Alborn Jr., W.E. Arnold J. Blaszczak L.C. Burgett S. DeHoff B.S. Estrem S.T.

The second group of mutants, however, which is distinguished by the Q552E mutation within all of the PBP2x sequences, remains uncharacterized both on the biochemical and structural level. This category of PBP2x variants appears to present a molecular mechanism selected to reduce the reactivity toward β-lactams that is different from that of the Sp328-like PBP2x proteins. One representative PBP2x, from strain 5259, was selected from this group for detailed study. In this work, we report the structural and functional analysis of 5259-PBP2x* and demonstrate the role of the Q552E substitution in the β-lactam resistance process. Isolation of Drug-resistant Clones and Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) Values for β-Lactam Antibiotics—The S. pneumoniae clinical strain 5259 of serotype 15 was isolated from a tracheal noninvasive sample at the University Hospital in Grenoble, France. S. pneumoniae 5259 was grown at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 on Columbia blood agar plates (Biomérieux). Clones were isolated, and overnight liquid cultures were stored at -80 °C. The MIC values for penicillin G and cefotaxime were determined using the E-test method on Muller-Hinton agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood. S. pneumoniae 5259 transformants from overnight liquid cultures were plated on agar plates at 0.5 McFarland. E-test strips were laid on the plates, and the MIC was read after an incubation period of 18 to 24 h as the values at the intersection of the strip and the grown bacteria. Construction of Expression Plasmids, Site-directed Mutagenesis, and Protein Purification—Genomic DNA from strain 5259 was extracted with the High Pure PCR preparation kit (Roche Applied Science). The region of pbp2x coding for residues 49–750 (thus lacking the cytoplasmic region and the transmembrane helix; henceforth identified with an asterisk) was PCR-amplified as a BamHI-SalI fragment and cloned into pGEX-4T1 to create the pGEX-5259-pbp2x* plasmid, which expresses 5259-PBP2x*. The previously described pGEX-R6-pbp2x* plasmid was used to express PBP2x* from the R6 strain (25Mouz N. Di Guilmi A.M. Gordon E. Hakenbeck R. Dideberg O. Vernet T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19175-19180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). With the goal of generating PBP2x* mutants in position 552 of both R6-PBP2x* and 5259-PBP2x* proteins, the QuikChange Kit (Stratagene) was employed. The primer 5′-GCCCTCAAGTCTGGTACCGCTGAGATTGCTGACG-3′ and its reverse complement were used to generate the pGEX-R6-pbp2x*-Q552E plasmid. The primers introduced a KpnI restriction site within the mutation site for rapid screening of successful mutants. The pGEX-5259-pbp2x*-E552Q plasmid was created using the primer 5′-GCCCTTAAATCAGGTACCGCGCAGATTGCGGATGAGAAAAAT-3′, and its reverse complement. The region of the expected mutation was sequenced for both constructs. R6-PBP2x*, R6-PBP2x*Q552E, 5259-PBP2x*, and 5259-PBP2x *E552Q were expressed in Escherichia coli MC1061 fusions with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Proteins were purified by affinity chromatography and the GST tag was removed by thrombin cleavage as described previously (26Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For crystallization experiments, 5259-PBP2x* was further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a 3-ml Source 15Q resin and gel-filtered on a Superdex HR10/60 column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The molecular masses of all proteins were verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Transformation of S. pneumoniae Strains—The R6 strain of S. pneumoniae was used as recipient for transformations. Competent cells, generated as described previously (27Chesnel L. Pernot L. Lemaire D. Champelovier D. Croizé J. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Zapun A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44448-44456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), were diluted 10-fold in C-medium with 0.018% albumin (8%, boiled), and were mixed with 50 ng of plasmid DNA. Cells were incubated for 30 min on ice and subsequently for 120 min at 37 °C before being plated on Columbia blood agar Base EH (BD Biosciences) plates enriched with 4% horse blood and cefotaxime at concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.3 μg.ml-1. Isolated clones were picked after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 and then grown in glucose-buffered broth (Diagnostic Pasteur). Overnight cultures were then stored at -80 °C until the MIC determination was carried out. The MIC values were measured using the E-test method as described above for three independent isolates. All transformed colonies were confirmed as S. pneumoniae by agglutination and optochine susceptibility assays. Finally, genomic DNA of each transformant was extracted, and the pbp2x genes were PCR-amplified and sequenced. Biochemical Characterization of the Purified Proteins—Acylation efficiencies were measured for R6-PBP2x*, R6-PBP2x*-Q552E, 5259-PBP2x*, and 5259-PBP2x*-E552Q for both penicillin G and cefotaxime. The k2/K parameter was determined by following the intrinsic fluorescence of the proteins during antibiotic binding (9Jamin M. Damblon C. Millier S. Hakenbeck R. Frère J.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Measurements were made at 37 °C using a spectrofluorimeter coupled to an SFM-400 stopped-flow apparatus (Bio-Logic). Proteins were used at a concentration of 0.6 μm and antibiotics at excess concentrations ranging from 25 μm to 2.5 mm in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Excitation was measured at 280 nm, and emission was recorded above 305 nm. At a given concentration of antibiotic, the pseudo first-order rate constant, kapp, was determined by nonlinear least squares fitting to the equation Fluot = Fluo0 exp(-kapp·t). The k2/K parameter, which accounts for the acylation efficiency, was determined by linear square fitting to the equation kapp = (k2/K)/[antibiotic]. The deacylation rate was determined for all four proteins using [3H]penicillin G as previously described (28Di Guilmi A.M. Mouz N. Petillot Y. Forest E. Dideberg O. Vernet T. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 284: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The deacylation reaction obeys the following equation: k3t = ln[EI*]t/[EI*]0, where [EI*]0 is the initial concentration of acyl enzyme and [EI*]t is its concentration at time t. To initiate acylation, 2 μm protein was incubated with 1 μm radiolabeled penicillin G in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. After 10 or 30 min of incubation for R6-PBP2x* and 5259-PBP2x*, respectively, 15 mm unlabeled penicillin G was added, defining the beginning of the kinetic assay. Protein samples were withdrawn at various times and immediately boiled with 1% SDS prior to analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The amount of radioactivity was measured in the protein bands by liquid scintillation counting. The rate constant k3 was determined by nonlinear least squares fitting to the equation cpmt = cpm0·exp(-k3·t). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—Screening experiments were performed by a TECAN Genesis robot at 8 °C using commercial Hampton crystallization screens kits and employing the sitting drop vapor diffusion method (Hampton Research). Crystallization drops were composed of 1 μl of protein solution and an equal amount of reservoir solution, which was 200 μl in volume. A first hit was identified with 15% polyethylene glycol 1500, and the optimization experiments were set up by hand using the hanging-drop technique. Crystals grew under the following conditions. 1 μl of precipitating solution (14% polyethylene glycol 1500, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.3, ammonium sulfate 200 mm) was added to 1 μl of the protein solution at a concentration of 10 mg.ml-1 (in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The drops were equilibrated over a reservoir of 500 μl of the precipitating solution and kept at 8 °C. Crystals grew as bipyramids to maximum dimensions of 0.15 × 0.17 × 0.12 mm after 2 weeks. They belong to the tetragonal space group, P4222, with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 195.0 Å, c = 154.2 Å. The asymmetric unit accommodates two monomers, corresponding to a crystal packing parameter (VM) of 4.76 Å3.Da-1 and a solvent content of 74%. Prior to data collection, crystals were briefly immersed in a cryoprotectant solution having the same composition as the mother liquor but with a slight increase of polyethylene glycol 1500 (to 16%) and containing 15% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as cryoprotectant. Crystals were subsequently flash-cooled by being plunged into liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on the BM30 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) operating at a wavelength of 0.999 Å. Angular increments between diffraction images of 1° and a distance crystal-to-detector of 210 mm were used. Raw diffraction images were indexed and integrated with MOSFLM, version 6.2.2 (29Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 1696-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Data scaling, merging, and reduction was carried out with programs of the CCP4 suite (30CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). The self-rotation function displays peaks showing a 2-fold axis perpendicular to the c axis. Structure Solution and Refinement—The crystal structure of 5259-PBP2x* was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe (31Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) with data between 30 and 3.0 Å and the R6-PBP2x* structure as a search model (22Gordon E. Mouz N. Duée E. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank accession code 1QME). Residues differing from the 5259-PBP2x* sequence were replaced by alanines prior to the molecular replacement procedure. The rotation and the translation functions gave two clear single solutions, with an R-factor of 42.8% and a correlation coefficient of 68.1%, which corresponded to two molecules in the asymmetric unit related by a 2-fold noncrystallographic axis. These two solutions were employed in the refinement procedure performed with CNS 1.1 (32Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The first cycle of the refinement procedure consisted of 20 cycles of rigid-body refinement with data between 31 and 4 Å. At this stage the N-terminal domain of the model was completely built in the electron density map for both molecules in the asymmetric unit. Subsequently, several cycles of simulated annealing, energy minimization, and grouped temperature factor refinement were performed. Cycles of refinement were interchanged with manual rebuilding sessions using the molecular graphics program O (33Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Water molecules were positioned progressively if they were observed to be in an environment susceptible to providing hydrogen bonds. In the final stages of the refinement, individual restrained B-factor refinement was performed. These iterative cycles of refinement and map interpretation led to a model with R-factor = 23.5% and R-free = 25.6% (34Brunger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3872) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the model was analyzed with PROCHECK (35Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar); a total of 83.1% of the non-glycine residues were found in the “most favored” region of the Ramachandran plot. Characterization of pbp2x Sequences—Eighty-nine strains displaying a wide range of β-lactam resistance levels were selected from a large collection of well characterized clinical strains kept at the University Hospital in Grenoble, France. The MIC values for penicillin G and cefotaxime were measured for all of strains, and the pbp2x fragments coding for each TP domain were sequenced. Among the 26 drug-sensitive strains (MICPenG < 0.1 μg.ml-1), only 10 PBP2x sequences displayed differences from that of PBP2x from strain R6. Similarly, the 53 remaining drug-resistant strains (MIC > 0.1 μg.ml-1) displayed 12 distinct PBP2x sequences. When the 22 different sequences (10 from sensitive strains, 12 from resistant strains) were submitted to a clustering algorithm (www.genebee.msu.su), they were found to fall into three groups: one contained 10 PBP2x sequences with major similarities to the R6-PBP2x sequence and originated from the susceptible strains; a second group displayed 11 PBP2x sequences that were similar to the previously characterized PBP2x from drug-resistant strain Sp328 (19Zhao G. Yeh W.K. Carnahan R.H. Flokowitsch J. Meier T.I. Alborn Jr., W.E. Becker G.W. Jaskunas S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Dessen A. Mouz N. Gordon E. Hopkins J. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45106-45112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); and a third differing PBP2x sequence displayed similarities to PBP2x from strain F2. The existence of two distinct groups of sequences from resistant strains was further confirmed by analysis of public data bases. Because our laboratories had already biochemically and structurally characterized a PBP2x molecule from strain Sp328 (23Dessen A. Mouz N. Gordon E. Hopkins J. Dideberg O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45106-45112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 26Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we initiated the characterization of a representative PBP2x from the second group of strains. Two strains from our hospital-derived collection displayed this particular PBP2x sequence, and one of them, strain 5259, was further characterized in this work. S. pneumoniae strain 5259 has MICs of 0.19 and 0.094 μg.ml-1 for penicillin G and cefotaxime, respectively. The 5259-PBP2x* sequence displays 28 mutations when compared with the R6-PBP2x* sequence. These mutations are as follows: three in the N-terminal domain (A172T, R254Q, and M256V), three in the C-terminal domain (L710F, Q721E, and T745K) and 22 in the TP domain. The latter 22 substitutions are within the C-terminal part of the TP domain, from amino acids 447 to 616. Among these substitutions, only 9 (I462L, T490S, A491V, D506E, N514H, L565S, D567N, A572V, and D616E) are common to both Sp328-PBP2x* and 5259-PBP2x* sequences. Among the 13 other substitutions in the TP domain, 9 are unique to 5259-PBP2x* (Q447M, S449A, I483L, L517M, P535A, T538N, Q552E, V563T, and Y568N), and 4 occur in both sequences, but the substituted amino acid residue is different (L510V, T513D, L523T, and N576H). The 5259-PBP2x sequence does not display the T338A substitution, which was shown to be an important factor in the development of drug resistance in strains such as Sp328 (26Mouz N. Gordon E. Di Guilmi A.M. Petit I. Petillot Y. Dupont Y. Hakenbeck R. Vernet T. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13403-13406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and is located adjacent to the active site serine; but it does contain a Q552E mutation adjacent to the third catalytic motif of the active site. Notably, public data bases contain 21 PBP2x* sequences harboring the Q552E substitution in the TP domain. When submitted to a cluster analysis, these sequences were found to differ markedly from those related to that from strain Sp328. Among these sequences, only four also harbor the T338A mutation, whereas one displays a T338P modification. Among the 16 remaining sequences, the ones from strains F2, G54, and Sp1465 are 100% identical from amino acids 266 to 616 to PBP2x from strain 5259. In Vitro Analysis of 5259-PBP2x*, 5259-PBP2x*E552Q, and R6-PBP2x*Q552E—To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance generated by 5259-PBP2x and to assess the role of the Q552E substitution in PBP2x catalysis and structure, different PBP2x* proteins were produced for structural analysis and in vitro characterization assays. In addition to the production of R6-PBP2x* and 5259-PBP2x*, site-directed mutagenesis was performed at position 552 of both proteins to generate the R6-PBP2x*-Q552E and the 5259-PBP2x*-E552Q mutants. All four proteins were expressed and purified analogously. The kinetics of the interaction between PBPs and β-lactams can be described by a three-step reaction represented by the following equation (36Frère J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Iwatsubo M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 57: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). E+I⇆k1k-1EI→k2EI*→k3E+P(Eq. 1) The first step represents the formation of a noncovalent complex EI with the dissociation constant K = k-1/k1 followed by the acylation of the active site serine by the β-lactam molecule with the rate constant k2. Those two steps are termed the “acylation efficiency” and are characterized by the second order rate constant k2/K. In this work, the acylation efficiency was measured at pH 7.0 by monitoring the decrease of the intrinsic fluorescence of each protein upon antibiotic binding. The acylation step is a very fast reaction and was thus analyzed with a stopped-flow apparatus coupled to a spectrofluorimeter. The results are presented in Table I and Fig. 1. The introduction of the substitution Q552E into R6-PBP2x* is responsible for a 4.2- and 5.6-fold decrease of the acylation efficiency for cefotaxime and penicillin G, respecti"

We have investigated the binding kinetics of PH domains found in the tail region of the molecular motor, myosin X. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we observed binding and release of individual PH domains fused to green fluorescent protein at the plasma membrane of living cells. Individual spots of light corresponding to single fluorescently tagged molecules were imaged onto a sensitive camera system, and digital image processing was then used to identify each fluorophore and store its trajectory in time and space. The PH domains bound with an apparent on-rate of 0.03 μm-1 μm-2 s-1 and a detachment rate constant of 0.05 s-1. The average residency time of the domains at the plasma membrane was about 20s. We found very limited movement of the membrane-bound PH domains in the mouse myoblast cells that we studied. This implies that the PH domains must either be attached to the cytoskeleton or corralled in a lipid compartment. Localization of the PH domains together with their rapid detachment rate is probably important in controlling the response of myosin X to signaling events and in regulating its cellular function.

PH domains are found in over 250 proteins in the human genome (1Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and are known to bind specific phosphoinositol phospholipids (PtdIns). 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PH, pleckstrin homology; TIRFM, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate; PtdIns(3,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: PtdIns, phosphatidylinositol; PH, pleckstrin homology; TIRFM, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; PtdIns(3,4)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate; PtdIns(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate; PtdIns(3,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate. The binding of PH domains to their target phospholipids is controlled by phosphorylation of the inositol moiety of the lipids. Because there are five available phosphorylation positions, this could give rise to 32 different PtdIns forms (for example, a 5-bit binary encoding). Although binding affinities of different PH domains have been measured in vitro and their localization has been observed in vivo, little is known regarding the membrane binding dynamics of these domains. Recently, several laboratories have developed optical methods to make wide field observations of individual fluorophores in aqueous solution and these techniques enable the dynamic behavior (e.g. kinetics of membrane binding and release, diffusion times, and trafficking) of proteins, ligands, and viruses (2Axelrod D. Lakowicz J.R. Topics inFluorescent Spectroscopy. 3. Plenum Press, New York1992: 289-342Google Scholar, 3Burghardt T.P. Axelrod D. Biophys.

However, one of the main problems in imaging single fluorophores within a living cell is the high autofluorescence that overlaps the emission spectrum of the enhanced (S65T mutant) green fluorescent protein (eGFP) used in many such studies (8Harms G.S. Cognet L. Lommerse P.H.M. Blab G.A. Schmidt T. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2396-2408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, we exploited total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to observe single fluorophores in living cells. TIRFM is a wide-field method (e.g. illuminates the entire cross-section of a specimen) that relies on near-field excitation (by the evanescent wave); thus, only a thin layer of the cell that lies close to the glasswater interface is illuminated (9Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Knight A.E. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Methods. 2003; 29: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This technique enables the activity of individual molecules to be observed directly allowing membrane binding dynamics of single molecules to be measured by steady-state observation. We are interested in the behavior of myosin X, which is a dimeric molecular motor consisting of a highly conserved motor domain that interacts with actin to produce force and movement and a modular tail region that is thought to bind to membranes via its PH domains. Here, we studied the three tandem PH domains present in its tail region (10Berg J.S. Derfler B.H. Pennisi C.M. Corey D.P. Cheney R.E. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3439-3451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first domain is split, such that the second domain is inserted into a loop in the first domain. The tail domain of myosin X fused to eGFP localizes to the actin rich cortex (11Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), and of the three identified tail domains, only the PH domains show any membrane localization (12Yonezawa S. Yoshizaki N. Sano M. Hanai A. Masaki S. Takizawa T. Kageyama T. Moriyama A. Dev. Growth Differ. 2003; 45: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sequence homology mapping suggests that all three domains bind to phosphoinositol lipids with a phosphate at the 3′ position such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(3,4)P2 following phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2 upon cell stimulation (13Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Phospholipid blot overlay assays showed that the PH domains in fact bind to PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,5)P2, and with lower affinity to PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vitro. 2D. Tacon and M. Peckham, unpublished findings. 2D. Tacon and M. Peckham, unpublished findings. In vivo, the PH domains are recruited to the plasma membrane, areas of dynamic ruffling activity, and intracellular vesicles in live cells. In this study, the binding kinetics of single molecules of eGFP-PH123 at the plasma membrane of live cells was investigated using TIRFM. Time-lapse TIRFM was employed to visualize individual fluorophores for long periods (>500 s), and this enabled data from up to 1000 individual fluorophores to be collected from each cell specimen. By handling the data obtained from each individual molecule separately, the power of the single molecule approach is retained, whereas sufficiently large data sets could be collected to ensure that the results are statistically valid. Steady-state observation of single molecules enabled their binding kinetics and spatial dynamics to be measured without perturbing the cell. Furthermore, the use of a novel time-lapse illumination method to systematically change the illumination intensity enabled the effects of photobleaching to be obviated. Cloning—The full-length myosin X cDNA was amplified from mouse myoblasts by long reverse transcription-PCR using primers based on the mouse sequence (GenBank™ accession number AJ249706) (14Yonezawa S. Kimura A. Koshiba S. Masaki S. Ono T. Hanai A. Sonta S. Kageyama T. Takahashi T. Moriyama A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It was then sequenced in its entirety to check for sequence fidelity. A fragment containing all three PH domains (eGFP-PH123, nucleotides 3615–4500) was subcloned into either peGFPN1 or peGFPC1 (Clontech), such that eGFP was fused either to the N terminus with a 15 amino acid linker or the C terminus with a 6 amino acid linker. In the experiments reported here, we used exclusively the C-terminal constructs. These were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and the cell lysates were immunoblotted using an anti-GFP antibody (AbCam Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) to confirm that the expressed proteins were of the predicted size (data not shown). In the experiments described here, we used eGFP-PH123 in which eGFP was fused to the C terminus; however, we found that N-terminal fusions gave similar cellular localization. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Expression Levels—Mouse myoblasts isolated from the “immortal mouse” (H2kb-tsA58) were cultured as described previously (15Peckham M. Miller G. Wells C. Zicha D. Dunn G.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1367-1377PubMed Google Scholar). They were transfected with the eGFP constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) or Genejuice (Novagen) following the recommended protocol. After 24 h, the cells were plated onto glass coverslips and allowed to settle. 8 h later, the medium was replaced with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) without serum and the coverslip was assembled into a small chamber for viewing the cells on the inverted microscope (see below). Approximately, 10% of the cells had a suitable level of expression for TIRF measurements following this transfection procedure, such that single molecules could be visualized as single spots. The final concentration of eGFP fusion protein in cells used in the TIRF experiments was in the nanomolar range (i.e. ∼1 molecule/μm3; 5000 molecules/cell). This was confirmed by independent measurements using confocal microscopy where fluorescence of a range of concentrations of eGFP was compared with that of live transfected cells. From the calibration curve, we estimated the concentration to be around 10 nm (9Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Knight A.E. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Methods. 2003; 29: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Under equivalent conditions in neutrophils, the concentration of target lipid, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, in the plasma membrane was ∼50 nm (local concentration of 5 μm) (16Stephens L.R. Hughes K.T. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1991; 351: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Objective Type TIRF Microscopy—The imaging apparatus was based around an inverted microscope (Axiovert S100, Zeiss) with a high numerical aperture objective lens (Fluor ×100, 1.45NA, Zeiss). An argon ion laser (532-AP-A01, Melles Griot) was used to illuminate the cells using a custom optical arrangement to produce evanescent field excitation (TIRFM) (9Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Knight A.E. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Methods. 2003; 29: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Illumination was controlled using a mechanical shutter system and neutral density filter. A small (∼2.5 mm diameter) mirror placed close to the back aperture of the objective lens directed the laser beam to the periphery of the lens so that incident light approached the specimen at an angle exceeding the critical angle for total internal reflection. A second mirror on the opposite side of the back aperture reflected the totally internally reflected beam out of the microscope system and projected it onto a position-sensitive photodiode used for autofocus control (see Ref. 9Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Knight A.E. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Methods. 2003; 29: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar for a full description). Sequences of images were acquired by a digital image-intensified CCD camera (GemStar, Photonic Science, Robertsbridge, United Kingdom) and recorded to the hard drive of a PC for analysis. Microscope Observation Chambers—Cells transfected with eGFP-tagged PH domains were plated onto glass coverslips and mounted in a viewing chamber. The chamber consisted of a Perspex block with a central hole. The coverslip with adhered cells was fixed to the lower face of the Perspex block, and the central chamber was then quickly filled with medium to prevent the sample from drying out. The upper face was then covered with a second coverslip to seal the central chamber. Small sideports enabled bathing media to be exchanged. Visualizing eGFP Molecules in Vitro Single Fluorophore-imaging System Calibration—To calibrate the single fluorophore TIRFM system, purified eGFP was viewed under controlled conditions. Microscope flow-cells were constructed using a pre-cleaned 22 × 50-mm2 glass microscope slide across which two 3 × 22-mm2 strips of (number 1) coverslip were fixed 15 mm apart using 2 μl of UV-curing epoxy adhesive (RS Components, Corby, United Kingdom). A 22 × 40-mm2 precleaned coverslip was glued onto the coverslip strips orthogonally to the slide, leaving ∼10 mm of coverslip projecting from either side. The flow-cell was exposed to UV light until the glue was completely cured. 50 μl of a buffered solution (pH 7.4) containing 5 μg ml-1 anti-eGFP antibodies (Abcam Ltd) was applied to the flow-cell for 5 min. This was subsequently washed out, and the surface was blocked using 1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin. 50 μl of a buffered solution containing 20 ng ml-1 eGFP (Clontech) then was introduced for 5 min, and finally, unbound eGFP was washed out using an excess of buffer solution. Flow-cells were then viewed using the TIRFM microscope. The eGFP attached to the glass surface at a density of 0.2–0.3 molecule μm-2. Single eGFP molecules were clearly seen on glass surface as isolated spots of a diffraction-limited size. The size, intensity, and lifetime of individual fluorophores together with their characteristic rapid photobleaching were used to calibrate the system for later studies using live cells. Live cell studies were conducted using the same microscope, and camera settings were used as the control studies. All of the experiments were conducted at 35 °C. Identification of Single Fluorophores, the “DISH Criteria”—Image data was analyzed using a custom written single fluorophore detection algorithm (9Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Knight A.E. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Methods. 2003; 29: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Control data sets obtained from eGFP molecules attached to the coverslip via antibody showed properties characteristic of single fluorophores. We term these the DISH criteria whereby the fluorescent spots of light had 1) diffraction-limited size, 2) intensity of emission appropriate for a single fluorophore, 3) single step photobleaching, and 4) half-life of the fluorophore population before photobleaching occurred, directly proportional to laser excitation power. Based on these criteria, we developed a three-pass computer algorithm that performed spatial and temporal statistical tests on stored video sequences to identify individual fluorophores (see below). On the first pass, groups of pixels were analyzed in time to test for the expected sudden change in intensity characteristic of rapid appearance and disappearance of single fluorophores. Fluorescent spots that exhibited the correct amplitude and speed of intensity change and which also had the correct diffraction-limited size were then subjected to a second round of analysis. The second pass performed a statistical analysis of the intensity levels before and after candidate changes in intensity were noted during the first pass. On the final pass of the algorithm, the trajectory in space and time for each candidate fluorophore was determined by tracking the centroid of each fluorescent spot. The computer program produced an output file that could be checked against the original raw data sets and which also contained all of the statistical information regarding the individual time trajectories for each fluorophore and the global statistics concerning average lifetimes. Fluorescence images produced using TIRFM were typified by the fact that fluorophores diffuse very rapidly to and from the evanescent excitation region before and after binding at the plasma membrane (which is close to the coverslip interface). This means that spots of light appear rapidly and then persist at the membrane for several video frames until they either photobleach or the molecule detaches. In either case, the spot of light rapidly disappears. The time resolution of our system is insufficient to discriminate between unbinding followed by rapid diffusion out of the excitation field and instantaneous photobleaching. In fact, the average diffusion time for a small protein in cytoplasm (e.g. diffusion coefficient, D ≈ 1 × 10-11 m2 s-1) from an evanescent field of depth, x = 100 nm, is given by x2/2D ≈ 0.5 ms. Because photobleaching is directly proportional to laser power, whereas unbinding is independent of illumination power, photobleaching can be factored out from unbinding by systematically changing the average laser power. To accomplish this, time-lapse illumination was employed. In every 5-s interval, the laser was switched on for 0.33, 0.55, 1.05, or 1.55 s or left on continuously for the full 5 s. The illumination “duty cycle ratio” was varied over the range from ∼7 to 100%. This approach offers the advantage that signal-to-noise ratio of the camera system and the TIRF angle during the period of illumination remain constant. Imaging of Single eGFP Molecules in Vitro—Purified eGFP attached to coverslips via anti-GFP antibodies could be identified clearly as isolated diffraction-limited spots of light (Fig. 1a). The spatial intensity distribution produced by individual fluorophores should correspond to an Airy disc pattern with a characteristic point spread function determined by the imaging system. Full width at half-height should be close to 0.6λ/N.A. ≈ 250 nm (where λ = optical wavelength, N.A. = effective numerical aperture of the imaging system, maximum of 1.3 for aqueous specimens). Our system gave a measured width at half-height of 400 nm (Fig. 1a, inset). This was dominated by image degradation caused by the image-intensifier system. Plots of intensity levels of individual fluorophores against time showed an approximately constant level of fluorescence with noise level dominated by photon counting (Fig. 1b). Approximately 30 photons/image frame were collected so that the expected mean ± S.D. in intensity due to photon counting statistics was ∼30-0.5 (i.e. 20%) of the mean intensity (Fig. 1b, inset). The distribution of mean intensities measured for many different fluorophores (Fig. 1c) is much broader than expected from the noise content of an individual record (e.g. Fig. 1b indicates that the average intensities should be within 1 count). The large variation in individual intensities probably arises from the random orientation of the eGFP on the surface (because polarized light was used to excite fluorescence) and variations in its local environment. Histograms in which the distribution of lifetimes of individual fluorophores before photobleaching were plotted show that the rate of disappearance of fluorophores due to photobleaching was monoexponential (Fig. 1d) with a half-time that depended in a linear fashion on the illumination intensity (see Fig. 4) Imaging Single eGFP-PH123 Fluorophores in Live Cells— TIRFM was used to image eGFP-PH123 expressed in living cells at very low expression levels (<10 nm) (Fig. 2a). Individual spots of light were observed (Fig. 2b) that had the same statistical properties as control experiments made using purified eGFP bound to a glass surface via antibody (see “Experimental Procedures”). When the cells were continuously illuminated at high laser power, the average fluorescence of the whole cell decreased (Fig. 2c). The exponential time course of bulk photobleaching was similar to the average lifetime of the individual fluorescent spots (τ = 2.5 s in Fig. 2, d and e). The conclusion from this finding is that most of the observed fluorophores are probably being photobleached during the observation period. When the average illumination intensity was decreased so that the cells were illuminated for only 350 ms in any 5-s period, the overall fluorescence intensity of the cell then remained high for many hundreds of seconds (Fig. 3, a and d) and decreased by only 15% over the entire recording period (900 s). Under these conditions, fluorescent spots arrived and remained at the membrane for many seconds (Fig. 3, b and c), the average lifetime of the spots was now 14 s (Fig. 3e), and some lasted as long as hundreds of seconds. eGFP-PH123 that detached from the membrane before photobleaching diffused from the excitation field so rapidly (< 0.5 ms) that our camera system could not directly distinguish this from instantaneous photobleaching. Illumination power was varied systematically as before (using purified eGFP bound to an antibody-coated coverslip), and the average lifetime of the fluorophores before photobleaching was found to depend linearly upon illumination power. However, a plot of the rate constant derived for the disappearance of the spots ( koff' = inverse of the half-life) versus average laser power (Fig. 4) now showed a non-zero intercept. koff' should be the sum of two rate processes, photobleaching and detachment (kpb and kd, respectively). Photobleaching rate, kpb, will be proportional to illumination power, ξ, and assuming that these processes are irreversible, koff' = ξ × kpb + kd. Thus, at high average laser power, the dominant process will be ξ × kpb, whereas at low power (ξ ≈ 0), it will be kd. This analysis for eGFP-PH123 in living cells showed that at zero illumination, koff' = kd = 0.05 s-1 (Fig. 4). In contrast, eGFP molecules attached via antibodies to glass had an extremely slow detachment rate, kd and, therefore, koff' extrapolated to near zero at zero laser power (Fig. 4). Our analysis assumes a single exponential (i.e. simple Poisson) process for both photobleaching and unbinding. The error in estimating the mean lifetime depends upon: 1) the sampling statistics; 2) systematic noise; and 3) whether or not the underlying model is actually suitable and correct. In the figure legends, we give the R2 value to indicate the goodness-to-fit of the monoexponential model to the histogram bins. The R2 values indicate that a single exponential is an adequate description of our data. Because our sample size is ∼500 observations for most experiments, as a “rule-of-thumb,” the 95% confidence interval would be ∼10% of the mean as shown in Equation 1, 95%confidenceinterval=2S.D.=2μn(Eq. 1) where μ = mean lifetime, n = number of samples, and S.D. = mean ± standard deviation. The apparent binding rate of eGFP-PH123 at the plasma membrane was estimated by analyzing the “landing rate” (i.e. the distribution of dark intervals before a fluorescent spot appeared within a given area of membrane or sample quadrat). Landing rate depended in a linear way upon the observation window bin size (i.e. area of the sample quadrat). Best estimates of landing rate were obtained using a 5 × 5-μm2 quadrat. We found that the apparent binding rate, kon' of eGFP-PH123 at the plasma membrane was 0.28 × 10-3 μm-2 s-1 (Fig. 5). The apparent binding rate, kon' depends upon the concentration of free eGFP-PH123 in the cell, the density of binding sites (with the correct phosphoinositol moiety), and the concentration of any competing PH domains. The expression level of eGFP-PH123 was found to be ∼10 nm by comparing the fluorescence signal measured in the cytosol of cells to that of free eGFP in solution by confocal microscopy (9Mashanov G.I. Tacon D. Knight A.E. Peckham M. Molloy J.E. Methods. 2003; 29: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Using this estimate of the concentration of free eGFP-PH123, the apparent second order rate constant for binding, kb, is calculated as 0.028 μm-1 μm-2 s-1. Binding Kinetics for eGFP-PH12 and eGFP-PH3—The above experiments were repeated using the first two PH domains of myosin X (PH12) and the third domain (PH3) fused to eGFP to determine the relative contribution of each PH domain to the observed binding and release rates at the plasma membrane. Neither of these constructs bound as tightly as eGFP-PH123, and there was a higher proportion of free to bound material. At an illumination duty ratio of 0.07%, koff' was 0.14 s-1 for both eGFP-PH12 (n = 800) and eGFP-PH3 (n = 300). From the relationship, koff' = ξ × kpb + kd and kd is calculated as 0.12 s-1 (knowing that ξ × kpb at 7% power was 0.021 s-1). Lateral Movement of PH Domains Attached to the Plasma Membrane—We tracked the position of fluorophores bound at the plasma membrane by fitting the intensity distribution obtained from the sum of three adjacent (100 ms) frames to a three-dimensional Gaussian mask of variable amplitude and position but of fixed width. We found that the mean-squared deviation in position did not increase with time but instead remained close to the limit of our position detection (0.03 μm2). The root-mean-squared deviation (e.g. the amount of movement that one would perceive by eye) was only 170 nm, and video images of the fluorescent spots therefore appeared fixed in position when viewed by eye. For a freely diffusing particle, one would expect the mean-squared displacement in position to increase linearly with time, such that mean-squared displacement = 4tDlat, where t = time and Dlat = lateral diffusion coefficient (with units in μm2 s-1). The extremely limited movement of the PH domains found in these experiments appears to be a feature of the mouse myoblastic cell line with which we chose to work. In other experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cells, 2G. I. Mashanov and T. Carter, unpublished findings. we found that the same fluorescently tagged PH domains (i.e. using identical genetic construct and experimental conditions) diffused haphazardly over many micrometers during a typical observation period of 5–10 s. Isolated PH domains have been used previously to determine the cellular localization of lipids such as PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns-(4)P, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdIns(3,4)P2. Here, we have observed individual eGFP-PH123 molecules binding to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Steady-state observations of single fluorophores lead to estimates for both binding and unbinding of these PH domains inside the living cell. All three PH domains present in the tail of myosin X are required for tight binding to membrane. Using a time-lapse method to systematically adjust the laser excitation power, the separate rates of photobleaching and detachment or unbinding of eGFP-PH123 were measured. The off-rate and apparent on-rate for this binding process together with the rate of lateral movement were calculated from the single molecule data sets. From lipid blots, eGFP-PH123 is expected to bind to PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 at the plasma membrane. PtdIns(4,5)P2 predominates in unstimulated cells, whereas levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, which is produced by rapid bursts of synthesis from PtdIns(4,5)P2 in response to cell stimulation, are probably low in the serum-free conditions used here. Previous studies (17Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar, 18Pike L.J. Miller J.M. J. Biol.

Jalink K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3257-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is localized to discrete regions of the plasma membrane such as lipid rafts, membrane ruffles, and regions of the membrane associated with F-actin (e.g. focal adhesions) (21Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). For example, it has been suggested that PtdIns(4,5)P2 acts to restrict actin polymerization to the cortex and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 controls the region of cortex at which actin polymerizes (17Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). Although the TIRFM excitation method used here means that we were unable to observe activities in ruffles, which project above the cell and out of the region of the evanescent wave, the discrete spots that we did observe at the plasma membrane for eGFP-PH123 could potentially correspond to lipid rafts or anchorage sites for F-actin at focal adhesions. Measurements of the lateral movement of eGFP-PH123 bound to plasma membrane were surprising in that the fluorophores remained fixed (within the resolution of our measurements, e.g. root mean square = 170 nm) in position for the entire observation period. Previous measurements (22Fujiwara T. Ritchie K. Murakoshi H. Jacobson K. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 23Vrljic M. Nishimura S.Y.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) of the free diffusion of fluorescently labeled phospholipids range from 0.18 to 5.4 μm2 s-1. The lateral diffusion for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, measured using AKT fused to eGFP, was 0.5 μm2 s-1, although single molecules were not imaged in that study (24Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The restricted lateral movement observed in the present study might be explained by the binding of PH domains either directly or indirectly to the actin cytoskeleton through a second binding site. Alternatively, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phospholipids might be more diffusible than PtdIns(4,5)P2 or the lateral diffusion rates might have been overestimated in previous studies. The limited residency time (∼20 s) of eGFP-PH123 molecules at the cell membrane is similar to previous estimates (24Haugh J.M. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). This is probably important for dynamic rearrangement of the actin-based cytoskeleton during cell movement and during endocytic and exocytic events. PtdIns(4,5)P2 is linked to endocytic events, and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is linked to exocytosis, such that membrane ruffling results from insertion of vesicles from the endocytic pathway into the plasma membrane (25Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11198-11200Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Myosin X has been suggested to be important in intrafilopodial motility and phagocytosis (26Cox D. Berg J.S. Cammer M. Chinegwundoh J.O. Dale B.M. Cheney R.E. Greenberg S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The present TIRFM studies show that isolated domains bind tightly at the plasma membrane and probably target myosin X to this location in vivo. The work presented here, together with earlier studies, implies that the PH domains of myosin X probably act to recruit the motor to sites of actin polymerization at the cell cortex. The dissociation rate, kd = 0.05s-1, is appropriate for myosin X targeting to respond to changes in levels of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(4,5)P2 following cell stimulation. In earlier experiments not reported here, we worked with a full-length GFP-tagged myosin X construct that unfortunately contained two random (PCR) mutations within the myosin X motor domain. Confocal images of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells showed that this full-length molecule localized both to the plasma membrane and to macropinosomes, but did not localize to the tips of filopodia. This result indicates that a much larger molecule than the one used in the current study can still access and bind to membrane. Subsequently, we used the correctly sequenced full-length myosin X clone (the generous gift of Dr. R. E. Cheney, University of North Carolina) and found that in mouse myoblasts this molecule behaved exactly as reported for other cell lines (i.e. by localizing specifically to the tips of the filopodia). Although we know that the motor domain is able to move along actin filaments in the absence of its tail, it is probable that the tail and, in particular, the PH domains are responsible for targeting myosin X to filopodia (11Berg J.S. Cheney R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and may also be important for inducing formation of new filopodia. It is hoped that the both the experimental techniques and methods of data analysis presented here will be broadly applicable to other experimental systems. In the future, the possibility of labeling different PH domains with different colored fluorescent groups (or GFP family proteins) might enable the evolution of complex signaling pathways to be observed directly inside living cells."

Excessive advanced glycation end products (AGEs) as a result of hyperglycemia in tissues or in the circulation may critically affect the progression of diabetic nephropathy. In diabetic nephropathy, glomerulosclerosis is a typical pathologic feature characterized by the increase of the extracellular matrix (ECM). We have reported previously that α1 type IV collagen (Col4) is one of the major components of ECM, which is up-regulated by AGEs, and that the overexpression of Col4 is transcriptionally regulated by an unknown transcription factor binding to the promoter. Here we identified this protein as Smad1 by yeast one-hybrid screening. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and reporter assay, we observed that Smad1 directly regulated transcription for Col4 through the binding of Smad1 to the promoter of Col4. Smad1 was significantly induced along with Col4 in AGE-treated mesangial cells. Moreover, suppression of Smad1 by antisense morpholino resulted in a decrease of AGE-induced Col4 overproduction. To elucidate the interaction between transforming growth factor-β and Smad1, we investigated whether activin receptor-liked kinase1 (ALK1) was involved in this regulation. AGE stimulation significantly increased the expression of the ALK1 mRNA in mesangial cells. We also demonstrated that Smad1 and ALK1 were highly expressed in human diabetic nephropathy. These results suggest that the modulation of Smad1 expression is responsible for the initiation and progression of diabetic nephropathy and that blocking Smad1 signaling may be beneficial in preventing diabetic nephropathy and other various diabetic complications.

There is accumulating evidence that AGEs 1The abbreviations used are: AGE, advanced glycation end product; ALK1, activin receptor-liked kinase1; AS, antisense; BMP, bone morphogenetic protein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Col1, type I collagen; Col4, α1 type IV collagen; ECM, extracellular matrix; GBM, glomerular basement membrane; OPN, osteopontin; pSmad1, phosphorylated Smad1; TGF, transforming growth factor have a pathogenic role in the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. Excessive AGEs produced as the result of hyperglycemia are known to stimulate the production of the ECM and inhibits its degradation. AGEs have a wide range of chemical, cellular, and tissue effects through changes in charge, solubility, and conformation that characterize molecular senescence. AGEs induce a variety of cellular events in vascular cells and other cells, possibly through several functional AGE receptors, thereby modulating the disease processes (1The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Google Scholar, 2United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group Lancet. 1998; 352: 837-853Google Scholar, 3Vlassara H. Striker L.J. Teichberg S. Fuh H.

Kirstein M. Yamada Y. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2873-2877Google Scholar). AGEs have recently been accepted as having an important role, not only in diabetic complications but also in aging and old age-related diseases, including atherosclerosis (6Vlassara H. Fuh H. Makita Z. Krungkrai S. Cerami A. Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12043-12047Google Scholar, 7Huijberts M.S. Wolffenbuttel B.H. Boudier H.A. Crijns F.R. Kruseman A.C. Poitevin P. Levy B.I. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 1407-1411Google Scholar). Moreover, a truncated, soluble form of the receptor for AGEs was reported to suppress the development of accelerated diabetic atherosclerosis (8Park L. Raman K.G. Lee K.J. Lu Y. Ferran Jr., L.J. Chow W.S. Stern D. Schmidt A.M. Nat. Med. 1998; 9: 1025-1031Google Scholar). Exposure of cultured mesangial cells to AGEs results in a receptor-mediated up-regulation of mRNA and protein secretion of Col4 (5Doi T. Vlassara H. Kirstein M. Yamada Y. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2873-2877Google Scholar, 9Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1166-1172Google Scholar). However, there is little information regarding the mechanisms that underlie this regulation. It was recently shown that TGF-β plays an important role in the AGE response of the glomeruli (10Yang C.W. Vlassara H. Peten E.P. He C.J. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9436-9440Google Scholar). Transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-β develop severe glomerulosclerosis (11Sanderson N. Factor V. Nagy P. Kopp J. Kondaiah P. Wakefield L. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2572-2576Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-β is a central mediator of the sclerosing process in diabetic nephropathy. Members of the TGF-β superfamily bind to two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors, termed type I and type II receptors (12ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 139-145Google Scholar). Type II receptors activate type I receptors, and signals are mediated through the type I receptors. Ligand-specific Smads are direct substrates of type I receptor kinases. Thus, the specificity of the signals is determined by type I receptors. ALK1 is one of the type I receptor members for TGF-β family proteins and has been linked to the inherited multisystemic vascular disorder, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 (HHT2). Although ALK1 has been known as an orphan receptor, recent reports show that ALK1 transduces TGF-β signals via Smad1 (13Oh S.P. Seki T. Goss K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Kim S. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2626-2631Google Scholar, 14Chen Y.G. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3672-3677Google Scholar). Morphologically, the development of diabetic nephropathy is characterized by progressive thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) and, by expansion, of the mesangial ECM. During the process of glomerular injuries, mesangial cells can overproduce Col4 and secrete type I collagen (Col1) and osteopontin (OPN), which are not normally present in the mesangial matrix (15Floege J. Johnson R.J. Gordon K. Iida H. Pritzl P. Yoshimura A. Campbell C. Alpers C.E. Couser W.G. Kidney Int. 1991; 40: 477-488Google Scholar). In particular, Col4 is a major component of the thickened GBM and expanded ECM, but no molecules that directly regulate the Col4 expression have been found. The 130-bp bidirectional promoter of Col4 contains a large stem-loop structure (CIV), which has been shown to interact with several DNA-binding proteins (16Bruggeman L.A. Burbelo P.D. Yamada Y. Klotman P.E. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1497-1502Google Scholar). Using a gel mobility shift assay, we reported previously that an unknown protein binding to the CIV site directly regulates Col4 expression only when exposed to AGEs (9Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1166-1172Google Scholar). To identify the protein that binds to the CIV site in the promoter region of the mouse Col4 gene, we constructed a cDNA library from mouse mesangial cells treated with AGEs. In this study, we used a yeast one-hybrid system to isolate a clone that encodes a specific transcription factor from the library, and we identified the clone as the cDNA that encodes Smad1. Cell Culture—A glomerular mesangial cell line was established from glomeruli isolated from normal, 4-week-old mice (C57BL/6JxSJL/J) and was identified according to the method described previously (17Davies M. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 320-327Google Scholar). The mesangial cells were maintained in B medium (a 3:1 mixture of minimal essential medium/F12 modified with trace elements) supplemented with 1 mm glutamine, penicillin at 100 units/ml, streptomycin at 100 mg/ml, and 20% fetal calf serum. The cultured cells fulfilled the criteria generally accepted for glomerular mesangial cells previously (17Davies M. Kidney Int. 1994; 45: 320-327Google Scholar). AGE or bovine serum albumin (BSA) exposure was carried out as described previously (9Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1166-1172Google Scholar). Preparation of AGEs—AGE-BSA was prepared by incubating BSA in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm, pH 7.4) with 50 mm glucose 6-phosphate for 8 weeks at 37 °C as described previously (5Doi T. Vlassara H. Kirstein M. Yamada Y. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2873-2877Google Scholar). Unmodified BSA was incubated under the same conditions without glucose 6-phosphate as control. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method. All AGE-protein specific fluorescence intensities were measured at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. AGE-BSA and control BSA contained 61.3 and 8.31 units of AGE per milligram of protein, respectively. cDNA Library Construction and Yeast One-hybrid Screening—We prepared cDNA from mouse mesangial cells exposed to AGEs and inserted it into the pGAD10 vector. Yeast one-hybrid screening was carried out according to the MATCHMAKER one-hybrid protocol (Clontech). Briefly, tandem repeats of the 27-bp sequence (5′-TTCCTCCCCTTGGAGGAGCGCCGCCCG-3′; CIV-1) from the mouse type IV collagen gene were ligated into the yeast integration and reporter vector pHISi or pLacZi to generate pHISi-CIV-1 or pLacZi-CIV-1, respectively (18Burbelo P.D. Utani A. Pan Z.Q. Yamada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11543-11547Google Scholar). Each pHISi-CIV-1 and pLacZi-CIV-1 reporter construct was linearized and integrated into the genome of competent yeast YM4271, sequentially. The resulting yeast cells with the integrated pHISi-CIV-1 and pLacZi-CIV-1 were used for one-hybrid screening with the AGE-stimulated mouse mesangial cell library. Positive colonies were selected on synthetic dropout -His/-Leu plates with 45 mm 3-amino-1, 2, 4-triazole (3-AT). To exclude false positive clones, we performed a β-galactosidase filter lift assay according to manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Plasmids were rescued from selected blue yeast colonies and retransformed into E. coli DH5α. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described previously by Luo et al. (19Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Google Scholar). We used anti-Smad1 antibody, anti-Smad4 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or normal control IgG at 4 °C overnight. PCR was performed with primers to amplify the region containing the CIV-1 motif. The 5′-primer was 5′-GGAGCTCCCCAATTTGTTG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-CAGCCTCCGCCTCTTACC-3′. The resulting product was ∼100 bp by agarose gel electrophoresis. Reporter Assay—1.3 × 105 COS7 cells in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were seeded into 6-well plates. Eight hours later, the cells were transfected with 750 ng of CIV-1-LacZ reporter construct along with either 750 ng of vector encoding wild type Smad1 or the mock vector and 75 ng of CMV-LUC (Firefly luciferase under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter) as an internal control. Transfection was performed with FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours later, the cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer, and β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were then measured using the Luminescent β-galactosidase reporter system (BD Biosciences) and the luciferase reporter assay system from Promega. β-galactosidase results were normalized for luciferase activity. RNase Protection Assay—Total RNA was isolated from mesangial cells using the TRIsol reagent (Invitrogen), and an RNase protection assay was performed as described previously (20Abe H. Iehara N. Utsunomiya K. Kita T. Doi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20874-20878Google Scholar). Briefly, the RNA probes were prepared by linearizing the PvuII fragment of Col4 from p1234, the ApaI fragment of Col1 from pGM101, and the EcoRI fragment of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) from pMGAP1. In addition, mouse riboprobe for Smad1 (5′-GCAAGTTTTGCGATGTGAGA-3′ and 5′-GCATCTTCCAGAGTGAAGCC-3′), ALK1 (5′-GAGTGTGGCGGTCAAGATTT-3′ and 5′-GGAGCCGTGTTCATGGTAGT-3′), and osteopontin (5′-TGCACCCAGATCCTATAGCC-3′ and 5′-CCTCAGTCCATAAGCCAAGC-3′) were amplified by reverse transcription PCR. The PCR fragments were sequenced to confirm that they were the respective cDNAs and then were cloned into a pGEM-T plasmid. After digesting the plasmid with SacI, an antisense riboprobe was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. The RNA probes and the test RNA were hybridized overnight at 45 °C. RNase A (40 μg/ml) and RNase T1 (2 μg/ml) were added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. The RNase resistant fragments were analyzed by 5% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The protected bands for each RNA probe had the same size as the coding sequence for the specific mRNA, thus providing evidence for their specificity, and were evaluated by densitometric analysis. Western Blotting—Cultured mesangial cells were treated with AGEs or BSA for 72 h. Cells were harvested in sample buffer, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitro-cellulose membrane, subjected to Western blot using a 1:500 dilution of antibody for Smad1 and pSmad1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Invitrogen). Immunostaining of Cultured Cells—Cultured cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The antibodies used were anti-Smad1 antibody, 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-pSmad1, 1:100 (Calbiochem). An appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was used for visualization, and imaging was done using a confocal laser microscope and a fluorescent microscope (Olympus). Smad1 Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotide—The antisense oligonucleotide used was a 25-nucleotide morpholino oligo (Genetools LLC) with the base composition 5′-CAAGCTGGTCACATTCATAGCGGCT-3′. A standard morpholino oligo with the base composition 5′-CAtGCTcGTCACATTCAaAGCcGCT-3′ (points of mismatch are shown by small letters) was used as a control. Microinjection of in vitro transcribed RNA was performed as described previously (21Ahn D.G. Kourakis M.J. Rohde L.A. Silver L.M. Ho R.K. Nature. 2002; 417: 754-758Google Scholar). Histology—Histopathological studies were performed on human tissues. This study was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and we obtained approval from the institutional review board. All patients gave their informed written consent. Diabetic kidney specimens (n = 5) were obtained from renal biopsies. Control human tissue sections were obtained from normal renal cortex harvested from kidneys removed for renal malignancy. Tissues for analysis were sampled from the pole opposite the tumor. Cryopreserved kidney tissues were cut in 5-μm-thick sections and fixed in acetone for 5 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by a 20-min incubation in the dark with 1% H2O2 in methanol. To eliminate nonspecific staining, sections were incubated with the appropriate preimmune serum for 20 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with primary antibodies anti-Smad1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-ALK1 (R&D Systems) antibodies. Smad1 Is Identified as a Binding Protein to Col4—To identify the protein binds to the CIV site in the promoter region of the mouse Col4 gene, we constructed a cDNA library from mouse mesangial cells treated with AGEs. We then used a yeast one-hybrid system to isolate a clone that encodes a specific transcription factor from the library. We identified this clone as the cDNA that encodes Smad1. Smad1 is well known for transducing the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signal (22Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar) and is essentially important in the development of kidney (23Roelen B.A. van Rooijen M.A. Mummery C.L. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 418-430Google Scholar). However, the expression of Smad1 is not detected in glomeruli in adult mouse (24Huang S. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Gene. 2000; 258: 43-53Google Scholar). To confirm the binding of Smad1 to the Col4 promoter in vivo, we performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Precipitated DNA was purified, and the promoter of the Col4 gene was detected by PCR. The anti-Smad1 antibody precipitated chromatin containing the CIV-1 site from cells stimulated with AGEs (Fig. 1). In contrast, considerably less binding was observed in BSA-exposed cells. We also detected Smad4 on the CIV-1 site (Fig. 1). These observations suggest that Smad1 and Smad4 can target the CIV motif in mesangial cells, especially when exposed to AGEs. Smad1 Transcriptionally Regulates Col4 Expression—Next, we examined the transcriptional activity of the Col4 gene by a reporter assay. We constructed a vector by fusing the CIV-1 promoter in front of the LacZ reporter and then cotransfected with a wild-type Smad1 vector in COS7 cells. First, we confirmed the expression of Smad1 by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2a). Phosphorylated Smad1 (pSmad1) was detected in cell lysates that had been tranfected with wild-type Smad1 vector. Cotransfection of the wild-type Smad1 resulted in an 18-fold increase in a relative β-galactosidase activity of Col4 compared with that of the vector alone (Fig. 2b, mock). The CIV-1 promoter has a GC-rich sequence in its 3′ end, which has been identified as a binding site for Smad1 (25Kusanagi K. Inoue H. Ishidou Y. Mishima H.K. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 555-565Google Scholar). We then constructed two mutant reporter plasmids, the deletion mutant of GC rich in CIV-1 (5′-TTCCTCCCCTTGGAGGA-3′; Mut1) and the trinucleotide substitution mutant of GC rich motif in CIV-1 (5′-TTCCTCCCCTTGGAGGAGCaCtGtCCG-3′; Mut2) (points of mutation are shown by small, underlined letters). The promoter activities of Mut1 and Mut2 were reduced to 4.9- and 4.3-fold increase, respectively (data not shown). β-galactosidase activity was normalized to luciferase activity and standardized as fold changes relative to cells cotransfected with the mock vector. In contrast, mock had no effect on the β-galactosidase activity in cotransfected cells. These results suggest that Smad1 is significantly involved in the induction of Col4 gene transcription. Activation and Translocation of Smad1 under AGE Exposure—To determine whether Smad1 is transcriptionally up-regulated by AGEs, we examined the expression of Smad1 in mesangial cells with or without AGEs stimulation. The levels of Smad1 mRNA were proportionally increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the levels of Col4 mRNA increased in parallel with the up-regulation of Smad1 transcripts. After BSA treatment, however, no change in the mRNA expression of Smad1 or Col4 was detected. Smad1 is well known to be phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus, where it participates in the transcriptional regulation of target genes (22Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 26Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the issue of whether the phosphorylation and translocation of Smad1 is affected by AGE treatment in mesangial cells (Fig. 3b). Consistent with the RNase protection assay, Smad1 and pSmad1 were distributed throughout mesangial cells with a preferential cytoplasmic localization after a 72 h-incubation in the presence of AGEs. Furthermore, the nuclear accumulation of Smad1 and pSmad1 in response to AGEs was observed in the cells 120 h after AGE stimulation, whereas BSA treatment led to little expression of Smad1 and pSmad1. The cells were counterstained with DAPI, and the nuclei were identified (data not shown). Similarly, both the Smad1 and pSmad1 proteins were detected in extracts from AGE-treated, but not BSA-treated, cells (Fig. 3c). These findings indicate that the regulation of Col4 is correlated with the expression of Smad1 under AGE exposure. The Blocking of Smad1 Attenuates ECM Protein Overproduction—To examine the importance of the Smad1 signaling pathway for the AGE-induced overexpression of Col4, we selectively inhibited this pathway by the antisense (AS) gene. The AGE-mediated induction of Smad1 was completely abolished in the presence of AS, but not in the presence of control oligos (4-mismatch) (Fig. 4, a and b). The overexpression of Col4 was strongly attenuated, consistent with the inhibition of Smad1. Similarly, both Col1 and OPN mRNA levels were significantly decreased (Fig. 4c). Smad1 mismatch morpholino oligos (control) had no effect on the expression of these genes. These data indicate that Smad1 plays a critical role in the control of Col4 expression. Smad1 and ALK1 Expression in Diabetic Conditions—To further elucidate the mechanism of Smad1 expression after AGE treatment, we investigated the expression of ALK1 in mesangial cells. ALK1 is a type I receptor for TGF-β family proteins and, specifically, phosphorylates Smad1 and Smad5. We were able to detect the significant increase in ALK1 mRNA expression in AGE-treated mesangial cells using an RNase protection assay (Fig. 5). In addition, at 10 μg/ml the TGF-β-neutralizing antibody significantly attenuated the up-regulated mRNA levels of ALK1 and Smad1 under AGE stimulation (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined whether high glucose exposure affected the expression of ALK1, Smad1, or Col4. In this condition, mRNA levels of these genes were increased, but they were weak and transient, compared with AGEs exposure (data not shown). Finally, we investigated the glomerular expression of Smad1 and ALK1 in human diabetic nephropathy. We carried out indirect immunohistochemistry on renal biopsies (diabetic nephropathy) and on normal kidney tissue. Glomerular immunoreactivity for Smad1 and ALK1 was correlated with the severity of sclerotic lesions in diabetic renal glomeruli; the immunoreactive signal was nearly absent in normal glomeruli (Fig. 6). These histological observations suggest that the ALK1/Smad1 signaling pathway is linked to the ECM expansion. Changes in GBM structure occur very earlier in diabetic nephropathy, even before microalbuminuria is apparent. Although Col4 is the principal component of the GBM, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of Col4 in diabetic conditions are, as yet, poorly understood. We have reported previously that an unknown protein binds to the Col4 promoter under AGE exposure (9Iehara N. Takeoka H. Yamada Y. Kita T. Doi T. Kidney Int. 1996; 50: 1166-1172Google Scholar). Here, we identified the protein as Smad1 using a yeast one-hybrid system. It is generally acknowledged that Smad1 transduces BMP signals, inducing formation of bone and cartilage (22Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar). Moreover, signaling by Smad1 is modulated by various other proteins such as signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) (27Nakashima K. Yanagisawa M. Arakawa H. Kimura N. Hisatsune T. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Taga T. Science. 1999; 284: 479-482Google Scholar) and Smurf1 (28Zhu H. Kavsak P. Abdollah S. Wrana J.L. Thomsen G.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 687-693Google Scholar), allowing the TGF-β superfamily ligands to elicit diverse effects on target cells. Recently, mesangial cells have been shown to produce TGF-β when exposed to AGEs (29Throckmorton D.C. Brogden A.P. Min B. Rasmussen H. Kashgarian M. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 111-117Google Scholar). We observed that chronic exposure of AGEs, inducing the sustained increase in Smad1 gene activation and expression, leads to Col4 overproduction, suggesting that Smad1 is a critical modulator in diabetic conditions. Targeted gene disruption of the Smad1 gene in mice results in embryonic lethality, suggesting that Smad1 plays critical roles in early embryogenesis (30Tremblay K.D. Dunn N.R. Robertson E.J. Development. 2001; 128: 3609-3621Google Scholar). However, because of the early embryonic lethality, not much is known about the role of Smad1 in vivo, particularly in the adult. A recent study has shown that Smad1 is absent in renal glomeruli in normal adult mouse (24Huang S. Flanders K.C. Roberts A.B. Gene. 2000; 258: 43-53Google Scholar). We show for the first time that AGEs induce the expression of Smad1 in adult mouse glomeruli. Therefore, Smad1 may be the earliest indicator of renal dysfunction. Development of diabetic kidney disease in diabetic patients is a huge clinical problem associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is also clear that the current therapy, optimal glycemic control, can slow (1The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 977-986Google Scholar, 2United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group Lancet. 1998; 352: 837-853Google Scholar) but not prevent the development or progression of diabetic nephropathy in most patients. Previous studies have shown that TGF-β is a key mediator of ECM accumulation in experimental and human kidney disease, leading to progressive glomerular scarring and renal failure (10Yang C.W. Vlassara H. Peten E.P. He C.J. Striker G.E. Striker L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9436-9440Google Scholar, 11Sanderson N. Factor V. Nagy P. Kopp J. Kondaiah P. Wakefield L. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Thorgeirsson S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2572-2576Google Scholar). Therapeutic approaches to down-regulate TGF-β signaling under diabetic conditions provide one strategy for inhibiting the progression of diabetic nephropathy. For example, the use of the endogenous proteoglycan decorin (natural inhibitor of TGF-β) (31Isaka Y. Brees D.K. Ikegaya K. Kaneda Y. Imai E. Noble N.A. Border W.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 418-423Google Scholar) and the use of a neutralizing TGF-β antibody (32Chen S. Carmen I glesias-de la Cruz M. Jim B. Hong S.W. Isono M. Ziyadeh F.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 16-22Google Scholar) have been shown to prevent the development of diabetic glomerulosclerosis. However, prolonged inhibition of TGF-β may lead to unwanted adverse effects, because TGF-β has anti-proliferative effect in some cancers and, in one report, Smad3-deficient animals found metastatic colon tumors (33Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L.F. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibitors for specific responses of TGF-β will lead to a novel therapeutic approach. We have demonstrated here that the morpholic antisense oligo specific for Smad1 strongly attenuated the overproduction of Col4 induced by AGEs. Similarly, Col1 and OPN mRNA expressions were partially inhibited. It is reported that Smad1 dissociates the repressor Hoxc-8 from the OPN promoter, thereby inducing OPN transcription (34Shi X. Yang X. Chen D. Chang Z. Cao X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13711-13717Google Scholar). Thus, Smad1 may be a novel therapeutic target in diabetic complications and be useful in combination with the current therapy. TGF-β evokes its biological effects by signaling through two different types of serine/threonine kinase receptors. Type II receptor activates type I receptors, which transduce various signals via the Smads (22Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 26Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar). Recent reports demonstrated that ALK1 has been thought of as a BMP signal transducer, mediating signals from TGF-β via Smad1 (13Oh S.P. Seki T. Goss K.A. Imamura T. Yi Y. Donahoe P.K. Li L. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Kim S. Li E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2626-2631Google Scholar, 14Chen Y.G. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3672-3677Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the expression of ALK1 in mouse mesangial cells and human kidney tissues. We have also shown that ALK1 and Smad1 are expressed in renal glomeruli, corresponding to the progression of diabetic conditions. These results lead not only to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the initiation and progression of diabetic conditions but also to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diabetic complications in various organs by suppressing the pathologically activated production of collagen. Both Smad1 and ALK1 are nearly absent in normal mesangial cells. In this study, we first demonstrated that ALK1 as well as Smad1 participate in the development of diabetic change in kidney, suggesting that ALK1 acts upstream of the excessive production of Col4. AGEs are known to induce a variety of cellular events in vascular cells and other cells, possibly through the functional several AGEs receptors, thereby modulating the disease processes. AGEs have been recently accepted as having an important role, not only in diabetic complications but also in aging and old age-related diseases, including atherosclerosis (6Vlassara H. Fuh H.

Col4 is also a major component of the vascular basement membrane that lies beneath the endothelium, surrounds medial smooth muscle cells, and undergoes significant nonenzymatic glycosylation (glycation). Glycation leads ultimately to increased cross-linking of collagen, resulting in increased arterial stiffness (35Chappey O. Dosquet C. Wautier M.P. Wautier J.L. Eur. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 27: 97-108Google Scholar). We report here that AGE-induced Col4 overproduction is mediated by Smad1 signaling. Recent reports show that Smad1 is expressed in endothelial cells of some blood vessels and is at the site of vasculogenesis in the developing yolk sac during blood island formation (36Dick A. Risau W. Drexler H. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 211: 293-305Google Scholar). Furthermore, ALK1 is highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells (22Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 37Attisano L. Carcamo J. Ventura F. Weis F.M. Massague J. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 671-680Google Scholar) and may be essential for vascular maturation and stabilization (38Urness L.D. Sorensen L.K. Li D.Y. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 328-331Google Scholar, 39Larsson J.

Inactivating mutations of ALK1 result in human hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2, also known as Osler-Rendu-Weber syndrome (40Johnson D.W. Berg J.N. Baldwin M.A. Gallione C.J. Marondel I.

In addition, recent evidence indicates that Smad1 transcriptionally regulates the osteopontin gene (33Zhu Y. Richardson J.A. Parada L.F. Graff J.M. Cell. 1998; 94: 703-714Google Scholar), which is a key factor of the progression of renal injuries and atherosclerosis. Accordingly, we speculate that the ALK1/Smad1 signaling may mediate the development of atherosclerosis, both in diabetic patients and in the aged, by inducing an overproduction of ECM. Because diabetic renal disease in the human is a process that occurs slowly over many years, it is likely that a very detailed evaluation of this phenomenon will be required to determine the interaction of Smad1 and ALK1 in this condition. Further work is in progress to clarify the role of ALK1/Smad1 in diabetic kidney using animal models. We thank Dr. K. Miyazono (The University of Tokyo, Japan) for providing a plasmid encoding Smad1 and Dr. Y. Takishita (Tokushima Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan) for his assistance with histological analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2000370813,"The hypoxia-inducible factor α subunits 1 and 2 (HIF-1α and HIF-2α) are subjected to oxygen-dependent asparaginyl hydroxylation, a modification that represses the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) at normoxia by preventing recruitment of the p300/cAMP-response element-binding protein coactivators. This hydroxylation is performed by the novel asparaginyl hydroxylase, factor-inhibiting HIF-1′ (FIH-1), of which HIF-1α and HIF-2α are the only reported substrates. Here we investigated the substrate requirements of FIH-1 by characterizing its subcellular localization and by examining amino acids within the HIF-1α substrate for their importance in recognition and catalysis by FIH-1. Using immunohistochemistry, we showed that both endogenous and transfected FIH-1 are primarily confined to the cytoplasm and remain there under normoxia and following treatment with the hypoxia mimetic, dipyridyl. Individual alanine mutations of seven conserved amino acids flanking the hydroxylated asparagine in HIF-1α revealed the importance of the valine (Val-802) adjacent to the targeted asparagine. The HIF-1α CAD V802A mutant exhibited a 4-fold lower Vmax in enzyme assays, whereas all other mutants were hydroxylated as efficiently as the wild type HIF-1α CAD. Furthermore, in cell-based assays the transcriptional activity of V802A was constitutive, suggesting negligible normoxic hydroxylation in HEK293T cells, whereas the wild type and other mutants were repressed under normoxia. Molecular modeling of the HIF-1α CAD V802A in complex with FIH-1 predicted an alteration in asparagine positioning compared with the wild type HIF-1α CAD, providing an explanation for the impaired catalysis observed and confirming the importance of Val-802 in asparaginyl hydroxylation by FIH-1."
https://openalex.org/W1977392771,"Huntingtin-interacting protein 1-related (HIP1r) is the only known mammalian relative of huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1), a protein that transforms fibroblasts via undefined mechanisms. Here we demonstrate that both HIP1r and HIP1 bind inositol lipids via their epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domains. In contrast to other ENTH domain-containing proteins, lipid binding is preferential to the 3-phosphate-containing inositol lipids, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate. Furthermore, the HIP1r ENTH domain, like that of HIP1, is necessary for lipid binding, and expression of an ENTH domain-deletion mutant, HIP1r/ΔE, induces apoptosis. Consistent with the ability of HIP1r and HIP1 to affect cell survival, full-length HIP1 and HIP1r stabilize pools of growth factor receptors by prolonging their half-life following ligand-induced endocytosis. Although HIP1r and HIP1 display only a partially overlapping pattern of protein interactions, these data suggest that both proteins share a functional homology by binding 3-phosphorylated inositol lipids and stabilizing receptor tyrosine kinases in a fashion that may contribute to their ability to alter cell growth and survival.

Muramatsu M. Sugano S. Suzuki Y. Nakagawara A. Ohhira M. Hayashi A. Hori T. Saito T. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 268-271Google Scholar), a protein that transforms fibroblasts via undefined mechanisms (2Rao D.S. Bradley S.V. Kumar P.D. Hyun T.S. Saint-Dic D. Oravecz-Wilson K. Kleer C.G. Ross T.S. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 471-482Google Scholar). HIP1 is also part of a t(5;7) chromosomal translocation that results in expression of an oncogenic HIP1/PDGFβR fusion protein that causes myelomonocytic leukemia (3Ross T.S. Bernard O.A. Berger R. Gilliland D.G. Blood. 1998; 91: 4419-4426Google Scholar). Furthermore, HIP1 is overexpressed in multiple primary epithelial tumors, and overexpression in prostate tumors predicts progression of prostate cancer (4Rao D.S. Hyun T.S. Kumar P.D. Mizukami I.F. Rubin M.A. Lucas P.C. Sanda M.G. Ross T.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 351-360Google Scholar). The transformation of fibroblasts by HIP1 is associated with altered levels of growth factor receptors (2Rao D.S. Bradley S.V. Kumar P.D. Hyun T.S. Saint-Dic D. Oravecz-Wilson K. Kleer C.G. Ross T.S. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 471-482Google Scholar). The mechanism by which HIP1 overexpression alters growth factor receptor levels may be a result of its role in trafficking of growth factor receptors. HIP1 and HIP1r each contain a clathrin light chain-binding coiled-coil region (5Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19897-19904Google Scholar), a leucine zipper, and a C-terminal TALIN homology domain. TALIN is a protein that binds actin and is involved in cell-substratum interactions (6Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Google Scholar). In addition, HIP1 and HIP1r contain epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domains. This domain in epsin and AP180 predominantly binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2) and is important in regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis (7Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Google Scholar, 8Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Google Scholar). HIP1 and HIP1r both have a punctate immunolocalization and co-localize partially with clathrin, AP-2, and endocytosed transferrin (9Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Warren R.A. Kessels M.M. Keen J.H.

Agostinelli N.R. Brett T.J. Mizukami I. Ross T.S. Traub L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46230-46236Google Scholar). Thus, structural and functional data suggest that HIP1 and HIP1r are involved in vesicle trafficking either at the plasma membrane, during sorting of vesicles, or at the trans-Golgi network. Unlike HIP1, HIP1r has lower affinity for clathrin, does not bind α-adaptin (5Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L. Chopra V. Philie J. Hayden M.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19897-19904Google Scholar), does not bind huntingtin directly, and does bind actin via its TALIN homology domain (9Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Warren R.A. Kessels M.M. Keen J.H. Heuser J. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1209-1223Google Scholar). HIP1 homologues have been found in yeast (14Holtzman D.A. Yang S. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 635-644Google Scholar) and Caenorhabditis elegans (15Engqvist-Goldstein A.E. Kessels M.M. Chopra V.S. Hayden M.R. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1503-1518Google Scholar). Sla2p, the yeast homologue of HIP1 and HIP1r, is required for endocytosis, polarization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton, and growth (14Holtzman D.A. Yang S. Drubin D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 635-644Google Scholar). We are interested in gaining a better understanding of what activities HIP1 and HIP1r might perform to affect tumorigenesis. Although the weight of evidence suggests that HIP proteins function in endocytosis, it is unclear how HIP1 and HIP1r might use clathrin-mediated trafficking to alter survival or growth of cells. One hypothesis suggested by our studies of HIP1 and transformation is that altered HIP1 expression may be a way to regulate growth factor receptor density and signaling and, as a result, affect cellular growth, death, and differentiation of cells (2Rao D.S. Bradley S.V. Kumar P.D. Hyun T.S. Saint-Dic D. Oravecz-Wilson K. Kleer C.G. Ross T.S. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 471-482Google Scholar). Along this line, one mechanism by which transformed cells escape the requirement for growth factors is to increase the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways (16Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Google Scholar, 17Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Fleming T.P. Hazan R. Ullrich A. King C.R. Schlessinger J. Aaronson S.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 1063-1070Google Scholar). Cells may compensate for decreased amounts of growth factors in the environment by elevating growth factor receptor levels. Another hypothesis derived from previous work studying ENTH domains (7Itoh T. Koshiba S. Kigawa T. Kikuchi A. Yokoyama S. Takenawa T. Science. 2001; 291: 1047-1051Google Scholar, 8Ford M.G. Pearse B.M. Higgins M.K. Vallis Y. Owen D.J. Gibson A. Hopkins C.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2001; 291: 1051-1055Google Scholar) is that the ENTH domains of HIP1 and HIP1r may be involved in regulating their roles in growth factor receptor endocytosis and thereby could be critical in their ability to promote cell growth or survival. To test if there is a link between HIP expression, growth factor receptor signaling, and the role of the ENTH domains, we describe the generation of HIP1r constructs analogous to those generated previously for HIP1 (4Rao D.S. Hyun T.S. Kumar P.D. Mizukami I.F. Rubin M.A. Lucas P.C. Sanda M.G. Ross T.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 351-360Google Scholar). These mutants lack each of the HIP1/HIP1r shared domains, and their effects on cell survival and growth factor receptor signaling were tested. Full-length HIP1r had no transient effects on cell survival, but expression of a mutant lacking the ENTH domain, HIP1r/ΔE, led to apoptosis when transfected into cells. In addition, the lipid binding characteristics mediated by the ENTH domains of both HIP1 and HIP1r were analyzed. To our surprise we found that, in contrast to other ENTH domain-containing proteins which bind PtdIns(4,5)P2, HIP1 and HIP1r bound preferentially to 3-phosphoinositides. We also found that overexpression of HIP1 and HIP1r inhibited the degradation of ligand-stimulated growth factor receptors. Consistent with the results obtained using stable HIP1-transformed fibroblasts (2Rao D.S. Bradley S.V. Kumar P.D. Hyun T.S. Saint-Dic D. Oravecz-Wilson K. Kleer C.G. Ross T.S. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 471-482Google Scholar), transient transfection of either HIP1 or HIP1r into 293T cells stabilized pools of either EGFR or PDGFβR following ligand-induced endocytosis. In contrast, transfection of the HIP1 and HIP1r mutants lacking the ENTH domains did not stabilize growth factor receptors. By using a dynamin dominant negative mutant, rate-limiting activities of HIP1 and HIP1r were placed downstream of dynamin. In light of these data, we propose that both HIP1r and HIP1 may stabilize growth factor receptor levels via altered intracellular trafficking. The finding that HIP proteins can function downstream of dynamin together with the fact that the inositol lipids that bind the HIP ENTH domains are concentrated on intracellular vesicular membranes suggest that the HIP proteins modulate the intracellular trafficking of receptors. This is in addition to a role described previously in clathrin vesicle formation at the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that the HIP proteins are either not rate-limiting in the kinetics of the internalization phase of endocytosis or under certain cellular conditions do not participate in the receptor uptake phase of the clathrin trafficking pathway. HIP1r Constructs—Full-length human HIP1r (NCBI accession number KIAA0655, amino acids 1-1069) was retrieved from a fetal cDNA library by PCR and cloned into the mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-HIP1r) or pcDNA3.1-mycHis (pcDNA3.1-HIP1r) (Invitrogen). Deletion constructs were made with a combination of PCR and restriction digests using standard methods. For pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/TH, the TALIN homology region of HIP1r was generated by PCR and cloned into pcDNA3.1-mycHis by PCR. Primers 5′-ACC AGC AGG GAATTC GGA ACA TGG AGG CCA GCC-3′ (underlined sequence denotes engineered EcoRI site) and 5′-GCT GGA CCC CTG GGG GAAGCTTTA GTT CAC GA-3′ (underlined sequence denotes engineered HindIII site) were used. PCR was performed with full-length HIP1r as template using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). PCR products and the pcDNA3.1 vector were digested with EcoRI and HindIII, ligated together, and confirmed by automated sequencing. Human HIP1r contains a BamHI restriction site at base pair position 2513 (Fig. 1A). pcDNA3-HIP1r was digested with EcoRI and BamHI to release the 5′ portion of HIP1r and inserted into EcoRI and BamHI digested pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/TH to generate pcDNA3.1-HIP1r. pcDNA3-HIP1r has an EcoRI site in the multicloning site and an internal BamHI in the HIP1r insert. The EcoRI- and BamHI-digested fragment was inserted into the EcoRI and BamHI sites in the pcDNA3.1 vector to generate pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/ΔTH. To generate pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/ΔE, pGEX-HIP1r/ΔE (see below) was digested with EcoRI and BamHI. This fragment was ligated into the EcoRI- and BamHI-digested portion of pcDNA3.1-HIP1r (containing the vector and the 3′ end of HIP1r). To generate pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/ΔEΔT, the EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pGEX-HIP1r/ΔE was ligated into EcoRI- and BamHI-digested pcDNA3.1. Human HIP1r contains three internal KspI restriction sites (Fig. 1A). To generate pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/Δ153, pcDNA3.1-HIP1r was digested with KspI and the 5′ and 3′ ends ligated together to produce a construct whose product lacks amino acids 153-632 of HIP1r. pGEX-HIP1r was prepared by ligation of an EcoRI-XhoI fragment from the pcDNA3-HIP1r construct, containing human FL-HIP1r, into EcoRI- + XhoI-digested pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences). To create pGEX-HIP1r/ΔE, pGEX-4T-3 was digested first with SmaI. A plasmid containing the HIP1r coding sequences (designated pKIAA0655 and kindly provided by the Kazusa DNA Research Institute) was then digested with HindIII and BamHI to release a 1.9-kb sequence that encoded nucleotides 610-2513. This fragment was blunted with Klenow and then ligated with the SmaI-digested pGEX-4T-3. The latter plasmid, pGEX/HIP1r/nt610-2513, was digested with XhoI, filled in with Klenow, and then digested with SalI. The vector sequences plus the 5′ HIP1r sequences starting at bp 610 (up to the SalI site) were ligated with a 1.1-kb SalI-SspI fragment (HIP1r bp 2500-3541) also derived from pKIAA0655. The resultant construct pGEX/HIP1r/ΔE was confirmed at its junctions by automated sequencing. To create pGEX-HIP1r/ENTH, a PCR product encompassing the first 450 bp of human HIP1r with engineered XhoI and NotI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was generated. The PCR product and the pGEX-4T3 vector were digested with XhoI and NotI and ligated together. Constructs were confirmed by automated sequencing. For construction of PGEX-HIP1r/LZ, a 323-bp PCR product encompassing bp 1437-1760 of human HIP1r was generated with engineered EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The digested PCR product was cloned into EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pGEX-4T3 and confirmed by sequencing. pGEX HIP1r constructs were transfected into BL21 bacteria, and proteins were isolated by bacterial GST fusion protein purification using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following purification, the protein samples were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated. When used to make antibodies, the GST portion was cleaved off with thrombin. pcDNA3.1(-)/dynamin1-K44A-HA was the kind gift of Dr. Sandra Schmid (University of California, San Diego). pcDNA3.1(+)/IRES-GFP was the kind gift of Dr. Kathleen Collins (University of Michigan). Mutant dynamin1 was subcloned into the IRES-GFP vector utilizing BamHI sites flanking the entire insert. Full-length HIP1 and HIP1/ΔE were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+)/IRES-GFP vector from the pcDNA3 constructs described previously (4Rao D.S. Hyun T.S. Kumar P.D. Mizukami I.F. Rubin M.A. Lucas P.C. Sanda M.G. Ross T.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 351-360Google Scholar). HIP1r Antibodies—The polyclonal anti-HIP1r antibody UM 359 was generated using pGEX-HIP1r/ΔE as the antigen (Cocalico Biologicals, Inc., Reamstown, PA). pGEX-HIP1r/TH was used as the antigen for polyclonal antibody UM 374. The monoclonal antibodies 1E1, 1E5, and 1C5 were made by the University of Michigan Hybridoma Core Facility using pGEX-HIP1r/TH or pGEX-HIP1r/LZ as the antigen. All antibodies were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—293T cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 2.5 μg of the various HIP1 or HIP1r constructs using 90 μl of Superfect transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's directions. Cells were harvested 48 h later and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitations, 2-3.5 mg of protein were mixed with 20 μl of the polyclonal HIP1r antibody UM359 and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Fifty microliters of protein G-Sepharose beads (50% slurry) were added, and the mixture was rotated at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were pelleted, washed 3-6 times in lysis buffer, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. One-tenth of the supernatants and the entire pellet from the immunoprecipitations were run on SDS-PAGE gels. Samples were run on 6-8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 5% milk/TBST and incubated at 4 °C overnight with anti-clathrin (TD.1, 1:200), anti-adaptin γ (BD Transduction Laboratories, clone 88, 1:1000), or anti-adaptin α (Sigma, clone 100/2, 1:500), and signals were detected using ECL. Membranes were then overblotted with the HIP1r antibodies 1E1 + 1E5 (1:20 dilution of tissue culture supernatant) or UM359 (1:2000 dilution of serum). Lipid Binding—PIP arrays were obtained from Echelon. Lipid binding was done following the manufacturer's protocol by using 12.5 μg of isolated protein in TBST at 4 °C overnight. HIP1r mutants were detected using a mixture of the monoclonal 1E1 and 1C5 antibodies at 1:5000 in TBST. Anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at 1:5000 in TBST, 3% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. Liposomes contained 40% phosphatidylethanolamine, 40% phosphatidylcholine, 10% phosphatidylserine, and 10% of one of the following: phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidic acid, PtdIns(3)P, PtdIns(4)P, PtdIns(5)P, PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(3,5)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdIns(3,4,5)P3. The mixture was resuspended in 1:1 chloroform/methanol containing 0.1% HCl, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Resuspended lipids were sonicated in a bath sonicator (45 °C) until a clear suspension was formed. Liposomes were collected by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in ice-cold cytosol buffer (0.2 m sucrose, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 2 mg/ml of total lipid. 100 μg of liposomes were mixed with isolated protein at 4 °C for 1 h and precipitated for 5 min at 16,000 × g. Pellets and one-fifth of the supernatants were run on 7% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and analyzed by Western blotting for HIP1 or HIP1r. Time Course of HIP1r Construct Expression—293T cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with 2.5 μg of the various pcDNA3.1-HIP1r constructs using Superfect transfection reagent. Cells were collected into lysis buffer at 1, 2, 4, and 7 days post-transfection. Fifty μg of protein was run on 10 or 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blotted with anti-HIP1r polyclonal antibody (UM 359, 1:5000) and signals detected by ECL. Apoptosis Assays—COS 7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-HIP1r, pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/ΔE, or pcDNA3-HIP1/ΔE and fixed with 3% formaldehyde at 24 and 48 h post-transfection. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% milk for 20 min, followed by staining with DAPI and anti-HIP1 monoclonal antibody 4B10 or anti-HIP1r monoclonal antibody 1C5. Bound antibodies were visualized with anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Vector Laboratories). Cells expressing the HIP constructs were scored for apoptosis by nuclear morphology. At least 100 cells were counted for each sample, and transfections were performed in triplicate. Growth Factor Transfection and Stimulation—For the EGFR stabilization experiments, 293T cells were grown to 50-60% confluency in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 5 μg of pRK5-EGFR (kindly provided by the molecular signaling group at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research) and 5 μg of either the various pcDNA3.1-HIP1r constructs or pcDNA3-HIP1 using Superfect transfection reagent. One day later, cells were starved for 20-24 h, treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 30 min, and stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) in the presence of cycloheximide. Samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h after stimulation. Fifteen micrograms of protein were run on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blotted with anti-phospho-EGFR (Cell Signaling, Tyr-845, 1:5000), anti-EGFR (Cell Signaling, 1:2000), anti-HIP1r (1C5 or UM374, 1:2000), or anti-HIP1 (4B10, 1:2000) and signals detected by SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Experiments with dominant negative caspase 9 also included 5 μg of pcDNA3-DNC9 (gift of Dr. Gabriel Nunez) or vector in the transfection. Dominant negative caspase 9 was detected using anti-caspase 9 antibody (Cayman Chemical Co., 1:1000). For PDGFβR experiments, 5 μg of SRα-PDGFβR (18Ross T.S. Gilliland D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22328-22336Google Scholar) were transfected with either vector, pcDNA3.1-HIP1r, pcDNA3.1-HIP1r/ΔE, pcDNA3-HIP1, or pcDNA3-HIP1/ΔE. Cells were starved, stimulated, and harvested as described. PDGFβR expression was detected using polyclonal anti-PDGFβR antibody (BD Pharmingen, 1:1000). Immunofluorescence—COS 7 cells were plated onto coverslips and transfected with pRK5-EGFR and either vector, pcDNA3.1-mycHis/HIP1, pcDNA3.1-HA/HIP1r, or pcDNA3.1-HA/DynaK44A using Superfect. The cells were starved the next day for 20 h, treated for 30 min with cycloheximide (Sigma; 100 μg/ml) at 37 °C, and stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 0 or 30 min. For each time point, cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde, permeabilized with Triton X-100, and blocked with 5% milk/PBST. The primary antibodies used were anti-EGFR polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco), and anti-EEA1 antibody (Cell Signaling). FITC anti-rabbit and Texas Red anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories) were the secondary antibodies used. Images were obtained with a Zeiss confocal microscope. For localization of HIP1 and HIP1r, COS 7 cells were plated onto coverslips, transfected with pcDNA3-HIP1 and pcDNA3.1-HIP1r, and fixed with 3% formaldehyde at 24 h post-transfection. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% milk for 20 min, followed by staining with anti-HIP1 monoclonal antibody 4B10 and anti-HIP1r polyclonal antibody UM359. Bound antibodies were visualized with anti-mouse IgG-FITC or anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red (Vector Laboratories). Cells were analyzed with a Zeiss confocal microscope and the images processed using Adobe Photoshop software. Flow Cytometry—For analysis of endocytic uptake of endogenous EGFR, HeLa cells were plated 2 days prior to transfection into 6-well dishes at an approximate density of 2 × 105 cells/well. By the time of transfection, cells were 60-80% confluent. The constructs, pcDNA3.1(+)/IRES-GFP, pcDNA3.1(+)/IRES-GFP/HIP1, pcDNA3.1(+)/IRES-GFP/HIP1/ΔE, and pcDNA3.1(+)/IRES-GFP/dynamin1-K44A were transfected into HeLa cells (2 μg/well of a 6-well dish). Following transfection, cells were grown in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then starved in serum-free medium for an addition 20 h. Cells were then stimulated with EGF for the times indicated, trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal bovine serum, and incubated with anti-EGFR antibody conjugated to phycoerythrin (Pharmingen) for 60 min with gentle rocking at 4 °C. Following staining, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were subjected to flow cytometric analysis on a BD Biosciences FACS Elite within 4 h after staining, with measurement of fluorescence intensity in the green and red wavelengths (for GFP positivity and phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-EGFR, respectively). Distinct populations of GFP-positive and negative cells were analyzed for mean fluorescence intensity. For graphical analysis, the fraction of fluorescence remaining after stimulation was plotted as a percentage of initial fluorescence against time. For analysis of transferrin uptake, 293T cells were transfected with the same constructs as above, and following starvation, cells were incubated with Alexa-Fluor-633-labeled transferrin as described previously (2Rao D.S. Bradley S.V. Kumar P.D. Hyun T.S. Saint-Dic D. Oravecz-Wilson K. Kleer C.G. Ross T.S. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 471-482Google Scholar). HIP1r Mutants and Antibody Characterization—In order to define the relevance of the various protein domains in the activity of HIP1r, deletion mutants lacking these domains were generated (Fig. 1A). In addition, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were raised against HIP1r using various HIP1r-GST fusion proteins as antigens (see “Materials and Methods”). The monoclonal antibodies HIP1r/1C5 and HIP1r/1E1 resulted from use of the HIP1r TALIN homology region as the antigen, and both antibodies recognized all of the deletion mutants (Fig. 1A) except those that did not contain the TALIN homology region (HIP1r/ΔT and HIP1r/ΔEΔT) (Fig. 1B). The polyclonal anti-HIP1r antibody UM359, which was generated against a ΔE-HIP1r-GST fusion protein, immunoprecipitated all of the HIP1r mutants (see the Supplemental Material Fig. 1a, lower panel). The monoclonal antibody HIP1r/1E5 was generated from a region of HIP1r that contained the coiled-coil domain and, as expected, did recognize HIP1r/ΔT. This is shown by the fact that all of the HIP1r mutants were recognized by Western blot using a mix of the monoclonal antibodies 1E1 and 1E5 (Supplemental Material Fig. 1a, bottom panel). Prior to using the HIP1r constructs (Fig. 1A), they were tested for expression levels and for association with endocytic proteins that had been published previously (5Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M.

Sanda M.G. Ross T.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 351-360Google Scholar) and HIP1r constructs, immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal anti-HIP1 antibody UM323 or the polyclonal anti-HIP1r antibody UM359, and immunoblotted for various endogenous endocytic proteins. As has been reported previously, we found that HIP1r (Supplemental Material Fig. 1A, lane 2) and HIP1 (Supplemental Material Fig. 1b, lane 2) associated with clathrin. The HIP1 mutants HIP1/ΔT and HIP1/ΔE and the HIP1r mutants HIP1r/ΔTH, HIP1r/ΔE, and HIP1r/ΔEΔT were able to associate with clathrin equally well compared with full-length HIP1 and HIP1r (Supplemental Material Fig. 1b, lanes 3 and 5; Fig. 1a, lanes 5-7). This provides evidence that the mutants we have created are folding properly in the cell. In addition, these data confirm the previous work showing that the LMD motif and coiled-coil regions of HIP1 are necessary for association with clathrin (Supplemental Material Fig. 1b, lanes 4 and 6) (11Waelter S. Scherzinger E. Hasenbank R. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Goehler H. Gauss C. Sathasivam K. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1807-1817Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether HIP1 and HIP1r associate with AP-1, an endocytic protein complex localized primarily to the trans-Golgi network and late endosomes. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting for γ-adaptin, the large subunit of the AP-1 tetrameric complex, showed that neither HIP1 nor HIP1r associated with AP-1 (data not shown). We also confirmed that although HIP1 associates with α-adaptin, the large subunit of the adaptor protein AP-2, HIP1r did not (data not shown) (5Legendre-Guillemin V. Metzler M. Charbonneau M. Gan L.

https://openalex.org/W2091618472,"Ferritin, normally considered a cytoplasmic iron-storage protein, is also found in the nuclei of some cells. There is no current agreement about its function(s) in this environment. Proposals include DNA protection, provision of iron to nuclear enzymes, and regulation of transcription initiation, but evidence for these functions is scanty. We have shown previously that H-ferritin subunits can be cross-linked to chromosomal DNA in vivo (Thompson, K. J., Fried, M. G., Ye, Z., Boyer, P., and Connor, J. R. (2002) J. Cell Sci. 115, 2165–2177). Here we describe systematic analyses of DNA binding and the covalent stability of DNA in the presence of ferritins from several different sources. Our data show that the H-subunit of human ferritin binds DNA, whereas neither the L-subunit nor the ferroxidase-deficient 222-mutant of the H-subunit has detectable binding activity. DNA binding is without significant preference for base composition, sequence, or the nature of DNA ends. H- and L-ferritins and ferritins of mixed subunit composition stimulate the conversion of superhelical plasmid DNA to the relaxed form. The sensitivity of this conversion to glycerol suggests that DNA is nicked by a free radical mechanism. The rate of nicking correlates with the iron content of the ferritin and is strongly inhibited by chelators. Ferritin-dependent nicking is characterized by a kinetic lag that is not seen in control reactions containing free iron species. These results suggest that the release of iron from ferritin is an important part of the nicking mechanism. The potential role of ferritin as a protector of the genome is discussed in the context of these results.

The potential role of ferritin as a protector of the genome is discussed in the context of these results. Ferritin is a cytoplasmic protein that binds and sequesters iron. Intranuclear iron-positive inclusions discovered to be ferritin have been found in hepatocytes following iron overload conditions in mice (1Haddow A. Horning E.S. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1960; 24: 109-147PubMed Google Scholar), rats (2Smith A.G. Carthew P. Francis J.E. Edwards R.E. Dinsdale D. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 1399-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and baboons (3Iancu T.C. Rabinowitz H. Brissot P. Guillouzo A. Deugnier Y. Bourel M. J. Hepatol. 1985; 1: 261-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Intranuclear ferritin-like particles have been described in human liver cells, bone marrow macrophages, reticular cells, and muscle and nerve cells in a number of pathological conditions such as pigmentary cirrhosis and chronic progressive motor disturbance (4Shires T.K. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 5Vaca C.E. Harms-Ringdahl M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We have shown that ferritin is present in neuronal but not glial nuclei during postnatal development, following hypoxic ischemic insult (6Cheepsunthorn P. Palmer C. Menzies S. Roberts R.L. Connor J.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 431: 382-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and in brain tumor cells (7Thompson K.J. Fried M.G. Ye Z. Boyer P. Connor J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that the amount of ferritin in the nucleus can be altered by changes in cellular iron status and/or oxidative stress (7Thompson K.J. Fried M.G. Ye Z. Boyer P. Connor J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there is increasing acceptance of the concept that ferritin is present in cell nuclei, there is little agreement about its function in this environment. Ferritin can offer protection from UV-induced DNA damage in nuclei of avian corneal epithelial cells (8Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12831-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 9Cai C.X. Birk D.E. Linsenmayer T.F. Mol. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2327-2334Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but other studies implicate it as a source of hydroxyl radical production, either through the oxidation of iron following sequestration or after iron release from the molecule (11Reif D.W. Schubert J. Aust S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 238-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Samokyszyn V.M. Thomas C.E. Reif D.W. Saito M. Aust S.D. Drug Metab.

In vivo cross-linking indicates that H-ferritin subunits have access to chromosomal DNA (7Thompson K.J. Fried M.G. Ye Z. Boyer P. Connor J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in vitro results demonstrate that some ferritins and ferritin-like proteins bind directly to DNA (14Broyles R.H. Belegu V.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Some of these studies indicate that ferritin can bind sequences regulating the expression of globin genes; this has given rise to the proposal that ferritin binding regulates globin transcription (14Broyles R.H. Belegu V. DeWitt C.R. Shah S.N. Stewart C.A. Pye Q.N. Floyd R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9145-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 17Broyles R.H. Blair F.C. Kyker K.D.

Chem. 1991; 266: 17566-17572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to binding DNA, ferritin could serve to deliver iron to the nucleus for iron-dependent enzyme or transcription factor activities (19Prince R.C. Grossman M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 153-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21Khoroshilova N. Beinert H. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, DNA binds iron with relatively high affinity (23Andronikashvili E.L. Mosulishvili L.M. Belokobilski A.I. Kharabadze N.E. Tevzieva T.K. Efremova E.Y. Cancer Res. 1974; 34: 271-274PubMed Google Scholar), and there is substantial evidence that free radical species produced in the redox reactions of iron are capable of DNA damage (cf. Ref. 4Shires T.K. Biochem. J. 1982; 205: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The metabolic demand for iron and the accompanying need to avoid the toxic consequences of its release may be met by proteins like ferritin, which bind iron reversibly and retain it in a relatively unreactive form. To test features of this model, we have examined the DNA interactions of several ferritins, and their abilities to protect DNA from iron-induced damage over prolonged periods. The results indicate that long term DNA protection depends sensitively on the solution conditions, among which are the oxidation state of the dominant iron species and the presence of species capable of oxidizing Fe(II) or reducing Fe(III). Together these data have the potential to reconcile conflicts in earlier results that bear on the ability of ferritin to protect the genome against iron-mediated damage. Ferritins—The human recombinant ferritins used in this study (recombinant heavy chain ferritin (rH), 1The abbreviations used are: rH, recombinant heavy chain; DTT, dithiothreitol; rL, recombinant light chain. recombinant light chain ferritin (rL), and the H-chain 222-mutant) were the generous gift of Paolo Arosio (Milan, Italy). The rH and rL proteins have been shown to have proper assembly, folding, and functional properties, whereas the mutant 222 protein has only 6.3% the ferroxidase activity of the rH protein (24Levi S. Santambrogio P. Cozzi A. Rovida E. Corsi B. Tamborini E. Spada S. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Crystalline bovine serum albumin, chymotrypsin, horse spleen apoferritin, horse spleen ferritin, and ovalbumin were obtained from Sigma. Measurement of Iron Content of Ferritin Samples—Iron was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry after acid digestion of samples at 75 °C for 24 h (25Erikson K.M. Pinero D.J. Connor J.R. Beard J.L. J. Nutr. 1997; 127: 2030-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed in triplicate. DNA Samples—Oligodeoxyribonucleotides with sequences 5′-GATCCAACTCCTAAGCCAGTGCCAGAAGAGCCAAGGACAGGTG-3′ and 5′-TCGTCACCTGTCCTTGGCTCTTCTGGCACTGGCTTAGGAGTT-3′ were synthesized by the Pennsylvania State College of Medicine Macromolecular Core Facility. These DNAs were annealed to form a 43-bp duplex with a sequence identical to that of base pairs –164 to –128 in the human β-globin promoter (17Broyles R.H. Blair F.C. Kyker K.D. Kurein B.T. Stewart D.R. Hala'sz H. Berg P.E. Schechter A.N. Colloq. INSERM. 1995; 234: 43-51Google Scholar). This DNA was 3′-end-labeled with [32P]dCTP as described (26Kurien B.T. Scofield R.H. Broyles R.H. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 245: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and unincorporated products were removed with GD-25 spin columns (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Binding competition analyses were performed with a mixture of HinfI, RsaI, and SinI fragments of plasmid pGEM-3, obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The DNAs of this mixture were labeled with 32P at 5′ termini as described previously (27Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (5387) Google Scholar). Plasmid pUC19 (lot 28) was purchased from New England Biolabs. Electrophoretic Analyses—Submarine-format agarose gels (1.5% w/v) were cast and run in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Polyacrylamide gels (nominal concentration 4% w/v) were cast as described (28Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar). Both gel and electrophoresis buffers contained 20 mm Tris acetate and 0.5 mm EDTA. Gels with non-radioactive DNA samples were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) and photographed using a digital image capture system (Stratagene). Gels containing 32P-labeled DNA were visualized by autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 film, exposed at 4 °C. Film densitometry was performed using a digital scanner, as described previously (29Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Supercoil Relaxation Assay—DNA backbone breakage was detected using a superhelical DNA relaxation assay (30Tachon P. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1989; 7: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Supercoiled plasmid pUC19 DNA (31Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) was used as substrate. Reaction mixtures (20–30 μl) contained DNA (0.5 or 1 μg) and were dissolved in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT. Where indicated, reactions were carried out in buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4 at 21 °C), 100 mm KCl. Ferritin, FeCl3, FeSO4, glycerol, and chelators (EDTA and EGTA) were added as needed. Reactions were quenched by addition of 10 μl of 50% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, and 0.1% bromphenol blue. Following electrophoresis as described above, the mole fractions of supercoiled and relaxed forms were measured by integration of digitized gel images. DNA relaxation reactions following pseudo first-order kinetics were analyzed as shown in Equation 1, A(t)=A0e-kt(Eq. 1) where A(t) is the concentration of supercoiled DNA at time t; A0 is its initial concentration; and k is the rate constant for the reaction. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—DNA samples (2 nm of 43-bp β-globin promoter fragment or 60 pm of 5′-ends when the pGEM fragment mixture was used) were dissolved in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4 at 20 °C), 5 mm spermidine, 2.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 0.2% Nonidet P-40). Recombinant H-, L-, or 222-ferritins were added to obtain desired final concentrations, and samples were equilibrated for 60 min at 21 ± 1 °C before resolution by PAGE (29Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Error Analysis—The estimation of errors of fitted parameters was performed by the method of Brodersen et al. (32Brodersen R. Nielsen F. Christiansen J.C. Andersen K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 169: 487-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The parameters representing the least squares “best” fit to the data were multiplied by random variables with a mean value of 1.0, to generate 100–200 sets of parameters that gave fits to the experimental data that were acceptable within a probability limit of 0.95, according to the F test (33Sprague E.D. Larrabee Jr., C.E. Halsall H.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 101: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Minimum and maximum values of parameters in these acceptable sets were taken to represent the 95% confidence limits of a given parameter. A Subunit-specific Ferritin-DNA Interaction—To test directly whether ferritin binds DNA, electrophoresis mobility shift assays (28Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar)) were carried out using a 43-bp DNA duplex. This DNA has a sequence identical to residues –164 to –128 of the human β-globin promoter (17Broyles R.H. Blair F.C. Kyker K.D. Kurein B.T. Stewart D.R. Hala'sz H. Berg P.E. Schechter A.N. Colloq. INSERM. 1995; 234: 43-51Google Scholar). Titration of this DNA with recombinant human H-ferritin (rH-ferritin) results in the concentration-dependent formation of a discrete mobility-shifted band (Fig. 1, lanes b–f). Titration of pre-formed complexes with unlabeled competing DNA (of identical sequence) decreased retention of the 32P-labeled DNA, indicating that the ferritin-DNA interaction is reversible (result not shown). In contrast, binding was not detected with the recombinant human L chain ferritin under the same solution conditions (Fig. 1, compare lanes e and i). Since H- and L-ferritins differ in feroxidase activities, the observed difference in their DNA binding prompted investigation of the 222-mutant of human H-ferritin. The 222-mutant forms native-like 24-subunit assemblies but has a three-amino acid substitution that diminishes the ferroxidase activity normally associated with the H-subunit (34Lawson D.M. Treffry A. Artymiuk P.J. Harrison P.M. Yewdall S.J. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Levi S. Arosio P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As a result, it is only 6.3% as active in iron uptake as is the recombinant H homopolymer (35Chasteen N.D. Sun S. Levi S. Arosio P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 356: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The mutant 222-ferritin did not possess detectable DNA binding activity over the range of protein concentrations that gave detectable DNA binding with rH-ferritin (Fig. 1, lanes j–m). Although proof is still lacking, the absence of detectable mobility shift with L-ferritin and the 222-mutant H-ferritin raises the intriguing possibility that ferroxidase activity might be required for DNA binding. Binding Is Independent of DNA Sequence, Base Composition, or Type of Molecular End—Binding competition assays were performed to determine whether the rH-ferritin-DNA interaction was dependent on base composition, sequence, or the structures present at the ends of restriction fragments. A population of fragments derived from plasmid pGEM-3 (36Corp Promega Promega Technical Bulletin 033: pGM-3Z Vector. Madison, WI2000Google Scholar) was titrated with rH-ferritin (Fig. 2A). Three of these fragments (of 1605, 1198, and 222 bp) contain a CAGTGC sequence motif (36Corp Promega Promega Technical Bulletin 033: pGM-3Z Vector. Madison, WI2000Google Scholar). This sequence has been reported to bind ferritin (17Broyles R.H. Blair F.C. Kyker K.D. Kurein B.T. Stewart D.R. Hala'sz H. Berg P.E. Schechter A.N. Colloq. INSERM. 1995; 234: 43-51Google Scholar). Because the many free DNA bands interfere with visualization of mobility-shifted ferritin-DNA complexes, binding is most easily monitored by following the disappearance of the free DNA bands, as originally described by Garner and Revzin (37Garner M.M. Revzin A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3047-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). In addition, this assay differs from the binary competition assays described previously (28Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar, 29Fried M.G. Electrophoresis. 1989; 10: 366-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) in that here the protein partitions between 15 discrete DNA fragments, ranging in size from 36 to 2645 bp. As discussed in the “Appendix,” the ratio of protein affinities for a target fragment (α) and a reference fragment (ref) is given by Equation 2. [P]→0LimIα,1Iref,1f(ref)f(α)=Kα1Kref,1(Eq. 2) Band intensities are represented by Iα,1 and Iref,1, whereas the input mole fractions of the corresponding DNA fragments are f(α) and f(ref). For this analysis, we have selected the 65-bp fragment as the reference species. Representative graphs of the dependence of the normalized binding ratio (Iα,1·f(ref)/Iref,1·f(α)), on ferritin concentration for the 460, 126, and 36-bp fragments, are shown in Fig. 2B, upper panel. For every fragment tested, the normalized binding ratio appeared to depend linearly on [ferritin], over the entire experimental concentration range, and linear extrapolation to [ferritin] = 0 was straightforward. As shown in Table I, values of Kα,1/Kref,1 for all fragments lie within a narrow range (0.42 ± 0.15 ≤ Kα,1/Kref,1 ≤ 2.71 ± 0.17). This result is inconsistent with a strong binding preference for any sequence present in the population, including those fragments containing the CAGTGC sequence. Similarly, a graph of normalized binding ratios as a function of the percent of G + C residues in each fragment reveals no systematic dependence of relative affinity on base composition (Fig. 2B, center panel). Intriguingly, a graph of normalized binding ratios as a function of fragment length (Fig. 2B, bottom panel) shows the absence of a systematic dependence of binding affinity on DNA length. This result is inconsistent with binding models in which the number of potential binding sites increases with DNA length (such as that represented by Equation 8 under the “Appendix”), and it justifies our choice of the fragment length-independent binding model, represented by Equation 7.Table IRelative affinities of ferritin for restriction fragments from pGEM-3LengthRestriction endonucleaseEnd structureaFor blunt-ended fragments the population average value of Kα,1/Kref,1 = 1.1 ± 0.5 (n = 4).

For fragments with 5′ overhangs, the population average value of Kα,1/Kref,1 = 0.9 ± 0.7 (n = 10). Open table in a new tab The observation that binding affinity is independent of DNA length suggests that binding sites might be within structures that are present at the same relative concentration for all DNA fragments. DNA ends are the most obvious class of structures with this property. However, the values obtained with blunt-ended DNA fragments Kα,1/Kref,1 = 1.1 ± 0.5 (n = 4) and with fragments possessing single-stranded 5′ overhangs Kα,1/Kref,1 = 0.98 ± 0.71 (n = 10) are not significantly different (Table I). Although this does not rule out DNA ends as binding sites for ferritin, it indicates that the differences in DNA end structures that we have chosen to test do not greatly influence the strength of the interaction. DNA Nicking in the Presence of Ferritin—Addition of ferritin to solutions containing iron (initially present as either FeCl3 or FeSO4) dramatically reduces the extent of nicking experienced by plasmid DNA added at a later time (7Thompson K.J. Fried M.G. Ye Z. Boyer P. Connor J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2165-2177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, this is a consequence of iron sequestration by the ferritin because the magnitude of the effect correlates with the iron uptake ferroxidase activity of the proteins tested (recombinant human H-ferritin > 222-mutant H-ferritin > horse spleen apoferritin). However, the long term protection of DNA requires both iron uptake and iron retention. Here we test the notion that the release of iron from ferritin can be a source of DNA damage. Supercoil-relaxation assays (30Tachon P. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1989; 7: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) were performed with plasmid pUC19 DNA incubated with ferritin (Fig. 3). Under the electrophoretic conditions chosen, individual topoisomers and the relaxed circle form were resolved (Fig. 3A, lanes i and q). After addition of ferritin, the mole fraction of the superhelical form decreased and that of the relaxed form increased with time (Fig. 3A, lanes b–h and j–p). At long reaction times, linear form DNA can also be detected. 2Mobility-shifted species are not detected in these assays, presumably because they are unstable under the conditions of agarose gel electrophoresis. Many protein DNA complexes are less stable in agarose gels than in the more concentrated polyacrylamide matrices (38Fried M.G. Bromberg J.L. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 39Fried M.G. Daugherty M.A. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 1247-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Comparison of the time course of reactions run with rH-ferritin, 222-mutant H-ferritin, liver ferritin, and spleen ferritin (Fig. 3B) shows that all reactions have a characteristic lag at early times, followed by an interval of increasing nicking activity. Such a lag phase is not seen when ferrous or ferric iron was added to ferritin-free control reactions (Fig. 3C). The duration of lag phase was similar for all ferritins tested, as were the rates of DNA nicking during lag phase (initial nicking rates average = 4.8 ± 1.1 × 10–5 s–1 within this sample population). Because the ferroxidase activities of rH, 222, spleen, and liver ferritins differ markedly (40Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar), these results are inconsistent with the idea that the lag reflects a function of the iron-transport ferroxidase. In addition, because there are large differences in the iron contents of our ferritin samples (Fig. 4), the uniform duration and nicking rates of the lag phase are unlikely to be a function of the degree of iron loading of ferritin. These issues will be discussed in more detail below.Fig. 4Iron contents of the ferritin samples used in this study. Samples were hydrolyzed in acid for 24 h at 75 °C, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The iron concentrations in the resulting solutions were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Determinations were made in triplicate; mean values are reported here.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Following the lag phase, the rate of DNA nicking accelerates (Fig. 3B). The nicking rates increase in the order spleen ferritin > liver ferritin > (rH, 222-ferritins). This order is the same as that of the iron content in our samples (Fig. 4), suggesting that the maximal rate of DNA nicking in each reaction may be related to the amount of ferritin-iron that is potentially available within the system. On the other hand, the small difference in nicking rate observed with rH and 222-mutant ferritins that differ significantly in ferroxidase activity suggests that the maximal nicking rate observed is not determined by the ferroxidase activity of the preparation. Finally, at long reaction times, the rate of detectable DNA nicking declines as the supercoiled substrate is depleted. Relationship of DNA Relaxation Rate and Superhelical Density—Does ferritin-mediated nicking of DNA depend on superhelical density? Different topoisomers in our DNA population differ in torsional stress and compaction because of supercoiling and possibly secondary structure (41Bauer W.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1978; 7: 287-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). These differences could influence the susceptibility of DNA to attack by reactive species. To determine whether this is the case, superhelical pUC19 DNA was exposed to ferritin for varying times as described above, but the electrophoretic step was carried out longer (24 h) to improve resolution of the topoisomers in the population. As shown in Fig. 5, the time course of nicking appears similar for all topoisomers in the population. Iron Release and the Formation of Free Radicals Appear to Be Necessary for DNA Nicking—The kinetic lag in ferritin-mediated DNA nicking suggests that one or more reaction steps precede the one in which DNA is nicked. We hypothesize that the lag corresponds to the interval required for iron release by ferritin. Following iron release, the Fenton reaction or related pathways should result in the formation of reactive iron species and/or hydroxyl radicals, which react with DNA (42Theil E.C. J. Nutr. 2003; 133: S1549-S1553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If free iron is an intermediate in this pathway, DNA nicking should be inhibited by chelators. Consistent with this prediction, the addition of EDTA and EGTA to the reaction mixture strongly inhibits nicking (Fig. 6A). If free radicals are necessary for DNA nicking, the reaction should be inhibited by radical scavengers such as glycerol. The dependence of the nicking rate on [glycerol] is consistent with this prediction (Fig. 6A, inset). Finally, the production of free radicals at locations distant from the DNA should result in random nicking of each DNA strand. Only very heavy damage of this kind should result in double-strand cleavage. This is the pattern that is seen when DNA is attacked by hydroxyl radicals produced by untethered iron-EDTA complexes (Fig. 6B, upper panel). On the other hand, the production of radicals by ferrous and ferric ions that are bound at the DNA surface should result in spatially correlated damage to both strands and a high probability of double-strand scission. The rapid accumulation of double-strand breaks is a feature of the reactions that take place in ferritin-DNA solutions (Fig. 6B, lower panel). Together, these results are consistent with a view of DNA nicking in the presence of ferritin in which iron release from ferritin and the production of free radicals at points close to both DNA strands are important features. Does Ferritin Protect DNA?—It is clear that DNA is nicked more rapidly in the presence of ferritin-iron complexes than in iron-free solutions. However, because iron is abundant in nuclei (43Gurgueira S.A. Meneghini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13616-13620Abstract Full Tex"

NR1-2ac-Myc /NR2A receptors when expressed in mammalian cells are not trafficked to the cell surface nor do they yield cell cytotoxicity post-transfection. NR1-2ac-Myc was, however, shown to assemble with NR2A subunits by immunoprecipitation and [3H]MK801 radioligand binding assays. Immunoblots of cells co-transfected with wild-type NR1-2a/NR2A subunits yielded two NR1-2a immunoreactive species with molecular masses of 115 and 226 kDa. Two-dimensional electrophoresis under non-reducing and reducing conditions revealed that the 226-kDa band contained disulfide-linked NR1-2a subunits. Only the 115-kDa NR1-2a species was detected for NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A. The c-Myc epitope is inserted adjacent to cysteine 79 of the NR1-2a subunit; therefore, it is possible that the tag may prevent the formation of NR1 disulfide bridges. A series of cysteine → alanine NR1-2a mutants was generated, and the NR1-2a mutants were co-expressed with NR2A or NR2B subunits in mammalian cells and characterized with respect to cell surface expression, cell cytotoxicity post-transfection, co-association by immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting following SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions. When co-expressed with NR2A in mammalian cells, NR1-2aC79A/NR2A displayed similar properties to NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A in that the 226-kDa NR1 immunoreactive species was not detectable, and trafficking to the cell surface was impaired compared with wild-type NR1/NR2 receptors. These results provide the first biochemical evidence for the formation of NR1-NR1 intersubunit disulfide-linked homodimers involving cysteine 79. They suggest that disulfide bridging and structural integrity within the NR1 N-terminal domain is requisite for cell surface N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor expression.

They are unique in that they require the binding of co-agonists, i.e. l-glutamate and glycine, together with the alleviation of a voltage-dependent blockade by magnesium ions for channel activation. NMDA receptors are critical mediators of excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, being pivotal for long term potentiation. They are also important as a therapeutic target post-ischemia. NMDA receptor channels are highly permeable to calcium ions, and thus overactivation leads to excitotoxic neuronal cell death (reviewed in Ref. 1Dingledine R. Borges L. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). Seven genes encode NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A–NR2D, and NR3A–NR3B. The NR1 subunit undergoes extensive splicing to yield eight variants NR1-1a,1b to NR1-4a,4b. Functional NMDA receptors are formed from the co-assembly of the obligatory NR1 glycine-binding subunit with NR2 and/or NR3 subunits, although it was recently shown (2Chatterton J.E. Awobuluyi M. Premkumar L.S. Takahashi H. Talantova M. Shin Y. Cui J. Tu S. Sevarino K.A. Nakanishi N. Tong G. Lipton S.A. Zhang D. Nature. 2002; 415: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) that NR1/NR3 subunits formed a novel, glycine-gated receptor. The quaternary structure of NMDA receptors is still not yet established. Experimental data support either a tetrameric structure comprising two NR1 and two NR2 subunits or a pentamer with reports of either three NR1 subunits co-assembled with two NR2s or two NR1s with three NR2s (1Dingledine R. Borges L. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). All NMDA receptor subunits share the same transmembrane organization. They have an extracellular N-terminal domain of ∼550 amino acids, 3 transmembrane domains, 1 re-entrant membrane domain M2 that is thought to form the inner lining of the cation channel, and an intracellular C-terminal tail. The N-terminal region can be subdivided into two discrete domains based on the amino acid sequence homology between the NMDA receptor subunits and amino acid-binding proteins of bacteria. Thus, the first ∼400 amino acids have homology with the bacterial periplasmic leucine-isoleucine-valine-binding protein (LIVBP), whereas amino acids 420–550 show similarity with the bacterial lysine-arginine-ornithine and glutamine-binding protein (reviewed in Refs. 1Dingledine R.

The glycine- and glutamate-binding sites of the NR1 and NR2 subunits, respectively, have been localized to the N-terminal regions, i.e. amino acids 420–550 (S1), that are proximal to the membrane and the S2 extracellular loop found between TM3 and TM4 by a combination of site-directed mutagenesis studies (4Kuryatov A.

Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Most interesting, the N-terminal region distal to the membrane has been shown to be important for the assembly of non-NMDA receptors (10Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For the assembly of functional heteromeric NR1/NR2 NMDA receptors, it has been shown that NR2A subunits are localized to the plasma membrane only when co-expressed with an NR1 subunit (12McIlhinney R.A.J. le Bourdelles B. Tricuad N. Molnar E. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and that NR1-1a-(1–380) is important for NR1-1a/NR2A subunit association (13Meddowes E. Le Bourdelles B. Grimwood S.

Furthermore, it was recently suggested that NR1-NR1 dimers are an initial step in NMDA receptor assembly (14Schorge S. Colquhoun D. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, using blue native-PAGE, Meddowes et al. (13Meddowes E. Le Bourdelles B. Grimwood S. Wafford K. Sandhu S. Whiting P. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Biol.

We have described previously an epitope-tagged NR2B subunit (15Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The FLAG or c-Myc epitopes were introduced between amino acids 53 and 54 of the mature NR2B subunit to yield NR2B53–54FLAG and NR2B53–54c-Myc (15Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). NR2BFLAG/c-Myc behaved as wild-type NR2B co-assembling with NR1 subunits to form functional cell surface NMDA receptors following coexpression in mammalian cells or in neurons (15Hawkins L.M.

The c-Myc epitope tag was subsequently engineered into the N-terminal domain of the NR1-2a splice variant at a position (amino acid 81) similar to that used successfully for the tagging of the NR2B subunit. Most interesting, this epitope-tagged form of the NR1-2a did not result in cell cytoxicity post-transfection suggesting that it was unable to form functional cell surface NMDA receptors. In this paper, we describe the biochemical properties of this NR1-2ac-Myc epitope-tagged NMDA receptor subunit. We show that characterization of the mutant NR1-2a subunit reveals insights into the importance of both NR1 disulfide bridging and the integrity of the N-terminal domain for both the assembly and cell surface expression of functional NMDA receptors. Constructs and Antibodies—The NMDA receptor clones, pCISNR1-1a, pCISNR2A, pCISNR2B, and pCISNR2BFLAG, were as described previously in Hawkins et al. (15Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence, DEQKLI-SEEDL, i.e. the c-Myc epitope tag sequence with an N-terminal Asp residue, was inserted between NR1-2a-(81–82) by using the unique PpuM1 restriction site at codon 239 of the immature NR1-2a (note throughout, amino acid and nucleotide sequence numbers refer to immature NR1-2a, i.e. the signal peptide is included). Briefly, pCISNR1-2a was prepared by restriction enzyme digestion with PpuM1, and religation was prevented by dephosphorylation. The oligonucleotides with sequences 5′ GAC GAA CAA AAG CTA ATA TCA GAA GAA GAC CTA and 5′ GTC TAG GTC TTC TTC TGA TAT TAG CTT TTG TTC were 5′-phosphorylated, annealed, and ligated into the PpuM1 site of pCISNR1-2a by using a standard protocol. The pCISNR1-2ac-Myc construct was verified by nucleotide sequencing. The cysteine → alanine NR1-2a point mutations at residues NR1-2a-(22), NR1-2a-(79), and NR1-2a-(308), the double cysteine → alanine at 79 and 308, and the triple cysteine → alanine at 22, 79, and 308 were generated from pCISNR1-2a by using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following complementary oligonucleotides were used to induce 2 base changes NR1-2a Cys-22 → Ala-22, 5′-CGC CCG CGC CGC CGC CGA CCC CAA GAT + complementary oligonucleotide; NR1-2a Cys-79 → Ala-79, 5′-GGC CCT GTC AGT GGC TGA GGA CCT CAT CTC + complementary oligonucleotide; NR1-2a Cys-308 → Ala-308, 5′-CCC ACC GCG GGG TGC CGT GGG CAA CAC C + complementary nucleotide. Mutations were verified by nucleotide sequencing using the Applied Biosystems, Inc., 310 Automated Genetic Analyzer. pGWIPSD-95c-Myc was a gift from Professor M. Sheng (Boston). Anti-NR1-(35–53)-Cys (an anti-NR1 antibody that recognizes all NR1 splice variants), anti-NR1 C2 (an anti-NR1 antibody that recognizes NR1 splice forms with the C2 exon, i.e. NR1-1a,1b and NR1-2a,2b), anti-NR2A-(1381–1394), and anti-NR2B-(46–60)-Cys affinity-purified antibodies were all as described previously (15Hawkins L.M.

Anti-lysosomal associated membrane protein-II (LAMP-II) antibodies were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa; anti-calnexin antibodies were from Novabiochem. Mammalian Cell Transfections—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured and transfected with either single subunit NR1 or NR2 NMDA receptor clones, co-transfected with both NR1/NR2 subunit combinations using the calcium phosphate method with a total of 10 μg of DNA and a ratio of 1:3 for NR1:NR2 transfections, respectively, or alternatively with NR1, NR2, and post-synaptic density 95 (PSD-95) clones using a total of 20 μg of DNA and a ratio of NMDA receptor clones:PSD-95 of 1:1 (20Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 21Rutter A.R. Freeman F.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mm ketamine post-transfection. They were harvested 24–36 h post-transfection by centrifugation at 3000 × g, and homogenates were prepared, adjusted to 0.5 mg protein/ml, and analyzed immediately for [3H]MK801 and [3H]MDL105,519 radioligand binding activities or alternatively frozen at –80 °C and later analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting. Cell Cytotoxicity—HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with various pCISNR1-2a/pCISNR2A constructs with or without pGWIPSD-95c-Myc. Twenty hours post-transfection, cell cytoxicity was determined using the Promega CytoTox 96™ cytotoxicity assay according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously (20Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously using 25–50 μg of protein/sample precipitated using the chloroform:methanol method and SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions as specified in 7.5% polyacrylamide slab minigels (15Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-NR1 (C2 exon) and anti-NR2A-(1381–1394) antibodies were used at final concentrations of 1–5 μg/ml; anti-c-Myc 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:2000. Rabbit and mouse horseradish-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) were used at a final dilution of 1:2000, and immunoreactivities were detected by using the ECL Western blotting system. Immunoreactive bands were quantified by either molecular densitometry using a Personal Densitometer with ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences) in the linear range of the film (15Hawkins L.M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or using the GeneGnome Chemiluminescence Capture and Analysis System (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). Two-dimensional Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out as described by Cadieux and Kadner (22Cadieux N. Kadner R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10673-10678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) except that after the first dimension of SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, the band of interest was excised from the gel, and the protein was eluted into 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.5 (2 ml), by electrophoresis at 50 V for 2.5 h followed by electrophoresis for 10 min at 50 V with reversed polarity. The eluted protein was subjected to a second dimension of SDS-PAGE with and without reducing agent. After resolution, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and proteins were detected by immunoblotting as above. Cell Surface NMDA Receptor Subunit Expression Measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—The measurement of cell surface NR1-2a/NR2B NMDA receptors was carried out by using an ELISA method modified from that described in Rutter et al. (21Rutter A.R. Freeman F.M. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1298-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were sub-cultured overnight prior to transfection in polylysine (50 μg/ml)-coated 24-well dishes, and 0.8 μg of total plasmid DNA was used per well. Cells were cultured in the presence of 1 mm ketamine for 24–36 h post-transfection. Cell culture media was aspirated, and each well was washed with 1 × 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were fixed by the addition of 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (250 μl) for 5 min at room temperature, washed once with 500 μl of PBS, and nonspecific sites blocked by incubation with 4% (w/v) milk powder in PBS (500 μl) for 30 min. Cells were incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody, which was anti-NR2B-(46–60) (0.5 μg/ml; 250 μl) because NR2 subunits are found on the cell surface only when co-expressed with an NR1 subunit (12McIlhinney R.A.J. le Bourdelles B. Tricuad N. Molnar E. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cells were washed 4 × for 10 min with 4 × 500 μl of 4% (w/v) milk powder in PBS; horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit Ig was added for 1 h (Amersham Biosciences; 1:2000 dilution in 4% (w/v) milk powder in PBS, 250 μl). Cells were washed 3 times for 10 min with 500 μl of 4% (w/v) milk powder in PBS, 1 time with 500 μl of PBS for 10 min, and then K-blue substrate (Adgen Ltd., Ayr, UK; 900 μl) was added. Cells were then incubated for 25 min, and the ODλ650 nm was measured. For the determination of total immunoreactivity in the transfected cells, cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (250 μl), washed 1 time with 500 μl of PBS, and then permeabilized by incubation with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. All subsequent steps were as above for the measurement of cell surface NMDA receptor subunit expression. For the determination of nonspecific binding of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies to transfected cells, HEK 293 cells were always transfected with the plasmid, pCIS, and the ODλ650 nm values obtained were subtracted to give specific NMDA receptor total and cell surface binding. Radioligand Binding Assays—[3H]MDL105,519 (74 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) radioligand binding assays to cell homogenates of transfected HEK 293 cells were carried out as described previously using 1 mm glycine for the measurement of nonspecific binding (23Chopra B. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 30: 65-72Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). (+)-5-[3H]Methyl-10,11-dihydrobenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine ([3H]MK801; 28.8 Ci/mmol; DuPont) radioligand binding assays to cell homogenates of transfected HEK 293 cells were carried out as described previously (24Rutter A.R. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2501-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 μm glycine, 10 μm glutamate, and 100 μm thienylcyclohexylpiperidine for the measurement of nonspecific binding. Immunoprecipitations—HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with either pCISNR1-2a/pCISNR2A, pCISNR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A (1:3 ratio with 10 μg of total DNA), or wild-type and mutant combinations ± pGWIPSD-95c-Myc. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and cell homogenates were solubilized for 1 h at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 240 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, containing benzamidine (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm). Samples were diluted to 1 mg of protein/ml, and the solubilized material was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. Aliquots (500 μl) were incubated with affinity-purified anti-NR2A-(1381–1394), anti-NR1 C2, or protein A purified non-immune Ig (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma; 2.5 mg) was added, and samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune pellets were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 s, washed with 3× solubilization buffer as above (3 × 1 ml), solubilized with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Preparation of Rat Forebrain Membranes—Membranes from adult rat forebrains were prepared as described previously and frozen at –80 °C until used (18Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Subcellular Fractionation—HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with NR1-2a/NR2A or NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A and cultured for 24 h post-transfection in the presence of 1 mm ketamine, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended by homogenization using a Dounce (glass/glass) homogenizer (10 passes) followed by four passes through a 25-gauge needle in 1.5 ml of 60 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 6 mm EDTA benzamidine (1 μg/ml), bacitracin (1 μg/ml), soybean trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), chicken egg trypsin inhibitor (1 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) containing 0.25 m sucrose. The resuspended material was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (1 ml) was applied to a 5–20% (v/v) Optiprep gradient (11 ml; Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway). Gradients were centrifuged using an SW40Ti rotor at 34,000 rpm (135,000 × g) for 3 h at 4 °C. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and analyzed by immunoblotting. Expression of NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A Heteromeric NMDA Receptors Does Not Result in the Cell Surface Expression of Functional NMDA Receptors—We have reported previously that co-expression of wild-type NR1/NR2 heteromeric receptors results in cell cytotoxicity post-transfection (20Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This NMDA receptor-induced cell death was eliminated by the inclusion of NMDA receptor antagonists in the cell culture medium post-transfection. Cytotoxicity was attributed to activation of functional cell surface NMDA receptors by l-glutamate and glycine in the cell culture media with a subsequent unregulated influx of Ca2+. The cell cytotoxicity assay post-transfection is therefore a useful biochemical means to measure functional cell surface NMDA receptors. Most interesting, in contrast to NR1/NR2BFLAG and NR1/NR2Bc-Myc receptors, NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A did not yield cell cytotoxicity post-transfection (Fig. 1A). The lack of observed cell death post-transfection was not because of a reduced expression of the NR1-2ac-Myc polypeptide, because immunoblots of transfected cell homogenates showed that when expressed alone, there was no significant difference in molecular weight and expression levels between wild-type and epitope-tagged subunits (Fig. 1, B and C). When NR1-2ac-Myc was co-expressed with NR2A, however, the subunit level was reduced 2.8 ± 0.8-fold compared with wild-type NR1-2a/NR2A combinations (Fig. 1, B and C). Cell surface ELISAs confirmed the cell cytotoxicity observations in that no significant cell surface anti-NR2B antibody reactivity was detected following the co-expression of NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2B receptors in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1D). This contrasted with ketamine-sensitive cell cytotoxicity post-transfection and cell surface expression for wild-type NR1-2a/NR2A and NR1-2a/NR2B receptors, respectively. NR1-2ac-Myc Co-assembles with NR2A Subunits, Demonstration by Immunoprecipitation, and Radioligand Binding Studies—From the above results, it was evident that although the c-Myc tagged NR1-2a subunit was expressed, it was not trafficked to the cell surface when co-expressed with an NR2 subunit. Further experiments were carried out to characterize the properties of the mutant. In the first instance, immunoprecipitation studies were used to establish whether NR1-2ac-Myc subunits were able to associate with NR2 subunits. Wild-type and mutant NR1-2a were co-expressed with NR2A in HEK 293 cells; transfected cells were detergent-extracted, and immunoprecipitation assays were carried out with anti-NR2A antibodies. The results are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. It can be seen that both NR1-2a and NR1-2ac-Myc subunits were specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-NR2A antibodies demonstrating that c-Myc-tagged NR1-2a subunits do co-assemble with NR2A. Further proof of their co-association was obtained by radioligand binding studies. [3H]MK801 is a use-dependent, non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors. It binds with high affinity only to assembled NR1/NR2 receptors (25Lynch D.R. Anegawa N.J. Verdoorn T. Pritchett D.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 540-545PubMed Google Scholar, 26Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). [3H]MK801 radioligand binding assays were carried out on cells transfected with NR1-2a/NR2A and NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A. The saturation binding curves are shown in Fig. 2C. Both curves were best fit by a single high affinity site with no significant difference in KD values between wild-type and mutant heteromers. Values are as follows: KD = 11.4 ± 4.3 (n = 3) nm (NR1-2a/NR2A) and KD = 7.7 ± 1.9 (n = 3) nm (NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A). There was, however, a significant decrease in the number of binding sites, Bmax. Values are as follows: 0.6 ± 0.2 (n = 3) pmol/mg protein (NR1-2a/NR2A) and 0.1 ± 0.05 (n = 3) pmol/mg protein (NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A). This percentage decrease correlates with that found by immunoblotting for the expression of NR1-2ac-Myc compared with NR1-2a in NR1/NR2 transfections (Fig. 1, B and C). These results imply that the insertion of the c-Myc epitope does not affect the integrity of the NMDA receptor ion channel. [3H]MDL105,519 is a competitive glycine site antagonist and binds with high affinity to NR1 subunits expressed alone. Fig. 2D shows representative [3H]MDL105,519 saturation curves for binding to NR1-2a and NR1-2ac-Myc. The binding parameters are as follows: KD = 1.9 ± 0.6 nm, Bmax = 1.4 ± 0.4 pmol/mg protein (n = 3; NR1-2a), KD = 1.2 ± 0.2 nm, and Bmax = 0.8 ± 0.2 pmol/mg protein (n = 3; NR1-2ac-Myc). There was thus no significant difference in the affinity and the Bmax values between wild-type and mutant receptors. These [3H]MDL105,519 binding studies are in agreement with the comparison of expression levels by immunoblotting, and furthermore, they imply that the introduction of the c-Myc epitope at amino acid NR1-2a 81 does not perturb the NR1 glycine binding domain. Subcellular Localization of NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A Expressed Receptors—Because NR1-2ac-Myc/NR2A receptors are not expressed at the cell surface, fractionation studies were carried out to determine their subcellular localization. The results are shown in Fig. 3A. For wild-type receptors, both NR1 and NR2 subunit immunoreactivities are spread throughout the top part of the gradient. In contrast, for the epitope-tagged receptors, both NR1 and NR2 subunit immunoreactivities are confined to the middle fractions of the gradient where they co-localize with calnexin, a molecular chaperone and endoplasmic reticulum marker. Retention in the endoplasmic reticulum, as might be predicted"
https://openalex.org/W2076337849,"Regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) is an emerging paradigm in signal transduction. RIP is mediated by intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CliPs), which liberate biologically active nuclear or secreted domains from their membrane-tethered precursor proteins. The yeast Pcp1p/Rbd1p protein is a Rhomboid-like I-CliP that regulates mitochondrial membrane remodeling and fusion through cleavage of Mgm1p, a regulator of these essential activities. Although this ancient function is conserved in PARL (Presenilins-associated Rhomboid-like protein), the mammalian ortholog of Pcp1p/Rbd1p, the two proteins show a strong divergence at their N termini. However, the N terminus of PARL is significantly conserved among vertebrates, particularly among mammals, suggesting that this domain evolved a distinct but still unknown function. Here, we show that the cytosolic N-terminal domain of PARL is cleaved at positions 52-53 (α-site) and 77-78 (β-site). Whereas α-cleavage is constitutive and removes the mitochondrial targeting sequence, β-cleavage appears to be developmentally controlled and dependent on PARL I-CliP activity supplied in trans. The β-cleavage of PARL liberates Pβ, a nuclear targeted peptide whose sequence is conserved only in mammals. Thus, in addition to its evolutionarily conserved function in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, PARL might mediate a mammalian-specific, developmentally regulated mitochondria-to-nuclei signaling through regulated proteolysis of its N terminus and release of the Pβ peptide.

RIP was originally described as a mechanism requiring two sequential cleavages carried out by distinct proteases (2Brown M. Goldstein J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The first protease cleaves the precursor protein close to a transmembrane helix (TMH), whereas the second cleavage, executed by an intramembrane-cleaving protease, or I-CliP, occurs within the TMH and releases a biologically active peptide. In the well characterized case of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), cleavage by the I-CliP site-2 protease (3Rawson R.B. Zelenski N.G. Nijhawan D. Ye J. Sakai J. Hasan M.T.

The recent characterization of Rhomboid-1, a previously described regulator of Drosophila development (9Bier E. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 190-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 10Ruohola-Baker H. Grell E. Chou T.B. Baker D. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1993; 73: 953-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), has brought new insights into RIP. Indeed, Rhomboid-1 is an I-CliP that does not require a preliminary cleavage of its substrate, Spitz, and the single cleavage, which occurs inside a TMH, yields a secreted regulatory peptide (11Urban S. Lee J.R. Freeman M. Cell. 2001; 107: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The Rhomboid family of serine I-CliPs consists of two subfamilies, denoted the RHO and PARL subfamilies (12Koonin E.V. Makarova K.S. Rogozin I.B. Davidovic L. Letellier M.C. Pellegrini L. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the latter being named after the Presenilins-associated Rhomboid-like protein (13Pellegrini L. Passer B.J. Canelles M. Lefterov I. Ganjei J.K. Fowlkes B.J. Koonin E.V. D'Adamio L. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2001; 3: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The conserved core of the Rhomboid family consists of six transmembrane helices. Bacterial and archaeal proteins of this family contain only the six conserved TMHs, whereas most of the eukaryotic members have an additional TMH that is located either upstream (PARL subfamily) or downstream (RHO subfamily) of the core (12Koonin E.V. Makarova K.S. Rogozin I.B. Davidovic L. Letellier M.C. Pellegrini L. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast member of the PARL subfamily, Pcp1p/Rbd1p, is a mitochondrial I-CliP that appears to regulate different mitochondrial activities through the cleavage of the dynamin-like GTPase Mgm1p, an essential mediator of mitochondrial fusion, and Ccp1, a protein required for peroxide and toxic radical scavenging (14Esser K. Tursun B. Ingenhoven M. Michaelis G. Pratje E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Herlan M. Vogel F. Bornhovd C. Neupert W. Reichert A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27781-27788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 16McQuibban G.A. Saurya S. Freeman M. Nature. 2003; 423: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). PARL, the human ortholog of Pcp1p/Rbd1p, can rescue the phenotype of a yeast strain lacking Pcp1p/Rbd1p activity, therefore indicating that the role of the members of the PARL subfamily in mitochondrial protein processing is conserved in eukaryotes (16McQuibban G.A. Saurya S. Freeman M. Nature. 2003; 423: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). However, Pcp1p/Rbd1p and PARL share no significant conservation in their N-terminal regions, whereas in vertebrates, particularly in mammals, this part of the protein is strongly conserved (12Koonin E.V. Makarova K.S. Rogozin I.B. Davidovic L. Letellier M.C. Pellegrini L. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the N-terminal portion of mammalian PARL could have a distinct, unknown function. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of PARL is cleaved in two unique sites. The first cleavage is constitutive and removes the mitochondrial import peptide, whereas the second cleavage, which depends on the I-CliP activity of PARL supplied in trans and is developmentally regulated, liberates Pβ, a nucleus-targeted peptide. Thus, the PARL case represents a new type of RIP in which the putative signaling moiety is part of the I-CliP itself. Cell Lines and Transfections—Cell lines HEK 293, neuro-2a (N2a), HeLa, and COS-1 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 μg/ml penicillin. Cells were transfected at 20-40% of confluence with FuGENE6 (Roche). Cortical primary cultures were prepared from newborn brain of rats as described (17De Koninck P. Cooper E. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7966-7978Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Forty-eight to seventy-two hours after transfection, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6) containing a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysate was spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was recovered for immunoblot or immunoprecipitation analysis. For immunoprecipitation analysis, an antibody was added, and the immunoprecipitation reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with gentle rocking. Immunocomplexes were captured by the addition of protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce) and incubation for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were washed three times in wash buffer I (50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.6), washed three times in wash buffer II (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.6), and resuspended in 100 μl of Laemmli loading buffer. Samples were heated at 85 °C for 2 min and separated on a 4-12% polyacrylamide-SDS gel (Invitrogen). Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the specified antibodies as described (18Pellegrini L. Passer B.J. Tabaton M. Ganjei J.K. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21011-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Rossi V. Motto M. Pellegrini L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13758-13765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed using the SuperSignal system (Pierce). Mitochondria Protease Protection Assay—Mitochondria-enriched preparations were obtained from one Petri dish containing confluent HEK 293 cells transfected with the PARL-HF construct (FLAG-tagged PARL with an HA tag). Cells were washed in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted with 10-20 strokes of a Teflon-coated Dounce homogenizer in 0.6 ml of homogenization buffer, which consisted of 0.1 m sucrose, 10 mm MES, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 3.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA. Mitochondria-enriched fractions were obtained by differential centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of homogenization buffer and 20-μl aliquots subjected to proteinase-K or trypsin (Sigma) digestion (1 μg) for 30 min at room temperature. Antibody Preparation—For the preparation of the anti-PNT antibody (directed against a PARL peptide located near the N terminus), a 12-amino acid-long peptide spanning amino acids 54-66 of PARL was synthesized, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, conjugated to bovine serum albumin, and used to immunize New Zealand rabbits according to standard 90-day protocols for antisera production (Covance). Antiserum (bleed 2 and 3) was used and diluted 1:1000 and 1:100 for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, respectively. The antibody used for immunocytochemical analysis was obtained by peptide affinity-purification of the antisera and used 1:2000 (1:200 in immunoblot). The specificity of the anti-PNT immunostaining was addressed by pre-adsorbing the antisera with a recombinant GST-PARL N-terminal fusion protein. Anti-PNT immunostaining was abolished when the antibody was incubated 1-4 h at 4 °C with lysate of Escherichia coli cells expressing a recombinant GST-PARL N-terminal (amino acid 20-96 of PARL) fusion protein. Constructs—For bacterial expression we used the pGEX-4 vector (Amersham Biosciences), whereas for mammalian expression we used the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and the pEGFP-N1 or pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) vectors. Note that the pEGFP-N1 vector used in this study was mutagenized at the methionine residue situated just downstream of the polylinker. This was done to avoid possible co-expression of GFP with small PARL-GFP fusion proteins (i.e. PARL-(52-77)-GFP), because a Kozak sequence embeds this methionine residue. The amino acid sequence encoded by the FLAG-tagged PARL (PARL-F) construct in the proximity of the PARL C terminus is GPKKGGGSKDYKDDDDK (FLAG peptide is underlined). The amino acid sequence encoded by the PARL-HF construct in the proximity of PARL TMH1 is PPVEETVFYPYDVPDYAPGYPIRSLI (HA peptide is underlined). Protein Sequencing—For N-terminal sequencing of immunoprecipitated proteins by Edman degradation, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the PARL-F construct (Fig. 1A). Two days later, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris Cl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with mouse anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma), washed, and resuspended in Laemmli buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were run on a 4-12% MOPS gel, blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by Coomassie staining. Protein bands with a molecular weight corresponding to those of the predicted MAMP and PACT proteins were excised from the blot, and their N-terminal sequences were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems Procise cLC494 protein sequencer. Approximately 1 pmol of the protein was loaded on the sequencer. A standard program using liquid phase trifluoroacetic acid was employed for sequencing. The phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives were determined by comparison with phenylthiohydantoin standards (Applied Biosystems) and analyzed on-line on a capillary separation system (ABI 140D) at the start of a sequence analysis. Immunocytochemistry—Rat neuronal primary cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1 m phosphate buffer and incubated in rabbit anti-PARL (1:2000), and mouse anti-βIII tubulin (TuJ-1, 1:1000; Promega) or mouse anti-neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN, 1:2000; Chemicon) and visualized using fluorescence-tagged secondary antibodies (Alexa 488 and/or Alexa 546, Molecular Probes). HEK 293 cells were transfected, fixed, and washed in PBS or, for the hypo-osmotic treatment, in water. For confocal immunofluorescence analysis, cells were incubated with mouse anti-mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex III (OxPhos, 1:500; Molecular Probes), rabbit anti-PARL, and mouse anti-HA (1:1000, Covance) and visualized as described above. For electron microscopy analysis, cells were incubated with mouse anti-HA followed by 1-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibody (Aurion) incubation and subsequent silver intensification as described (20Sik A. Hajos N. Gulacsi A. Mody I. Freund T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3245-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sections were dehydrated, embedded, cut using Ultra-Cut, and examined using a Tecnai 12 electron microscope. PARL N Terminus Is Cleaved at the β-Site through a Self-regulated Mechanism—To address the role of the PARL N-terminal domain, a lysate of HEK 293 cells transfected with a PARL-F construct was immunoprecipitated with antibodies raised against a PARL peptide located near the N terminus (designated anti-PNT) and with antibodies against the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1A). With the anti-PNT antibody, two immunoprecipitated bands of ∼42 and ∼37 kDa were detected (Fig. 1B); we reasoned that these bands should correspond to the intact PARL and to the form with the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) cleaved-off, respectively. We named this second form of the PARL protein MAMP, after mature mitochondrial PARL, and the cleavage site that originates it was designated α-site. PARL insertion in the mitochondria appeared to be an efficient process, as indicated by the low amount of unprocessed, full-length PARL (Fig 1B). Unexpectedly, a third specific, smaller protein of ∼33.5 kDa was immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. The formation of this smaller, PARL-derived protein was abrogated by mutation of the amino acid residues that form the predicted catalytic site of Rhomboid-like proteases (Fig. 1, A and C) (11Urban S. Lee J.R. Freeman M. Cell. 2001; 107: 173-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 12Koonin E.V. Makarova K.S. Rogozin I.B. Davidovic L. Letellier M.C. Pellegrini L. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16McQuibban G.A. Saurya S. Freeman M. Nature. 2003; 423: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cleavage of the putative MTS, which produced MAMP, was not affected by the same mutations (Fig. 1C). Given the location of the PNT and FLAG epitopes in the constructs used for these experiments, we hypothesized that the 33.5-kDa band was the product of a more distal cleavage of the PARL N terminus (Fig. 1A). We designated this PARL derivative PACT, after PARL Cterminus, and the cleavage site that originates it was denoted β-site. We observed increasing accumulation of PACT starting at 48 h post-transfection in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained in the murine neuroblastoma N2a cell line, but not in the COS-1 or HeLa cell lines; in contrast, MAMP was invariably observed in all these cell lines (Fig. 1E). We conclude that, whereas α-cleavage occurs constitutively, β-cleavage depends on the I-CliP activity of PARL and might be additionally regulated, apparently in a cell-dependent manner. To map the α- and β-cleavage sites, cells were transfected with the PARL-F construct containing an HA tag inserted upstream of TMH1, designated PARL-HF (Fig. 1A). PACT was detected in anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates that were immunoblotted with the anti-HA and anti-FLAG but not with the anti-PNT antibody; this placed the β-cleavage site between the PNT and HA epitopes (Fig. 2A). To identify the cleavage sites of PARL precisely, MAMP and PACT were isolated and subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation. The α-site was located between amino acids 52 and 53, and the β-site was between amino acids 77 and 78 (Fig. 2B). The α-site is embedded within a sequence that is highly conserved in all animal orthologs of PARL, whereas the β-site is strictly conserved only in mammals; a variation of the β-site is seen instead in more distant orthologs, e.g. in amphibia and fish and, particularly, in Drosophila (Fig. 2B). Thus, whereas α-cleavage is associated with mitochondrial import of PARL and is highly conserved in evolution, β-cleavage is likely to be a more specific phenomenon of later evolutionary origin. To investigate the sequence requirements of β-cleavage, we mutated the residues in positions -2 to +2 and, as a control, an upstream doublet of small amino acids resembling the Ser-Ala residues in the β-cleavage site (Fig. 2B). All four mutations around the β-site abolished generation of PACT, whereas the other mutations had no effect (Fig. 2C). To gain further insight into the mechanism of the self-regulated cleavage of PARL, we co-transfected HEK 293 cells with the inactivated PARL-HF S277G mutant and the wild-type or the H335G mutant PARL. The formation of PACT from PARL-HF S277G was observed in the presence of PARL wild-type but not in that of the inactive H335G mutant (Fig. 2D and data not shown), indicating that the proteolytic activity of PARL required for the β-cleavage of its N terminus could be supplied in trans. We conclude that β-cleavage is either executed by an unknown protease (PARLase) that is activated via a PARL-catalyzed cleavage or by PARL itself through an intermolecular reaction. However, the latter appears to be a remote possibility because the β-site is not embedded within a TMH, an essential requirement in all known RIP systems (1Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 4Tandon A. Fraser P. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (Reviews3014)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Urban S.

Nature. 2003; 423: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). β-Cleavage of PARL Generates Pβ, a Small Nuclear Targeted Peptide—In several RIP signaling systems, released cytosolic fragments of the cleaved membrane-bound precursor proteins (e.g. AID/AICD) (6Passer B. Pellegrini L. Russo C. Siegel R.M. Lenardo M.J. Schettini G. Bachmann M. Tabaton M. D'Adamio L. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2000; 2: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) are transported into the nucleus where they regulate gene expression (1Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 7Haines N. Irvine K.D. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the N-terminal peptide generated from the self-regulated β-cleavage of PARL could be a nucleus-targeted molecule. To test this possibility, we transfected HEK 293 and HeLa cells with constructs expressing different portions of the N-terminal domain of PARL fused C-terminally (GFP-PARL) or N-terminally to GFP (PARL-GFP; Fig. 3A). Fluorescent microscopy analysis of HEK 293 cells transfected with a construct expressing PARL-(1-52)-GFP showed exclusive mitochondrial localization of this protein, suggesting that the mitochondrial targeting sequence of PARL is located within the region spanning the first 52 amino acids and the conserved α-cleavage site of PARL N terminus (Fig. 2B). This region is predicted to have an amphiphilic α-helical structure, which is typical of mitochondrial targeting sequences, and is identified as an MTS using the MITOPROT program (21Claros M.G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1995; 11: 441-447PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial targeting was abrogated in GFP-PARL constructs that contained GFP at the N terminus, indicating that the N-terminal position of the MTS is critical (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a PARL-GFP construct that encompassed the region between the α- and β-cleavage sites, (PARL-(53-77)-GFP), which is conserved only in vertebrates, showed a clear nuclear localization (Fig. 3, C and D). Because monopartite and bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS) are found both at the N and C termini of nuclear proteins and their function is often unaffected by their location within a fusion protein (see also GFP-PARL constructs in Fig. 3A) (22Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 341-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we suspected that the region between the α- and β-sites might harbor an NLS. Although this sequence does not contain a canonical monopartite or bipartite nuclear localization signal, it contains three closely spaced doublets of positively charged amino acids (spanning amino acids 54-65), the first and second of which are conserved in vertebrates, whereas the third one is mammalian-specific (Fig. 2B). Clusters of positive charges are characteristic of both types of NLS (22Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 341-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which made us speculate that this sequence of PARL could function as a nuclear localization signal. When any of the two conserved doublets of positively charged amino acids was mutated to a pair of small residues, the nuclear localization of the GFP-PARL N terminus was, indeed, largely abrogated (Fig. 3, A, C, and D). The nuclear/cytosolic distribution of these mutants did not change when cells where treated with a nuclear export machinery inhibitor, leptomycin B (23Gay F. Calvo D. Lo M.C. Ceron J. Maduro M. Lin R. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 717-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (not shown), indicating that these mutations affected the rate of nuclear import rather than the export of the GFP fusion proteins. Our data indicate that only a peptide originated by sequential α- and β-cleavage of PARL has the potential to be imported into the nucleus. We conclude that α-cleavage is constitutive and associated with the removal of the mitochondrial targeting sequence, whereas the β-cleavage is self-regulated and associated to the generation of a nuclear targeting peptide. We designated this nucleus-targeted peptide spanning amino acids 53-77 of PARL Pβ. Accordingly, Pβ is predicted to be a 25-amino acid-long nuclear peptide produced by self-regulated β-cleavage of MAMP. PARL β-Cleavage Is Developmentally Regulated—To investigate β-cleavage of endogenous PARL, we performed immunohistochemical analysis on rat neuronal primary cultures using an antibody raised against a peptide encompassing a sequence located between the α- and β-cleavage sites (anti-PNT; Figs. 1A and 2B). This antibody specifically recognized, by immunohistochemical analysis, PARL-HF in the mitochondria of transfected HEK 293 cells (Supplemental Fig. 2, in the on-line version of this article). In addition, it recognized GFP-PARL-(20-96) in the nuclei of transfected HEK 293 cells (not shown). Specific anti-PNT immunostaining was detected in the nuclei and the mitochondria (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, however, immature neurons showed primarily nuclear immunostaining, whereas differentiated neurons had largely mitochondrial immunostaining. The degree of neuronal differentiation was assessed by means of well established morphological criteria, such as the size of the soma and the dendritic arborization pattern (24Rakic P. Prog. Brain. Res. 2002; 138: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, right panel), as well as by co-immunostaining with anti-βIII tubulin (TuJ-1) and anti-neuronal nuclear protein (NeuN), markers of early and late differentiation, respectively (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that, during neuronal differentiation, PARL is cleaved to generate Pβ, which is then targeted to the nucleus (Fig. 4B). Upon differentiation, however, β-processing stops or greatly decreases, as indicated by the anti-PNT mitochondrial labeling and, conversely, by the lack of nuclear immunostaining in differentiated neurons (Fig. 4B, right panel). Thus, in vivo β-cleavage of PARL appears to be under developmental control, and nuclear accumulation of Pβ might be linked to neuronal development. PARL β-Cleavage Occurs on the Cytosolic Side of the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane—The nuclear localization of the Pβ peptide prompted us to investigate the topology and localization of PARL in the mitochondria to determine how Pβ, upon its liberation, could reach the nucleus. To this end, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the PARL-HF construct, followed by immunogold anti-HA electron microscopy analysis. Specific anti-HA labeling was detected on the cytosolic side of the outer membrane of the mitochondria, indicating that the N terminus of PARL protruded into the cytosol (Fig. 5A). However, when the cells were subjected to hypo-osmotic treatment, which partially disrupts mitochondrial structure and unveils masked epitopes, some immunolabeling was also detected in the inner membrane (Fig. 5A, lower panel). This finding dovetails with the recent observation that OPA1 (25Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie-Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar), the mammalian ortholog of Mgm1p and therefore a probable substrate of PARL, is also present in both mitochondrial membranes (26Satoh M. Hamamoto T. Seo N. Kagawa Y. Endo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 482-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These findings were further supported by the results of a protease protection assay on mitochondrial preparations obtained from PARL-HF-transfected HEK 293 cells. This experiment showed that PACT is sensitive to protease digestion (Fig. 5B), thus locating β-cleavage on the outer membrane. Given the topology of PARL (Fig. 5A), we conclude that β-cleavage occurs at the cytosolic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane and that Pβ is released directly to the cytosol, from where it can move to the nucleus (Fig. 6).Fig. 6A model for the PARL signaling. A signal triggers the I-CliP activity of PARL, resulting in the cleavage of either a hypothetical protease (PARLase, depicted in orange) or a regulator thereof. This cleavage activates PARLase that, in turn, cleaves the N terminus of PARL (MAMP), protruding into the cytosol, at the β-site, thus releasing the Pβ peptide. Pβ is then targeted to the nucleus, thanks to its nuclear localization signal, where it participates in nuclear activities.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study we report that the N-terminal domain of PARL is cleaved at two closely spaced sites, the α- and β-site at positions 52-53 and 77-78, respectively. Whereas the α-cleavage is constitutive and appears to comprise the removal of the mitochondrial targeting sequence, β-cleavage, which was not previously suspected to exist, is regulated and depends on PARL I-CliP activity supplied in trans. These findings suggest that β-cleavage is not simply an alternative cleavage of the mitochondrial import peptide but a distinct event that appears to occur consecutively with the α-cleavage. The β-cleavage generates Pβ, a small peptide that contains a highly effective nuclear localization signal (Fig. 3, C and D) and, in vivo, is targeted to the nuclei (Fig. 4). This conclusion is further supported by the fact that β-cleavage occurs on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial outer membrane (Fig. 5B). The small predicted size of Pβ virtually rules out the possibility that this peptide has an enzymatic activity. It seems likely therefore that Pβ functions through a specific interaction(s) with a nuclear factor(s). Small peptides can have potent biological activity, such as hormonal responses (27Re R.N. Regul. Pept. 2002; 106: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and apoptosis. For instance, humanin is a recently discovered 24-amino acid-long peptide that binds the apoptosis-inducing Bax protein; humanin binding to Bax prevents Bax from associating with mitochondria, therefore suppressing cytochrome c release and preventing apoptosis (28Guo B. Zhai D. Cabezas E. Welsh K. Nouraini S. Satterthwait A.C. Reed J.C. Nature. 2003; 423: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Given that Pβ accumulates in the nuclei of immature neurons, this peptide could contribute to regulation of nuclear activities, e.g. by interacting with a transcription factor(s) during neuronal differentiation (Fig. 6). The apparent “invention” of Pβ and, consequently, of a putative new signaling function of PARL, appears to be a case of “gene sharing” whereby a gene product is recruited, in a specific lineage of descent, for a new function that is often unrelated to the original one (29Piatigorsky J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Many crucial biological functions, e.g. the role of cytochrome c in programmed cell death, evolved in similar ways (30Koonin E. Wolf Y. Karev G. Nature. 2002; 420: 218-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), and this phenomenon seems to be more common than originally suggested (31Jeffery C.J. Ann. Med. 2003; 35: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the Pβ-mediated signaling function of PARL is a vertebrate-specific or, possibly, mammalian innovation, as suggested by the notable conservation of the Pβ NLS as well as its distal sequence among mammals and, to a lesser extent, other vertebrates, but not between vertebrates and insects (Fig. 2B and Supplemental Fig. 1, found in the on-line version of this article). The results presented here suggest that, in addition to its evolutionarily conserved activity in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, mammalian PARL was recruited to execute a novel mitochondria-to-nucleus signaling function. Characteristically, in regard to RIP systems (1Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 4Tandon A. Fraser P. Genome Biol. 2002; 3 (Reviews3014)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this activity appears to be subject to elaborate regulation. Indeed, the release of the Pβ peptide, the putative effector molecule of the PARL signaling, is self-regulated, likely needs the activity of a second protease (PARLase; Fig. 6), and appears to be under developmental control. It has been recently shown that I-CliPs can be substrates for intramembranous proteolysis (33Moliaka Y.K. Grigorenko A. Madera D. Rogaev E.I. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 185-192Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Now we show yet an additional and novel type of RIP, which involves a self-regulated, non-intramembranous cleavage of an I-CliP that results in the release of a nuclear-targeted peptide. To our knowledge, this is the first case of RIP where the putative signaling moiety is part of the I-CliP itself. We thank F. Dumas for protein sequencing, P.

It is still not understood why there are multiple forms of COX enzyme in the same cell type and when the evolutionary duplication of the COX gene occurred.

Intron/exon boundaries are well conserved between coral and mammalian COX genes. mRNAs of the previously reported G. fruticosa COX-A (GenBank™ accession number AY004222) and the novel COX-B share 94% sequence identity in the coding regions and less than 30% in the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region. Transcripts of both COX genes are detectable in coral cells, although the transcriptional level of COX-A is 2 orders of magnitude higher than COX-B. Expression of both coral genes in mammalian cells gave functional proteins with similar catalytic properties. By data base analyses we also detected and constructed different pairs of COX genes from the primitive chordates, Ciona savignyi and Ciona intestinalis. These two gene pairs encode proteins with 50% intra-species and only 70% cross-species sequence identity. Our results suggest that invertebrate COX gene pairs do not correspond to vertebrate COX-1 and COX-2 and are consistent with duplication of the COX gene having occurred independently in corals, ascidians, and vertebrates. It is evident that due to the importance and complexity of its regulatory role, COX has multiple isoforms in all organisms known to express it, and the genes encoding for the isozymes may to be regulated differently.

Vertebrates from fish to human beings have two different COX isozymes, COX-1 and COX-2 (3DeWitt D.L. el-Harith E.A. Smith W.L. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1989; 19: 454-457Google Scholar, 4O'Banion M.K. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4888-4892Google Scholar, 5Reed D.W.

A. 2002; 99: 8418-8423Google Scholar). COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most mammalian tissues, and expression levels of this enzyme do not vary greatly in adult animals. COX-2, although absent in most cells, can be rapidly induced in many cell types by inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (2Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Google Scholar, 7Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Google Scholar). Mammalian COX isozymes are encoded by separate single copy genes that map to distinct chromosomes (1Marnett L.J. Goodwin D.C. Rowlinson S.W. Kalgutkar A.S. Landino L.M. Poulter C. Comprehensive Natural Products Chemistry. 5. Elsevier Science Publishers Ltd., Oxford1999: 225-261Google Scholar, 8Tanabe T. Tohnai N. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68: 95-114Google Scholar). The human gene for COX-1 is ∼22 kb in length with 11 exons and is transcribed as 2.8- and 5.2-kb mRNA (9Yokoyama C. Tanabe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 888-894Google Scholar, 10Hla T. Prostaglandins. 1996; 51: 81-85Google Scholar). The gene for COX-2 is about 8.3 kb long with 10 exons, and it is transcribed as 2.8- and 4.6-kb mRNA variants (11Appleby S.B. Ristimaki A. Neilson K. Narko K. Hla T. Biochem.

Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 551-557Google Scholar). The gene structures of COX-1 and COX-2 demonstrate remarkable conservation of exon/intron junctions (16Kraemer S.A. Meade E.A. DeWitt D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 391-400Google Scholar, 17Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4338-4344Google Scholar, 18Xie W. Merrill J.R. Bradshaw W.S. Simmons D.L.

The main differences between the COX-1 and COX-2 genes consist of different intron lengths and one missing intron in COX-2. Although encoded by different genes, the two COX isozymes share a relatively conserved primary structure (∼60% of amino acid sequence identity), similar structural topology, and an identical catalytic mechanism (20Picot D.

Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 377-404Google Scholar); but the patterns of gene expression and regulation differ greatly, pointing to distinct biological roles (7Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Google Scholar, 15Hla T. Bishop-Bailey D. Liu C.H. Schaefers H.J. Trifan O.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 551-557Google Scholar, 25Smith W.L. Langenbach R. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1491-1495Google Scholar). The origin of prostaglandins, as well the mechanism of their biosynthesis in invertebrates, has been an object of intensive studies and speculations over the years (26Corey E.J. Washburn W.N. Chen J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1973; 95: 2054-2055Google Scholar, 27Brash A.R. Baertschi S.W. Ingram C.D. Harris T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15829-15839Google Scholar, 28Knight J. Taylor G.W.

The first nonvertebrate COX has been cloned and characterized from the prostaglandin-containing corals Gersemia fruticosa (30Varvas K. Järving I. Koljak R. Valmsen K. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9923-9929Google Scholar, 31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar) and Plexaura homomalla (32Valmsen K. Järving I. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Koljak R. Pehk T. Brash A.R. Samel N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7700-7705Google Scholar), indicating the evolutionary conservation of the COX pathway of prostaglandin formation from marine invertebrates to mammals. Here we report on cloning and characterization of two functional cyclooxygenase-encoding genes in the coral G. fruticosa. The exon/intron structure is highly conserved between two coral genes and with all vertebrate COX genes characterized. However, significant differences in the transcriptional level of the coral COX genes point to differences in the gene regulation and/or mRNA stability in cells. In addition, by using data base searches, we constructed and analyzed the sequences and exon/intron structures of COX genes from two ascidians species, Ciona intestinalis and Ciona savignyi. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar) using the method for RNA isolation from marine red or green algae (33Su X. Gibor A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 650-657Google Scholar). mRNA was prepared from total RNA by using an oligo(dT)-cellulose column and purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). First strand cDNA was prepared using an oligo(dT)-adapter primer (34Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Google Scholar). For isolation of genomic DNA, the CTAB procedure (35Weising K. Nybom H. Wolff K. Meyer W. DNA Fingerprinting in Plants and Fungi. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 51-57Google Scholar) was used with slight modifications. Three pieces of G. fruticosa (∼1 g) stored at -70 °C were transferred into 2 ml of prewarmed (65 °C) isolation buffer (2% w/v CTAB, 1.4 m NaCl, 50 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol). Proteinase K (100 μg/ml final concentration) was added, and the tube was incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. The pellet was separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was gently extracted with 2 ml of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1, v/v), and the phases were separated by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 5 min. The aqueous phase was collected and re-extracted with 1 volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (50:49:1, by volume), and the sample was then centrifuged again. To remove the traces of phenol, the aqueous phase was re-extracted with chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1, v/v). For precipitation, 2.5 volumes of ice-cold ethanol were added. DNA precipitated as a whitish network, which was transferred into the washing solution (1 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol) using a glass hook. The pellet was collected by centrifugation (10 min, 5000 × g), dissolved in 200 μl of TE buffer, and quantified by UV spectroscopy. Approximately 1.2 mg of genomic DNA was recovered by using this protocol. Amplification and Cloning of Genomic DNA Sequences—Fragments of genomic DNA were amplified by PCR using 500 ng of G. fruticosa genomic DNA and 0.4 μm gene-specific primers (see Table I) in 50 μl of 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm each dNTP. After a hot start at 95 °C for 5 min, 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Naxo Ltd., Estonia) was added, and the PCR was programmed as follows: 95 °C for 45 s, 50–58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 5 min for 35 cycles; and 72 °C for 10 min. For amplification of longer genomic DNA fragments (3–9 kb), Expand Long Template PCR System with buffer 3 (Roche Diagnostics), 0.5 mm each dNTP, and 0.3 μm primers were used. The PCR program was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 53–62 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 8–15 min; 20 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 53–62 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 8–15 min + 20 s for each cycle; and 68 °C for 15 min. The PCR products visualized on 0.7% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide were purified (Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit, Roche Diagnostics; QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen Inc.) and subcloned into the TA cloning vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega). The exon/intron junctions were determined by comparing the cDNA sequence and genomic sequence. All exons and intron five were sequenced full length. In other cases, the sequences at the borders of the introns were determined by sequencing across the exon/intron borders, and the sizes of introns were estimated by PCR.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR Positions are given relative to the ATG start codon of G. fruticosa COX-A (or COX-B) cDNA.

The first strand cDNA was synthesized using 2 μg of G. fruticosa poly(A)+ RNA and COX-B-specific primer TNTS-down (Table I) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The first strand cDNA was purified by the QIA-quick PCR purification kit (Qiagen Inc.). Terminal transferase was used to add a homopolymeric A-tail to the 3′-end of the cDNA. 5 μl (1:5) of tailed cDNA was amplified by PCR using a nested gene-specific primer DCTR-down, the oligo(dT)-anchor primer (0.3 μm), and the Expand Long Template PCR System with buffer 1 (Roche Diagnostics). The PCR program was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 5 min; 20 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 5 min + 20 s for each cycle; and 68 °C for 10 min. 0.01 μlofthe first round reaction products (added as a 100-fold dilution) was further amplified by a second PCR using a nested gene-specific primer TCDC-down and the PCR anchor primer. 3′-RACE—3′-RACE of COX-B was accomplished by using first strand cDNA prepared using G. fruticosa mRNA and the adaptor-linked oligo(dT) primer (31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar). The upstream primers for the first and second rounds of PCR were COX-B-specific; FKG-up and QET-up (Table I). The PCR program was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 5 min; 20 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 5 min + 20 s for each cycle; and 68 °C for 10 min. Full-length cDNA Clones—Full-length open reading frame of the G. fruticosa COX-B cDNA was obtained by PCR. The BamHI site was added at the 5′-end of the upstream and downstream primer to facilitate subcloning (primers GGGN-up and LSAK-down in Table I). PCR was run using 1 μl of the first strand cDNA and the Expand Long Template PCR System with buffer 3 (Roche Diagnostics), 0.5 mm each dNTP, and 0.3 μm primers. The PCR program was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 2 min; 10 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min; 20 cycles at 93 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 68 °C for 3 min + 20 s for each cycle; and 68 °C for 10 min. The ends of the PCR product were digested with BamHI. Digested product was purified on agarose gel and cloned into pCG and pCG-E2Tag (36Kaldalu N. Lepik D. Kristjuhan A. Ustav M. BioTechniques. 2000; 28: 456-462Google Scholar) vector for transient expression in COS-7 cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Qiagen plasmid purification system. Three clones were full-length sequenced and expressed. The rabbit COX-2 cDNA was isolated from the RabCOX-2-pcDNA3.1 construct (kind gift from Dr. Matthew Breyer, Vanderbilt University), cloned into pCG expression vector, and used as a positive control in transfections for tunicamycin treatments. The clones were sequenced using a DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Biosciences) and an ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer. Sequence alignments were obtained with the Clustal method using the Lasergene program (DNAstar, Inc.). The signal peptide cleavage site was predicted using SignalP version 1.1 (37Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar). Untranslated regions of COX-A and COX-B mRNA were analyzed using UTRdb (38Pesole G. Liuni S. Grillo G. Licciulli F. Mignone F. Gissi C. Saccone C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 335-340Google Scholar). For determination of relative concentration of COX-A and COX-B transcripts in the G. fruticosa mRNA, three different primer pairs were used: VAV-up versus DMV-down, ESGA-up versus DYA-down, and FKG-up versus TNTS-down (see Table I). The primer pairs were tested for specificity in PCR with different dilutions (1 fg to 10 ng per μl) of cloned COX-A and COX-B in the pCG-E2Tag vector (total size about 6100 bp). The cloned DNA was isolated using the Qiagen plasmid purification system. The concentrations of the stock solutions (20 ng per μl) were estimated by UV spectrum and agarose gel electrophoresis. The working solutions were prepared by serial 4–5-fold dilutions of the original stock solution. PCRs were run at three different hybridization temperatures: 50, 55, and 60 °C. cDNA for quantification was synthesized from 2.9 μg of mRNA in a 50-μl reaction volume. 1 μl of 5–10,000 times diluted cDNA synthesis reaction (equal to 5.8 pg to 11 ng of mRNA) was used in a 25-μl PCR volume. For each run, a master mix, containing all components except DNA, was prepared and aliquoted into separate tubes to ensure that all reactions had the same starting conditions. cDNA dilutions and control dilutions of cloned COX genes were run and analyzed at the same time using the same master mix. Quantitative PCR was performed in 25 μl of 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 0.4 μm of primers. After the hot start at 95 °C for 5 min, 0.6 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Naxo Ltd.) in 3 μl of buffer was added, and the PCR was programmed as follows: 95 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min for 30 cycles; and 72 °C for 10 min. The amplification products were visualized on 2% agarose gel using ethidium bromide. Five sets of quantitative PCR were performed independently. For determination of ratio of COX-A and COX-B in the G. fruticosa genomic DNA, 1–500 ng of genomic DNA and the primer pair FFAQ-up versus FMY-down were used (Table I). PCR was performed in 50 μl of 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) containing 20 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% Tween 20, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 0.4 μm primers. After the hot start at 95 °C for 5 min, 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Naxo Ltd.) in 3 μl of buffer was added, and the PCR was run as described for cDNA quantification. The amplification products were visualized on 1.2% agarose gel using ethidium bromide. The COS-7 cells were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed as described previously (31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar) with slight modifications. 250 μl of cell suspension (1 × 107 cells/ml) was mixed with 400 ng of plasmid DNA and 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA in a disposable electroporation cuvette and was subjected to an electric discharge of 180 V using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 970-microfarad capacity. For activity assay, transfected cells were grown at 28 °C for 72 h. Tunicamycin treatments of COS-7 cells transfected with pCG-COX-A, pCG-COX-B, or pCG-RabCOX-2 constructs were performed by adding tunicamycin (Sigma) to the media at final concentration of 0.3 or 1.0 μg/ml 4 h post-transfection. The cells were grown at 37 °C and harvested at 28 h post-transfection. Transfected cells from 100-mm diameter dishes were lysed in 200 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-8% PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) as described previously (31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with anti-E2Tag mouse monoclonal antibody (Quattromed Ltd., Estonia) or rat COX-2-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen) and with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (LabAs Ltd., Estonia) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Detection was performed using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The subcellular localization of recombinant G. fruticosa COX-B in COS-7 cells was determined using rat COX-2-specific monoclonal antibody and immunofluorescence analysis as described previously (31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar). Transfected cells from four tissue culture plates (∼6 × 106 cells) were treated with 0.3 m EDTA/phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged again. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and disrupted by sonication. The sonicated cells were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h to yield the microsomal fraction. The membranes were resuspended by homogenization in a small volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) followed by cyclooxygenase assay. Incubations of the microsomal fraction of transfected cells with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (final concentration of 50 μm) were performed in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm adrenaline and 1 μm hemin for 10 min at room temperature as described previously (31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by addition of 100 μl of 100 mm SnCl2 as an aqueous suspension. After acidification to pH 3, the products were recovered by extraction with ethyl acetate and subjected to TLC analysis with unlabeled authentic standards (a generous gift from Kevelt Ltd., Estonia) (31Koljak R. Järving I. Kurg R. Boeglin W.E. Varvas K. Valmsen K. Ustav M. Brash A.R. Samel N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7033-7040Google Scholar). For the product quantification, the TLC plates were cut into zones and extracted with methanol. The radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. The deduced protein sequences and genomic structures of the pufferfish Takifugu rubripes and ascidians C. intestinalis and Ciona savignyi COX-related genes were obtained using BLAST searches (tblastn) of Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (Walnut Creek, CA) and Whitehead Institute (Cambridge, MA) corresponding genome data bases (40Altschul S.F.

Search was based on homology with known COX protein sequences. Characterization of the G. fruticosa COX-B mRNA—The initial information about the G. fruticosa COX-B was obtained from PCR cloning and sequencing of fragments of genomic DNA (see below). COX-B-specific primers were designed, and extension of the 5′- and 3′-ends of COX-B cDNA was achieved using RACE-PCR methodology. The obtained nucleotide sequence consisted of a 147-nucleotide 5′-UTR, a 1788-nucleotide protein coding region, and the 250- or 420-nucleotide 3′-UTR (excluding the poly(A) tail), with a total length of 2358 nucleotides (Table II). The open reading frame encoded a protein of 596 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 68.5 kDa.Table IIComparison of mRNAs of G. fruticosa COX-A and COX-BRegionG. fruticosa COX-AG. fruticosa COX-BIdentity%5′-UTR16114730.1Coding region1767 (589 amino acids)1788 (596 amino acids)93.6 (93.4)3′-UTR171 or 337250 or 42027.9 Open table in a new tab The deduced amino acid sequence of G. fruticosa COX-B was determined from the coding region of the COX-B transcript, and comparisons were made with G. fruticosa COX-A (Table II and Fig. 1) and other known cyclooxygenases. The enzyme appears to share all the important structural and functional domains implicated in enzyme function. The predicted protein is closely related to the G. fruticosa COX-A (93% identity) and shares 79% identity with P. homomalla COX. Overall comparisons between G. fruticosa COX-B and vertebrate COX-1 and COX-2 revealed about 40–43 and 43–45% of amino acid identity, respectively. The main difference between G. fruticosa COX-A and COX-B coding regions is an insertion of 21 nucleotides near the 5′-end of COX-B, in the region where the first intron is located in vertebrate COX-1 genes. The 21-nucleotide insert in the COX-B mRNA resulted in a 7-residue insert in the N-terminal signal peptide and affects the predicted cleavage site of the signal peptide (Fig. 1) (37Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Google Scholar). The proposed signal peptide of COX-B, 35 N-terminal amino acids, includes two conserved cysteines (Cys36 and Cys37 in ovine COX-1 numbering) that are involved in formation of disulfide bonds in the ovine COX-1 and murine COX-2 (20Picot D.

https://openalex.org/W2034282698,"Angiomotin was identified by its ability to bind angiostatin and has been shown to mediate its activity in vitro. The family of angiomotin-like protein consists of three members that have coiled-coil domains and conserved c-terminal PDZ-binding motifs. We show here that expression of angiomotin in mouse aortic endothelial (MAE) cells results in stabilization of tubes in the Matrigel assay. Control tubes start to regress after 72 h, whereas MAE-angiomotin (MAE Amot) tubes were stable for over 30 days. In contrast, cells expressing a functional mutant lacking the PDZ protein interaction motif did not migrate and form tubes. Cells from the established tubes invaded into the solidified matrigel. We therefore tested whether angiomotin promotes endothelial invasion. In microcarrier-based invasion in vitro assay, angiomotin-expressing cells invaded collagen matrix and formed tube-like branches. This was confirmed in vivo as injection of MAE-Amot cells promoted tumor growth and invasion into surrounding muscle tissue. Injection of cells transfected with the functional mutant resulted in establishment of noninvasive tumors surrounded by a capsule of fibrous tissue. These tumors remained in constant size or dormant over 3 weeks. Zymogel analysis of the transfected cells did not reveal any differences in proteolytic activity. However, time-lapse photography showed a significant increase in random motility in MAE-Amot cells. We conclude that angiomotin may promote angiogenesis by both stimulating invasion as well as stabilizing established tubes."
https://openalex.org/W1983931098,"The amino acid sequence of ERp57, which functions in the endoplasmic reticulum together with the lectins calreticulin and calnexin to achieve folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins, is highly similar to that of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), but they have their own distinct roles in protein folding. We have characterized the domain structure of ERp57 by limited proteolysis and N-terminal sequencing and have found it to be similar but not identical to that of PDI. ERp57 had three major protease-sensitive regions, the first of which was located between residues 120 and 150, the second between 201 and 215, and the third between 313 and 341, the data thus being consistent with a four-domain structure abb′a′. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli was used to verify the domain boundaries. Each single domain and a b′a′ double domain could be produced in the form of soluble, folded polypeptides, as verified by circular dichroism spectra and urea gradient gel electrophoresis. When the ability of ERp57 and its a and a′ domains to fold denatured RNase A was studied by electrospray mass analyses, ERp57 markedly enhanced the folding rate at early time points, although less effectively than PDI, but was an ineffective catalyst of the overall process. The a and a′ domains produced only minor, if any, increases in the folding rate at the early stages and no increase at the late stages. Interaction of the soluble ERp57 domains with the P domain of calreticulin was studied by chemical cross-linking in vitro. None of the single ERp57 domains nor the b′a′ double domain could be cross-linked to the P domain, whereas cross-linking was obtained with a hybrid ERpabb′PDIa′c polypeptide but not with ERpabPDIb′a′c, indicating that multiple domains are involved in this protein-protein interaction and that the b′ domain of ERp57 cannot be replaced by that of PDI.

ERp57 is a member of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) oxidoreductase family (3Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Google Scholar, 4Ferrari D.M. Söling H.-D. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 1-10Google Scholar) and has two thioredoxin-like domains with -Cys-Gly-His-Cyscatalytic site motifs in positions corresponding to the thioredoxin-like domains a and a′ of PDI, which consists altogether of domains a, b, b′, and a′ plus an acidic C-terminal extension c (5Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Google Scholar). ERp57 also shows a significant sequence similarity to PDI in regions corresponding to domains b and b′ (6Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Google Scholar). No similarity is found in the organization of the human genes or gene loci for ERp57 and PDI, however (7Koivunen P. Horelli-Kuitunen N. Helaakoski T. Karvonen P. Jaakkola M. Palotie A. Kivirikko K.I. Genomics. 1997; 42: 397-404Google Scholar). Despite the 56% overall amino acid sequence similarity between PDI and ERp57, the latter does not substitute for PDI as the β subunit in the assembly of the collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase α2β2 tetramer (6Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Google Scholar), an enzyme involved in the synthesis of collagens (8Kivirikko K.I.

Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 15-24Google Scholar), but the N-terminal domains a and b of ERp57 can in part substitute for those of PDI in this assembly (11Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11287-11293Google Scholar). ERp57 possesses disulfide oxidoreductase activity in vitro, but the level is lower than that of PDI (12Srivastava S.P. Fuchs J.A. Holtzman J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 971-978Google Scholar, 13Bourdi M. Demady D. Martin J.L. Jabbour S.K. Martin B.M. George J.W. Pohl L.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 397-403Google Scholar, 14Hirano N. Shibasaki F. Sakai R. Tanaka T. Nishida J. Yazaki Y. Takenawa T. Hirai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 336-342Google Scholar). Interestingly, this activity is markedly increased in the presence of CNX or CRT (15Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6012Google Scholar). ERp57 present in transient complexes with its substrates, and CNX and CRT catalyzes the formation and isomerization of disulfide bonds in the synthesis of glycoproteins in vivo (16Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Google Scholar). It is also involved in the folding of a major histocompatibility complex class I heavy chain in a system of semipermeabilized cells, leading to disulfide bond formation in this protein when in interaction with ERp57 (17Farmery M.R. Allen S. Allen A.J. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14933-14938Google Scholar). ERp57 even interacts with glycoproteins having no cysteine residues, and thus its role in glycoprotein folding may be more extensive than that of a basic oxidoreductase (18Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar, 19Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Google Scholar). PDI can likewise become bound to glycoproteins, but it is not co-precipitated from cells with CNX and CRT, indicating that PDI and the lectins are not associated partners in glycoprotein folding in vivo (16Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Google Scholar, 20Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). The exact mode of ERp57 action in glycoprotein folding is still partly unknown. A freshly attached core oligosaccharide of an unfolded glycoprotein is first trimmed by glucosidases I and II, after which the glycoprotein becomes bound to CNX or CRT, this being followed by binding of the complex to ERp57 (18Oliver J.D. van der Wal F.J. Bulleid N.J. High S. Science. 1997; 275: 86-88Google Scholar, 21Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide motif does not act as the binding site between ERp57 and the lectins, but instead, ERp57 becomes directly bound to CNX and CRT (20Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide binding function of CRT and CNX has been mapped to a distinct lectin domain of the polypeptides (22Peterson J.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2775-2784Google Scholar). These P domains have been found to form a hairpin motif (23Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Güntert P. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Google Scholar), and the tip of the hairpin is believed to be involved in the protein-protein interactions and to bind ERp57 (2Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 3: 181-191Google Scholar, 23Ellgaard L. Riek R. Herrmann T. Güntert P. Helenius A. Wüthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3133-3138Google Scholar). All four PDI domains have the thioredoxin fold, although domains b and b′ show no amino acid sequence similarity to thioredoxin (24Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Google Scholar, 25Dijkstra K. Karvonen P. Pirneskoski A. Koivunen P. Kivirikko K.I. Darby N.J. van Straaten M. Scheek R.M. Kemmink J. J. Biomol.

No three-dimensional structure is available for ERp57, but nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) characterization of its a′ domain has shown that it is structurally related to the corresponding PDI domain and also possesses the thioredoxin fold (27Silvennoinen L. Karvonen P. Koivunen P. Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpeläinen I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 385-386Google Scholar). The present work sets out to study the ERp57 domain architecture by limited proteolysis and recombinant protein expression methods. The structures of the soluble individual domains were studied in more detail by circular dichroism (CD) spectrum analysis and urea gradient gel electrophoresis. The abilities of ERp57 and the a and a′ domains to fold denatured RNase A were also examined, as was the ability of the individual domains to interact with the P domain of CRT. Construction of a Baculovirus Transfer Vector and Generation of a Recombinant ERp57 Baculovirus—An ERp57 expression vector containing a histidine tag in its N terminus was synthesized by PCR using human ERp57 cDNA (6Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Google Scholar) as a template. Two fragments, named Eag3His and 3HisAvr, were produced. Eag3His contained an EagI site at its 5′ end, nucleotides coding for the ERp57 signal peptide, and 9 additional nucleotides coding for 3 histidines at its 3′ end, whereas 3HisAvr contained nucleotides coding for 3 histidines at its 5′ end followed by nucleotides coding for the N terminus of the mature ERp57 polypeptide, extending to an internal AvrII site at 420 bp. The PCR products were blunt-ended and digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes. These fragments were then ligated together with an AvrII-EcoRI-digested fragment of human ERp57 cDNA (6Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Google Scholar) and cloned into the EagI-EcoRI sites in pVL1392 (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid encoding the ERp57 signal peptide followed by 6 histidines and the mature human ERp57 was co-transfected into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells with a modified Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold, Pharmingen) by calcium phosphate transfection (28Gruenwald S. Heitz J. Baculovirus Expression Vector System, Procedures and Methods Manual. Pharmingen, San Diego, CA1994Google Scholar). The resultant viral pool was collected 4 days later, amplified twice, and used for recombinant protein production. Production of ERp57 in Insect Cells and Purification of the Protein— Sf9 cells were cultured in suspension in TNM-FH medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Bioclear) at 27 °C. The cells were infected with a baculovirus coding for the untagged ERp57 at a multiplicity of 5, whereas the histidine-tagged ERp57 (HIS-ERp57) was produced in High Five (H5) insect cells in SF-900 II SFM medium (Invitrogen) without any serum supplement. The cells expressing the untagged ERp57 (6Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Google Scholar) were harvested 72 h after infection and washed with a solution of 0.15 m NaCl and 0.02 m phosphate, pH 7.4, homogenized in a solution of 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 m Trisacetate, pH 7.8, and centrifuged at 170,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 high-resolution column (Amersham Biosciences) calibrated with molecular weight standards, and the fractions eluted from the column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and by non-denaturing PAGE. H5 cells expressing the histidine-tagged ERp57 were homogenized in a solution of 0.05 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02 m Tris, pH 8, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+ affinity column followed by washing with a buffer containing 30 mm imidazole and elution with a gradient of 30–500 mm imidazole. The fractions containing the protein were pooled, dialyzed against a solution of 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and applied to a HiTrap Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences), washed with a buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl, and eluted with a gradient of 150–400 mm NaCl. The fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated with a Biomax Ultrafree centrifugal filter device (Millipore). Protein concentration was determined by Roti-Quant (Roth). Limited Proteolysis of the Purified ERp57 Protein—The purified HIS-ERp57 (3 μg) was incubated with 60 or 120 ng of trypsin, V8 protease, proteinase K, chymotrypsin, or thermolysin at 37 °C for 15–90 min. The digestions were stopped by adding 1.5 mmol of Pefabloc SC (Roche Applied Science), except for the thermolysin digestions, which were terminated by the addition of 1.5 mmol of EDTA. The digested samples were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Individual bands were excised and subjected to N-terminal sequencing in a Procise 492 sequencer (PE Biosystems). Construction of Escherichia coli Expression Vectors for ERp57 and Its Domains—A cDNA fragment of ERp57 lacking the signal peptide and stop codon but containing a NcoI site at the 5′ end and a BglII site at the 3′ end was generated by PCR using the ERp57 cDNA (6Koivunen P. Helaakoski T. Annunen P. Veijola J. Räisänen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 599-605Google Scholar) as a template. This fragment was ligated into the NcoI-BglII sites in pQE60 (Qiagen). The 4th and 5th nucleotides of the NcoI site were then mutated to A and T, resulting in an ATG sequence. This plasmid was digested with EcoRI-HindIII, and the fragment obtained was subsequently ligated into the corresponding sites in pET21(+) (Novagen). This plasmid thus encodes the mature ERp57 polypeptide, which contains a methionine in its N terminus and an arginine, a serine, and a His tag in its C terminus. Expression constructs for ERp1–111, ERp1–113, ERp1–115, ERp107–216, ERp107–326, ERp211–348, ERp211–468, ERp222–326, and ERp222–348 were generated by PCR. The forward primers contained a BamHI site at their 5′ end, and the reverse primers contained a HindIII site at their 3′ end. The PCR products were first ligated into pQE30 (Qiagen) and then excised from the vector with EcoRI and HindIII, generating fragments that contained a ribosome binding site and nucleotides encoding the amino acids Met-Arg-Gly-Ser-(His)6-Gly-Ser before the first ERp57 amino acid indicated for the construct. These fragments were subsequently cloned into pET21(+) (Novagen). Expression constructs for ERp1–123 and ERp1–119, containing NcoI and HindIII sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends, were generated by PCR and cloned into the corresponding sites in pET32a (Novagen). ERp349–468 was generated as described earlier (27Silvennoinen L. Karvonen P. Koivunen P. Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpeläinen I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 385-386Google Scholar). Production of ERp57 and Its Domains in E. coli and Purification of the Polypeptides—The expression constructs generated in pET21(+) and pET32a (Novagen) were transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) Star or Origami (DE3) (Novagen) and induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested 3 h after induction, suspended in 0.05 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.02 m Tris, pH 8, supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and sonicated on ice. After centrifugation at 60,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were applied to Ni2+ affinity columns, washed, and eluted as described above for HIS-ERp57 produced in insect cells, and fractions containing the desired proteins were pooled. The remaining pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions of ERp57, ERp1–113, and ERp107–216 were then applied to a Sephacryl S-100 high resolution column (Amersham Biosciences) and fractions of ERp211–348 and ERp211–468 were applied to a Superdex 75 HR column (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated and eluted with 0.2 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing the protein were pooled and concentrated, and the protein concentrations were determined as above. ERp349–468 was produced and purified as described earlier (27Silvennoinen L. Karvonen P. Koivunen P. Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpeläinen I. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 385-386Google Scholar). Transverse Urea Gradient Gel Electrophoresis—Electrophoresis of HIS-ERp57 (data not shown), ERp1–113, ERp107–216, ERp211–348, ERp211–468 (data not shown), and ERp349–468 was carried out in a urea gradient increasing from 0 on the left to 8 m on the right, with a compensating 11–7% acryl amide gradient, in 0.05 m Tris acetate, pH 4.0. Light-induced polymerization of the gels was initiated with 2 mm methylene, and after overnight incubation, they were rotated 90°, and samples of 50 μg were loaded. The gel assembly was cooled to 4 °C, pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 100 V, and electrophoresed for 4 h at 150 V for the domains and at 200 V for HIS-ERp57, after which the gel was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Circular Dichroism Spectrum Analyses—Circular dichroism spectra of HIS-ERp57, ERp1–113 (domain a), ERp107–216 (domain b), ERp211–348 (domain b′), ERp211–468 (domains b′a′), and ERp349–468 (domain a′) were measured with a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter in a 1-mm quartz cuvette at 20 °C. The spectra were averages of five scans. All the proteins analyzed were dissolved in H2O except for ERp107–216 (domain b), which was dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. RNase A Folding Analysis—RNase A was reduced and denatured as described earlier (29Torrella C. Ruoppolo M. Marino G. Pucci P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 301-306Google Scholar, 30Ruoppolo M. Orrù S. Talamo F. Ljung J. Pirneskoski A. Kivirikko K.I. Marino G. Koivunen P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 939-952Google Scholar). The folding reactions were carried out at 25 °C in a nitrogen atmosphere in the presence of 1 mg/ml RNase A, 1.5 mm reduced glutathione (GSH), 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and 10 or 50 μm HIS-ERp57, ERp1–113 (domain a), or ERp349–468 (domain a′) dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and preincubated in the presence of 1.5 mm GSH/0.3 mm GSSG redox buffer for 10 min at 25 °C. Aliquots of the folding mixtures were taken at different time intervals, and the protein samples were alkylated by the addition of iodoacetamide (29Torrella C. Ruoppolo M. Marino G. Pucci P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 301-306Google Scholar, 30Ruoppolo M. Orrù S. Talamo F. Ljung J. Pirneskoski A. Kivirikko K.I. Marino G. Koivunen P. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 939-952Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) analyses of the samples were carried out using a Quattro Micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ion source (Micromass, Manchester, UK, 30). Chemical Cross-linking—A cDNA for the P domain of CRT was amplified by PCR from a rat fetal liver cDNA pool (BD Biosciences), cloned into pET32(+) (Novagen), expressed as a fusion protein with thioredoxin in E. coli, and purified by exploiting the histidine tag at the C terminus of thioredoxin. The fusion partner was cleaved with enterokinase (Sigma). Histidine tags were introduced between the ERp57 signal peptide and the N terminus of the two baculovirus expression constructs ERpabb′PDIa′c and ERpabPDIb′a′c generated earlier, coding for amino acids 1–352 of ERp57 and 351–491 of PDI and for 1–218 of ERp57 and 219–491 of PDI, respectively (11Pirneskoski A. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. Kivirikko K.I. Koivunen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11287-11293Google Scholar). The hybrid polypeptides were expressed in H5 insect cells and purified by exploiting the histidine tags at their N termini, as described earlier for HIS-ERp57. Cross-linking studies with 1 μg of the purified ERp57 domains and the hybrid ERpabb′PDIa′c and ERpabPDIb′a′c polypeptides with 1 μg of the CRT P domain and disuccinimidyl glutarate were carried out on ice for 2 h (31Frickel E.-M. Riek R. Jelesarov I. Wüthrich K. Ellgaard L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1954-1959Google Scholar). The reactions were analyzed by reducing 10 and 15% SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining. Gel Filtration Reveals That ERp57 Expressed in Insect Cells Is a Monomer—To study whether ERp57, like PDI (32Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 213: 225-234Google Scholar), is a homodimer, a recombinant baculovirus encoding the human ERp57 polypeptide without a histidine tag was used to infect Sf9 insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection and homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and the supernatant was applied to a Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column calibrated with polypeptide standards. The elution position of ERp57 was determined by SDS-PAGE and non-denaturing PAGE analyses of the fractions and was found to correspond to that of a molecular mass of about 60 kDa (data not shown), thus indicating that the polypeptide was eluted as a monomer. Limited Proteolysis of ERp57 Indicates a Four-domain Structure Similar to That of PDI—To purify the recombinant ERp57 polypeptide for limited proteolysis studies, a baculovirus encoding human ERp57 with a histidine tag in its N terminus was generated and used to infect H5 insect cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a buffer containing Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The pellet was solubilized in 1% SDS, and the Triton X-100-soluble and SDS-soluble proteins were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Most of the recombinant protein was found in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). This fraction was then applied to an Ni2+ charged chelating Sepharose column eluted by an imidazole gradient. The fractions were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and those containing the ERp57 protein were pooled and concentrated (Fig. 1, lane 3). Trypsin, thermolysin, proteinase K, chymotrypsin, and V8 protease were used to digest the purified HIS-ERp57 polypeptide to determine the conditions favoring its limited degradation to protease-resistant fragments. Chymotrypsin and V8 protease were found to be the most suitable enzymes for this purpose. The molecular masses of the protease-resistant fragments were determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the major bands were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for N-terminal sequencing. Digestion of HIS-ERp57 with chymotrypsin gave several major bands, of which those of about 31, 20, 19, 17, and 14.5 kDa (Fig. 2, lane 1) were identified by N-terminal sequencing. The 31-kDa fragment was found to begin at Ile212, the 20-kDa fragment was found to begin at Val313, and the 19-kDa fragment was found to begin at Ser319 (Fig. 2, lane 1). The 17-kDa band gave two N-terminal sequences, one of which began at Leu329 and the other of which began 12 residues later, at Leu341 (Fig. 2, lane 1). The sizes of these fragments suggested that they all extended to about residues 470–481, i.e. close to the C terminus of the polypeptide. The 14.5-kDa fragment began at the histidine tag followed by the first amino acids of the ERp57 polypeptide (Fig. 2, lane 1), and its C terminus was probably around residue 120, possibly after Phe121, as deduced from the cleavage specificity of chymotrypsin. The digestion patterns obtained with V8 protease consisted of numerous bands, of which the N termini of nine were sequenced (Fig. 2, lane 2). The highest molecular mass polypeptide, of about 55 kDa, began with the histidine tag followed by the N-terminal amino acids of ERp57, thus corresponding to an undigested polypeptide (Fig. 2, lane 2). The 41-kDa fragment began at Phe121, and the 38-kDa fragment began at Phe147 (Fig. 2, lane 2), both probably extending to about the C terminus of the polypeptide. The N termini of the 32- and 31-kDa fragments corresponded to Gln201 and Asn215, and these fragments probably also extended approximately to the C terminus of the polypeptide, whereas the N terminus of the 24-kDa fragment was identical to that of the 41-kDa fragment, i.e. Phe121 (Fig. 2, lane 2), and it probably ended after Glu326. The 18-kDa fragment began at Arg327, whereas the 16.5-kDa fragment began with the histidine tag (Fig. 2, lane 2) and probably extended to Glu132. The smallest molecular mass fragment sequenced was of 14.5 kDa and gave three N termini, the histidine tag, Gln201, and Asn215 (Fig. 2, lane 2), these fragments probably continuing to about Glu118–120, Glu326, and Asp334. The digestions with trypsin yielded two major bands of 31 and 16 kDa, the N termini of which were at Phe211 and Tyr340, respectively (Fig. 3), whereas the thermolysin digestions gave three fragments of 31, 17-, and 14.5-kDa, the largest of which started at Phe211. The 17-kDa fragment had two N termini, Phe333 and Leu341 (Fig. 3), whereas the smallest fragment began with the histidine tag and probably extended to about residue 120. The N termini of fragments generated by thermolysin were not strictly in agreement with its substrate specificity. The digestions with proteinase K resulted in the largest population of bands. The N termini of the 16.5- and 14.5-kDa fragments were sequenced, and both were found to begin with the histidine tag and were likely to extend to about residues 140 and 120, respectively (Fig. 3). The above experiments identified three major protease-sensitive regions in the HIS-ERp57 polypeptide that probably correspond to four protease-resistant domains. The first region, identified by all the proteases studied except for trypsin, begins at the histidine tag located at the N terminus of the polypeptide. The molecular weights of six fragments obtained with three proteases suggested that four of them ended at about residue 120, one ended at about 130, and one ended at about 140. In agreement with this, the N termini of two fragments were at Phe121 and one at Phe147. The first protease-sensitive region must thus begin around residue 120, which seems to be the main site, and extend until residue 140–150. Seven fragments obtained by four proteases had their N termini between residues 201 and 215, suggesting that the second protease-sensitive region is relatively short and well defined. Interestingly, we did not find the second protease-resistant domain in the form of a single fragment in any of the digestions but only together with either the third or the third and fourth protease-resistant domains. Eight fragments obtained with three proteases had their N termini between residues 313 and 341, six of them between 327 and 341. The molecular weights of three fragments obtained with the V8 protease suggested that their C termini were likewise between residues 326 and 334. The third protease-resistant region is thus located between residues 313 and 341, and more particularly, between 326 and 341. The proteolysis data thus suggest that ERp57, like PDI ("
https://openalex.org/W2074841642,"Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular deposition of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide containing neuritic plaques. Aβ peptides are proteolytically derived from the membrane-bound amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although the function of APP is not entirely clear, previous studies demonstrate that neuronal APP colocalizes with β1 integrin receptors at sites of focal adhesion, suggesting that APP is involved in mediating neuronal process adhesion. Integrin-dependent adhesion is also a well-characterized component of immune cell proinflammatory activation. Using primary mouse microglia and the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, we have begun investigating the role of APP in integrin-dependent activation. Co-immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that APP is recruited into a multi-receptor signaling complex during β1 integrin-mediated adhesion of monocytes. Stimulation induces a subsequent, specific recruitment of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to APP, including Lyn and Syk. Antibody cross-linking of cell surface APP leads to a similar response characterized by activation and recruitment of tyrosine kinases to APP as well as subsequent activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and increased proinflammatory protein levels. These data demonstrate that APP can act as a proinflammatory receptor in monocytic lineage cells and provide insight into the contribution of this protein to the inflammatory conditions described in Alzheimer's disease.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) 1The abbreviations used are: APP, amyloid precursor protein; Aβ, β-amyloid; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PP1, 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine; siRNA, small interference RNA; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; IL, interleukin; COX, cyclooxygenase. is a ubiquitously expressed integral membrane protein from which the 1-40 and 1-42 residue β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are proteolytically cleaved (1Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Google Scholar). The longer, more insoluble peptide, Aβ1-42, is a marked component of the extracellular neuritic plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (2Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 432-433Google Scholar). The physiologic role for APP independent of the production of the Aβ peptides remains to be elucidated. Although only a fraction of the pool of cellular APP localizes to the plasma membrane, the overall structure of the protein suggests that APP may function as a receptor or growth factor (3Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 327-331Google Scholar). APP is an integral transmembrane glycoprotein that exists as one of three major splice variants consisting of either 695, 751, or 770 amino acid residues (4Ponte P. Gonzalez-DeWhitt P. Schilling J. Miller J. Hsu D. Greenberg B. Davis K. Wallace W. Lieberburg I. Fuller F. Nature. 1988; 331: 525-527Google Scholar). These isoforms are composed of a large glycosylated extracellular region, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a short, highly conserved cytoplasmic tail (1Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Google Scholar). Interestingly, the cytoplasmic domain of APP contains a well-defined consensus motif found in tyrosine kinase receptors, NPXY, implicating a role in signal transduction that is reinforced by the ability of multiple adaptor proteins including Fe65 and X11 to interact with this specific motif on neuronal APP (5Bressler S.L. Gray M.D. Sopher B.L. Hu Q. Hearn M.G. Pham D.G. Dinulos M.B. Fukuchi K. Sisodia S.S. Miller M.A. Disteche C.M. Martin G.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1589-1598Google Scholar, 6Fiore F. Zambrano N.

A. 1996; 93: 10832-10837Google Scholar). The phosphotyrosine-binding domains of Fe65 and X11 bind the phosphotyrosine binding motif (Y682ENPTY687) on the intracellular domain of APP. However, there is no evidence that phosphorylation of this domain is required for the interaction to occur (8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Google Scholar, 9Zambrano N. Buxbaum J.D. Minopoli G. Fiore F. De Candia P. De Renzis S. Faraonio R. Sabo S. Cheetham J. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6399-6405Google Scholar). The adaptor protein Shc has also been identified as an APP-interacting protein; however, this interaction is promoted by tyrosine phosphorylation of the APP phosphotyrosine-binding motif (10Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Google Scholar, 11Russo C. Dolcini V. Salis S. Venezia V. Zambrano N. Russo T. Schettini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35282-35288Google Scholar). These data suggest that APP is capable of serving as a docking molecule in membrane proximal signaling events. It has also been demonstrated that neuronal APP colocalizes with β1 integrins at point contacts, suggesting a possible role in adhesion (12Yamazaki T. Koo E.H. Selkoe D.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1004-1010Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that APP binds directly to extracellular matrix molecules, particularly collagen type I (13Beher D. Hesse L. Masters C.L. Multhaup G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1613-1620Google Scholar). Integrins are a family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors composed of an α and β subunit that are expressed in a diverse group of cell types. There are 16 identified α and 8 β subunits that combine to form at least 22 different αβ heterodimeric integrin receptors. The specific combination of subunits dictates the binding specificity as well as overall function of the integrin receptor (14Plow E.F. Haas T.A. Zhang L. Loftus J. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21785-21788Google Scholar, 15Porter J.C. Hogg N. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 390-396Google Scholar). Integrins function to modulate cellular adhesion and use a characteristic tyrosine kinase-mediated activation pathway to alter cellular response (16Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Google Scholar, 17Howe A. Aplin A.E. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1998; 10: 220-231Google Scholar, 18Rosales C. O'Brien V. Kornberg L. Juliano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1242: 77-98Google Scholar). A common feature of integrin behavior is their ability to form macromolecular signaling complexes with other cell surface receptors (19Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Google Scholar, 20Moro L. Venturino M. Bozzo C. Silengo L. Altruda F. Beguinot L. Tarone G. Defilippi P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6622-6632Google Scholar, 21Wang J.F. Zhang X.F. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41950-41957Google Scholar). β1 integrin-dependent adhesion stimulates a well-characterized tyrosine kinase-based activation response in monocytic lineage cells, inducing increased expression of several inflammatory mediator genes (22Reyes-Reyes M. Mora N. Gonzalez G. Rosales C. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 273-280Google Scholar, 23McGilvray I.D. Lu Z. Bitar R. Dackiw A.P. Davreux C.J. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, inflammatory activation of these cells increases localization of APP to the plasma membrane, suggesting APP participates in adhesion-mediated activation of this cell type (25Monning U. Konig G. Banati R.B. Mechler H. Czech C. Gehrmann J. Schreiter-Gasser U. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23950-23956Google Scholar, 26Jung S.S. Gauthier S. Cashman N.R. Neurobiol. Aging. 1999; 20: 249-257Google Scholar). To answer this question, we investigated the role of APP in β1 integrin-dependent adhesion and activation of the human monocytic cell line, THP-1, and primary mouse microglia.

APP siRNA (siGene, SMARTpool Plus) was obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Type I collagen was derived from rat tail following a standard protocol. All other materials not specified were purchased from Sigma. Tissue Culture—THP-1 cells are a monocytic cell line derived from peripheral blood of a human with acute monocytic leukemia commercially available from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). THP-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (U.S. Biotechnologies, Inc., Parkerford, PA), 5 mm Hepes, and 1.5 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin/neomycin. Microglia were derived from the brains of postnatal day 2 C57Bl/6J mice. Briefly, cerebral cortices were isolated and trypsinized for 15 min. Digestion was terminated by adding tissue to DMEM/F12 media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum (U.S. Biotechnologies, Inc.). Cells were triturated to obtain a single-cell suspension and plated into 75-cm2 flasks. Media were replaced the next day, and cells were fed every 5 days. At ∼14 days in vitro, microglia were harvested by rapid shaking for 30 min on a reciprocal shaker. Cell Stimulation—THP-1 monocytes were removed from normal growth medium into serum-free RPMI 1640 and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min before stimulation. Tissue culture wells were coated with type I rat tail collagen and allowed to dry in a laminar flow hood. THP-1 cells were added to either tissue culture plastic alone or to wells coated with collagen at a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml. Cells were stimulated for either 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, or 24 h. In inhibition studies, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with tyrosine kinase inhibitor, PP1 (5 μm), before stimulation. Generation of Fab Antibody Fragments—The monoclonal 22C11 antibody was digested at 37 °C for 24 h in the presence of 0.02 m cysteine and 0.1 m papain. Digestion was terminated with the addition of 0.03 m iodoacetamide. Fab fragments were separated on a 10% nonreducing polyacrylamide gel and identified by colloidal Coomassie staining. The band was removed from the gel, and electro-elution was performed to recover the Fab fragments. The identity of these fragments was confirmed by Western blotting for APP. APP Cross-linking—To cross-link cell surface APP, THP-1 cells or microglia were removed from normal growth medium into serum-free RPMI 1640 and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were either unstimulated (control) or stimulated with anti-APP antibody, 22C11 (1 μg/ml), monovalent Fab APP antibody fragment (1 μg/ml), or mouse IgG1, isotype control (1 μg/ml). Cells were stimulated for 5 min or 24 h at 37 °C. Total cell lysates and immunoprecipitates were prepared as described below. Western Blotting—Ice-cold RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate) was used to lyse cells. Cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 4 °C, 10 min) to remove insoluble material. Protein concentrations were quantitated by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by 7 or 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blotting. Western blots were blocked in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 3% BSA for 15 min and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in primary antibodies. Blots were washed three times in TBS-T, followed by incubation for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dried milk. The blots were washed three times in TBS-T, followed by detection with enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). In some instances, blots were stripped in 0.2 n NaOH, 5 min, 25 °C. Immunoprecipitation—For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in ice-cold Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton). Lysates were vortexed and then incubated on ice for 15 min, followed by pulse sonication. Cells were centrifuged 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Primary antibody (1 μg/mg protein) was added and incubated 4 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G beads (35 μl) were added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were resolved and Western blotted as described above. Small Interference RNA (siRNA) Transfection—THP-1 cells were transfected with APP siRNA (2 × 106cells; 2 μg of siRNA) using the appropriate Nucleofector program as described by the manufacturer (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cells were transfected with either individual siRNA duplexes or the combined pool of duplexes. Cells were stimulated by adhesion to collagen (as described above) 24 h after transfection or lysed to determine APP expression.

To characterize a tyrosine kinase activation response in our system, we determined that adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to type I collagen stimulated a time-dependent increase in protein phosphotyrosine levels with a maximal stimulation at 30 min (Fig. 1A). Collagen adhesion stimulated increased phosphorylation, indicative of activation, of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (Fig. 1B). However, adhesion-mediated activation did not stimulate activation of the ERKs nor JNKs (Fig. 1, C and D). It is important to point out that control cells display a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylated protein levels and increased phosphorylation of p38, which is likely attributable to the progressive settling of the cells on the tissue culture plastic (Fig. 1, A and B). The profile of increased protein phosphotyrosine levels stimulated by collagen adhesion was different from that stimulated by other β1 ligands, fibronectin, and laminin, as well as the nonspecific cationic ligand poly-l-lysine (Fig. 2A) (32Boudreau N.J. Jones P.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 481-488Google Scholar). Additionally, only collagen-dependent adhesion stimulated recruitment of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins to APP (Fig. 2B). Moreover, collagen adhesion stimulated formation of a multi-receptor complex including cell surface APP and β1 integrin subunits (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that APP participates in the tyrosine kinase-dependent activation response of β1 integrin receptors in monocytes, particularly those using type I collagen as a ligand. Reportedly, the potential αβ combinations that can function as collagen receptors include the receptors composed of the β1 subunit noncovalently linked to either α1, α2, α3, α10, or α11 subunit (29Tulla M. Pentikainen O.T. Viitasalo T. Kapyla J. Impola U. Nykvist P. Nissinen L. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol.

THP-1 cells were plated for 30 min on tissue culture plastic (c), type I collagen (col), 0.1 mg/ml fibronectin (fib), 0.1 mg/ml laminin (lam), or 0.05 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (lys). Cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer, and APP was immunoprecipitated.

Previous studies demonstrated that the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk are active components of integrin-mediated signaling responses in monocytic cells (24Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Google Scholar, 33Miller L.A. Hong J.J. Kinch M.S. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1426-1434Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments verified that Lyn and Syk were recruited to APP upon collagen binding and displayed increased levels of tyrosine phosphorylation, indicative of enzyme activation (Fig. 3, A-C). Protein tyrosine kinases are often receptor proximal factors involved in the initial stage of a series of events leading to activation of cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases and subsequent transcriptional regulation (34Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. et al.Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase-initiated activation response mediated by β1 integrin-dependent adhesion of monocytic cells is a well-described event in the induction of immediate-early genes characteristic of monocytic differentiation including interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-α (35Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Google Scholar). As expected, persistent exposure of monocytes to collagen resulted in the acquisition of a reactive phenotype including an increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL-1β, and CD36 protein levels (Fig. 4). To determine whether tyrosine kinase activation was required for subsequent activation of the p38 MAPK pathway and increased proinflammatory protein levels, we treated THP-1 cells with a specific inhibitor of Src family kinases, PP1, and evaluated the downstream effects (36Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar). Pretreatment of THP-1 cells with PP1 before plating on collagen prevented the increased activation and recruitment of the tyrosine kinases to APP and subsequent activation of p38 MAPK (Fig. 5A). Importantly, kinase inhibition also prevented the stimulated increase in COX-2 protein levels (Fig. 5B), which served as a representative indicator of reactivity, demonstrating that Src family kinases such as Lyn are critical initiating factors in acquisition of a reactive phenotype. To further define a role for APP in integrin-mediated proinflammatory activation of monocytic lineage cells, we used siRNA to significantly reduce APP expression (Fig. 5C). We determined that APP is a critical component of adhesion-mediated increased p38 MAPK activity and increased COX-2 protein levels, indicating that APP is involved in acquisition of a reactive phenotype (Fig. 5, D and E).Fig. 4Adhesion-mediated activation stimulates acquisition of a reactive phenotype. THP-1 monocytes were plated on tissue culture plastic alone or on type I collagen for the indicated times (in hours). Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer, separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted using anti-CD36 antibody, anti-inducible nitric oxide synthase (α-iNOS) antibody, anti-COX-2 antibody, anti-IL-1β antibody, and anti-ERK2 antibody (loading control).

THP-1 cells were either untreated or treated for 30 min with PP1 (5 μm) or dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle. Cells were plated for 30 min or 24 h on tissue culture plastic alone or type I collagen. A, cells were lysed at 30 min with 1% Triton X-100 buffer, and APP was immunoprecipitated.

Cells were lysed at 24 h with RIPA buffer. Cell lysates were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-APP antibody. D, non-transfected cells were unstimulated (control) or stimulated by adhesion to collagen (col), or cells were stimulated 24 h after transfection with siRNA by adhesion to collagen (col APP-).

Antibody binding was visualized by chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our findings demonstrate that APP has receptor-like properties upon β1 integrin engagement; however, we predicted that APP may function as a receptor independent of β1 integrin ligation. We tested this hypothesis by stimulating THP-1 cells with an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of APP, clone 22C11, to simulate ligand binding (37Brouillet E. Trembleau A. Galanaud D. Volovitch M. Bouillot C. Valenza C. Prochiantz A. Allinquant B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1717-1727Google Scholar). Direct cross-linking of cell surface APP on THP-1 cells stimulated a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylated proteins qualitatively similar to that induced by collagen adhesion (Fig. 6A). In addition, co-immunoprecipitations verified that Lyn and Syk were activated and recruited to APP upon antibody cross-linking similar to adhesion-dependent activation (Fig. 6B). However unlike collagen-dependent activation, antibody-dependent APP dimerization stimulated increased activation of not only p38 MAPK but also ERKs and JNKs (Fig. 6A). These data demonstrate fundamental differences in APP contribution to monocytic activation, depending upon its recruitment to β1 integrin macromolecular complexes or its ability to act as an independent receptor. Importantly, we demonstrated that proinflammatory activation was dependent on APP dimerization because the monovalent Fab antibody fragment was not sufficient to stimulate increased tyrosine phosphorylated proteins or increased MAPK activity (Fig. 6C). We next determined whether APP dimerization stimulated acquisition of a reactive phenotype similar to that induced by β1 integrin engagement. Dimerization stimulated an increase in COX-2 and IL-1β protein levels in the monocytes after 24-h treatment (Fig. 7). However, in contrast to collagen-stimulated activation, direct APP cross-linking did not stimulate increased inducible nitric oxide synthase or CD36 protein levels. These data again illustrate a difference between adhesion-dependent and APP dimerization-dependent activation of monocytic cells and define the specificity of APP independent-mediated changes in a cellular proinflammatory phenotype. To confirm that initial tyrosine kinase activity was critical for subsequent activation of the MAPK pathways and the phenotypic changes, THP-1 cells were pretreated with PP1 to inhibit Lyn activation before cross-linking. Kinase inhibition prevented the stimulated increase in tyrosine phosphorylated proteins and recruitment of Lyn and Syk to APP as well as the increase in p38 MAP kinase activity (Fig. 8A). Surprisingly, ERK and JNK activation were unaffected by kinase inhibition, demonstrating a divergence in the signaling response downstream of APP (Fig. 8A). Similar to adhesion-mediated activation, tyrosine kinase inhibition also prevented the acquisition of a reactive phenotype represented by the lack of a stimulated increase in COX-2 protein levels (Fig. 8B). Although the primary focus of this report is characterizing the contribution of APP to monocyte activation, we presumed that APP participates in specific microglial activation paradigms as well. For comparison, we demonstrate that cross-linking cell surface APP on microglial cells also stimulated a rapid increase in protein phosphotyrosine levels, activation of Lyn, activation of ERKs (Fig. 9, A and B), and increased COX-2 protein levels (Fig. 9C). Importantly, APP dimerization did not induce activation of JNKs or p38 MAPK as observed in monocytes (Fig. 9A). These data demonstrate that APP is capable of acting as an independent receptor responsible for tyrosine kinase-mediated proinflammatory activation of microglia. However, the specific activation response diverges from that observed in THP-1 monocytes, suggesting differences in the resultant phenotype. These data define a novel role for APP in the proinflammatory activation of monocytic lineage cells. We demonstrate that β1 integrin ligation stimulates increased tyrosine kinase activity, recruitment of tyrosine kinases to APP, and a resultant reactive phenotype, indicating that APP is an important signaling molecule in adhesion-mediated activation of THP-1 monocytes. We confirmed the role for APP in adhesion-mediated proinflammatory activation through the use of APP siRNA. Decreasing APP expression does not affect initial tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins, consistent with previously demonstrated data in which integrin-mediated activation is sufficient to stimulate tyrosine kinase activity (24Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Google Scholar, 33Miller L.A. Hong J.J. Kinch M.S. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 1426-1434Google Scholar, 38Meng F. Lowell C.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4391-4403Google Scholar). However, downstream activation of p38 MAPK and subsequent increased COX-2 protein levels are dependent on APP expression. This suggests that APP does not have a role in regulating adhesion-mediated membrane proximal tyrosine kinase activity, but it does have a role in the subsequent signaling and proinflammatory phenotype. Presumably, recruitment of these initial activated tyrosine kinases to APP is critical for the propagation of the proinflammatory signaling response, therefore decreasing APP expression is sufficient to attenuate the proinflammatory signaling cascade. Importantly, we also demonstrate that cell surface APP dimerization stimulates a collectively similar activation of monocytic lineage cells. Previous work has identified a hydrophobic region on the ectodomain of cell surface APP that is proposed to play an important functional role, such as dimerization or ligand binding (3Rossjohn J. Cappai R. Feil S.C. Henry A. McKinstry W.J. Galatis D. Hesse L. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Parker M.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 327-331Google Scholar). Our data support the idea that there is a biological ligand for APP and indicate that receptor ligation stimulates a series of signaling events, ultimately leading to transcriptional changes and an inflammatory state in monocytic lineage cells. Interestingly, the resultant phenotype differs slightly between APP dimerization and adhesion-mediated activation, which further supports the proposal that APP has a specific ligand and consequently an independent function as a cell surface receptor. We report the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk as novel proteins that interact with APP during activation of this putative receptor. It remains to be determined if the interaction between APP and these tyrosine kinases is a phosphorylation-independent event as described by the interaction between neuronal APP and the cytoplasmic proteins Fe65, X11, and murine DAB-1 (6Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30853-30856Google Scholar, 8Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell.

It may be more probable that the interaction emulates that demonstrated between C-terminal fragments of APP and the adaptor proteins Shc and Grb2 in which phosphorylation of Y682 within the Y682ENPTY687 motif promotes the interaction of these proteins (10Tarr P.E. Roncarati R. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16798-16804Google Scholar, 11Russo C. Dolcini V. Salis S. Venezia V. Zambrano N. Russo T. Schettini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35282-35288Google Scholar). Additionally, this same tyrosine residue is phosphorylated by a constitutively active form of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl and serves as a docking site for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain of Abl itself (40Zambrano N. Bruni P. Minopoli G. Mosca R. Molino D. Russo C. Schettini G. Sudol M. Russo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19787-19792Google Scholar). The nature of protein-protein interactions involving non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family is well-described and involves the Src homology 2 domain of these proteins interacting with a phosphorylated tyrosine residue on the coupled protein. The exact nature of the interaction between APP, Lyn, and Syk will be addressed to a greater extent in future work. The involvement of APP in proinflammatory activation of peripheral blood cells reveals that APP has an important role in modulating immune function. This is a previously undescribed function for APP, and it may provide important insight into potential immune system dysfunction in patients with autosomal dominant forms of Alzheimer's disease. APP dimerization in primary murine microglia also stimulates an inflammatory state, although the signaling pathway diverges slightly from that demonstrated in peripheral monocytes. This difference may be a reflection of heterogeneity between monocytes and microglia, between species, or between primary cells and cell lines. In conclusion, these data demonstrate a novel function for APP as a cell surface receptor that mediates proinflammatory activation of monocytic lineage cells. Moreover, these data support the idea that there is a yet unidentified APP ligand and demonstrate the significance of this ligand in stimulating a tyrosine kinase-dependent signaling cascade in monocytes and microglia that incites the production of inflammatory mediators such as COX-2 and IL-1β. The physiological consequences of this inflammatory state in vitro have yet to be studied, although it is probable that in vivo the release of these inflammatory mediators may lead to activation of cells in the immediate environment, such as endothelial cells or astrocytes. Importantly, tyrosine kinase inhibition prevents the increased COX-2 protein levels and could possibly serve as a critical regulatory point in this inflammatory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2023554336,"Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a hereditary cardiomyopathy that causes sudden death in the young. We found a line of mice with inherited right ventricular dysplasia (RVD) caused by a mutation of the gene laminin receptor 1 (Lamr1). This locus contained an intron-processed retroposon that was transcribed in the mice with RVD. Introduction of a mutated Lamr1 gene into normal mice by breeding or by direct injection caused susceptibility to RVD, which was similar to that seen in the RVD mice. An in vitro study of cardiomyocytes expressing the product of mutated Lamr1 showed early cell death accompanied by alteration of the chromatin architecture. We found that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) bound specifically to mutant LAMR1. HP1 is a dynamic regulator of heterochromatin sites, suggesting that mutant LAMR1 impairs a crucial process of transcriptional regulation. Indeed, mutant LAMR1 caused specific changes to gene expression in cardiomyocytes, as detected by gene chip analysis. Thus, we concluded that products of the Lamr1 retroposon interact with HP1 to cause degeneration of cardiomyocytes. This mechanism may also contribute to the etiology of human ARVD."

However, Rubisco may be unique among α/β-barrel enzymes in that the carboxyl terminus folds over loop 6 and appears to stabilize its closed conformation. This arrangement of loop 6 and the carboxyl terminus is also observed in the crystal structure of unactivated Rubisco that contains RuBP in the active site (10Taylor T.C. Andersson I. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 432-444Google Scholar). In vivo, Rubisco activase is responsible for facilitating the opening of the closed structure to release this RuBP (reviewed in Refs. 2Spreitzer R.J.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 3-7Google Scholar). The change from closed to open conformation in the carboxyl-terminal, α/β-barrel domain of the large subunit is accompanied by movement of the amino-terminal domain of a neighboring large subunit (reviewed in Ref. 4Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Google Scholar), which also contributes residues to the active site and may contain the primary site of interaction with Rubisco activase (13Larson E.M. O'Brien C.M. Zhu G.

In the absence of RuBP or CABP, the carboxyl terminus is disordered, and loop 6 is usually disordered or misfolded into an open conformation depending on the source or treatment of the Rubisco used for crystallization (15Curmi P.M.

An open crystal structure of tobacco Rubisco was solved in which phosphate was observed to reside at a site normally occupied by the carboxyl group of Asp-473 in the closed structure (18Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 903-916Google Scholar). This prompted speculation that Asp-473 may serve as a latch that holds the carboxyl terminus over loop 6 in the closed conformation (18Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 903-916Google Scholar). In plant-like Rubisco enzymes, comprised of eight ∼55-kDa large and eight ∼16-kDa small subunits, Asp-473 is 100% conserved, but the large subunit carboxyl terminus is quite variable in length and sequence identity (Fig. 1). Some bacterial Rubisco enzymes exist as only large subunit dimers (reviewed in Ref. 20Tabita F.R. Photosynth. Res. 1999; 60: 1-28Google Scholar), and without electron density for the carboxyl terminus (21Andersson I. Knight S. Schneider G. Lindqvist Y. Lundqvist T. Branden C.I. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 337: 229-234Google Scholar), it is more difficult to assign a residue comparable with Asp-473 in their divergent sequences (i.e. Rhodospirillum rubrum, Fig. 1). In previous studies, the role of the large subunit carboxyl terminus in Rubisco function was investigated by using biochemical or genetic methods that deleted or added residues (22Spreitzer R.J.

Lundqvist T. Schneider G. Madden M. Howard R. Lorimer G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1365-1373Google Scholar, 25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar, 26Zhu G. Jensen R.G. Bohnert H.J. Wildner G.F. Schlitter J. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 71-79Google Scholar) or by using directed mutagenesis to replace cyanobacterial carboxyl-terminal residues with those characteristic of land plants (25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar). Although some alterations were observed in carboxylation catalytic efficiency or holoenzyme stability (22Spreitzer R.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5460-5464Google Scholar, 23Portis A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 397-400Google Scholar, 24Ranty B. Lundqvist T. Schneider G. Madden M. Howard R. Lorimer G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1365-1373Google Scholar, 25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar, 26Zhu G. Jensen R.G. Bohnert H.J. Wildner G.F. Schlitter J. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 71-79Google Scholar), only the deletion of as many as 10 residues from the carboxyl terminus of the Synechococcus enzyme caused a substantial reduction in CO2/O2 specificity (Fig. 1, residues 466-475) (25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar). If the carboxyl terminus plays a role in stabilizing loop 6 during catalysis, and loop 6 determines the differential stabilization of the carboxylation and oxygenation transition states (27Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1991; 183: 597-603Google Scholar, 28Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 31: 157-164Google Scholar), one might expect that specific carboxyl-terminal residues may influence CO2/O2 specificity. However, the function of individual residues was not assessed by directed-mutagenesis substitutions in previous studies. The green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii serves as a useful model organism for the study of Rubisco because photosynthesis-deficient mutants can be maintained with acetate as an alternative source of carbon and energy. Mutant strains that lack functional genes for the large (chloroplast rbcL) or small (nucleus rbcS) subunit can be complemented by transformation (reviewed in Ref. 29Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar), and the wild-type rbcL gene can be replaced with a mutant rbcL gene regardless of whether the mutant large subunit can produce a functional holoenzyme (e.g. Ref. 30Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Google Scholar). Furthermore, because mutant genes exist in vivo, genetic selection can be used to recover second-site suppressor mutations as a means for identifying complementing structural interactions (29Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar, 31Du Y.C. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14206-14211Google Scholar). With this in mind, and considering the evolutionary conservation and potential critical function of Asp-473, we decided to examine the essentiality of Asp-473 by directed mutagenesis and Chlamydomonas chloroplast transformation. D473A and D473E substitutions did not prevent the photosynthetic growth of the Chlamydomonas transformants, indicating that Asp-473 is not essential for Rubisco function. However, both substitutions caused substantial decreases in catalytic efficiency and CO2/O2 specificity. Strains and Culture Conditions—C. reinhardtii 2137 mt+ is the wild-type strain (32Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). Mutant MX3312, which lacks the rbcL gene that encodes the Rubisco large subunit, was obtained from Dr. Genhai Zhu (Maxygen, Inc., Redwood City, CA) and used as the host for chloroplast transformation. This mutant was created via chloroplast transformation of wild-type 2137 mt+ with the 786-bp coding region of the bacterial aadA gene (33Hollingshead S. Vapnek D. Plasmid. 1985; 13: 17-30Google Scholar) flanked precisely by the Chlamydomonas rbcL 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (34Dron M. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 775-793Google Scholar). Because chloroplast transformation occurs by homologous recombination in Chlamydomonas, mutant MX3312 has a photosynthesis-deficient, acetate-requiring phenotype due to the complete loss of the rbcL coding sequence, but it is resistant to aminoglycosides such as spectinomycin and streptomycin due to the expression of aadA (35Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Google Scholar). All strains are maintained at 25 °C in darkness with 10 mm acetate medium containing 1.5% Bacto-agar (32Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis, cells were grown with 250-500 ml of liquid acetate medium at 25 °C on a rotary shaker (220 rpm) in darkness. Directed Mutagenesis and Chloroplast Transformation—Using a plasmid containing the Chlamydomonas rbcL gene (36Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Google Scholar), directed mutagenesis was performed using synthetic oligonucleotides and a QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (37Papworth C. Bauer J.C. Braman J. Wright D.A. Strategies. 1996; 9: 3-4Google Scholar). To create the D473A substitution, the sequence GAC was changed to GCT, which also introduced a CviRI restriction site useful for screening. The D473E substitution was created by changing GAC to GAA. In this case, the mutant oligonucleotide also contained a silent mutation (ACA to ACT) at the codon for Thr-471 that introduced an MfeI site useful for screening. The resultant mutant plasmids, named pLS-D473A and pLS-D473E, were transformed into the chloroplast of rbcL mutant MX3312 by using a helium-driven biolistic device (38Finer J.J. Vain P. Jones M.W. McMullen M.D. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 323-328Google Scholar), and photosynthesis-competent transformants were selected on minimal medium in the light (80 microeinsteins/m2/s) by standard methods (36Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Google Scholar, 39Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Google Scholar). Successive rounds of selection, single-colony isolation, and restriction enzyme analysis were performed to ensure the homoplasmicity of the D473A and D473E mutant genes (40Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Google Scholar). The mutant rbcL genes were PCR-amplified and completely sequenced to confirm that only the intended mutations were present (30Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Google Scholar, 36Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Google Scholar, 39Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Google Scholar). The mutant Chlamydomonas strains were named D473A and D473E. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Analysis—Soluble cell protein was isolated from dark-grown cells as described previously (40Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Google Scholar) and quantified (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 7.5-15% polyacrylamide gradient in the running gel (42Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-446Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, proteins were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, probed with rabbit anti-tobacco Rubisco immunoglobulin G (0.5 μg/ml), and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) (43Thow G. Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5109-5114Google Scholar). Enzyme Analysis—Rubisco holoenzyme was purified from cell extract by sucrose gradient centrifugation in 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (40Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Google Scholar). The thermal stability of purified Rubisco was determined as described previously (36Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Google Scholar, 44Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar). RuBP carboxylase and oxygenase activities were measured via the incorporation of acid-stable 14C from NaH14CO3 (45Chen Z. Chastain C.J. Al-Abed S.R. Chollet R. Spreitzer R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4696-4699Google Scholar). The ratio of carboxylation to oxygenation at any given concentrations of CO2 and O2 is determined by the CO2/O2 specificity factor Ω = VcKo/VoKc, where Vc and Vo are the Vmax values for carboxylation and oxygenation, and Kc and Ko are the Km values for CO2 and O2 (46Laing W.A. Ogren W.L. Hageman R.H. Plant Physiol. 1974; 54: 678-685Google Scholar). Thus, Ω of purified and activated Rubisco (20 μg/reaction) was determined by assaying carboxylase and oxygenase activities simultaneously in 88 μm [1-3H]RuBP (15.8 Ci/mol) and 2 mm NaH14CO3 (0.5 Ci/mol) in 30-min reactions at 25 °C (47Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 237-245Google Scholar, 48Spreitzer R.J. Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 117-121Google Scholar). [1-3H]RuBP and phosphoglycolate phosphatase were synthesized/purified by standard methods (47Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 237-245Google Scholar, 49Kuehn G.D. Hsu T.C. Biochem. J. 1978; 175: 909-912Google Scholar). Km(RuBP) was determined by adding 1-5 μg of activated Rubisco to 1-ml reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 30 mm NaH14CO3 (5 Ci/mol), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 μm RuBP at 25 °C (27Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1991; 183: 597-603Google Scholar). To measure the binding affinity for the transition state analog CABP (27Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1991; 183: 597-603Google Scholar, 30Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Google Scholar, 39Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Google Scholar), purified Rubisco (200 μg) was incubated at 25 °C for 2.5 h in 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μm [14C]CABP (50 Ci/mol). The mixture was loaded on a Sephadex G-75 column (1 × 30 cm) that had been equilibrated at 25 °C with 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl. The column was eluted with the same buffer, and 1-ml fractions were collected and assayed for protein and 14C dpm (39Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Google Scholar). The peak protein fraction was mixed with a 1,000-fold molar excess of unlabeled CABP. After incubation at 25 °C for 38 h, the mixture was fractionated again. CABP and [14C]CABP were synthesized by standard methods (50Pierce J. Tolbert N.E. Barker R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 934-942Google Scholar, 51Zhu G. Jensen R.G. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 244-249Google Scholar). Directed Mutagenesis, Transformation, and Mutant Phenotypes—To test the functional significance of Asp-473, directed mutagenesis was used to eliminate its charged side group by replacement with Ala or to alter its size without affecting charge by replacement with Glu. When rbcL mutant plasmids pLS-D473A and pLS-D473E were transformed into the chloroplast of the rbcL deletion mutant MX3312, photosynthesis-competent transformants were recovered on minimal medium in the light at frequencies similar to that of transformation with the wild-type rbcL gene (36Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Google Scholar, 39Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Google Scholar). Furthermore, phenotypic analysis of a number of independent transformants via spot tests (32Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 565-569Google Scholar) at 25 or 35 °C on minimal medium or acetate medium (in the light or in the darkness) revealed no obvious differences in growth relative to that of wild type. Such analysis has previously proved useful for identifying rbcL mutants with various defects in Rubisco catalysis, assembly, or stability (reviewed in Ref. 29Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar). Thus, despite the critical role proposed for Asp-473 in Rubisco catalysis, substitution with Ala or Glu caused no major alterations in holoenzyme function or stability in vivo. Holoenzyme Levels and Thermal Stability in Vitro—When extracts of mutants D473A and D473E were fractionated on sucrose gradients, no significant differences in the amount of Rubisco holoenzyme were observed relative to that of wild type (data not shown). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western analysis also showed that the mutants have wild-type levels of Rubisco subunits (Fig. 2). To further confirm that the D473A and D473E mutants do not affect the structural stability of Rubisco, thermal inactivation experiments were performed (36Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Google Scholar, 44Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the D473A and D473E mutant enzymes are not different from wild-type Rubisco with respect to thermal stability in vitro. Thus, removing the Asp-473 side group or increasing its size has no obvious effect on Rubisco holoenzyme stability in vivo or in vitro.Fig. 3Thermal inactivation of purified Rubisco from wild type (○) and large subunit mutants D473A (□) and D473E (▵). Purified Rubisco (10 μg) in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Bicine (pH 8.0), 10 mm NaH14CO3 (58 Ci/mol), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was incubated at each temperature for 20 min. The samples were then cooled on ice and assayed for RuBP carboxylase activity at 25 °C (36Du Y.C. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19844-19847Google Scholar, 44Chen Z. Hong S. Spreitzer R.J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 1189-1194Google Scholar). Activities for each enzyme were normalized against the level of activity measured after the 35 °C incubation (wild type, 1.5 μmol/min/mg; mutant D473A, 0.2 μmol/min/mg; mutant D473E, 0.2 μmol/min/mg).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Catalytic Properties—The purified D473A and D473E mutant enzymes were found to have 17 and 14% decreases in Ω, respectively (Table I). Despite ∼2-fold beneficial increases in Ko/Kc, the 52-59% decreases in Vc/Vo and 87% decreases in carboxylation catalytic efficiency (Vc/Kc) are ultimately responsible for the decreased Ω values (Table I). The D473A and D473E mutant enzymes also have decreases in the binding affinity for CABP (Table II), which is anticipated from the decreased carboxylation Vc/Kc and Ω values, the latter of which is indicative of a change in the relative stabilities of the carboxylation and oxygenation transition states (27Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1991; 183: 597-603Google Scholar, 28Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 31: 157-164Google Scholar). However, Km(RuBP) is increased ∼2-fold for the mutant enzymes (Table I). This indicates that the conversion of RuBP to the 2,3-enediol(ate), a step common to both carboxylation and oxygenation, is also altered by the mutant substitutions.Table IKinetic properties of Rubisco purified from wild type and large-subunit mutants D473A and D473EEnzymesΩaValues are the means ± S.D.

Oxygenation of RuBP generates phosphoglycolate, which is the first intermediate in the nonessential photorespiratory pathway that leads to the loss of CO2. These properties make Rubisco an obvious target for genetic engineering aimed at improving agricultural productivity (reviewed in Refs. 2Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Google Scholar and 3Parry M.A.J. Andralojc P.J. Mitchell R.A. Madgwick P.J. Keys A.J. J. Exp. Bot. 2003; 54: 1321-1333Google Scholar). However, despite the variation in the Vc and Ω values of Rubisco enzymes from divergent species (52Jordan D.B. Ogren W.L. Nature. 1981; 291: 513-515Google Scholar), Rubisco catalysis depends on a conserved set of active site residues (reviewed in Refs. 2Spreitzer R.J. Salvucci M.E. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 449-475Google Scholar, 4Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Google Scholar, 12Andrews T.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 3-7Google Scholar). Thus, attempts to design a better Rubisco will likely depend on our depth of understanding of the structure-function relationships of the enzyme some distance from the active site. With 16 subunits, ∼4,800 amino acids, and ∼76,000 atoms arranged in strikingly similar x-ray crystal structures (reviewed in Ref. 4Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Google Scholar), it is a daunting task to identify regions of structure far from the active site that may influence catalysis. Only by genetic screening and selection in vivo (29Spreitzer R.J. Rochaix J.D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998: 515-527Google Scholar), random or scanning mutagenesis (53Cheng Z.Q. McFadden B.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 457-465Google Scholar, 54Smith S.A. Tabita F.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 557-569Google Scholar, 55Spreitzer R.J. Esquivel M.G. Du Y.C. McLaughlin P.D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5615-5621Google Scholar), bioinformatic analysis of sequence divergence (56Du Y.C. Peddi S.R. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49401-49405Google Scholar), and/or detailed comparative analysis of divergent x-ray crystal structures (18Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 903-916Google Scholar) may it be possible to identify regions worthy of experimental analysis. Based on an extensive comparison of Rubisco crystal structures, Duff et al. (18Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 903-916Google Scholar) proposed that Asp-473 in the carboxyl-terminal region of the large subunit may serve as a critical latch residue that accounts for the folding of the carboxyl terminus over loop 6 during catalysis. Because the large subunit carboxyl terminus is one of the most variable regions of Rubisco structure with respect to both length and sequence identity (4Andersson I. Taylor T.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 130-140Google Scholar, 26Zhu G. Jensen R.G. Bohnert H.J. Wildner G.F. Schlitter J. Photosynth. Res. 1998; 57: 71-79Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), Asp-473 might serve as a critical connection by which the variation in the carboxyl terminus could influence loop 6 catalysis. Although we had intended to exploit chloroplast transformation and genetic selection in Chlamydomonas to identify critical residues that could compensate for the loss of Asp-473, it was surprising to find that D473A and D473E substitutions did not eliminate the ability of Chlamydomonas to grow photoautotrophically. This indicated that Asp-473 is not essential for catalysis, and further analysis showed that neither substitution altered Rubisco stability in vivo (Fig. 2) or in vitro (Fig. 3). However, both mutant enzymes displayed 87% decreases in carboxylation catalytic efficiency and ∼16% decreases in CO2/O2 specificity (Table I, Vc/Kc and Ω). In a previous study that relied on the expression of Synechococcus Rubisco in Escherichia coli (25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar), deletion of the last 8 carboxyl-terminal residues (which includes Asp-473, Fig. 1) caused a 99% decrease in Vc/Kc but did not change Ω. This indicates that the decreases in Ω resulting from the D473A and D473E substitutions in the Chlamydomonas enzyme may be due to secondary alterations in structure rather than simply the loss of the Asp side chain. Both substitutions, by either lengthening or eliminating a charged side chain, may prevent a close association of the carboxyl terminus with loop 6, thereby introducing unfavorable interactions between other residues (Fig. 4). Because the biochemical properties of the D473A and D473E enzymes are quite similar (Table I), one might also assume that they cause similar structural alterations. The idea that other interactions between the carboxyl terminus and loop 6 may play a significant role in Rubisco function is borne out by the previous study with the Synechococcus enzyme (25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar). Deletion of two additional residues, Lys-466 and Phe-467 (Fig. 1), nearly eliminated carboxylation and caused a 38% decrease in Ω (25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar). Thus, the conserved Phe-467 residue, which shields Lys-334 from solvent (Fig. 4), also plays an important role in the interactions between the carboxyl terminus and loop 6. In the 1.4-Å x-ray crystal structure of Chlamydomonas Rubisco, numerous interactions can be observed between the carboxyl terminus and loop 6 in the closed form of the enzyme (Fig. 4). Because Asp-473 is in van der Waals contact with Glu-338 and Val-341, and its amide nitrogen forms a hydrogen bond with the side group of Glu-336, alterations in the interactions with these loop 6 residues may be sufficient to account for the observed decreases in Ω that arise from the D473A and D473E substitutions. However, changing Chlamydomonas Val-341 to the Ile residue common to land plant Rubisco had little or no effect on catalysis (39Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Google Scholar). Asp-473 is also in van der Waals contact with Asp-302, Arg-303, and His-310 and forms an ionic bond with Arg-134 (Fig. 4). All of these residues are conserved, and all but Arg-134 are in van der Waals contact with loop 6 residues. Thus, changes in Asp-473 might also be transmitted to loop 6 via alterations in such intervening residues. In a previous study with the Synechococcus enzyme (57Bainbridge G. Anralojc P.J. Madgwick P.J. Pitts J.E. Parry M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 387-393Google Scholar), substitutions at Lys-128 also caused decreases in Ω. The ϵ-amino group of Lys-128 forms hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl groups of both carboxyl-terminal Phe-467 and loop 6 Val-331 (Fig. 4), and a V331A substitution in Chlamydomonas Rubisco was shown previously to cause a 37% decrease in Ω (58Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3051-3053Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it seems possible that a number of carboxyl-terminal residues might influence Rubisco CO2/O2 specificity via interactions with residues that also interact with loop 6. We are particularly interested in the value of Ω because it is a measure of the differential stabilization of the carboxylation and oxygenation transition states at the rate-determining step of both reactions (27Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Planta. 1991; 183: 597-603Google Scholar, 28Chen Z. Spreitzer R.J. Photosynth. Res. 1992; 31: 157-164Google Scholar). Thus, any substitutions that influence Ω may be potential targets for genetic engineering aimed at improving Rubisco. As may be expected from the decreased Ω values, the D473E and D473A mutant enzymes do not bind the carboxylation transition state analog CABP as tightly as does the wild-type enzyme (Table II). However, the mutant enzymes also have 2-fold increases in Km (RuBP) (Table I), and a similar increase was observed for the Synechococcus carboxyl-terminal deletion mutant that caused a decrease in Ω (25Gutteridge S. Rhoades D.F. Herrmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7818-7824Google Scholar). Although loop 6 is not essential for the enolization of RuBP in the first partial reaction common to both carboxylation and oxygenation (59Larson E.M. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4531-4537Google Scholar), these observations agree with the structural analysis of substrate binding (18Duff A.P. Andrews T.J. Curmi P.M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 903-916Google Scholar), indicating that loop 6 and the carboxyl terminus are folded in a closed state prior to the addition of CO2 or O2 in the second, rate-limiting step of carboxylation or oxygenation. This may raise a question as to the path by which CO2 and O2 enter the active site. Further study of the interactions between the carboxyl terminus and loop 6 may define the precise role of this structural arrangement in catalysis and may also provide useful information leading to the design of an improved Rubisco enzyme. We thank Dr. Genhai Zhu for providing the rbcL-MX3312 mutant strain and Dr. Archie R. Portis (USDA/Agricultural Research Service, University of Illinois) for a sample of CABP."
https://openalex.org/W2018674949,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are an important family of extracellular proteases that process a variety of biologically significant molecules. MMPs are members of the metzincin superfamily of >770 zinc endopeptidases, which includes astacins, serralysins, adamalysins, leishmanolysins, and snapalysins. Metzincins are characterized by an absolutely conserved methionine residue COOH-terminal to the third histidine in the consensus sequence HEXXHXXGXX(H/D), where the histidine residues chelate a catalytic zinc ion. The canonical methionine is part of a tight 1,4-β-turn that loops the polypeptide chain beneath the catalytic zinc ion, forming a hydrophobic floor to the Zn2+ ion binding site. The role of this methionine is uncertain, but its absolute conservation indicates an essential catalytic or structural function. To investigate this hypothesis, we replaced Met-392 that forms the Met-turn of human MMP-2 (gelatinase A) by site-directed mutagenesis. The catalytic competence of leucine and serine mutants was assessed. (M392L)MMP-2 and (M392S)MMP-2 cleaved the physiological substrates gelatin, native type I collagen, and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 with similar efficiency to wild-type MMP-2. These mutants also cleaved two quenched fluorescent peptide substrates with a kcat/Km comparable to wild-type MMP-2 and underwent 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate-induced autoactivation with similar kinetics. (M392L)MMP-2 and (M392S)MMP-2 were inhibited by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, -2, and -4 and by the zinc chelators 1,10-phenanthroline and a synthetic hydroxamate inhibitor, Batimastat, similar to the wild-type protein, indicating an unaltered active site topography. A tryptic susceptibility assay also suggested that (M392L)MMP-2 and (M392S)MMP-2 were correctly folded. These results challenge the dogma that this methionine residue and the Met-turn, which are absolutely conserved in all of the subfamilies of the metzincins, play an essential role in catalysis or active site structure.

MMPs are involved in physiological processes such as connective tissue remodeling and the control of inflammation (4Balbin M. Fueyo A. Tester A.M. Pendas A.M. Pitiot A.S. Astudillo A. Overall C.M.

The cleavage of these substrates is evident in a range of pathological conditions including arthritis, tumor metastasis, and fibrosis in which the MMPs are strongly implicated (7Egeblad M. Werb Z. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 163-176Crossref Scopus (5163) Google Scholar, 8Curran S. Murray G.I. Eur. J.

Hence, it is important to understand the structural features of these enzymes to facilitate rational inhibitor drug design (11Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given the largely negative clinical trial results in the treatment of cancer with current MMP hydroxamate inhibitors (12Fingleton B. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2003; 7: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Overall C.M. Lopéz-Otín C. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 657-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), this is an essential step in the design of the next generation of inhibitor drugs. A number of three-dimensional structures of MMPs are available. MMPs have a common domain structure, which is typically comprised of a propeptide, catalytic domain, proline-rich linker, and COOH-terminal hemopexin domain (11Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bode W. Fernandez-Catalan C. Tschesche H. Grams F. Nagase H. Maskos K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Some members of the family have additional domains, e.g. gelatinases A (MMP-2) and B (MMP-9) have three fibronectin type II modules inserted in the catalytic domain, which comprise the collagen binding domain (15Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the membrane-type MMPs (MT-MMPs) (-1, -2, -3, -5) have a COOH-terminal transmembrane domain (16Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). MMPs are members of a superfamily of zinc endopeptidases, the metzincins, whose other members are the astacins, serralysins, adamalysins, leishmanolysins, and snapalysins (17Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Stocker W. Bode W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Bode W. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Stocker W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Although their amino acid sequences differ, metzincins have a conserved fold with similar topology and the zinc binding environment of their active sites is highly conserved (20Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). The latter features a consensus sequence HEXXHXXGXX(H/D). The His residues chelate a zinc ion that is essential for catalytic activity, whereas the Glu polarizes a zinc-bound water molecule that facilitates nucleophilic attack on the scissile bond of substrate bound in an antiparallel β-sheet-like manner in the active site cleft (for review see Ref. 17Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A conserved structurally superimposable methionine that is 8 residues COOH-terminal to the His residues in MMPs forms a tight 1,4-turn, the so-called “Met-turn.” This turn loops the polypeptide chain beneath the catalytic zinc ion forming a hydrophobic floor to the Zn2+ ion binding site (see Figs. 2 and 3 in Ref. 17Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct contact between the Met and the zinc ion or substrates. The methyl hydrogens of the Met sulfur are 5-6 Å from the aromatic rings of the first two His ligands, and it is proposed that there may be electrostatic interactions between these residues (17Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 18Stocker W. Bode W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This Met residue in close proximity to the Zn2+ ion and its triad of ligating residues is the single absolutely conserved defining characteristic of the metzincin superfamily of >770 metalloproteinases and one that led to their designation as metzincins (20Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Hence, it is assumed that the methionine and Met-turn have an essential role in the structure or function of the members of the metzincins. In this study, we have probed the function of the conserved Met and Met-turn of the metzincins using human MMP-2 as a model, a protease considered critically important in tumor metastasis and therefore a validated drug target (12Fingleton B. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2003; 7: 385-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Met-392 was altered by site-directed mutagenesis. In one variant, M392L, the side chain of the Leu is of a size similar to Met and so should maintain the hydrophobicity of the local environment. In another mutant, M392S, the mutation introduces a potential zinc chelator, which might affect enzymic activity. Surprisingly, despite the absolute conservation of the Met residue, there was no significant effect on the activity, activation, or inhibition properties of MMP-2 by these substitutions. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of Met-392 to Leu, Ser, or Cys was carried out using the QuikChange strategy (Stratagene) with the oligonucleotides shown in Table I. The catalytically inactive mutant, (E375A)MMP-2 (18Stocker W. Bode W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), was also generated using oligonucleotides listed in Table I. The template was a double-stranded plasmid preparation of proMMP-2 with an IgG leader sequence in vector pGW1GH (21Butler G.S. Sim D. Tam E. Devine D. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Clones were selected with mycophenolic acid, and those overexpressing MMP-2 or the Met mutants of MMP-2 were identified by Western blotting with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies αGelAβIV (raised against the peptide sequence Asp-188 to Gly-200, which constitutes the “north side” of the active site) or αCBD123 (raised against the collagen binding domain of MMP-2 (15Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar)). TIMP-2 and TIMP-4 were expressed and purified as described previously (24Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M.

Purification of MMP-2—At cell confluence, roller bottle (850 cm2, BD Biosciences) cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 50-100 ml of serum-free medium (CHO-S-SFMII, Invitrogen). Medium was harvested every 1-2 days for up to 10 days. MMP-2 or MMP-2 mutants were purified at 4 °C in 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.025% sodium azide) (21Butler G.S. Sim D. Tam E. Devine D. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17511-17519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). MMP-2 was eluted from gelatin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with 10% Me2SO. After dialysis, pooled fractions were loaded onto lentil lectin-Sepharose (Sigma) to remove MMP-9 and a 1-ml gelatin-Sepharose column in tandem. Eluted fractions containing proMMP-2 were pooled, dialyzed into MES buffer, and stored at -70 °C. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining confirmed the purity of the recombinant protein samples. For activity studies, proenzyme was dialyzed into fluorescence assay buffer (FAB, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij 35) immediately prior to each study. NH2-terminal Sequencing—Proenzyme samples (4 μg) were activated with 2 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) for 4 h, electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels, and blotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. This was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 50% methanol. Bands of interest were excised and sequenced by Edman degradation in an Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer. Protease Assays—MMP-2 was APMA-activated and active site-titrated against a standard preparation of TIMP-1 (24Bigg H.F. Morrison C.J. Butler G.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. Wang Z. Soloway P.D. Overall C.M.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar. Enzymes (10-30 pm, active site-titrated) were incubated in FAB with 10 μg/ml fluorescein-labeled gelatin (DQgelatin, Molecular Probes) at 37 °C using excitation and emission filters of 485 and 520 nm, respectively. Rates of cleavage of gelatin were measured from the linear increase in fluorescence in a continuous assay (typically up to a 2-h duration). The cleavage efficiency of the enzymes was calculated in arbitrary fluorescence units s-1 nm-1 enzyme because there is no standard to calibrate the plate reader and calculate kcat/Km. DQgelatin (10 μg/ml) alone had a zero rate of fluorescence release, and any turbidity of the gelatin sample did not affect the fluorescence read-out under the conditions used. Gelatinolytic activity was also assayed by zymography using non-reduced samples electrophoresed on 9% polyacrylamide gels co-polymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin. Following SDS removal using Triton X-100, gels were incubated in 100 mm Tris, pH 8, 30 mm CaCl2 for 3-4 h and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Biotin-labeled type I collagen (0.025 pmol) was incubated with enzymes in collagenase assay buffer (CAB, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 3.8 mm NaN3, 0.05% Brij 35) with 2 mm APMA for 18 h at 28 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and ECL detection (27Tam E.M.

Monocyte chemoattractant protein 3 (MCP-3) (5 μg) was incubated in CAB with 100 ng of APMA-activated enzyme at 37 °C for 4.5 h, and the products were electrophoresed under reducing conditions on 15% Tris-Tricine gels (5McQuibban G.A.

Cleavage products were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Measurement of Ki(app)—A range of concentrations of Batimastat (BB-94) or 1,10 phenanthroline were incubated with proteases for 2 h at 37 °C in 96-well fluorescence assay plates. Residual activity was measured at 37 °C using 1 μm general quenched fluorescent substrate. Data was fitted to a tight binding equation (28Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D.

Trypsin Susceptibility—Proteinases (43.3 nm) were incubated with 8.7 nm trypsin (Sigma) in CAB with or without 48 mm EDTA at 25 °C. Aliquots were removed at 0, 1, 2, or 23 h, and these reactions were terminated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 11% gels followed by silver staining. Expression and Purification of MMP-2 Mutants—Each of the Met mutants, pro(M392S)MMP-2, pro(M392L)MMP-2, and pro(M392C)MMP-2, co-migrated with wild-type proMMP-2 and pro(E375A)MMP-2 at a molecular mass corresponding to 72 kDa in the presence of dithiothreitol (Fig. 1A). In the absence of reductant, all of the proenzymes migrated at 66 kDa, consistent with the presence of correct disulfide bond linkages. No dimers were observed for pro(M392C)MMP-2, which contains an introduced unpaired cysteine. Pro(M392L)MMP-2, pro(M392S)MMP-2, and pro(M392C)MMP-2 were isolated from CHO K1 cells as a complex with endogenous TIMP-2, similar to wild-type proMMP-2 and pro(E375A)MMP-2, (Fig. 1B). Exogenous TIMP-2 also formed a stable complex with proMMP-2, and the zymogen forms of the three Met mutants that had been expressed and purified from Timp2-/-fibroblasts (data not shown).

Proteolytic Activity—The mutation of Met-392 to Ser or Leu did not significantly affect the cleavage efficiency of two different quenched fluorescent substrates (Table II).

Cleavage fragments of the β-chains and α1 and α2 chains generated by (M392S)MMP-2 and (M392L)MMP-2 were similar to those generated by wild-type MMP-2 (Fig. 2B). A time course (Fig. 2C) and incubation at increasing enzyme:substrate ratios (Fig. 2D) demonstrated that (M392S)MMP-2 and (M392L)MMP-2 were as efficient as wild-type MMP-2 at native type I collagenolysis with full cleavage occurring by 10 h and at a 10-20:1 enzyme:collagen molar ratio after 18 h. The chemokine MCP-3 is a recently described physiological substrate of MMP-2 in vitro and in vivo (5McQuibban G.A. Gong J.H. Tam E.M. McCulloch C.A. Clark-Lewis I. Overall C.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1202-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Similar to wild-type MMP-2, (M392S)MMP-2 and (M392L)MMP-2 converted MCP-3 (8935 Da) to MCP-3-(5-76) (8574 Da) (Fig. 3A). By matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the mass of the cleaved chemokine generated by wild-type MMP-2 was 8571 Da, the mass of the cleaved chemokine generated by (M392S)MMP-2 was 8571 Da, and the mass generated by (M392L)MMP-2 was 8577 Da, showing that cleavage occurred at an identical site to remove the NH2-terminal four residues. These mutants cleaved MCP-3 (5 μg) to the same extent in the same concentration range as wild-type MMP-2 between 10 and 100 ng of enzyme, demonstrating similar efficiency (Fig. 3B). MMP-2 is secreted as a zymogen. Removal of the propeptide at Tyr-81 is autocatalyzed by MMP-2 in trans and is required for enzymatic activity (31Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Krutzsch H.C. Wacher M.P.

The proMMP-2 mutants were incubated in the presence of the organomercurial APMA, which coordinates with Cys-73 and so disrupts the interaction of the propeptide with the active site, initiating autoactivation. The activation profile of (M392S)MMP-2 and (M392L)MMP-2 resembled that of wild-type MMP-2. At 25 °C, conversion to the 68-kDa activation intermediate form was apparent after 10 min (Fig. 4A), full activation of MMP-2 was visible by 60 min, and the proenzyme was completely converted to this 66-kDa form after 4 h. There were no lower molecular weight autodegradation species formed at 25 °C that were visible by silver staining. At 37 °C, APMA-induced autoactivation of (M392S)MMP-2 and (M392L)MMP-2 proceeded at a similar rate to wild-type MMP-2 but occurred earlier than at 25 °C with degradation products (arrows) that were not seen at 25 °C (Fig. 4B). NH2-terminal sequencing of the 66-kDa form of (M392L)MMP-2 confirmed correct processing at Tyr-81 as with wild-type MMP-2. Similar to (E375A)MMP-2, the (M392C)MMP-2 mutant was catalytically inactive in all of the protease assays including autoactivation Inhibition—The effect of Met substitution on the inhibition of MMP-2 by the zinc-chelating chemical inhibitors Batimastat (BB-94) and 1,10-phenanthroline was examined. The Ki(app) values for both the hydroxamate inhibitor Batimastat and 1,10-phenanthroline were similar for (M392L)MMP-2, (M392S)MMP-2, and wild-type MMP-2 (Table III). Wild-type MMP-2, (M392L)MMP-2, and (M392S)MMP-2 were also equally inhibited by the specific protein inhibitors TIMPs -1, -2, and -4, (data not shown). Hence, these results show that mutation of Met-392 did not alter the inhibition characteristics of the enzyme and further indicates the absence of structural perturbations in the active site or zinc binding triad and that the region of the N-domain, which participates in the interaction with TIMPs, is structurally preserved.Table IIIInhibition by zinc-chelating inhibitorsEnzymeKi(app)Batimastat1,10-phenanthroline×10−9 mMMP-20.167 (2)12.968 (2)(M392L)MMP-20.139 (3)11.299 (2)(M392S)MMP-20.182 (3)9.549 (2) Open table in a new tab Tryptic Digest—To assess the conformation of the Met mutants, susceptibility to degradation by trypsin was tested (Fig. 5). The mutants pro(M392S)MMP-2 and pro(M392L)MMP-2 were resistant to degradation by trypsin similar to pro(E375A)MMP-2 and wild-type proMMP-2 (the latter shows an additional product at 66 kDa, which represents autoactivated material). However, pro(M392C)MMP-2 was significantly degraded by 1 h, suggesting that the conformation of this protein was destabilized by the mutation. Similar to wild type and pro(E375A)MMP-2, pro(M392S)MMP-2 and pro(M392L)MMP-2 were susceptible to degradation by trypsin in the presence of EDTA, forming similar degradation products. This indicates that, like wild-type MMP-2, these mutants utilize Ca2+ and/or Zn2+ to maintain a stable folded conformation. However, the pattern of degradation of pro(M392C)MMP-2 in the presence of EDTA appeared identical to that in the absence of EDTA, suggesting that pro(M392C)MMP-2 is not folded correctly, or was expressed in the apo form. To date there are >770 members of the metzincin superfamily in all species (17Gomis-Ruth F.X. Mol. Biotechnol. 2003; 24: 157-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), all harboring the canonical methionine. This methionine is the only totally conserved residue in the superfamily. Even the Zn2+-ligating histidine residues are not conserved because reverse orientations of the sequence HEXH are known to occur in some metzincins. The molecular packing environment around the Met also is highly varied among the different members of the metzincins. Because of its absolute conservation, it is widely believed that this methionine residue plays an essential role in the structure or activity of these proteinases. To date, there have been few reports where the conserved Met of the metzincin superfamily has been altered. For the MMPs, the previous studies used a C domain-truncated mutant of MMP-8 (neutrophil collagenase). Both methionine residues were replaced with selenomethionine (SeMet) by expression in Escherichia coli (34Qoronfleh M.W. Ho T.F. Brake P.G. Banks T.M. Pulvino T.A. Wahl R.C. Eshraghi J.

Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) for crystallography studies. The remaining study investigated the effect of mutating the conserved Met of the serralysin protease C from Erwinia chrysanthemi (36Hege T. Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here we have specifically addressed the role of the conserved Met of the metzincins within the context of full-length human MMP-2, an archetypal member of the MMP family, using a site-directed mutagenesis approach. Substitution of Met-392 with Leu or Ser did not significantly affect MMP-2 activity. As well as cleaving quenched fluorescent peptides, which only bind at the active site, (M392L)MMP-2- and (M392S)MMP-2 cleaved gelatin, native type I collagen, and MCP-3 with rates similar to wild-type MMP-2. Cleavage of these substrates requires cooperative binding at the active site and exosites on the collagen binding domain and the hemopexin domain, respectively (11Overall C.M. Mol. Biotechnol. 2002; 22: 51-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further indicating unaltered structure, orientation and function of the active site and exosites on the ancillary domains. These mutants also cleaved heat-denatured human mannose-binding lectin (data not shown) as efficiently as wild-type MMP-2 (21Butler G.S. Sim D. Tam E. Devine D. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17511-17519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The kinetics of APMA-initiated autoactivation and the activated species formed by (M392L)MMP-2, (M392S)MMP-2, and wild-type MMP-2 were indistinguishable. Of the two studies of SeMet-substituted MMP-8 catalytic domain, one found no differences in activity (34Qoronfleh M.W. Ho T.F. Brake P.G. Banks T.M. Pulvino T.A. Wahl R.C. Eshraghi J. Chowdhury S.K. Ciccarelli R.B. Jones B.N. J. Biotechnol. 1995; 39: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and the other found a slightly reduced kcat/Km for cleavage of the general quenched fluorescent peptide substrate (35Pieper M. Betz M. Budisa N. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Bode W. Tschesche H. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the same peptide used in our studies. E. chrysanthemi protease C mutants M226L and M226C had reduced activity (3-8-fold) against various substrates with M226C retaining 20% activity (36Hege T. Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, we found that (M392C)MMP-2 was completely inactive, potentially because of the introduction of a chelator moiety in close proximity to the Zn2+ ion and to the disrupted structure as indicated from tryptic susceptibility. All three Met mutants, (M392L)MMP-2, (M392S)MMP-2, and (M392C)MMP-2, were sufficiently stable to be purified. However, if purification was carried out in Tris buffer instead of MES buffer, (M392L)MMP-2 and (M392S)MMP-2 showed an increased tendency to autodegrade compared with wild-type MMP-2 (see Fig. 1B). This finding suggests that the substitution of Met-392 might result in some perturbation of the propeptide-active site interaction that normally maintains latency. This effect may be masked in the autoactivation studies because the organomercurial APMA functions by perturbing the prodomain structure, which leads to breakage of the Cys-Zn2+ ion bond. In contrast, Met mutants of protease C including M226S could not be isolated because of instability, whereas M226L and M226C could (36Hege T. Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). (M392L)MMP-2 and (M392S)MMP-2 were as resistant to trypsin cleavage as wild-type MMP-2 but were similarly degraded in the presence of EDTA, demonstrating that these mutants also utilize zinc and calcium to maintain a stable folded conformation. TIMPs bind to the active site of MMPs as an elongated wedge over a very extended surface (37Gomis-Ruth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar), whereas the hydroxamate inhibitors such as Batimastat bind only the active site cleft and chelate the catalytic zinc (14Bode W. Fernandez-Catalan C. Tschesche H. Grams F. Nagase H. Maskos K. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 639-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) as does 1,10-phenanthroline. (M392L)MMP-2 and (M392S)MMP-2 were inhibited by TIMPs -1, -2, and -4 and by the hydroxamate inhibitor Batimastat and 1,10-phenanthroline with similar Ki(app) values to wild-type enzyme, suggesting that the catalytic domain active site architecture and zinc coordination properties are preserved in these mutants. SeMet-substituted MMP-8 also retained inhibitor binding properties (34Qoronfleh M.W. Ho T.F. Brake P.G. Banks T.M. Pulvino T.A. Wahl R.C. Eshraghi J. Chowdhury S.K. Ciccarelli R.B. Jones B.N. J.

Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). (M392C)MMP-2 was degraded by trypsin, even in the absence of EDTA, indicating that the catalytic domain of this mutant is not folded correctly or does not bind the stabilizing metal ions, thus accounting for the absence of catalytic activity of this mutant in all of the protease assays. Substitution of Met-215 of MMP-8 with SeMet resulted in only a slight disturbance around the SeMet compared with wild-type MMP-8 in the three-dimensional structure (35Pieper M. Betz M. Budisa N. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Bode W. Tschesche H. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography of the protease C mutants suggested that the removal of the van der Waals interactions of the methionine sulfur with the imidazoles permits small movements of the zinc-liganding His residues. Hence, Pieper et al. (35Pieper M. Betz M. Budisa N. Gomis-Ruth F.X. Bode W. Tschesche H. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) conclude that the conserved Met of the metzincin family is important for catalysis because of a role in maintaining the environment of the catalytic zinc. However, our study did not detect any significant effects on the activity of replacing the conserved Met-392 of MMP-2 with Leu or Ser. It is possible that the mutation of Met-392 to other amino acids less conserved in space or hydrophobicity characteristics would have significant effects on activity or that there is an effect other than on stability or catalysis. It is surprising that the substitution of an absolutely conserved active site residue in an enzyme superfamily appears to have little, if any, effect on the structure or activity of MMP-2. Yet this is not unprecedented. For example, site-directed mutagenesis of cytochrome c showed that an invariant Phe long believed to be essential for activity is not required for function (38Pielak G.J. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Nature. 1985; 313: 152-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Hence, the reason for the absolute conservation of the Met-turn methionine in the metzincin superfamily is elusive. Even if the Met is a remnant from an ancestral enzyme where it played a critical function in a different framework, there must be sufficient selective pressure remaining to conserve this residue in more than 770 metzincins, even in such a subtle role. The role of the active site methionine of the metzincins may become critical only when the enzyme is operating under extreme conditions, for example, in vivo in inflammation where the pH is reduced and temperatures are increased. The challenge is to determine which parameters to test to solve this enigma."

The gE-gI heterodimer has been implicated in cell-to-cell spread of virus and is a receptor for the Fc fragment of IgG. Previous studies localized the gE-gI-binding site on human IgG to a region near the interface between the CH2 and CH3 domains of Fc, which also serves as the binding site for bacterial and mammalian Fc receptors. Although there are two potential gE-gI-binding sites per Fc homodimer, only one gE-gI heterodimer binds per IgG in gel filtration experiments. Here we report production of recombinant human Fc molecules that contain zero, one, or two potential gE-gI-binding sites and use them in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments to show that two gE-gI heterodimers can bind to each Fc. Further characterization of the gE-gI interaction with Fc reveals a sharp pH dependence of binding, with KD values of ∼340 and ∼930 nm for the first and second binding events, respectively, at the slightly basic pH of the cell surface (pH 7.4), but undetectable binding at pH 6.0. This strongly pH-dependent interaction suggests a physiological role for gE-gI dissociation from IgG within acidic intracellular compartments, consistent with a mechanism whereby herpes simplex virus promotes intracellular degradation of anti-viral antibodies.

Alphaherpesviruses encode two glycoproteins that bind the Fc region of IgG to function together as a viral Fc receptor (FcR). 1The abbreviations used are: FcR, Fc receptor; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; gE, glycoprotein E; gI, glycoprotein I; hdFc, heterodimeric Fc; hIgG, human IgG; HSV-1, herpes simplex virus type 1; LDL, low density lipoprotein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MSX, methionine sulfoximine; nbFc, non-binding Fc; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; PRV, pseudorabies virus; RU, resonance unit; VZV, varicella zoster virus; wtFc, wild-type Fc. This FcR is a heterodimer composed of two type I transmembrane proteins, glycoprotein E (gE) and glycoprotein I (gI), on the surface of virions and virally infected cells (1Westmoreland D.

The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) gE protein contains 550 amino acids, including an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence, an ∼441-residue extracellular region followed by a predicted single transmembrane helix, and an ∼106-residue C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The HSV-1 gI protein contains 390 amino acids, including an N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequence, an ∼248-amino acid extracellular portion followed by a predicted single transmembrane helix, and an ∼94-amino acid C-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Potential endocytosis signals, including YXXφ motifs (tyrosine followed by any two amino acids and a hydrophobic residue), dileucine motifs, and acidic cluster motifs containing phosphorylation sites, are located in the cytoplasmic tails of gE and gI. Transfection experiments in HeLa cells to express HSV-1 gE proteins with truncated cytoplasmic tails localized two sorting signals: one located within an acidic stretch and a second located within a stretch of residues containing two tyrosine-based tetrapeptide motifs (7Alconada A. Bauer U. Sodeik B. Hoflack B. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 377-387Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with studies of the gE cytoplasmic domains of two commonly studied alphaherpesviruses, pseudorabies virus (PRV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), that identified functional roles for acidic motifs containing consensus casein kinase II phosphorylation sites and tyrosine motifs (8Zhu Z. Hao Y. Gershon M.D. Ambron R.T. Gershon A.A. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6563-6575Google Scholar, 9Olson J.K. Grose C. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4042-4054Google Scholar, 10Alconada A. Bauer U. Hoflack B.

A methionine-leucine endocytosis signal in the cytoplasmic tail of VZV gI has been shown to be important for the efficient internalization of gI in transfected HeLa cells (13Olson J.K. Grose C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1542-1551Google Scholar). In vitro and in vivo studies characterizing the FcR function of the gE-gI heterodimer have underscored its importance for alphaherpesviruses in escaping antibody-dependent components of the immune response. Mutational studies determined that the HSV-1 gE-gI heterodimer is required for high affinity binding of monomeric IgG, whereas gE alone is a monomeric, lower affinity FcR that only binds IgG-antigen immune complexes, such as IgG-coated erythrocytes (3Johnson D.C. Frame M.C. Ligas M.W. Cross A.M. Stow N.D. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1347-1354Google Scholar, 14Dubin G. Frank I. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2725-2731Google Scholar). FcR activity has also been demonstrated for gE-gI complexes from VZV and PRV (15Litwin V. Jackson W. Grose C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3643-3651Google Scholar, 16Favoreel H.W. Nauwynck H.J. Van Oostveldt P. Mettenleiter T.C. Pensaert M.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8254-8261Google Scholar). The gE-gI complex may play a protective role whereby binding of the Fc portion of IgG could sterically inhibit neutralization of the virus or infected cells by anti-HSV antibodies as well as complement- and cell-mediated lysis of infected cells (17Adler R. Glorioso J.C. Cossman J. Levine M. Infect. Immun. 1978; 21: 442-447Google Scholar, 18Dowler K.W. Veltri R.W. J. Med. Virol. 1984; 13: 251-259Google Scholar). Additional data suggest that gE-gI binds anti-HSV IgG by a process known as antibody bipolar bridging in which the Fab domains of an anti-HSV antibody bind to specific viral antigens, and the Fc domain binds to gE-gI. FcR-mediated antibody bipolar bridging that interferes with antibody- and complement-mediated neutralization has been demonstrated on the surfaces of HSV-1 virions and virally infected cells (19Frank I. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4479-4488Google Scholar). Furthermore, under conditions in which antibody bipolar bridging could occur, gE was required for the protection of infected cells from antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, C1q complement binding, and granulocyte attachment (20Dubin G. Socolof E. Frank I. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 7046-7050Google Scholar, 21Van Vliet K.E. De Graaf-Miltenburg L.A. Verhoef J. Van Strijp J.A. Immunology. 1992; 77: 109-115Google Scholar). More recently, a functional HSV-1 FcR was shown to be critical for protecting HSV-1-infected mice from attack by human anti-HSV IgG (22Nagashunmugam T. Lubinski J. Wang L. Goldstein L.T. Weeks B.S. Sundaresan P. Kang E.H. Dubin G. Friedman H.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5351-5359Google Scholar). Several properties of IgG binding by gE-gI have been elucidated. Early studies showed that IgG binding by HSV-1-infected cells is both species- and subtype-specific. Thus, rabbit IgG and human IgG (hIgG) subtypes 1, 2, and 4 (hIgG1, hIgG2, and hIgG4) bind to HSV-1, but rodent IgG and many allotypes of hIgG3 do not bind (23Johansson P.J. Hallberg T. Oxelius V.A. Grubb A. Blomberg J. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 796-804Google Scholar, 24Johansson P.J. Myhre E.B. Blomberg J. J. Virol. 1985; 56: 489-494Google Scholar, 25Johansson P.J. Schroder A.K. Nardella F.A.

Michaelsen T.E. Immunology. 1985; 54: 565-572Google Scholar). Correlating with these results, the affinities of recombinant, soluble gE-gI for different hIgG subtypes derived from a surface plasmon resonance-based binding assay resulted in a rank ordering of the hIgG binding preference as follows: hIgG4 > hIgG1 ≥ hIgG2 (equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values ranging from 200 to 400 nm ⋙ hIgG3 (undetectable binding) (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar). When the arginine at position 435 of hIgG3 was substituted with a histidine, which is the amino acid found at position 435 in hIgG1, hIgG2, and hIgG4, binding of gE-gI was partially restored (KD ∼1 μm), and conversely, when histidine 435 of hIgG4 was replaced with an arginine, binding was undetectable (28Chapman T.L.

These results suggest that the gE-gI-binding site on Fc includes residue 435 at the CH2-CH3 domain interface of Fc, consistent with the finding that fragment D of protein A, which also binds to the CH2-CH3 domain interface of Fc, inhibits binding of Fc fragments to HSV-1-infected cells (29Johansson P.J.H. Nardella F.A. Sjoquist J. Schroder A.K. Christensen P. Immunology. 1989; 66: 8-13Google Scholar). In addition to gE-gI, other proteins known to recognize the CH2-CH3 domain interface of Fc regions of antibodies include bacterial FcRs (protein A and protein G), mammalian FcRs (FcαRI, a receptor for IgA, and FcRn, which transports IgG from the mother to the fetus or neonate), and rheumatoid factor, an autoimmune antibody that recognizes the Fc portion of IgG and IgM. Each of these Fc-binding proteins interacts with Fc at the CH2-CH3 domain junction of each subunit of the Fc dimer with a binding stoichiometry of two Fc-binding proteins per Fc molecule (30Sauer-Eriksson A.E.

Other FcRs, such as FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII, and FcϵRI, mediate the interaction with their respective Fc partners via a portion of the CH1-CH2 hinge and a region of the CH2 domain in an asymmetric interaction in which only one FcR binds to each Fc dimer (37Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Google Scholar, 38Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S.

Although gE-gI shares an Fc-binding site with protein A, protein G, FcRn, and rheumatoid factor, our earlier characterization of the interaction between a soluble version of gE-gI and IgG suggested that only one gE-gI binds per IgG molecule (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar). Because FcRn can form 1:1 complexes with IgG even though two FcRn molecules bind per IgG at equilibrium (40Huber A.H. Kelley R.F. Gastinel L.N. Bjorkman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1077-1083Google Scholar, 41Popov S. Hubbard J.G. Kim J. Ober B. Ghetie V. Ward E.S. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 521-530Google Scholar, 42Sanchez L.M. Penny D.M. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9471-9476Google Scholar), we conducted additional experiments to investigate the binding stoichiometry of the gE-gI/Fc interaction. By using recombinant human Fc molecules that contain zero, one, or two potential gE-gI-binding sites, we determined the binding stoichiometry of gE-gI and Fc in an analytical ultracentrifugation assay. These experiments demonstrate that one or two gE-gI molecules can bind per Fc homodimer, analogous to other 2:1 FcR/Fc interactions in which the Fc-binding protein recognizes each of the CH2-CH3 domain interfaces on homodimeric Fc. We also examined the binding of gE-gI to Fc as a function of pH, discovering that gE-gI binds tightly to Fc at neutral or slightly basic pH but undetectably at acidic pH. This pH-dependent Fc binding profile is opposite to that of FcRn, which exhibits a sharply pH-dependent binding profile with binding at acidic pH ≤ 6.5 but not at neutral pH (43Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Bjorkman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 638-642Google Scholar, 44Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 571-580Google Scholar, 45Simister N.E. Mostov K.E. Nature. 1989; 337: 184-187Scopus (600) Google Scholar). None of the other FcR/Fcγ interactions, however, are known to be affected by pH changes near neutral. The sharp pH dependence of the FcRn/Fc interaction is critical to its function by allowing FcRn to bind IgG in the acidic environment of intracellular transport vesicles and release IgG at the slightly basic pH of the bloodstream. We suggest that the opposite, but equally striking, pH-dependent binding properties of the gE-gI/Fc interaction play a role in gE-gI function, in the transport of anti-HSV antibodies from the cell surface to lysosomes for degradation. Construction of and Expression of Soluble gE-gI and gE Vectors—A soluble version of the gE-gI heterodimer was expressed in CHO cells as described previously (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar). Soluble gE-gI was also expressed in insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding both gE and gI. For insect cell expression, standard PCR subcloning techniques were used to insert fragments of the gE (encoding residues 1-419) and gI (encoding residues 1-266) genes of HSV strain KOS into the BglII-EcoRI sites (gE) and BamHI site (gI) of the pAcUW51 dicistronic baculovirus expression vector (Pharmingen). An oligo-linker encoding a factor Xa cleavage site followed by six histidine residues and a stop codon was ligated into the vector in-frame with the 3′ end of the gI gene. An expression vector for gE alone with a C-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed by PCR subcloning a fragment of the gE gene of HSV strain KOS (encoding residues 1-390) into the BglII-EcoRI sites of pAcUW51 (Pharmingen) in-frame with an oligo-linker encoding a factor Xa cleavage site followed by six histidine residues and a stop codon at the 3′ end of the gE gene. The open reading frames of all constructs were completely sequenced. Recombinant baculovirus stocks for expression of gE-gI and gE were generated by cationic liposome cotransfection of the dicistronic expression plasmid with linear wild-type baculovirus DNA in High 5 insect cells (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. The gI construct used in these experiments and in previous studies (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar, 46Rizvi S.M. Raghavan M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 11897-11901Google Scholar) contains a deletion of residues 221-227, which comprise the last copy of a seven-amino acid repeat (XXXPSTT, where X is any amino acid) in the putative stalk region near the C terminus. The alteration in this region does not affect the Fc-binding function of the gE-gI heterodimer but significantly increases the expression levels of the heterodimer in insect cells, with the yield increasing from ∼200 μg of purified gE-gI heterodimer per liter for expression of the unaltered construct to ∼10 mg/liter for the altered construct (data not shown). Purification of Soluble gE-gI Heterodimer—Soluble gE-gI was initially purified from either CHO cell supernatants directly or pH-adjusted insect cell supernatants by binding to an IgG affinity column (constructed by covalently coupling human IgG to Sepharose) at pH 7.4 and eluting at pH 11.5 as described (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar). After the pH-dependent binding of gE-gI to Fc was discovered, we used a gentler protocol involving a pH 5.5 buffer (50 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) to elute gE-gI from the IgG affinity column. Proteins eluted from the IgG affinity column were subsequently purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 or Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences). Purification of Soluble gE—Insect cell supernatants containing secreted gE were buffer exchanged into nickel-binding buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) and passed over a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). Bound protein was eluted in buffer containing 40 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 HiLoad 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Analysis of the peak fractions on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel showed a band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 47 kDa (data not shown). Approximately 70 mg of gE were obtained per liter of insect cell supernatants. Expression of Wild-type and Mutant Human Fc Proteins—Three forms of human Fc, wild-type Fc (wtFc), heterodimeric Fc (hdFc), and non-binding Fc (nbFc), which contain two, one, and zero potential gE-gI-binding sites, respectively, were constructed using a human IgG1 heavy chain cDNA (provided by David Cosman, Immunex, Seattle) as described previously for expression of the analogous forms of rat Fc (34Martin W.L. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12639-12647Google Scholar). For expression of wild-type Fc, the DNA encoding the Fc region of human IgG1 (residues 223-447) was PCR-amplified and subcloned in-frame with the rat IgG2a signal sequence into pBJ5-GS, a mammalian expression vector that carries the glutamine synthetase gene as a means of selection and amplification in the presence of the drug methionine sulfoximine (MSX) (47Bebbington C.R. Hentschel C.C.G. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 163-188Google Scholar). The expression vector encoding wtFc was transfected into CHO cells using the LipofectAMINE 2000 protocol (Invitrogen) with selection and amplification of stable cell lines using methionine sulfoximine as described (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar, 43Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Bjorkman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 638-642Google Scholar). Clones were screened for secretion of Fc by testing the supernatants for binding to protein A-Sepharose, as visualized on a Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-PAGE gel run under reducing and non-reducing conditions. Positive clones yielded a protein migrating with apparent molecular masses of 35 and 70 kDa under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively. The nbFc expression construct was generated by mutating residues located in the vicinity of the CH2-CH3 domain interface of wtFc, a region of Fc that has been implicated in gE-gI binding (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar). The QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) was used to make the following substitutions, which are analogous to substitutions introduced into rat Fc to abrogate binding to rat FcRn (34Martin W.L. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12639-12647Google Scholar): Met-252 to Gly, Ile-253 to Gly, His-310 to Glu, His-433 to Glu, His-435 to Glu, and Tyr-436 to Ala. PCR was used to add a factor Xa cleavage site and six histidines to the 3′ end of the nbFc construct. This DNA encoding nbFc was subcloned into pBJ5-GS as described above for wtFc. The expression vectors encoding wtFc and nbFc were cotransfected into CHO cells using the LipofectAMINE 2000 protocol (Invitrogen) with selection and amplification of stable cell lines using MSX as described (28Chapman T.L. You I. Joseph I.M. Bjorkman P.J. Morrison S.L. Raghavan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6911-6919Google Scholar, 43Gastinel L.N. Simister N.E. Bjorkman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 638-642Google Scholar). Supernatants from clones that were viable in MSX were assayed for expression of either hdFc or nbFc by binding to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and for expression of wtFc or hdFc by binding to FcRn-Sepharose, similar to the identification of clones expressing rat wtFc, hdFc, and nbFc (34Martin W.L. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12639-12647Google Scholar). Positive clones secreted a mixture of hdFc, which is a heterodimer containing one wtFc and one nbFc chain, and wtFc and nbFc homodimers. On a 10% SDS-PAGE gel run under reducing conditions, nbFc migrates as a band of apparent molecular mass 37 kDa, wtFc migrates at an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa, and hdFc migrates as two bands, 37 and 35 kDa (data not shown). Purification of Human Fc Proteins—CHO cells were grown to confluence in 15-cm tissue culture plates, and supernatants were collected every 2-3 days. wtFc was purified from the harvest media using a modification of a previously described functional purification for rat Fc involving pH-dependent binding to a rat FcRn-Sepharose column (34Martin W.L. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12639-12647Google Scholar). The pH of supernatants containing wtFc was adjusted to 5.8 with the addition of 1 m citrate buffer, pH 5.5 (∼85 ml of citrate buffer/600 ml of supernatant), and then passed over the FcRn-Sepharose column. The column was washed with 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) NaN3 and then eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. Eluted proteins were concentrated in a 15-ml Amicon (10,000-Da cut-off) spin concentrator and either stored or loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 or Superdex 75 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl. Peak fractions were concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml and stored at 4 °C. hdFc and nbFc were purified from media harvested from CHO cells that secrete a mixture of wtFc, hdFc, and nbFc. The purification scheme is similar to that used to purify rat hdFc and nbFc (34Martin W.L. Bjorkman P.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12639-12647Google Scholar). In the first step, hdFc and nbFc are separated from wtFc using a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen) to which the double histidine tag of nbFc and the single histidine tag of hdFc bind. In the second step, hdFc and nbFc are separated at low pH by passage over an FcRn-Sepharose column, to which hdFc binds and nbFc flows through. Supernatants containing wtFc, hdFc, and nbFc were buffer exchanged into 40 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 5% (w/v) glycerol and then mixed in batch with Ni-NTA-agarose. The Ni-NTA-agarose was washed with 40 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole and eluted with 40 mm Tris, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole. Peak fractions were collected, concentrated, and buffer exchanged in 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and loaded onto a rat FcRn-Sepharose column. nbFc flows through this column, and hdFc was eluted at pH 8.3. To control for oversaturation of the FcRn column, the flow-through was passed over the column repeatedly until the final two passes showed no evidence of hdFc elution at pH 8.3. hdFc and nbFc were concentrated and buffer exchanged in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, and then either stored or loaded onto a size-exclusion column as described for wtFc. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically using extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 69,280 (wtFc, hdFc, and nbFc), 87,630 (gE-gI), and 64,010 m-1 cm-1 (gE), which were calculated from the amino acid sequence using the ProtParam tool in Expasy (48Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—wtFc, hdFc, or nbFc were each mixed with insect cell-expressed gE-gI, which contains a C-terminal His6 tag on gI, in various molar ratios from 1:1 (4.9 μm gE-gI, 4.9 μm Fc) to 6:1 (29.4 μm gE-gI, 4.9 μm Fc) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl. Fc samples were examined alone at a concentration of 4.9 μm; gE-gI was examined alone at concentrations of 9.8 and 14.7 μm, and gE was examined alone at a concentration of 12 μm. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with two-sector charcoal-filled Epon 12-mm centerpieces equipped with quartz windows that were loaded with 416 μl of protein and 423 μl buffer as a reference. The samples were spun at 42,000 rpm at 20 °C in an An-60 Ti rotor in a Beckman Ultima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge. Radial scans using absorbance optics were collected at 230, 250, or 280 nm with a step size of 0.003 cm in continuous mode at an interval of about 4 min until the samples reached the bottom of the cell. Data were analyzed using the c(s) routine in the program SEDFIT (49Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Google Scholar), which uses maximum entropy regularization and a finite element solution to the Lamm equation to fit the sedimentation data. The c(s) analysis results in a differential sedimentation coefficient distribution in which sample diffusion has been accounted for explicitly. The apparent sedimentation coefficients (s*) reported in these studies were not corrected to standard conditions due to the complications of calculating partial specific volumes for the Fcs and gE-gI since they are glycosylated; however, all s* values were determined under identical conditions. In the samples in which there was one predominant species, molecular masses were estimated using the fit value for the frictional ratio. The absorbance of samples used for centrifugation was measured at 230, 250, and 280 nm, and a scale factor between wavelengths was calculated for each set of samples with a given molar ratio. c(s*) distributions were scaled such that all have units of A280 per Svedberg. Biosensor Studies—Surface plasmon resonance studies were performed using a BIAcore 2000 instrument. Purified recombinant wtFc fragment in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, was immobilized on a research-grade CM5 biosensor chip using primary amine coupling as described in the Biacore manual. For gE-gI binding to immobilized Fc, one flow cell was mock coupled with buffer only, whereas the other three flow cells were coupled with Fc at low coupling densities (75-467 resonance units (RU)) limiting the possibility of mass transport (50Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Google Scholar). Mass transport was not observed in a test in which gE-gI was injected at various flow rates, and the sensorgrams were superimposed to check whether or not the association phases aligned (data not shown). 3-Fold dilutions of a concentrated stock of purified CHO cell-expressed, soluble gE-gI were made starting at 10.9 μm and ending at 0.5 nm. For each binding experiment at a different pH, the pH of a triple buffer containing 25 mm sodium acetate, 25 mm MES, 25 mm bis-Tris propane, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) P-20 surfactant was adjusted appropriately. 250 μl of each of the eight gE-gI concentrations and at least one buffer sample were injected at 50 μl/min, and RUs were recorded as a function of time. After the each injection of gE-gI, a 30-s injection of 250 mm di-ammonium hydrogen citrate, pH 5.0, was used to disrupt the binding and regenerate the surface. Sensorgrams for the binding of gE-gI to immobilized wtFc at pH values between 6.0 and 8.2 in steps of 0.2 pH units were processed using the Scrubber software package (BioLogic Software, Campbell, Australia; www.biologic.com.au) and analyzed using single-site and bivalent ligand models in Clamp99 (51Morton T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2060959023,"Nitric oxide (NO)-mediated relaxation of colonic smooth muscle is crucial for the maintenance of human gut function. The molecular mechanisms of NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation involve cyclic GMP-mediated inhibition of store-dependent calcium signaling. Recently, IRAG (inositol 1,4,5-trisphophate receptor-associated cGMP kinase substrate) has been characterized as a novel target molecule of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKI) mediating NO-/cGMP-dependent inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-dependent calcium release in transfected COS cells. The aim of the present study was to characterize IRAG expression and its functional role in NO-dependent signaling in human colonic smooth muscle. Reverse transcriptase-PCR revealed IRAG mRNA expression in human colon, rectum, and cultured colonic smooth muscle cells. In cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells, bradykinin (BK) elicited InsP3-dependent calcium transients that were repeatable and independent of extracellular calcium. The NO donor sodium nitroprusside and the specific cGK activator 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic-monophosphate (8-pCPT-cGMP) significantly inhibited BK-induced increase in intracellular calcium. Cells transfected with antisense oligonucleotides raised against IRAG (IRAG-AS) showed strongly decreased IRAG protein expression. In these cells, sodium nitroprusside and 8-pCPT-cGMP both failed to modulate BK-induced calcium transients. Thus, endogenous IRAG appears to be essentially involved in the NO/cGK-dependent inhibition of InsP3-dependent Ca2+-signaling in colonic smooth muscle.

Smooth muscle tone is predominately regulated by the rise and fall of free intracellular cytosolic calcium concentration (1Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V.

Sci. 1997; 18: 484-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Increased levels of cGMP lead to smooth muscle relaxation predominately via activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK) (14Hofmann F. Ammendola A. Schlossmann J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Carvajal J.A. Germain A.M. Huidobro-Toro J.P. Weiner C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 409-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The crucial role of cGK for gastrointestinal smooth muscle function became apparent in cGKI-deficient mice showing a selective lack of NO-dependent smooth muscle relaxation associated with severe gastrointestinal dysfunction and marked hypertrophy of gastrointestinal smooth muscle (16Pfeifer A. Klatt P. Massberg S. Ny L. Sausbier M. Hirneiss C. Wang G.X. Korth M. Aszodi A. Andersson K.E. Krombach F. Mayerhofer A. Ruth P. Fassler R. Hofmann F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of cGKI-dependent smooth muscle cell relaxation, however, have not been fully understood (for a review, see Ref. 14Hofmann F. Ammendola A. Schlossmann J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1671-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a recent study (see Ref. 26Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), a new protein has been identified as molecular target of cGKI in smooth muscle microsomal membranes and has been termed IRAG (InsP3R-associated cGMP kinase substrate). IRAG precipitated together with cGKIβ and InsP3 receptor type I in a complex which was found to be localized at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. In transfected COS cells, the coexpression of IRAG with cGKI was essential for the cGMP-dependent inhibition of InsP3-dependent calcium release. This inhibition has further been demonstrated to depend on the cGKI-mediated phosphorylation of IRAG at Ser696. No interaction between cGKI and the InsP3 receptor was observed when IRAG was absent (17Ammendola A. Geiselhoringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To date, only little is known about IRAG expression and its function in gastrointestinal tissues. Furthermore, evidence for a functional role of IRAG in smooth muscle tissue is lacking. We show here that IRAG is expressed in human colon and that the suppression of IRAG protein expression in human colonic smooth muscle cells is sufficient to abolish the inhibitory effect of sodium nitroprusside and 8-pCPT-cGMP on bradykinin-induced calcium release in these cells. Tissue Preparation—Tissues from human colon and rectum were obtained from surgical resections for colorectal malignant disease. The tissues were macroscopically and microscopically free of tumor. The muscle layer containing the nerve plexus was separated from the mucosa by sharp dissection and prepared as described previously (18Saur, D., Paehge, H., Schusdziarra, V., and Allescher, H. D. Gastroenterology, 118, 849-858Google Scholar, 19Saur D. Seidler B. Paehge H. Schusdziarra V. Allescher H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25798-25814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation and RT-PCR—Liquid nitrogen-frozen colon, rectum muscle layer preparations, and cultured colonic smooth muscle cells (harvested after splitting the cells three and six times) were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica), and total RNA was isolated using the guanidine isothiocynate/phenol/chloroform extraction method as described previously (18Saur, D., Paehge, H., Schusdziarra, V., and Allescher, H. D. Gastroenterology, 118, 849-858Google Scholar, 20Saur D. Neuhuber W.L. Gengenbach B. Huber A. Schusdziarra V. Allescher H.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: G349-G358Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Subsequently, reverse transcription and PCR amplification were carried out as described before (19Saur D. Seidler B. Paehge H. Schusdziarra V. Allescher H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25798-25814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed with specific intron spanning primer pairs for human IRAG (Table I) for 35 cycles using random hexamer primed cDNA from human colon, rectum, colon smooth muscle cells, and as negative control, HeLa cells (annealing 60 °C, 30 s; extension 72 °C, 30 s; denaturation 94 °C, 15 s). Amplification products were cloned into pCRII plasmid (Invitrogen) and subjected to DNA sequence analysis (GATC, Konstanz, Germany).Table IOligonucleotides of sense- (S) and antisense strand (AS) primers used in RT-PCRNameSequenceIRAG (S)5′-CAA GTT GGT GAG TGA GCG ATT C-3′IRAG (AS)5′-TGC TTC GAG AGG ATG TAG GAG AA-3′ Open table in a new tab Cell Culture—An established culture of human colonic smooth muscle cells (Clonetics Normal Human Cell Systems, San Diego, CA) was used for calcium imaging experiments and Western blot analysis. Cells had been isolated from a single donor, brought into cell culture, and shipped after two splittings. The cell culture has been shown to retain smooth muscle phenotype for at least 15 population doublings by positive staining for α-actin and negative staining for factor VIII by the provider. To minimize dedifferentiation, we did not use cells from passages higher than the 5th and 6th passage, although comparable cultures of primary cells have been used beyond that (21Bielefeldt K. Whiteis C.A. Sharma R.V. Abboud F.M. Conklin J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1439-G1450PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zholos A.V. Fenech C.J. Prestwich S.A. Bolton T.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 528: 521-537Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). When used for experiments, cells preserved the typical morphology of smooth muscle cells, and characteristic calcium transients were elicited by high potassium depolarization or cholinergic stimulation with carbachol (data not shown). Furthermore, these cells expressed cGKI β as demonstrated by Western blot analysis (not shown) (23Fritsch R. Kurjak M. Allescher H.D. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 2543Google Scholar). Cells were grown in smooth muscle growth medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 μg/liter human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 5 mg/liter insulin, 0.39 mg/liter dexamethasone, 50 mg/liter gentamicin, and 50 μg/liter amphothericin B (all Biowhittaker, Baltimore, MD) in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere. Medium was replaced every other day. Cells were grown to 80% confluence before they were used for calcium imaging experiments. Western Blot Analysis—For Western blot analysis, cultured human colonic myocytes were harvested using a cell scraper, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and suspended in protein lysis buffer (0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm Tris-HCl, and 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% protease inhibitor mixture). Cells were then freeze-thawed, treated with ultrasound (four strokes of 15 s, cooled on ice between treatments), and lysed using a 24-gauge needle. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (24Huber A. Saur D. Kurjak M. Schusdziarra V. Allescher H.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1146-G1156PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% slab gels using a 3% stacking gel in a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus according to the procedure of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) using Tris-glycine-SDS buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, 0.05% SDS, and 20% methanol). After blocking the membrane with 5% dry milk, we probed blots for 2 h with a selective antibody for IRAG (diluted 1:2000). Purified protein was used as a positive control as described previously (5Huber A. Trudrung P. Storr M. Franck H. Schusdziarra V. Ruth P. Allescher H.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G629-G637PubMed Google Scholar). The antibody was raised against the common sequence of IRAG (17Ammendola A. Geiselhoringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 26Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.X. Allescher H.D. Korth M.

Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system; Amersham Biosciences). For comparison of IRAG protein expression in cells transfected with antisense oligonucleotides directed against IRAG (IRAG-AS, Table II) and in controls transfected with inverse sequence oligonucleotides (IRAG-IS), identical amounts of protein were separated on each lane, and the intensity of protein bands stained by the IRAG antibody was compared densitometrically after digitalization (One-D-Scan, Scanalytics).Table IIAntisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides raised against IRAG (IRAG-AS 1, IRAG-AS 2) and inverse sequence oligonucleotides (IRAG-IS 1, IRAG-IS 2)NameSequenceIRAG-AS 15′-CsAsCsAGCAACGCTGACCsCsTsC-3′IRAG-AS 25′-AsAsCsTTGGCTTCTTCCAGCsAsGsC-3′IRAG-IS 15′-CsTsCsCCAGTCGCAACGAsCsAsC-3′IRAG-IS 25′-CsGsAsCGACCTTCTTCGGTTsCsAsA-3′ Open table in a new tab Transfection with Antisense Oligonucleotides—A mixture of two antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides raised against IRAG mRNA (IRAG-AS 1, IRAG-AS 2; TIB MOLBIOL, Berlin, Germany) was used to silence IRAG protein synthesis in cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells. IRAG-AS 1 was raised against mRNA encoding for the domain shown to interact with cGKIβ, and IRAG-AS 2 was raised against the mRNA region encoding for the Ser696 phosphorylation site of IRAG (17Ammendola A. Geiselhoringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Table II). Cells used in control experiments were transfected with inverse sequence phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (IRAG-IS 1, IRAG-IS 2, Table II). Delivery of IRAG-AS/IRAG-IS into cells was facilitated using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol (27Tao M. Miyano-Kurosaki N. Takai K. Takaku H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 48 h before they were used for calcium imaging experiments and Western blot analysis. Intracellular delivery of the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides was controlled by the use of fluorochrome (Texas Red)-marked oligonucleotides (TIB MOLBIOL) in pilot experiments. Measurement of Intracellular Calcium with Dual Wavelength Microfluorescence Technique—Fura-2 calcium imaging was performed following a standard protocol. Colonic myocytes at passage 5 or 6 were grown on glass coverslips to ∼80% confluence. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were loaded with Fura-2 AM (5 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C. Fura-2 AM-loaded cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and reincubated with HEPES buffer (in mm: 118 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, 15 NaHCO3, 11 glucose, 0.9 Na2PO4, 0.8 MgSO4, pH 7.4) to ensure complete intracellular hydrolysis of the ester. For fluorescence measurements, coverslips were brought into the perfusion chamber of a Zeiss Axiovert (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) fluorescence microscope. During experiments, cells were rinsed with HEPES buffer at 5 ml/min. All drugs and nonaqueous stock solutions were diluted in HEPES buffer. For stimulation, cells were exposed to bradykinin for 60 s. Cells were exposed to various concentrations of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and 8-pCPT-cGMP 5 min prior to the second stimulation period, and ODQ and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs were added 10 min prior to the second stimulation period. An equilibration time of 300 s was inserted before and between single stimulation periods. Data Analysis—Calcium imaging data are shown as ratios calculated from fluorescence intensities measured at 340- and 380-nm excitation (ratio F340/F380) and 520-nm emission wave length as described elsewhere (28Ma, H. T., Patterson, R. L., van Rossum, D. B., Birnbaumer, L., Mikoshiba, K., and Gill, D. L. Science, 287, 1647-1651Google Scholar). Data were collected from all cells visible within a microscopic field, but only cells reactive to bradykinin during the first stimulation period were used for analysis. This was done to eliminate nonreactive or damaged cells from analysis. A cell was considered reactive to bradykinin when exposure to bradykinin induced an at least 5-fold increase in ratio F340/F380. Virtually all cells that showed a typical calcium transient in response to bradykinin fulfilled this criterion and underwent analysis. For statistical analysis, the peak ratios reached within single stimulation periods were compared after subtraction of basal ratios. Cells were stimulated repeatedly with each serving as its own control. Statistical significance was evaluated with paired student's t test. Result were considered significant at p < 0.05. Values are presented as Δ peak ratio ± S.E. Drugs and Solutions—Drugs used for calcium imaging were 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), SNP, 8-pCPT-cGMP, bradykinin, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs (all from Calbiochem), ODQ (Tocris Cookson), and Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Triton X-100 was purchased from Fluka (Neu Ulm, Germany); EGTA, EDTA, SDS, glycine, β-mercaptoethanol, and Hepes were from Merck; acrylamid/bisacrylamid was from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany); dry milk powder was from Bio-Rad; protease inhibitor mixture Set was from Calbiochem. All other materials were purchased as indicated. Expression of IRAG mRNA in Human Colon and Cultured Colonic Smooth Muscle Cells—The presence of IRAG mRNA in human colon and rectum muscle layers and in cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells was determined by RT-PCR using specific intron spanning primer pairs (Table I). A single band at the expected size of ∼125 bp was obtained in the investigated tissues and cultured colonic smooth muscle cells after passage three and six, respectively, whereas no PCR product was seen for HeLa cells (Fig. 1). Sequencing of all cloned RT-PCR products confirmed IRAG mRNA expression. Transfection of Human Colonic Smooth Muscle Cells with Antisense Oligonucleotides Raised against IRAG mRNA—To determine the functional role of IRAG in human colonic smooth muscle, IRAG protein expression was inhibited by transfection of cultured colonic myocytes with antisense oligonucleotides raised against IRAG mRNA (IRAG-AS, Table II). Cells for control experiments were transfected with inverse sequence oligonucleotides (IRAG-IS, Table II). Intracellular delivery of oligonucleotides was facilitated using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. In pilot experiments, cultured cells were transfected with fluorochrome-labeled oligonucleotides. Eight hours after transfection, a cytoplasmatic fluorescence signal could be detected in virtually all cells in culture (not shown). Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antiserum raised against IRAG (17Ammendola A. Geiselhoringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) demonstrated IRAG protein expression in cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells. A protein band corresponding to IRAG was detected at ∼125 kDa. A less intense band detected at ∼135 kDa was not seen when the antibody was probed with purified IRAG (not shown) and most likely represents a nonspecific band. Comparison of IRAG protein expression was performed using equal amounts of protein extracted from cells transfected with IRAG-AS and from controls transfected with IRAG-IS. Cells transfected with antisense oligonucleotides raised against IRAG showed a significantly lower intensity of the IRAG protein band as compared with controls transfected with IRAG-IS (Fig. 2A). Densitometric analysis of bands revealed a reduction of IRAG band intensity to 17% of controls (Fig. 2B; n = 4; p < 0.001), indicating a strongly decreased IRAG protein expression in cells transfected with IRAG-AS. Bradykinin-induced Calcium Transients in Human Colonic Smooth Muscle Cells—Ratiometric measurements of changes in [Ca2+]i in cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells were performed using the dual wavelength microfluorescence technique. Low resting Fura-2 ratios were maintained for more than 2 h during experiments. The addition of bradykinin (10-6m) to the perifusate evoked a rapid increase in intracellular calcium concentration followed by a slightly delayed decrease back to baseline. Allowing 300 s of washout between stimulation episodes, a minimum of three subsequent stimulations of cells with bradykinin resulted in virtually identical calcium signals without significant variation (not shown). In a typical experiment, 60 and 70% of all cells visualized simultaneously within a microscopic field were reactive to bradykinin (10-6m) and underwent further analysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine the source of calcium mobilized by bradykinin, extracellular calcium was removed from the perifusate after the first stimulation episode. Fig. 3, A and B, shows a representative tracing and the statistics of bradykinin-induced calcium transients in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium. There was no significant change of peak ratios during stimulation of cells with bradykinin in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium (n = 7, not significant), indicating Ca2+-release from intracellular stores. To further characterize bradykinin-induced calcium release, cells were incubated with 2-APB (75 μm) after the first stimulation period. 2-APB has been shown to inhibit InsP3-dependent calcium release when used at this concentration range (29Maruyama T. Kanaji T. Nakade S. Kanno T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 498-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) and has widely been used as an inhibitor of InsP3-sensitive calcium release in intact cells (28Ma, H. T., Patterson, R. L., van Rossum, D. B., Birnbaumer, L., Mikoshiba, K., and Gill, D. L. Science, 287, 1647-1651Google Scholar). Application of 2-APB (75 μm) did not result in any detectable changes in [Ca2+]i. However, bradykinin-induced calcium transients were almost completely abolished when cells were incubated with 2-APB (5% of control peak ratios, n = 10, p < 0.001), indicating that bradykinin induced calcium release from InsP3-dependent stores (Fig. 4). Inhibition of Bradykinin-induced Calcium Transients by NO-dependent Pathways—To characterize the effect of NO-dependent pathways on bradykinin-induced calcium transients in human colonic smooth muscle cells, the NO donor SNP was added to the perifusate after the first stimulation period. Increasing concentrations of SNP inhibited bradykinin-induced calcium release in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect observed at a concentration of 5 × 10-4m (38% of control peak ratios, n = 41, p < 0.001; Fig. 5A). To ensure that the effect of SNP was mediated by cGMP-dependent mechanisms, cells were coincubated with ODQ, a selective and membrane-permeable inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase. ODQ (2.5 × 10-6m) completely reversed the inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium release induced by 5 × 10-4m SNP (116% of control peak ratios, n = 9, not significant, Fig. 5A), indicating that the SNP-induced inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium transients was mediated by soluble guanylate cyclase. Similarly, when cells were incubated with Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs (5 × 10-5m), a selective and membrane-permeable inhibitor of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGK), 5 × 10-4m SNP failed to inhibit bradykinin-induced calcium transients and induced a slight increase of bradykinin-induced calcium release (112% of control peak ratios, n = 20, p < 0.05, Fig. 5A), whereas Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs had no effect on bradykinin-induced calcium transients in the absence of SNP (not shown). To further support these findings, we co-incubated cells with 8-pCPT-cGMP, a membrane-permeable and direct activator of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. 8-pCPT-cGMP induced a dose-dependent inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium transients with a maximum effect observed at 10-4m (54% of control peak ratios, n = 19, p < 0.001, Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data indicate that, in cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells, the activation of the NO/cGK-signaling pathway induces a significant inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium transients. Lack of Inhibition of Bradykinin-induced Calcium Transients by NO-dependent Pathways in Colonic Smooth Muscle Cells with Decreased IRAG Expression—To test whether IRAG is involved in the NO/cGK-dependent inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium release in cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells, we used phosphorothioate-stabilized antisense oligonucleotides to suppress IRAG protein expression (Fig. 2) and determined the effect of SNP and 8-pCPT-cGMP on bradykinin-induced calcium release in these cells. Both compounds were used at concentrations that had been found to be highly effective in native cells (Fig. 5). To rule out nonspecific effects of the transfection procedure, controls were transfected with inverse sequence oligonucleotides (IRAG-IS, Table II) following an identical protocol. Fig. 6, A and B, shows a representative tracing and the statistics obtained from controls transfected with IRAG-IS, confirming the significant inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium transients by SNP (5 × 10-4m) found in native cells (38% of control peak ratios, n = 11, p < 0.05). Similarly, 8-pCPT-cGMP (10-4m) induced an inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium release in controls transfected with IRAG-IS that was comparable with the inhibition observed in native cells (46.5%, n = 17, p < 0.001, Fig. 7, A and B).Fig. 78-pCPT-cGMP inhibits calcium transients in controls. A, representative cytosolic fura-2 ratiometric measurement from a single cultured human colonic smooth muscle cell (control cell population transfected with IRAG-IS) stimulated with BK 10-6m twice, before and during incubation with 8-pCPT-cGMP (10-4m), a direct activator of cGK. B, 8-pCPT-cGMP (10-4m) attenuates BK-induced calcium signaling to 46.5% of control (Δ average peak ratio ± S.E., n = 17, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Parallel experiments were performed using cultured colonic smooth muscle cells transfected with IRAG-AS. Decreased IRAG protein expression in these cells was demonstrated by Western blot (Fig. 2). To ensure that the calcium imaging data obtained from the three differently treated groups of cells were comparable, peak ratios measured during stimulation with bradykinin (10-6m) were compared between native cells, cells transfected with IRAG-AS, and cells transfected with IRAG-IS. Between these three groups, peak ratios did not differ significantly (p > 0.1 for each comparison between single groups). However, in cells transfected with IRAG-AS, the NO donor SNP (5 × 10-4m) failed to significantly modulate bradykinin-induced calcium release (99.6% of control peak ratios, n = 19, not significant). Fig. 8, A and B, shows a representative tracing and the statistics of the effect of SNP (5 × 10-4m) on bradykinin-induced calcium transients in cultured colonic smooth muscle cells transfected with IRAG-AS. Similarly, when cells transfected with IRAG-AS were exposed to bradykinin in the presence of the cGMP-analogue and direct activator of cGK, 8-pCPT-cGMP (10-4m), no significant effect on bradykinin-induced calcium release was observed (102% of control peak ratios, n = 22, not significant). Fig. 9, A and B, shows a representative tracing and the statistics of bradykinin-induced calcium transients in cultured colonic smooth muscle cells transfected with IRAG-AS before and during incubation with 8-pCPT-cGMP (10-4m). In summary, the inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium release by SNP and the cGK activator 8-pCPT-cGMP in cultured human colonic smooth muscle cells was abolished when the expression of the recently discovered cGKI substrate protein IRAG was substantially suppressed. These data suggest a crucial role for endogenously expressed IRAG in the interaction between NO-dependent signaling and IP3-dependent calcium release in human colonic smooth muscle. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that IRAG, a recently discovered cGKI substrate protein, is expressed in the human gastrointestinal tract. To characterize the functional role of IRAG in NO-dependent signal transduction in human gastrointestinal smooth muscle, calcium imaging studies using cultured colonic smooth muscle cells were performed. Bradykinin was used to induce IP3-dependent calcium transients in these cells. Bradykinin has successfully been used as a tool for store-dependent calcium release in gastrointestinal smooth muscle (30Wassdal I. Larsen K. Iversen J.G. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1999; 165: 259-264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other cell types (26Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 31Clementi E. Vecchio I. Sciorati C. Nistico G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 517-524PubMed Google Scholar). The persistence of bradykinin receptors under culture conditions has been reported in primary cultured rabbit colonic smooth muscle (32Hyman P.E. Diego A. Ridout D. Yuan Q.X. Ennes H. Cominelli F. Snape W.J.J. Tomomasa T. Gastroenterology. 1992; 102: 1597-1604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Bradykinin-induced calcium transients in cultured colonic smooth muscle cells were unaffected by the removal of extracellular calcium but virtually completely abolished in the presence of 2-APB, indicating calcium mobilization from InsP3-sensitive calcium stores. The nitric oxide donor SNP significantly inhibited the bradykinin-induced increase in intracellular calcium. This inhibition was dose-dependent and reached statistical significance at 5 × 10-5m SNP with a maximum effect observed at 5 × 10-4m. To make sure that the effects observed with these relatively high concentrations of SNP used in this experimental setting were mediated by activation of the cGMP/cGK pathway, we used two specific blockers of downstream targets of the NO/cGK pathway. Low concentrations of ODQ, a specific inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase (33Zhao Y. Brandish P.E. DiValentin M. Schelvis J.P. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10848-10854Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and the cGK-inhibitor, Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs, both totally reversed the inhibitory effect of SNP on bradykinin-induced calcium release, indicating that the SNP-induced inhibition was mediated by cGMP and cGK. Of course, nonspecific effects of sodium nitroprusside are likely to occur, especially with the relatively high concentrations used in these experiments. However, the SNP-induced inhibition of BK-induced calcium release was entirely blocked by both ODQ and Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs, indicating that effects besides activation of the cGMP/cGK pathway are unlikely to significantly contribute to the inhibition of BK-induced calcium release in the cell type studied here. Direct pharmacological activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase using the membrane-permeable cGMP-analogue 8-pCPT-cGMP mimicked the effect of SNP and dose-dependently inhibited bradykinin-induced calcium transients to a similar extent, supporting a cGK-dependent inhibition of BK-induced calcium release in these cells. An inhibition of InsP3-dependent calcium signaling by NO-dependent mechanisms has been reported previously in gastrointestinal smooth muscle (34Murthy K.S. Severi C. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G967-G974PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in other cell types (35Tertyshnikova S. Yan X. Fein A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 512: 89-96Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 36Kannan M.S. Prakash Y.S. Johnson D.E. Sieck G.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L1-L7PubMed Google Scholar) and has been considered to substantially contribute to the relaxatory effect of NO in smooth muscle. However, the molecular mechanisms linking NO-dependent signal transduction and InsP3-dependent calcium release have been subject to much debate. A cGK-dependent inhibition of InsP3 production has been described in permeabilized gastric smooth muscle cells (34Murthy K.S. Severi C. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G967-G974PubMed Google Scholar) and in transfected CHO cells (37Ruth P. Wang G.X. Boekhoff I. May B. Pfeifer A. Penner R. Korth M. Breer H. Hofmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2623-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a direct phosphorylation of the InsP3 receptor by cGKI has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo (38Komalavilas P. Lincoln T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21933-21938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 39Haug L.S. Jensen V. Hvalby O. Walaas S.I. Ostvold A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7467-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, an increased reuptake of calcium ions into sarcoplasmatic stores achieved by cGK-dependent activation of sarcoplasmatic Ca2+-ATPase pumps has been demonstrated in vascular smooth muscle (40Cornwell T.L. Pryzwansky K.B. Wyatt T.A. Lincoln T.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 923-931PubMed Google Scholar, 41Raeymaekers L. Eggermont J.A. Wuytack F. Casteels R. Cell Calcium. 1990; 11: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 42Raeymaekers L. Hofmann F. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, which of these mechanisms significantly contribute to the NO-/cGK-mediated inhibition of InsP3-dependent calcium signaling in gastrointestinal smooth muscle has not been clearly established. Some functional evidence has been obtained recently indicating a principal role of the newly discovered cGKI-substrate protein IRAG in linking cGKI with InsP3-dependent calcium release (26Schlossmann J. Ammendola A. Ashman K. Zong X. Huber A. Neubauer G. Wang G.X. Allescher H.D. Korth M. Wilm M. Hofmann F. Ruth P. Nature. 2000; 404: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). IRAG has been found to complex together with cGKIβ and InsP3 receptor type I in smooth muscle membranes. In transfected COS cells, this complex was found to be localized at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Functional evidence for the specific interaction of cGKI, IRAG, and InsP3 receptor type I has been obtained from experiments using a two-hybrid screen and transfected COS cells. In these cells, the interaction between cGKI and the InsP3 receptor has been shown to depend on the coexpression of IRAG. Similarly, a cGMP-dependent inhibition of InsP3-dependent calcium release has only been observed in the presence of both cGKIβ and IRAG. The mechanisms of interaction between cGKIβ and IRAG have been characterized by mutation analysis showing that mutation of IRAG at the phosphorylation site at Ser696 abolished the cGK-dependent inhibition of InsP3-dependent calcium release (17Ammendola A. Geiselhoringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These findings are of special interest since they suggest a central role for IRAG in linking NO-dependent signaling to InsP3-dependent calcium signaling. However, most of the functional data were obtained from experiments using COS cells in which cGKIβ and IRAG had been overexpressed, a nonphysiologic condition bearing the risk of artifacts. Up to now, no data existed providing evidence for a functional role of endogenous IRAG in smooth muscle tissue. In this study, we aimed to determine whether endogenously expressed IRAG is involved in the signaling cascade linking NO-dependent pathways and InsP3-dependent calcium signaling in human colonic smooth muscle. Therefore, we inhibited IRAG protein expression by transfection of cells with phosphorothioate-stabilized antisense oligonucleotides raised against IRAG-mRNA (IRAG-AS). Cells used in control experiments were transfected with inverse sequence oligonucleotides to exclude nonspecific effects. Exposure of cells with strongly diminished IRAG expression to bradykinin evoked calcium transients that were undistinguishable from those seen in native cells and controls. This indicates that the suppression of IRAG is not associated with an increase in bradykinin-induced calcium release in these cells. However, the suppression of IRAG protein expression was sufficient to abolish the inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium release induced by SNP and 8-pCPT-cGMP. This is in good agreement with the findings using Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs to inhibit cGMP-dependent protein kinase in these cells since Rp-8-pCPT-cGMPs (5 × 10-5m) entirely blocked the SNP-induced inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium release but had no effect on bradykinin-induced calcium release when applied in the absence of SNP. Taken together, these data suggest that, in human colonic smooth muscle cells, IRAG is essentially involved in the cGK-dependent inhibition of InsP3-dependent calcium transients. However, our findings cannot rule out the functional involvement of other mechanisms of interaction between the NO/cGK pathway and InsP3-dependent calcium release in mediating the observed effects. Furthermore, since smooth muscle tissues show significant heterogeneity, conclusions based on these data have to be limited to the type of smooth muscle tissue used in the experiments, and gene knockout models will be required to clarify the functional consequences of a lack of IRAG for the development and function of smooth muscle in various organ systems. Since the interaction of cGKI and IRAG has been found to be limited to the cGKIβ isoform (17Ammendola A. Geiselhoringer A. Hofmann F. Schlossmann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24153-24159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the functional involvement of IRAG suggests that the cGK-dependent inhibition of bradykinin-induced calcium transients in human colonic smooth muscle cells is mediated by the cGKIβ isoform. This is in contrast to recent findings obtained from murine vascular smooth muscle cells deficient for both cGKIα and cGKIβ (43Feil R. Gappa N. Rutz M. Schlossmann J. Rose C.R. Konnerth A. Brummer S. Kuhbandner S. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In those cells, the NO-dependent inhibition of noradrenaline-induced calcium transients could be rescued by expression of cGKIα, but not cGKIβ (43Feil R. Gappa N. Rutz M. Schlossmann J. Rose C.R. Konnerth A. Brummer S. Kuhbandner S. Hofmann F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1080-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, besides differences in the experimental approaches leading to these divergent results, smooth muscle tissues from various organ systems and different species may show considerable variation in the specific cellular function of the two cGKI isoforms. In summary, these data point to a physiologic role of IRAG in human gastrointestinal smooth muscle. They support the idea that IRAG is considerably involved in mediating NO-dependent inhibition of calcium signaling in gastrointestinal smooth muscle contributing to NO-dependent relaxation."
https://openalex.org/W2002859651,"Humans heterozygous for PKD1 or PKD2 develop autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, a common genetic disorder characterized by renal cyst formation and extrarenal complications such as hypertension and vascular aneurysms. Cyst formation requires the somatic inactivation of the wild type allele. However, it is unknown whether this recessive mechanism applies to life-threatening vascular aneurysms, which could involve weakening of the endothelial lining or surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Drosophila Pkd2 at 33E3 (Pkd2) encodes a PKD2 family of Ca(2+)-activated Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels. We show here that loss-of-function Pkd2 mutations severely reduced the contractility of the visceral SMCs, which was restored by expressing wild type Pkd2 cDNA via a muscle-specific Gal4 driver. The effect of Pkd2 mutations alone on the skeletal muscle was minimal but was exacerbated by ryanodine-induced perturbation of intracellular Ca(2+) stores. Consistent with this, Pkd2 interacted strongly with a ryanodine receptor mutation, causing a synergistic reduction of larval body wall contraction rate that is normally regulated through Ca(2+) oscillation during excitation-contraction coupling in the skeletal muscle. These results suggest that PKD2 cooperates with the ryanodine receptor to promote optimal muscle contractility through intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis. Further genetic analysis indicated that Pkd2 is strongly haploinsufficient for normal SMC contractility. Since Ca(2+) homeostasis is a conserved mechanism for optimal muscle performance, our results raise the possibility that inactivation of just one PKD2 copy is sufficient to compromise vascular SMC contractility and function in PKD2 heterozygous patients, thus explaining their increased susceptibility to hypertension and vascular aneurysms."

Rasooly A. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 61: 1-10Google Scholar, 2Dinges M.M. Orwin P.M. Schlievert P.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 16-34Google Scholar). SEB is one of the major virulence factors regulated by a quorum-sensing mechanism in the setting of staphylococcal infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains. These high-risk community-acquired infections, which may lead to NMTSS, occur with increasing frequency as compared with the greater than 2 million hospital-acquired infections recorded annually in the United States (3Fey P.D. Said-Salim B. Rupp M.E. Hinrichs S.H. Boxrud D.J. Davis C.C. Kreiswirth B.N. Schlievert P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 196-203Google Scholar, 4Clark N.M. Hershberger E. Zervosc M.J. Lynch J.P. Curr. Opin. Crit. Care. 2003; 9: 403-412Google Scholar). Strikingly, SEB induces a fatal respiratory distress syndrome in non-human primates, suggesting its potential use as a bioweapon on the battlefield or in mass civilian settings (5Mattix M.E. Hunt R.E. Wilhelmsen C.L. Johnson A.J. Baze W.B. Toxicol. Pathol. 1995; 23: 262-268Google Scholar, 6Madsen J.M. Clin. Lab. Med. 2001; 21: 593-605Google Scholar). Potential air-borne, water-borne, and food-borne use of SEB led to its designation by the United States Centers for Disease Control as a category B agent. In terms of its mechanism of action, SEB is avidly bound by the T cell receptor Vβ chain and by major histocompatibility complex class II proteins on dendritic cells or macrophages (7Seth A. Stern L.J. Ottenhoff T.H. Engel I. Owen M.J. Lamb J.R. Klausner R.D. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 324-327Google Scholar, 8White J. Herman A. Pullen A.M. Kubo R. Kappler J.W. Marrack P.

The resulting intercellular “synapse” generated by SEB engagement leads to excessive production of the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interferon γ (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, and IL-6. T cell-produced inflammatory cytokines contribute to massive vascular injury, organ failure, and depending on the mode of exposure potentially lethal respiratory distress syndrome or toxic shock (1Balaban N. Rasooly A. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2000; 61: 1-10Google Scholar, 2Dinges M.M. Orwin P.M. Schlievert P.M. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 13: 16-34Google Scholar, 5Mattix M.E. Hunt R.E. Wilhelmsen C.L.

Active immunization prior to SEB exposure and passive immunization immediately after exposure are not readily available (6Madsen J.M. Clin. Lab. Med. 2001; 21: 593-605Google Scholar). We have designed an alternative approach to antibody-mediated neutralization of SEB and related toxins by targeting a common step in their intracellular signaling to the nucleus required for inflammatory cytokine gene expression. The genes that encode inflammatory cytokines are under the control of stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs), including nuclear factor κB (NFκB), activator protein 1, nuclear factor of activated T cells, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) (10Hawiger J. Immunol. Res. 2001; 23: 99-109Google Scholar). For example, SRTFs are translocated to the nucleus in CD4+ T cells in response to staphylococcal enterotoxin A, which is structurally and functionally related to SEB (11Sundstedt A. Sigvardsson M. Leanderson T. Hedlund G. Kalland T. Dohlsten M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 979-984Google Scholar). Following their mobilization to the T cell nuclear compartment, SRTFs act in concert to stimulate transcription of multiple genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and other mediators of inflammation (12Goldfeld A.E. McCaffrey P.G. Strominger J.L. Rao A. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1365-1379Google Scholar, 13Tsai E.Y. Yie J. Thanos D. Goldfeld A.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5232-5244Google Scholar, 14Sica A. Dorman L. Viggiano V. Cippitelli M. Ghosh P. Rice N. Young H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30412-30420Google Scholar). We reasoned that simultaneous blockade of these four SRTFs at the level of cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttling may yield in vivo protection from T cell-mediated toxicosis induced by SEB. To test this hypothesis, we applied cell-permeant peptides initially engineered by us to inhibit nuclear import of SRTFs in monocytes and macrophages (15Lin Y.Z. Yao S.Y. Veach R.A. Torgerson T.R. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14255-14258Google Scholar, 16Liu X.-Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Google Scholar). This process is stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through Toll-like receptor 4-generated signaling. Because LPS does not stimulate T cells, we thus aimed to inhibit nuclear import evoked by a distinct recognition- and signaling-based mechanism initiated by SEB interaction with T cells. The in vivo SEB toxicity model analyzed in this study is characterized by cytokine-dependent fulminant liver injury (17Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Google Scholar). The novel inhibitors of nuclear import employed by us in the SEB toxicity model contain a linear or cyclized form of the nuclear localization signal (NLS) from the p50/NFκB1 subunit of NFκB (16Liu X.-Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Google Scholar). NLS was fused to the signal sequence hydrophobic segment from fibroblast growth factor 4. This hydrophobic segment serves as a membrane-translocating motif (MTM), which enables peptide or protein cargoes to cross freely the plasma membrane of multiple cell types in various organs (16Liu X.-Y.

Chem. 2004; 279: 11425-11431Google Scholar). Of equal importance, these cell-permeant peptides carrying NLS have been shown to simultaneously block the nuclear import of multiple SRTFs in the cultured Jurkat T cell line, a process that is mediated by the shuttling molecule Rch1/importin α/karyopherin-α 2 (26Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092Google Scholar). Thus, we envisaged that global in vivo inhibition of SRTF-regulated genes encoding multiple mediators of inflammation in T lymphocytes, which are essential for SEB-induced toxicity (27Marrack P. Blackman M. Kushnir E. Kappler J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 455-464Google Scholar, 28Aoki Y. Hiromatsu K. Arai T. Usami J. Makino M. Ishida H. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3494-3500Google Scholar), would provide a new and useful platform to counteract noxious intracellular signaling evoked by SEB and related toxins. Peptide Synthesis, Purification, and Labeling—MTM-containing peptides (SN50, cSN50, and SM), and MTM-deficient peptide (N50c) were synthesized, purified, filter-sterilized, and analyzed as described elsewhere (16Liu X.-Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Google Scholar, 26Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092Google Scholar). To monitor the delivery of peptides to T cells, the SN50 and SM peptides were coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After extensive dialyzes against water to remove free FITC, labeled peptides were concentrated in a speedvac and used immediately. The N50c peptide was coupled with fluorescein-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After labeling, the peptide was dialyzed against two changes (1 h each) of sterile phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, then two changes (1 h each) of phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and then lyophilized and stored at -20 °C. Before use, it was reconstituted with water. Relative fluorescence of all peptide solutions was determined using a Fusion Universal Microplate Analyser (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 485 nm excitation, 535 nm emission, 20 nm band pass. Peptide solutions with equivalent fluorescence units were used in all experiments. Delivery and Intracellular Detection of Cell-permeant Peptides ex Vivo and in Vivo—For ex vivo detection of fluorescein-labeled peptides in primary T cells, spleens were harvested from wild type C57BL/6 mice and T cells were isolated by negative selection using magnetic beads coated with anti-major histocompatibility complex class II (1a) monoclonal antibody (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified CD3+ T cells (>89% CD3+ as determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS)) (BD PharMingen) were resuspended in RPM1 1640 without supplements and incubated with 5 μm FITC-labeled SN50 or SM peptide or unconjugated FITC for 30 min at 25 °C in duplicate. Fluorescein-labeled N50c, which lacks an MTM, was used as a control. One of each was then treated with 5 μg/ml proteinase K (BD Biosciences, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) for 10 min at 37 °C. To document susceptibility of peptides to proteolytic degradation, they were incubated with 5 μg/ml proteinase K for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of T cells. After all treatments, cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline. Cell fluorescence was measured in FACScalibur using forward versus side light scatter; green fluorescence was collected with a 530 ± 30-nm band pass filter. This protease accessibility test assures measurement of that pool of fluorescein-labeled peptide that was translocated across the plasma membrane to reach an intracellular compartment (cytoplasm), making it inaccessible to proteinase K action. For in vivo detection of fluorescein-labeled peptides in T cells, blood and spleens were harvested (16Liu X.-Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Google Scholar) from wild type BALB/c mice 30 min after intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 500 μl of labeled peptide or FITC solutions with equivalent fluorescence units. T cells were isolated and analyzed by FACS as in ex vivo experiments. Cytokine Production by Cultured Spleen Cells—Murine lymphocytes were isolated from the spleens of wild type C57BL/6 mice and transgenic C57BL/6 mice that express IκB.DN (inhibitor of NFκB nuclear translocation) as previously described (16Liu X.-Y. Robinson D. Veach R.A. Liu D. Timmons S. Collins R.D. Hawiger J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16774-16778Google Scholar) and cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum containing no detectable LPS (≤0.006 ng/ml as determined by the manufacturer, Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 2 mml-glutamine, 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml). Splenocytes (2 × 106/ml) were treated with peptides SN50 and SM at 10, 20, and 30 μm for 30 min at 25 °C followed by the addition of 0.5 μg/ml of SEB (Toxin Technology, Sarasota, FL). Splenocytes were then distributed in 200-μl aliquots (6 × 105 cells/well) to a 96-well plate and cultured for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% C02. Plates were spun at 800 × g for 2 min. The supernatant was removed and frozen at -80 °C for later assay. Animal Treatment Protocols—Wild type C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All mice were female (8-12 weeks old) with an average weight of 20 grams. Wild type BALB/c mice were injected ip with 5 μg of SEB (25 μg/ml; Sigma) and 20 mg of d-galactosamine (d-Gal) (100 mg/ml; Sigma), both in pyrogen-free saline. SEB contained less than 1 endotoxin unit of LPS/mg of SEB as determined by the Limulus chromogenic assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Falmouth, MA). Peptides cSN50 (0.7 mg) and SM (0.7 mg) or 5% dimethyl sulfoxide in sterile H20 as diluent were injected in 200 μl volumes ip into mice before (30 min) and after (30, 90, 150, 210 min, and 6 and 12 h) SEB and d-Gal challenge. In some experiments, cSN50 peptide and diluent were injected only after the SEB and d-Gal challenge, with the first ip injection of cSN50 peptide 30 min after SEB and d-gal followed by 5 ip injections at 90, 150, 210 min, and 6 and 12 h. Transgenic C57BL/6 mice expressing IκB.DN in the T cell lineage were engineered and bred as previously described (29Boothby M.R. Mora A.L. Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Ballard D.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1897-1907Google Scholar). Wild type and transgenic C57BL/6 mice were injected ip with 150 μg of SEB (0.75 mg/ml; Toxin Technology) and 20 mg of d-Gal. Highly purified SEB contained less than 1 endotoxin unit of LPS/mg of SEB after its additional purification by the manufacturer. Animals were observed at hourly intervals for signs of toxic shock (piloerection, ataxia, and the lack of reaction to cage motion). Inactive animals were euthanized. Surviving animals were euthanized at 72 h, except for three survivors that were observed for 10 days before euthanasia. Animal handling and experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the American Association of Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cytokine Assays of Blood and Cultured Cell Supernatants—Blood samples (40 μl) taken from the saphenous vein were collected in heparinized tubes before (30 min) and after SEB challenge at intervals shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4. Plasma levels of IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in plasma and cultured cell supernatant were measured by a cytometric bead array (CBA) (BD PharMingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, beads coated with capture antibodies specific for IL-2, -4, and -5, IFN-γ, and TNF-α proteins were utilized.

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Apoptosis among liver cells was evaluated by histology and by TUNEL (TdT-dependent dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assay using the Apop Tag reagent (Chemicon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—All in vivo experimental data were expressed as mean ± S.E. A two-way repeated measure analysis of variance and a log rank test were used to determine the significance of the difference in cytokine production and survival, respectively. Student's t test was used to determine the significance of the difference in cytokine production in cultured splenocytes. Intracellular Delivery of Nuclear Import Inhibitors to T Cells—Two cell-permeant peptides, SN50 and SM, were studied for their ability to enter primary T cells ex vivo and in vivo. The cell-permeant SN50 peptide ferries NLS as its cargo, whereas the cargo of the SM peptide was a mutated version of the same NLS (Table I). The NLS in the SN50 peptide is known to interact with the nuclear import adaptor protein Rch1/importin α/karyopherin α 2 (26Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092Google Scholar). Conversely, the mutated sequence in the SM peptide is inactive in terms of inhibition of SRTFs nuclear import and served as a control. A third peptide, called N50c, is a truncated form of SN50 that lacks the MTM and was used as a plasma membrane translocation-negative control (Table I) (26Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092Google Scholar).Table IThe composition and labeling of cell-permeant peptidesPeptideMembrane-translocating motifNLS or its mutantSN50 peptideAAVALLPAVLLALLAPVQRKRQKLMPFITC SN50 peptide(FITC) AAVALLPAVLLALLAPVQRKRQKLMPcSN50 peptideAAVALLPAVLLALLAPCYVQRKRQKLMPCSM peptideAAVALLPAVLLALLAPAAADQNQLMPFITC SM peptide(FITC) AAVALLPAVLLALLAPAAADQNQLMPFM N50c(FM) CVQRKRQKLMP Open table in a new tab The SN50, SM, and N50c peptides, labeled with fluorescein, were added to ex vivo cultured murine spleen-derived primary T cells. Although the SN50 and SM peptides were detected in primary T cells, the N50c peptide lacking a membrane-translocating motif was not, thus indicating the MTM dependence of ex vivo delivery of NLS peptide cargo to these cells (Fig. 1, A-C). To verify further the intracellular delivery of cell-permeant SN50 and SM peptides, we employed a protease-accessibility test that is based on the incubation of T cells with cell-permeant peptides, before and after treatment with a broad-range protease (proteinase K), followed by FACS. Treatment of fluorescein-conjugated peptides with proteinase K prior to their addition to T cells, degraded all peptides tested and prevented SN50 and SM delivery into T cells as compared with proteinase K-untreated peptides and cells (Fig. 1, A and B). On the other hand, treatment with protease following 30 min of incubation of T cells with FITC-labeled peptides did not ablate T cell-associated fluorescence. The observed reduction in T cell-associated fluorescence, as compared with the protease-untreated cells, was due to proteolytic removal of an extracellular pool of fluorescein-labeled peptides absorbed on the surface of T cells. Thus, the protease-accessibility test indicates that both cell-permeant peptides were similarly delivered to T cells, the principal targets of SEB (27Marrack P. Blackman M. Kushnir E. Kappler J. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 455-464Google Scholar, 28Aoki Y. Hiromatsu K. Arai T. Usami J. Makino M. Ishida H. Yoshikai Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3494-3500Google Scholar). Nuclear Import Inhibitors Suppress Inflammatory Cytokine Gene Expression in Cultured Primary T Cells—To validate the T cell delivery of cell-permeant peptides by demonstrating their intracellular function, we evaluated the ability of SN50 and SM peptides to interfere with SEB-induced production of inflammatory cytokines in ex vivo cultured splenocytes. For these studies, splenocytes were isolated from wild type C57BL/6 mice and then treated with an SN50 or SM peptide prior to exposure to the T cell agonist SEB. The SN50 peptide at a concentration of 30 μm significantly inhibited the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNFα (p <0.02), IFNγ (p <0.05), and IL-2 (p <0.05) in SEB-stimulated splenocytes derived from wild type animals (Fig. 1D). For SN50, the effective concentration leading to 50% inhibition (EC50) of cytokine production was 20 ± 4 μm (not shown). In contrast, cytokine expression was unaffected following treatment with the SM peptide (30 μm) containing the MTM fused to a mutated version of the NLS (26Torgerson T.R. Colosia A.D. Donahue J.P. Lin Y.Z. Hawiger J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6084-6092Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Thus, SN50 interferes significantly ex vivo in primary cells with SEB-induced inflammatory cytokine production by blockading the Rch1-dependent mechanism responsible for the nuclear import of NFκB and other SRTFs. This SN50 peptide-directed ex vivo inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production was compared with the effect of the transgene that encodes an inhibitor of NFκB nuclear translocation in T cells (29Boothby M.R. Mora A.L. Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Ballard D.W. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1897-1907Google Scholar). IκB.DN is a truncated form of the cytoplasmic protein IκBα with an NH2-terminal deletion that prevents its phosphorylation and degradation, thereby retaining NFκB in the cytoplasm of stimulated T cells. Splenocytes derived from transgenic C57BL/6 mice expressing the inhibitor IκB.DN produced significantly lower levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α (p <0.02), IFN-γ (p <0.05), and IL-2 (p <0.02) in response to SEB as compared with splenocytes from wild type C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that SN50 peptide produces a similar suppression of inflammatory cytokine expression as transgene-directed inhibition of NFκB nuclear translocation in SEB-stimulated T cells. In Vivo Suppression of Inflammatory Cytokine Production by Nuclear Import Inhibitor—To track in vivo targeting of T cells by a peptide inhibitor of nuclear import, fluorescein-labeled peptides SN50, SM, and N50c were injected intraperitoneally into separate groups of BALB/c mice. T cells were isolated from the blood and the spleen 30 min after injection. T cells from mice injected with SN50 and SM stained positive for the presence of fluorescein-labeled peptides as compared with controls (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, injection with fluorescein-labeled N50c, which lacks an MTM, failed to produce any gain in fluorescence as compared with controls. The control mice received phosphate-buffered saline (not shown) or unconjugated FITC. These results establish the MTM dependence of a rapid in vivo delivery of nuclear import inhibitory peptides to T cells. We next explored the in vivo toxicity of SEB. Although mice display heightened resistance to SEB toxicity as compared with humans (31Peavy D.L. Adler W.H. Smith R.T. J. Immunol. 1970; 105: 1453-1458Google Scholar), BALB/c mice expressing both I-A and I-E major histocompatibility complex class II isotypes of the H-2d haplotype are 50 times more susceptible to SEB than the C57BL/6 strain (32Taub D.D. Newcomb J.R. Rogers T.J. Cell. Immunol. 1992; 141: 263-278Google Scholar). To sensitize BALB/c mice to the deleterious effects of SEB-induced cytokines such as TNFα, we used d-Gal. In this murine model, simultaneous administration of SEB and d-Gal via an ip route evokes acute liver injury followed by rapid death (17Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kundig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K.

Importantly, animals deficient for TNFα and IFNγ receptors are refractory to the lethal effects of SEB and d-Gal, a finding that further validates the physiologic relevance of this particular animal model (17Pfeffer K.

The M306I mutation abolished hydroxylation of deacetylcephalosporin C, whereas the W82A mutant reduced ring-expansion of penicillin G (an “unnatural” substrate). Truncation of the C terminus of DAOC/DACS to residue 310 (Δ310 mutant) enhanced ring-expansion of penicillin G by ∼2-fold. A double mutant, Δ310/M306I, selectively catalyzed the ring-expansion reaction and had similar kinetic parameters to the wild-type DAOC/DACS.

This work demonstrates that a single amino acid residue side chain within the DAOC/DACS active site can control whether the enzyme catalyzes ring-expansion, hydroxylation, or both reactions.

Labeling studies are consistent with radical intermediates in the ring-expansion reaction catalyzed by DAOCS and DAOC/DACS. In view of the high levels of sequence identity between DAOC/DACS, DAOCS, and DACS and the similarities in reaction mechanisms between the enzymes, the differences in substrate and reaction selectivity are perhaps surprising. This paper shows that single amino acid substitutions within the active site control whether DAOC/DACS is able to perform ring-expansion, hydroxylation, or both reactions.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Clones were screened for the insertion of the cefEF gene by agarose gel electrophoresis, and plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) for expression. Molecular Modeling of DAOC/DACS and DACS and Selection of Mutants—Models of the DAOC/DACS (Swiss-Prot accession number P11935) and DACS (Swiss-Prot accession number P42220) enzymes were produced and analyzed in program O (24Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar) based on the DAOCS structure solved with iron(II) and 2-oxoglutarate (Protein Data Bank code 1rxg) (9Valegård K.

Nature. 1998; 394: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Models indicated that DAOC/DACS has an additional amino acid (Asp-149) inserted into a loop region compared with DAOCS. In addition, DAOC/DACS also possesses an extended C terminus of 21 amino acids compared with DAOCS and the secondary structure of this region was predicted using PROF predictions (25Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). Residue numbering refers to the C. acremonium DAOC/DACS sequence (Swiss-Prot accession number P11935) unless otherwise specified. Site-directed Mutagenesis—For single amino acid substitutions, two complimentary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were synthesized (Table I). Truncation mutants were produced by PCR using the N-terminal primer and an appropriate C-terminal primer (Table II) followed by subcloning into the pET24a(+) expression vector. Reaction buffer (2 μl, 10×), dsDNA template (50 ng) (the cefEF gene cloned into the pGEM-T vector), forward primer (125 ng), reverse primer (125 ng), dNTP mixture (0.5 μl, 100 mm), MgSO4 (1 μl, 25 mm), Me2SO (1 μl, 100%), and H2O to a final volume of 20 μl were mixed in a 500-μl Eppendorf tube. PfuTurbo polymerase (0.5 μl, 1.25 units) was added, and the reaction mixture was placed in a Biometra personal cycler. Reactions were heated at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 16 cycles of the following: 95 °C for 1 min (denaturation); 55 °C for 1 min (annealing); and 72 °C for 7 min (extension). The reaction was cooled on ice for 2 min, and DpnI (1 μl, 10 units) was added followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h to digest parental DNA. The resulting DNA (1 μl) was transformed into Epicurian coli XL1-Blue competent cells, and the presence of the desired mutation was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Mutant genes were subcloned into the pET24a(+) expression vector by digestion with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes followed by ligation of the appropriate insert. Plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) for expression.Table IPrimers used to construct point mutationsMutantPrimer sequenceW82SForward primer: 5′-GCCCTCGAGTCGGAGAGCACCG-3′Reverse primer: 5′-CGGTGCTCTCCGACTCGAGGGC-3′W82SForward primer: 5′-GCCCTCGAGGCGGAGAGCACCG-3′Reverse primer: 5′-CGGTGCTCTCCGCCTCGAGGGC-3′N305LForward primer: 5′-GCGGGAACTATGTCCTCATGCGGAGGGATAAGCCG-3′Reverse primer: 5′-CCGCCGGCTTATCCCTCCGCATGAGGACATAGTTC-3′M306IForward primer: 5′-CTATGTCAACATACGGAGGG-3′Reverse primer: 5′-CCCTCCGTATGTTGACATAG-3′ Open table in a new tab Table IIPrimers used for the production of C-terminal mutantsMutantPrimer sequenceForward5′-CAT ATG ACT TCC AAG GTC CCC-3′Δ3105′-GGA TCC AAG CTT CTA CTT ATC CCT CCG C-3′Δ3125′-GGA TCC AAG CTT CTA CGC CGG CTT ATC CC-3′Δ3175′-GGA TCC AAG CTT CTA AGC CGC CTC CGC-3′Δ3205′-GGA TCC AAG CTT CTA CGC GGG GAC AGC-3′Δ3285′-GGA TCC AAG CTT CTA AGC TGC GGT AG-3′Δ310/M306I5′-GGA TCC AAG CTT CTA CTT ATC CCT CCG TAT GTT G-3′Δ310/M306I/N305L5′-GGA TCC AAG CTT CTA CTT ATC CCT CCG TAT GAG G-3′ Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of DAOC/DACS—A single colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) freshly transformed with the required plasmid [derived from pET24a(+)] was inoculated into 2TY media (5 ml) containing kanamycin sulfate (70 μg/ml) and grown at 30 °C and 250 rpm for 5 h before subculturing into the same media (100 ml) for overnight growth under the same conditions. Overnight culture (15 ml/flask) was used to inoculate 24 × 700 ml of the same media and grown as before to A600 = 0.8 (∼3 h). Expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and growth continued for 3 h before harvesting by centrifugation (8000 rpm, 5 min at 4 °C). Of the truncation mutants, only the Δ310 and Δ328 truncation mutants were produced in a soluble form. The remaining C-terminal truncation mutants were insoluble (presumably because of disruption of secondary structures) and were not analyzed further. Protein purification was carried out at 4 °C, and protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). The presence of DAOC/DACS in samples was determined using 12.5% SDS-PAGE analyses. Cell pellets (∼25 g) were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm DTT, and 10% (w/v) glycerol (150 ml) and treated with 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min and sonicated on ice using a W-380 sonicator (Ultrasonics Inc.) with 8 × 10-s pulses on power 5. DNase 1 (100 μg) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 20 min followed by centrifugation (30 min, 20,000 rpm). Polyethyleneimine was added to 0.05% (w/v), and after 20 min, the extract was centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 25 min and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The crude extract was loaded onto a DEAE-Fast Flow column (XK26 column, 2.6 × 15 cm, 80 ml) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 2 mm DTT at 10 ml/min. The sample (170 ml, 8 mg/ml protein) was loaded, and the column was washed with 200 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a 60-300 mm NaCl gradient over 400 ml, collecting 20-ml fractions. Fractions 3-7 were pooled (70 ml, 3 mg/ml protein) and diluted with one volume of equilibration buffer, divided into three batches, and further purified using a 6-ml RESOURCE-Q column using a 0-300 mm NaCl gradient over 30 ml with 2-ml fractions. Fractions 5-7 were pooled and concentrated to 7 ml before loading onto a Superdex-75 column (716 ml) equilibrated in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT at 2 ml/min. Fractions (10 ml) were collected between 200 and 500 ml, and fractions containing DAOC/DACS (17Baldwin J.E. Adlington R.M. Crouch N.P. Turner N.J. Schofield C.J. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

Circular dichroism analyses suggested that no gross changes in secondary or tertiary structure had occurred upon introduction of the mutations. Activity Assays—Ring-expansion activity was assayed in the presence of 2 mm DTT, 2 mm ascorbate, 2 mm iron(II) sulfate, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 2 mm 2-oxoglutarate, and 10 mm penicillin G as substrate in a final volume of 100 μl (7Lloyd M.D. Lee H.-J.

Samples were prepared for high pressure liquid chromatography analysis as before, and supernatant (100 μl) was loaded onto a C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) equilibrated in 25 mm NH4HCO3 run at 1 ml/min, monitoring at 220 nm. The DAOC substrate and hydroxylated DAC product had retention times of 13 and 7.5 min, respectively (1Baldwin J.E. Adlington R.M. Coates J.B. Crabbe M.J.C. Crouch N.P. Keeping J.W. Knight G.C.

Substrate Selectivity of Wild-type DAOC/DACS—The pKC200 plasmid allowed expression of DAOC/DACS at ∼30% of total soluble protein using a kanamycin selection system, and an efficient purification method was developed. The enzyme was assayed with a series of different penicillins and deacetoxycephems for both prime substrate oxidation (ring-expansion or hydroxylation, respectively) and 2-oxoglutarate conversion (Table III). As expected (29Baldwin J.E. Adlington R.M. Crabbe M.J. Knight G.C. Nomoto T. Schofield C.J. Ting H.-H. Tetrahedron. 1987; 43: 3009-3014Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 30Baldwin J.E.

NMR analyses of incubations with cephem substrates showed conversion of DAOC (the ring-expansion product from penicillin N, the natural penam substrate) and G-7-ADCA (the ring-expanded product of penicillin G) to their corresponding hydroxylated products. There was no evidence for hydroxylation of 7-ADCA (the deacetoxycephem nucleus without a side-chain) or cephalexin (the ring-expanded product of ampicillin), but a small level of conversion (< ∼5%) would not be detected by this assay. Assays for 2-oxoglutarate conversion suggested that some “uncoupled turnover” of the co-substrate had occurred in the presence of the latter two cephem substrates.Table IIIConversion of penam and deacetoxycephem substrates by DAOC/DACSPenam substrate (ring-expansion reaction)2-Oxoglutarate conversionSubstrate conversionnmol CO2 / min / mg proteinnmol product / min / mg protein1 None14.6 ± 0.320.12 6-APA22.5 ± 2.732.03 Acetyl-6-APA20.3 ± 3.049.04 Adipoyl-6-APA41.4 ± 3.099.75 Amoxycillin17.6 ± 1.337.36 Ampicillin8.6 ± 0.845.47 6-α-Methylpenicillin N24.9 ± 1.8155.98 Penicillin G17.9 ± 1.5101.99 Penicillin V13.6 ± 0.433.9Deacetoxycephem substrate (hydroxylation reaction)2-Oxoglutarate conversionSubstrate conversion (NMR assay)nmol CO2 / min / mg protein10 DAOC29.82 ± 0.7Yes11 7-ADCA25.11 ± 5.5<5%12 G-7-ADCA38.10 ± 9.4Yes13 Cephalexin19.98 ± 1.3<5% Open table in a new"

We recently identified Rapostlin as a novel effector of Rnd2. Rapostlin induces neurite branching in response to Rnd2 in PC12 cells. During the cloning of Rapostlin, we have found two mainly expressed splicing variants of Rapostlin (renamed as RapostlinL), RapostlinM and RapostlinS, lacking 29 residues and 61 residues within the unique insert region at the center, respectively, and three minor variants, RapostlinLd, RapostlinMd, and RapostlinSd, each with the identical five-amino acid deletion from RapostlinL, RapostlinM, and RapostlinS, respectively. RapostlinL is predominantly expressed in brain, whereas RapostlinS is expressed ubiquitously. In a dot-blot assay, all splicing variants bind to Rnd2 in a GTP-dependent manner. However, RapostlinM and RapostlinS induce less neurite branching when coexpressed with Rnd2 in PC12 cells, indicating that the insert region is important for the branching activity of RapostlinL. All splicing variants bind to N-WASP in vitro and in vivo through the SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus, and the SH3 domain is essential for branching activity of RapostlinL. In immunoprecipitation experiments, Rnd2 reduces RapostlinL-N-WASP interaction, whereas it has little effect on the interaction of RapostlinM or RapostlinS with N-WASP. Therefore, we found that functionally different splicing variants of Rapostlin have different responses to Rnd2 in association with N-WASP. Rho family GTPases regulate neuronal morphology.

Formation of this network includes many steps: neuronal migration to proper regions, neurite outgrowth, formation of polarity, guidance of axons and dendrites to proper targets, dendritic maturation, and synapse formation with appropriate partners. Rho family GTPases are involved in the regulation of all these steps by regulating cytoskeleton (1Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Google Scholar, 2Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases are implicated in morphological changes of various cells by reorganizing cytoskeleton (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar). Among these GTPases, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 have been extensively investigated, and they are known to induce stress fibers, lamellipodia, and filopodia in fibroblasts, respectively. In neurons, Rac and Cdc42 stimulate extension of lamellipodia and filopodia at advancing growth cones, respectively (4Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Google Scholar), whereas Rho triggers growth cone collapse and neurite retraction (5Jalink K. Van Corven E.J. Hengeveld T. Morii N. Narumiya S. Moolenaar W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 801-810Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases serve as molecular switches by cycling between GDP-bound inactive state and GTP-bound active state, and once activated, they transduce signals to a variety of specific downstream effectors, leading to morphological changes (6Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar). For example, a well studied Rho effector, Rho-kinase is involved in stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly in fibroblasts by regulating myosin phosphorylation; it is also involved in Rho-induced neurite retraction in neurons (7Hirose M. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Google Scholar, 8Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M.

Rac and Cdc42 also regulate actin cytoskeleton by their effectors such as p21-activated kinase (1Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Google Scholar, 2Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Google Scholar). p21-Activated kinase is involved in the induction of both filopodia and membrane ruffles in fibroblasts and neurite outgrowth in neurons by inducing dynamic reorganization of actin cytoskeleton (1Negishi M.

In addition to Cdc42, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and several SH3 domain-containing proteins, such as Grb2/Ash, Nck, and the WASP-interacting SH3 protein (WISH) activate N-WASP. N-WASP is also activated by phosphorylation from Src-family kinases. In addition to these three well characterized Rho family GTPases, other members, including RhoG (12Katoh H. Yasui H. Yamaguchi Y.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1106-1115Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about Rnd2, although the predominant neuronal expression of Rnd2 suggests its important role in neural function (19Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Google Scholar). We recently identified Rapostlin as a novel effector of Rnd2 (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). Rapostlin has a similar domain structure to a Cdc42 effector, Cdc42-interacting protein-4 (CIP4; Ref. 24Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Google Scholar), with a Fer-CIP4 homology (FCH) domain at the amino terminus and an SH3 domain at the carboxyl terminus. However, Rapostlin has a unique insert region, which is absent in CIP4. Rapostlin binds directly to microtubules through its amino-terminal region, including FCH domain. Rapostlin induces neurite branching in response to Rnd2 in PC12 cells, and the amino-terminal region of Rapostlin is necessary for this branching activity, suggesting that Rapostlin induces neurite branching through interaction with microtubules (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). While the isolation of Rapostlin was in process, we cloned the splicing variants of Rapostlin (renamed as RapostlinL): RapostlinM, RapostlinS, RapostlinLd, RapostlinMd, and RapostlinSd, which differ only in the size of the insert region. We report here that all splicing variants bind to active Rnd2, but that RapostlinM and RapostlinS induce less neurite branching in the presence of Rnd2 in PC12 cells, indicating that the insert region is important for the branching activity. We also report that all variants bind to N-WASP through the SH3 domain, which is essential for branching activity, and that Rnd2 releases N-WASP from RapostlinL, but releases less from RapostlinM and RapostlinS. Plasmid Constructions—For expression in mammalian cells, cDNAs encoding the full-length RapostlinL (amino acids 2-620), RapostlinM (amino acids 2-591), RapostlinS (amino acids 2-559), and RapostlinL ΔSH3 (amino acids 2-552) were subcloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), encoding an initiating Met followed by the Myc epitope tag sequence at the amino terminus. cDNA encoding Rnd2V16 was subcloned into pcDNA3, encoding an initiating Met followed by the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag sequence at the amino terminus, for expression in PC12 cells, while it was subcloned into pEF-BOS for expression in 293T cells. cDNA-encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was subcloned into pcDNA3. N-WASP cDNA was a generous gift from Dr. T. Takenawa (University of Tokyo); it was subcloned into pCMV-HA (Clontech). For purification of recombinant proteins, cDNA of Rnd2 was subcloned into pAcG2T (PharMingen), whereas cDNAs of Rnd1, Rnd3, RapostlinL ΔN (amino acids 329-620), RapostlinLd ΔN (amino acids 329-615), RapostlinM ΔN (amino acids 329-591), RapostlinS ΔN (amino acids 329-559), RapostlinL (amino acids 2-620), RapostlinLd (amino acids 2-615), RapostlinM (amino acids 2-591), RapostlinS (amino acids 2-559), Rapostlin SH3 domain (amino acids 553-620 of RapostlinL), and Plexin-B1 (amino acids 1724-1915) were subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences). Cloning and RT-PCR of Rapostlin-splicing Variants—To initially clone Rapostlin-splicing variants, two primers, 5′-gaaataccaacccaaaaagaactcg-3′ and 5′-aatagacttcgacgtaggaagtggggac-3′, were used in RT-PCR with rat brain RNA as a template. The PCR products obtained were cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced completely. For determination of the complete coding sequences, two pairs of primers, one pair of 5′-gggctttccgcattctcagg-3′ and 5′-tctctgctcaggcgggaagttgc-3′ for the 5′-terminal region, and another pair of 5′-agtgaaggcggccgagtctattga-3′ and 5′-aagacgcccccagttcccgagtgtc-3′ for the 3′-terminal region were used in RT-PCR. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced as above. To investigate the expression pattern of the splicing variants, two primers, 5′-agtgaaggcggccgagtctattga-3′ and 5′-tctctgctcaggcgggaagttgc-3′, were used in RT-PCR from various adult rat tissues. Cell Culture and Transfection—293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml of streptomycin under humidified air containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with test plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) for PC12 cells, or LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) for 293T cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. PC12 cells were differentiated with 50 ng/ml of nerve growth factor (NGF) (Promega) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after the transfection. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PC12 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips (circular, 13 mm in diameter). Forty-eight hours after the transfection, cells on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After residual formaldehyde had been quenched with 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS for 10 min, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and incubated with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-HA pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS for 1 h for detection of HA-tagged Rnd2V16, or incubated with rabbit anti-Myc pAb for detection of Myc-tagged Rapostlin-splicing variant or RapostlinL ΔSH3; this was followed by incubation with an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 1 h. Microtubules were stained with mouse anti-α-tubulin mAb (Sigma) in PBS for 1 h, followed by incubation with an Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) in PBS for 1 h. Cells on coverslips were mounted in 90% glycerol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride in PBS. The cells were photographed with a Leica DC350F digital camera system equipped with a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope and analyzed with Image-Pro Plus image analysis software (Media Cybernetics). Branching Activity—Branching activity was determined as described previously (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar, 25Szebenyi G. Callaway J.L. Dent E.W. Kalil K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7930-7940Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells bearing at least one neurite longer than 5 μm were analyzed. Only processes longer than 5 μm from the neurites were considered as branches. The branching activity was defined as the ratio of the total number of branches to the total length of neurites from 20 cells and expressed as branch points/mm, that is, the average number of branches per region. We adopted this criterion because neurites had generally more branches as neurites were longer. Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-10% PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was blocked with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO) and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Binding Assays—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused Rnd2 protein was prepared from Sf9 cells, whereas GST and GST-fused Rnd1, Rnd3, Plexin-B1, carboxyl-terminal regions of Rapostlin-splicing variants (RapostlinL ΔN, RapostlinLd ΔN, RapostlinM ΔN, and RapostlinS ΔN), full-length splicing variants (RapostlinL, RapostlinLd, RapostlinM, and RapostlinS), and SH3 domain were prepared from Escherichia coli, as described previously (8Katoh H. Aoki J. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2489-2492Google Scholar, 23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar, 26Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Google Scholar). For a dot-blot assay, recombinant GST-fused Rnd protein was loaded with 1 mm GDP or guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 55.5 mm (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). A dot-blot assay was performed as described previously (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar, 27Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Google Scholar). GST (5 μg), GST-fused carboxyl-terminal region of Rapostlin-splicing variants (RapostlinL ΔN, RapostlinLd ΔN, RapostlinM ΔN, or RapostlinS ΔN) (5 μg), or GST-fused Plexin-B1 (5 μg) was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and allowed to dry for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was blocked in buffer A containing 5% low fat milk for 1 h at 4 °C. The membrane was then incubated for 1.5 h at 4 °C in buffer A containing 24 μg of GST-fused Rnd protein preloaded with GDP or GTPγS. The membrane was washed with buffer A and then incubated with 3% low fat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing rabbit anti-Rnd2 pAb (prepared as described previously; Ref. 23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Rnd1 pAb (prepared as described previously; Ref. 16Ishikawa Y. Katoh H. Negishi M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11065-11072Google Scholar), or goat anti-Rnd3 pAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). This antibody was detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO) and an ECL detection kit. For a pull-down assay, 293T cells (1 × 106 cells) transfected with HA-tagged N-WASP were rinsed with PBS and lysed with the ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with 2 μg of GST, GST-fused full-length splicing variant (RapostlinL, RapostlinLd, RapostlinM, or RapostlinS), or GST-fused SH3 domain for 1 h at 4 °C and then with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with rat anti-HA mAb (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitation—293T cells (1 × 106 cells) cotransfected with HA-tagged N-WASP, Rnd2V16, and Myc-tagged Rapostlin-splicing variant (RapostlinL, RapostlinM, or RapostlinS) or RapostlinL ΔSH3 were rinsed with PBS and lysed with the ice-cold lysis buffer. Cell lysates were then centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were diluted 1:4 with lysis buffer without Triton X-100 and incubated with mouse anti-Myc mAb (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. They were subsequently incubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After the beads were washed with the ice-cold cell lysis buffer with 0.2% Triton X-100, the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with rat anti-HA mAb, mouse anti-Myc mAb, or rabbit anti-Rnd2 pAb. Cloning of Rapostlin-splicing Variants—When we performed RT-PCR from rat brain to clone Rapostlin, the electrophoresis of the PCR product showed three bands (data not shown). Cloning and sequence analysis of these bands showed that they were Rapostlin and two splicing variants of Rapostlin with shorter length. We renamed Rapostlin as RapostlinL, and named these two variants RapostlinM and RapostlinS. RapostlinM and RapostlinS lack 29 residues (amino acids 329-357) and 61 residues (amino acids 329-389), respectively, within the insert region (Fig. 1A). RapostlinM has a reported human homolog with GenBank™ accession number AK023681. Further analysis revealed three other variants, RapostlinLd, RapostlinMd, and RapostlinSd, with the identical five-amino acid deletion (amino acids 390-394) from RapostlinL, RapostlinM, and RapostlinS, respectively (Fig. 1A). RapostlinL has a human homolog, formin-binding protein 17 (FBP17; Ref. 28Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Google Scholar), whose gene structure has been identified. A Gene Resource Locator 2The Gene Resource Locator (GRL) database can be found on the Internet at grl.gi.ku-tokyo.ac.jp. search of the FBP17 gene structure showed that exon 10 consists of 61 residues (amino acids 329-389 of RapostlinL), whereas exon 11 consists of the subsequent five residues (amino acids 390-394 of RapostlinL). This finding means that RapostlinS lacks exon 10, whereas RapostlinLd lacks exon 11. This gene structure supports the result of cloning by RT-PCR. From the results of cloning, RapostlinL, RapostlinM and RapostlinS were found to be mainly expressed variants, whereas RapostlinLd, RapostlinMd, and RapostlinSd were minor ones. Because it was impossible to distinguish RapostlinL, RapostlinM, and RapostlinS from each other by Northern blot analysis, we performed RT-PCR from adult rat tissues, though a 15-nucleotide difference between RapostlinL and RapostlinLd, RapostlinM and RapostlinMd, or RapostlinS and RapostlinSd could not be detected (Fig. 1B). RapostlinL (including RapostlinLd) was predominantly expressed in brain, whereas RapostlinS (including RapostlinSd) was expressed ubiquitously. RapostlinM (including RapostlinMd) was expressed in brain and testis, but the expression level was low. We also investigated the expression of Rapostlin-splicing variants in rat brain at different ages (embryonic day 18 (E18), postnatal day 2 (P2), postnatal day 12 (P12) and adult), and all variants were detected throughout the development (data not shown). All Splicing Variants Bind to Rnd2 in a GTP-dependent Manner—We reported previously that RapostlinL specifically binds to GTPγS-loaded GST-Rnd2 but not to GDP-loaded GST-Rnd2 through its carboxyl-terminal region in dot-blot assays (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). To examine the interaction of Rapostlin-splicing variants with Rnd2, we carried out a dot-blot assay (Fig. 2). GST-fused splicing variant lacking the amino-terminal region was spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the membrane was overlaid with GDP- or GTPγS-preloaded GST-Rnd2. All splicing variants bound to GTPγS-loaded GST-Rnd2 but not to GDP-loaded GST-Rnd2. Considering that SH3 domain does not associate with Rnd2 (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar), these results suggest that the Rnd2 binding site is located between the insert region and SH3 domain. We also examined the interaction of Rapostlin-splicing variants with GST-Rnd1 and GST-Rnd3 preloaded with GTPγS. All splicing variants did not bind to GTPγS-loaded GST-Rnd1 or GST-Rnd3, although Plexin-B1 bound to both of them as reported previously (Fig. 2; Ref. 15Oinuma I. Katoh H. Harada A. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25671-25677Google Scholar). These results indicate that all splicing variants specifically bind to Rnd2 among Rnd subfamily GTPases in a GTP-dependent manner. Only RapostlinL Induces Neurite Branching in Response to Rnd2 in PC12 Cells—We showed previously that RapostlinL induces neurite branching in response to a constitutively active Rnd2,Rnd2V16 (equivalent to a constitutively active V12 mutation in Ras) but not to a negative Rnd2,Rnd2N21 (equivalent to a dominant-negative N17 mutation in Ras) in PC12 cells (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the branching activity of Rapostlin-splicing variants with or without coexpressed Rnd2V16 (Figs. 3 and 4). We transiently expressed Myc-tagged Rapostlin-splicing variant and/or HA-tagged Rnd2V16 in the NGF-differentiated PC12 cells and analyzed the morphological changes of the cells. GFP-expressing control cells and Rnd2V16-expressing cells extended a few unbranched neurites bearing microtubules, as we reported previously (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). Without coexpressed Rnd2V16, all of the splicing variants examined, namely, RapostlinL, RapostlinM, and RapostlinS, induced few branches from neurites. On the other hand, RapostlinL induced neurite branching when coexpressed with Rnd2V16 as in our previous report (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). However, RapostlinM and RapostlinS induced less branching when coexpressed with Rnd2V16. These results indicate that the deletion in the insert region makes a functional difference in inducing neurite branching.Fig. 4Quantification of neurite branching activity in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding the indicated proteins and differentiated with NGF for 44 h. Branching activities (branch points/mm neurite) of the cells were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown are means ± S.E. for triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rapostlin Binds to N-WASP via the SH3 Domain—The SH3 domain of CIP4, a Cdc42 effector with a similar domain structure to Rapostlin, associates with WASP (29Tian L. Nelson D.L. Stewart D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7854-7861Google Scholar). WASP is a Cdc42 effector regulating actin cytoskeleton, and CIP4 mediates the association of WASP with microtubules. This interaction of CIP4 with WASP is implicated in the microtubule-dependent formation of podosomes, unique actin-rich adhesion structures of monocyte-derived cells (30Linder S. Hüfner K. Wintergerst U. Aepfelbacher M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4165-4176Google Scholar). Because WASP is expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells, we speculated that Rapostlin interacts with N-WASP, a WASP-related protein expressed predominantly in brain-like RapostlinL and Rnd2. Therefore, we carried out a pull-down assay (Fig. 5A). HA-tagged N-WASP was expressed in 293T cells, and the cell lysates were incubated with GST, GST-fused full-length splicing variant, or GST-fused SH3 domain. All splicing variants and SH3 domain bound to N-WASP in vitro. These results indicate that Rapostlin interacts with N-WASP through its SH3 domain, and all splicing variants bind to N-WASP, because they all have the SH3 domain. We next performed an immunoprecipitation experiment to verify that Rapostlin interacts with N-WASP through its SH3 domain in vivo (Fig. 5B). Myc-tagged RapostlinL or RapostlinL mutant lacking SH3 domain (RapostlinL ΔSH3) and HA-tagged N-WASP were expressed in 293T cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc mAb. HA-tagged N-WASP was coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged RapostlinL, but we could not detect the interaction between N-WASP and RapostlinL ΔSH3 regardless of Rnd2V16. These results confirm that Rapostlin interacts with N-WASP via its SH3 domain. Interestingly, Rnd2V16 released N-WASP from RapostlinL. Furthermore, to analyze the function of this SH3 domain of Rapostlin, we transiently expressed RapostlinL ΔSH3 with Rnd2V16 in PC12 cells (Fig. 6). These cells failed to induce neurite branching, suggesting that the SH3 domain is essential for the RapostlinL-mediated neurite branching. Rnd2 Releases N-WASP from RapostlinL, but Releases Less from RapostlinM and RapostlinS—To investigate the difference in the in vivo association with N-WASP between Rapostlin-splicing variants, we performed an immunoprecipitation study (Fig. 7). 293T cells were transfected with HA-tagged N-WASP, Rnd2V16, and Myc-tagged Rapostlin-splicing variant, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc mAb. HA-tagged N-WASP was coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged RapostlinL in the absence of Rnd2V16, but this interaction was significantly reduced by coexpression of Rnd2V16. On the other hand, the interaction between N-WASP and RapostlinM or RapostlinS was less affected by coexpression of Rnd2V16. These results indicate that the insert region is important for Rnd2 to reduce the association of RapostlinL with N-WASP. Rho family GTPases are central regulators of neuronal morphology, including neurite formation, elongation, retraction, and branching (1Negishi M. Katoh H. J. Biochem. 2002; 132: 157-166Google Scholar, 2Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Google Scholar). They regulate such a wide variety of morphological changes by transducing signals to cytoskeleton, especially actin cytoskeleton (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar). Rnd2 belongs to the Rnd subfamily, a new member of the Rho family GTPases. It is specifically expressed in neurons in brain, which suggests its important role in neuronal function (19Nishi M. Takeshima H. Houtani T. Nakagawara K. Noda T. Sugimoto T. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 74-81Google Scholar). Nevertheless, little is known about Rnd2. We showed previously that a novel Rnd2 effector, RapostlinL, induces neurite branching in response to Rnd2 in PC12 cells (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). We also showed that the amino-terminal region of RapostlinL, which is essential for the binding of RapostlinL to microtubules, is necessary for the neurite branching induced by RapostlinL in concert with Rnd2. These results suggest that the interaction of RapostlinL with microtubules is crucial for the neurite branching induced by Rnd2 and RapostlinL. Here, we have reported that RapostlinL, through the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain, binds to N-WASP. N-WASP is known to stimulate actin polymerization-inducing filopodia and neurite extension (10Miki H. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Takenawa T. Nature. 1998; 391: 93-96Google Scholar, 11Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biochem. 2003; 134: 309-313Google Scholar). A RapostlinL mutant lacking the SH3 domain (RapostlinL ΔSH3) fails to induce neurite branching. In addition, we showed previously that RapostlinL induces reorganization of actin filaments in response to Rnd2 in HeLa cells (23Fujita H. Katoh H. Ishikawa Y. Mori K. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45428-45434Google Scholar). These results suggest that RapostlinL may regulate actin reorganization through N-WASP. Well studied effectors of Rho family GTPases usually regulate either actin cytoskeleton or microtubules. Thus, RapostlinL is a novel effector, linking actin cytoskeleton and microtubules. Neurite branching requires coordinate reorganization of not only actin cytoskeleton, but also microtubules (31Kalil K. Szebenyi G. Dent E.W. J. Neurobiol. 2000; 44: 145-158Google Scholar). In the beginning of branch formation, actin filament-rich filopodia and lamellipodia are extended from the neurites. Bundled microtubules splay apart, with coincident accumulation of actin filaments, and microtubules invade lamellipodia. Then, branches emerge with new growth cones at their tips. We suggest that RapostlinL may function as a linker between actin cytoskeleton and microtubules, eventually causing the induction of neurite branching. In this study, we have cloned Rapostlin-splicing variants and investigated their functional difference. We cloned two major variants, RapostlinM and RapostlinS. RapostlinM lacks 29 residues, the amino-terminal half of exon 10 of human homolog FBP17 within the insert region, whereas RapostlinS lacks 61 residues, the entire exon 10 of the human homolog. We also cloned three minor variants, RapostlinLd, RapostlinMd, and RapostlinSd, with the identical five-amino acid deletion, exon 11 of human homolog, from RapostlinL, RapostlinM, and RapostlinS, respectively. From the results of immunohistochemistry of human tissues (32Fuchs U. Rehkamp G. Haas O.A. Slany R. König M. Bojesen S. Bohle R.M. Damm-Welk C. Ludwig W.D. Harbott J. Borkhardt A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8756-8761Google Scholar), FBP17 has been reported to be expressed ubiquitously. However, Fuchs et al. (32Fuchs U. Rehkamp G. Haas O.A. Slany R. König M. Bojesen S. Bohle R.M. Damm-Welk C. Ludwig W.D. Harbott J. Borkhardt A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8756-8761Google Scholar) used polyclonal antibody raised against the coiled-coil region, which is present in all splicing variants. Therefore, they have confused human RapostlinL, FBP17, with other splicing variants. Based upon our RT-PCR results, Fuchs et al. seem to have detected RapostlinS in various tissues. Here, we have shown, by RT-PCR, that RapostlinL is predominantly expressed in brain just like Rnd2, but that RapostlinS is expressed ubiquitously. Considering relatively weak expression of RapostlinM, it is speculated that RapostlinL mainly mediates downstream signals of Rnd2 as an effector in the brain. Indeed, RapostlinM and RapostlinS induce little neurite branching in response to Rnd2. However, all splicing variants specifically bind to Rnd2 among Rnd subfamily GTPases in a GTP-dependent manner. They also bind to N-WASP. Consistent with this functional difference, Rnd2 reduces RapostlinL-N-WASP interaction, whereas it has little effect upon the interaction of RapostlinM or RapostlinS with N-WASP. Therefore, to induce neurite branching, it seems essential to release N-WASP when Rnd2 binds to RapostlinL. In light of the result that the ability of RapostlinL to interact with N-WASP via SH3 domain is also essential for the induction of neurite branching, it may be reasonable to speculate that N-WASP is recruited by RapostlinL from cytosol to RapostlinL-bound microtubules and that Rnd2 releases N-WASP, regulating actin cytoskeleton. At present, how Rnd2 is activated or recruited is unknown (33Tanaka H. Fujita H. Katoh H. Mori K. Negishi M. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 349-353Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the upstream regulation mechanism of Rnd2 will be required to further dissect how Rnd2 and RapostlinL regulate actin cytoskeleton via N-WASP. In conclusion, we have shown that RapostlinL interacts with N-WASP through the SH3 domain and that the SH3 domain is essential for neurite branching. We cloned Rapostlin-splicing variants, which induce less neurite branching and have different association mechanisms with N-WASP in response to Rnd2. However, many questions remain unsolved concerning Rnd2 signaling and Rnd2-RapostlinL-induced neurite branching. Further studies focusing on upstream regulators and downstream effectors will help to elucidate Rnd2 signaling pathways and the regulation of neuronal morphology. We thank Dr. T.

https://openalex.org/W2027907293,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a malignant disease characterized by an accumulation of monoclonal CD5+ mature B cells, with a high percentage of cells arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, and a particular resistance toward apoptosis-inducing agents. Dok1 (downstream of tyrosine kinases) is an abundant Ras-GTPase-activating protein (Ras-GAP)-associated tyrosine kinase substrate, which negatively regulates cell proliferation, downregulates MAP kinase activation and promotes cell migration. The gene encoding Dok1 maps to human chromosome 2p13, a region previously found to be rearranged in B-CLL. We have screened the Dok1 gene for mutations from 46 individuals with B-CLL using heteroduplex analysis. A four-nucleotide GGCC deletion in the coding region was found in the leukemia cells from one patient. This mutation causes a frameshift leading to protein truncation at the carboxyl-terminus, with the acquisition of a novel amino-acid sequence. In contrast to the wild-type Dok1 protein, which has cytoplasmic/membrane localization, the mutant Dok1 is a nuclear protein containing a functional bipartite nuclear localization signal. Whereas overexpression of wild-type Dok1 inhibited PDGF-induced MAP kinase activation, this inhibition was not observed with the mutant Dok1. Furthermore the mutant Dok1 forms heterodimers with Dok1 wild type and the association can be enhanced by Lck-mediated tyrosine-phosphorylation. This is the first example of a Dok1 mutation in B-CLL and the data suggest that Dok1 might play a role in leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2063442955,"In the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication system, T4 gene 59 protein binds preferentially to fork DNA and accelerates the loading of the T4 41 helicase. 59 protein also binds the T4 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein that coats the lagging strand template. Here we explore the function of the strong affinity between the 32 and 59 proteins at the replication fork. We show that, in contrast to the 59 helicase loader, 32 protein does not bind forked DNA more tightly than linear DNA. 32 protein displays a strong binding polarity on fork DNA, binding with much higher affinity to the 5′ single-stranded lagging strand template arm of a model fork, than to the 3′ single-stranded leading strand arm. 59 protein promotes the binding of 32 protein on forks too short for cooperative binding by 32 protein. We show that 32 protein is required for helicase-dependent leading strand DNA synthesis when the helicase is loaded by 59 protein. However, 32 protein is not required for leading strand synthesis when helicase is loaded, less efficiently, without 59 protein. Leading strand synthesis by wild type T4 polymerase is strongly inhibited when 59 protein is present without 32 protein. Because 59 protein can load the helicase on forks without 32 protein, our results are best explained by a model in which 59 helicase loader at the fork prevents the coupling of the leading strand polymerase and the helicase, unless the position of 59 protein is shifted by its association with 32 protein. In the bacteriophage T4 DNA replication system, T4 gene 59 protein binds preferentially to fork DNA and accelerates the loading of the T4 41 helicase. 59 protein also binds the T4 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein that coats the lagging strand template.

The bacteriophage T4 gene 59 helicase loading protein and gene 32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein are each part of the relatively simple multienzyme system used to replicate T4 DNA (reviewed in Refs. 1Nossal N.G. Karem J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar and 2Benkovic S.J. Valentine A.M. Salinas F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In this system T4 DNA polymerase, which synthesizes both the leading and lagging strands, is held on the template by the circular T4 gene 45 clamp, which is loaded by the T4 gene 44/62 clamp loader. The hexameric gene 41 helicase moves on the lagging strand template, opening the duplex ahead of the leading strand polymerase and interacting with the gene 61 primase to enable it to make the pentamer RNA primers used to initiate lagging strand synthesis. Although 41 helicase can load on forked DNA templates by itself, its loading is much more rapid when the gene 59 helicase loading protein is present (3Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the lagging strand of the fork, 32 protein coats the single-stranded template strand and increases the rate of primer synthesis. 32 protein also increases the processivity of both the lagging strand polymerase and the T4 encoded 5′ to 3′ nuclease (RNase H) that removes the RNA primers and some adjacent DNA, before adjoining fragments are joined by DNA ligase (4Bhagwat M. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28516-28524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage T4 replication begins at one of several replication origins. The products of this early origin-dependent replication invade each other to create forks for recombination-dependent replication, which is the predominant replication mode for this phage (reviewed in Refs. 5Kreuzer K.N. Morrical S.W. Karem J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 28-42Google Scholar and 6Mosig G. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 379-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Recombination-dependent replication requires the T4 replication proteins, as well as the phage uvsX and uvsY recombination proteins. In vitro, the 41 helicase has been shown to catalyze polar branch migration after 59 protein loads the helicase on joint molecules formed by the T4 uvsX recombinase and 32 protein (7Salinas F. Kodadek T. Cell. 1995; 82: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The helicase, 59 loader, and 32 protein are all needed for branch migration on deproteinized joint molecules (8Kong D. Nossal N.G. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8380-8387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Mutants in T4 gene 59 are UV-sensitive and defective in recombination-dependent replication but capable of some early replication (9Shah D.B. J. Virol. 1976; 17: 175-182Crossref Google Scholar, 10Wu R. Wu J.L. Yeh Y.C. J. Virol. 1975; 16: 5-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the 59 helicase loader strongly stimulates synthesis from an R-loop within the T4 uvsY origin in vitro (11Nossal N.G. Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the role of 59 protein in synthesis from T4 origins in vivo is still not clear. The 59 helicase loader is a small (26 kDa) basic protein that binds to both single- and double-stranded DNA but has a strong preference for binding forked DNA with either single- or double-stranded arms (12Mueser T.C. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 597-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 13Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 8312-8318Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Whereas 59 protein binds to forks with completely duplex arms, it loads the helicase only if there is a gap of at least 10 nucleotides on the lagging strand arm. 59 protein also binds and loads the helicase on model cruciforms and recombination structures, consistent with the role of 59 protein in recombination-initiated replication in vivo. The crystal structure of 59 protein is a two-domain, almost completely helical protein, with no similarity to the structures of other ssDNA 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; DTT, dithiothreitol; b, base. -binding proteins (12Mueser T.C. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 597-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A portion of the N-terminal domain shares strong structural similarity with several members of the high mobility group family proteins, which like 59 protein bind branched DNA structures. 59 helicase loader and 32 protein have a strong affinity for each other, even in the absence of DNA. Barry and Alberts (3Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) initially purified 59 protein on a column of immobilized 32 protein, and Yonesaki (15Yonesaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1284-1289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that immobilized 59 protein bound both 32 protein and the 41 helicase. Morrical and co-workers have shown (16Lefebvre S.D. Wong M.L. Morrical S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22830-22838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the 32 and 59 proteins can bind simultaneously to ssDNA and have extensively characterized this complex (16Lefebvre S.D.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7651-7661Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). 32 protein can be divided into three domains by limited proteolysis (reviewed in Ref. 19Williams K.R. Shamoo Y. Spicer E.K. Coleman J.E. Konigsberg W.H. Karem J. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 301-304Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the central core (residues 22–253) (20Shamoo Y. Friedman A.M. Parsons M.R. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which binds DNA noncooperatively, has a large open cleft containing many of the residues required for DNA binding. The short N-terminal “B-domain” (residues 1–21) must be present along with the core for tight, cooperative DNA binding (21Spicer E.K. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 6433-6436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The B-domain of one 32 molecule is thought to bind to the adjacent 32 protein when it is cooperatively bound to DNA. The acidic C-terminal “A-domain” (residues 254–302) has been implicated in binding to other T4 replication proteins, including the polymerase and primase (23Hurley J.M. Chervitz S.A. Jarvis T.C. Singer B.S. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Krassa K.B. Green L.S. Gold L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The A-domain also plays a role in preventing intact 32 protein from denaturing double-stranded DNA. 32 protein that lacks the A-domain binds ssDNA more tightly than the full-length protein and has an increased capacity to destabilize duplex DNA (22Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 26Hosoda J. Moise H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The immobilized C-terminal A-domain of 32 protein binds 59 protein (17Morrical S.W. Beernink H.T.H. Dash A. Hempstead K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20198-20207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and thus is at least partially responsible for the interaction between the 32 and 59 proteins. Protein-protein cross-linking has revealed additional contacts for 59 protein within the 32 protein central core (28Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25236-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The architecture of the T4 replication fork appears to depend on this strong interaction between the 59 and 32 proteins. Recent electron microscopic studies show that the 32 protein-covered ssDNA on the lagging strand template is organized in a compact structure. This structure is significantly less compact in reactions where the helicase is loaded without the loading protein (29Chastain P. Makhov A.M. Nossal N.G. Griffith J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21276-21285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Because 59 protein is still present on molecules with extensive replication, 2P. Chastain, E. Green, N. G. Nossal, and J. D. Griffith, unpublished experiments. it is likely that both the 59 and 32 proteins are present on the DNA within the compact structure. T4 41 helicase has a nucleotidase activity that is strongly stimulated by ssDNA, and inhibited when the DNA is covered with 32 protein. Addition of 59 protein increases the helicase-catalyzed hydrolysis of GTP or ATP on 32 protein-coated DNA. Thus, it has been proposed that a major function of 59 protein is to promote the loading of the helicase on 32 protein-coated DNA (3Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Morrical S.W. Hempstead K. Morrical M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33069-33081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This would be of obvious physiological importance because the 32 protein concentration in T4-infected cells is regulated to be high enough to coat the available single-stranded DNA (31von Hippel P.H. Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. Paul L.S. Stormo G.D. Gold L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 795-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, 59 protein also loads the helicase on DNA when 32 protein is not present (3Barry J. Alberts B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jones C.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2614-2619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In this paper, we explore the function of the strong affinity between the 32 and 59 proteins at the replication fork. We show that, in contrast to the 59 helicase loader, 32 protein does not bind forked DNA more tightly than linear ssDNA. We find that 32 protein binds with much higher affinity to single-stranded regions on the lagging strand of a model fork than to single-stranded regions of the leading strand. 59 protein promotes the binding of 32 protein on forks too short for cooperative binding by 32 protein. Finally, we show that 32 protein is required for helicase-dependent leading strand synthesis, if the helicase is loaded by 59 protein. 32 protein is not required for leading strand synthesis when helicase is loaded without 59 protein, and 59 protein can load the helicase on forks without 32 protein. Thus, the most likely explanation for the requirement for 32 protein when 59 protein is present is that 59 helicase loader at the fork prevents the coupling of the helicase and the leading strand polymerase, unless the position of 59 protein is shifted by its association with 32 protein. Proteins—T4 DNA polymerase (wild type and exonuclease-defective D219A (33Frey M.W. Nossal N.G. Capson T.L. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The polyclonal antibody against T4 59 protein was described by Jones et al. (13Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27145-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length T4 32 protein was made from the plasmid pYS6 (37Shamoo Y. Adari H. Konigsberg W.H. Williams K.R. Chase J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1982; 29: 939-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), which contains a temperature-sensitive cI857 λ repressor. The culture was grown overnight in 450 ml with 50 μg/ml carbenicillin (Invitrogen) at 28 °C and used to inoculate 20 liters of the same media in a large scale fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Bioflow 3000) at 28 °C. When the optical density (A600) reached 0.6, the fermentation temperature was raised to 42 °C for 30 min and then lowered to 37 °C for 2 h to induce protein expression. Cells (31.5 g) were collected by centrifugation (8,000 × g, 10 min) and frozen in large pellets (–80 °C). The frozen cell pellets were added to 300 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 mg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ICN), 1 mg of hen egg white lysozyme) at 21 °C with stirring for 20 min until thawed. The lysis mixture was placed on ice, sonicated (Branson Sonifier 250, 100% power, 50% duty cycle, 2 min, with stirring), and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 °C, 40 min). The supernatant was diluted 2-fold with 25 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.5, and loaded at 20 ml/min at 4 °C onto a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (50-ml bed volume XP26 column, Biopilot, Amersham Biosciences), which had been equilibrated with QS buffer A (25 mm BisTris-HCl, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). Protein was eluted using a linear salt gradient (30 min, 20 ml/min, 0–100% QS buffer B (QS buffer A with 0.5 m NaCl)) with the 32 protein eluting at about 300 mm NaCl. Dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) was added to the pooled 32 protein fraction to match the conductivity of HA buffer A (dilution buffer + 100 mm NaCl). The diluted sample was loaded onto ceramic hydroxylapatite (10 ml/min, 4 °C, 50-ml bed volume, Integrated Separation Systems) equilibrated with HA buffer A. Protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient (30 min, 10 ml/min, 4 °C, 0–100% HA buffer B (HA buffer A + 1 m (NH4)2SO4)) with 32 protein eluting at about 400 mm salt. Trace nuclease activity, which copurified with 32 protein, was eliminated using hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the pooled 32 HA fractions until the conductivity matched that of PE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 600 mm (NH4)2SO4). The sample was applied to a POROS 20 PE perfusion weak hydrophobic column (5-ml bed volume, 4 °C, equilibrated with PE buffer, Perspective Biosystems). The flow-through fraction (∼250 ml) contained 32 protein that was free of nuclease, as measured with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, supercoiled plasmid DNA, and single-stranded circular M13 DNA. The PE flow-through fraction was diluted (8×, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol) to match the conductivity of QS buffer A. The diluted sample was loaded onto a POROS 20 HQ perfusion strong anion exchange column (20 ml/min, 4 °C, 30-ml bed volume, Perspective Biosystems) equilibrated with QS buffer A and eluted with a step to QS buffer B. The purified 32 protein (28 ml, 220 mg) was dialyzed against QS buffer A (overnight, 4 °C) and frozen in aliquots (4 ml each, –80 °C). DNA Substrates—The following oligonucleotides were made and reverse phase-purified by Sigma-Genosys and were used to prepare fork DNA, flap DNA, and partial duplex DNAs for gel shift assays: A, 5′-TAACGTATTCAAGATACCTCGTACTCTGTACAGGTTGCGATCCGACTGTCCTGCAT (56 b); B, 5′-GATCATGCAGGACAGTCGGATCGCAACCTGATTTACTGTGTCATATAGTACGTGATTCAG (60 b); D, 5′-AGTACGAGGTATCTTGAATACGTTA (25 b); E, 5′-TACAGAGTACGAGGTATCTTGAATACGTTA (30 b); F, 5′-CTGAATCACGTACTATATGACACAGTAAAT (30 b); G, 5′-GCAGTCCTAACTTTGAGGCAGACC (24 b); H, 5′-GGTCTGCCTCAAGACGGTAGTCAA (24 b); and L, 5′-ATGCAGGACAGTCGGATCGCAACCTG (26 b). Oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described (13Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27145-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the small fork with 12-b arms, 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide G was incubated with unlabeled oligonucleotide H (G:H, 1:1.5) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 200 mm NaCl at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 60 min at 68 °C. The heated DNA was allowed to slowly cool to room temperature over a period of ∼3 h and then purified by centrifugation through a Probe Quant G-50 spin column (Amersham Biosciences). The larger fork and partial duplexes were made by purifying 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide A on a G-50 spin column before annealing with the unlabeled oligonucleotide at a ratio of 1:1.5 under the same conditions. Similarly, flap DNAs were made by annealing 5′ 32P-labeled oligonucleotide A with unlabeled oligonucleotides B and E (or F) (A:B:(E or F), 1:1.5:10). Flap DNA substrates were further purified by electroelution from 6% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE (100 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) buffer, using an electroelution device (Owl Scientific, Inc.). Following electroelution, the purified DNA was concentrated in Microcon YM-10 centrifuge filter devices (Millipore). Gel Retardation Assays—Gel retardation assays were carried out as described (13Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27145-27154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 5-μl reactions containing 3 nm DNA, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 60 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction time, temperature, and concentrations of 32 protein and the 59 helicase loader are indicated in the figure legends. Electrophoresis was carried out at 100 V in 1/2× TBE on 6% polyacrylamide DNA retardation gels (Invitrogen) that were precooled and run at 4 °C. Electrophoresis times were varied according to the DNA substrate: larger fork and flap DNA substrates for 120 min, the partial duplex DNA substrates or the 56-base ssDNA for 85 min, and 12-base arm fork for 70 min. Gels were vacuum-dried on DE81 paper (Whatman), supported by Whatman 3MM paper, and autoradiographed on BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For quantitation, gels were exposed to Fujifilm BAS-MS imaging plates. Imaging plates were scanned on a Fuji FLA-3000 Image Analyzer (Fuji Medical Systems). Quantitation of scanned images was done, using Image Gauge software, version 3.12, from Fuji Medical Systems. The fraction of shifted density above the unshifted DNA in control reactions without 59 or 32 protein was subtracted as background from each lane. DNA Replication Reactions—An 84-base oligonucleotide, complementary to positions 6198–6281 of M13mp19, was used to make the primer-template. When annealed to M13mp2 ssDNA, only the 3′ 34 bases are complementary, leaving a 50-base unpaired tail. The reaction mixtures contained 1.6 nm (circular molecules) of the primer-template, 2 mm ATP, 250 μm of each dNTP including [α-32P]dCTP, (∼800 cpm/pmol), 250 μm CTP, GTP, and UTP, 25 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 60 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Enzymes were diluted in a solution containing 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 25% glycerol. The protein concentrations were 2 μm 32 ssDNA-binding protein, 328 nm 41 helicase, 30 nm wild type, or D219A exonuclease-defective T4 DNA polymerase, 242 nm 44/62 clamp loader, 162 nm 45 clamp, 95 nm 59 helicase loading protein, and 64 nm 61 primase. The first stage reaction was carried out with polymerase, 44/62 clamp loader, and 45 clamp for 10 min at 37 °C. 41 helicase, 59 helicase loading protein, 61 primase, and 32 protein were added for the second stage. At the times indicated, aliquots of the reaction mixtures were mixed with an equal volume of 0.2 m EDTA to stop the synthesis, and the products were analyzed by 0.6% alkaline-agarose gel electrophoresis (39Venkatesan M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12426-12434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and trichloroacetic acid precipitation (34Nossal N.G. Hinton D.M. Hobbs L.J. Spacciapoli P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 560-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Polarity of 32 Protein Binding to Fork DNA—At the replication fork, 32 protein binds to the ssDNA unwound by the helicase. Although the parameters governing the binding of 32 protein to linear ssDNA have been studied extensively (22Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

Biol. 1981; 145: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), the effect of fork structure on its binding has not been determined. We measured 32 protein binding to a fork with 30-b single-stranded arms (Fig. 1, right), a flap with a 5′ single-stranded lagging strand template arm, and a double-stranded leading strand template arm (a model for the replication fork) (Fig. 1, middle), and a flap with a 3′ single-stranded leading strand template arm (a model for the recombination intermediate formed when the invading strand is complementary to the lagging strand template) (Fig. 1, left). Titration with increasing concentrations of 32 protein (Fig. 1) showed that 32 protein bound with similar affinity to the fork DNA with two single-stranded arms (lanes 15–20) and to the flap with a single-stranded lagging strand template arm (lanes 8–13). This binding was comparable with 32 protein binding to single-stranded linear DNA under the same conditions (see Fig. 4, below). In contrast, 32 protein bound with much lower affinity to the flap with a single-stranded leading strand template arm (lanes 1–6). Thus, 32 protein displays a strong and unexpected polarity in its binding.Fig. 4Binding of 32 and 32-A proteins to single-stranded linear DNA is inhibited by a duplex region at the 5′ end. Each DNA substrate was titrated with 32-A protein at a lower range of protein concentrations (1–40 nm) than the corresponding titrations with full-length 32 (10–160 nm). Binding reactions were for 5 min at 25 °C. The DNA substrates in A–C were made with oligonucleotides A + D, A + L, and A, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 32 protein has a central core (residues 22–253) that contains the DNA-binding cleft, a short N-terminal B-domain (residues 1–21) that is thought to bind to the adjacent 32 protein when it is cooperatively bound to DNA, and an acidic C-terminal A-domain (residues 254–302) that has been implicated in binding to other T4 replication proteins, including the polymerase, primase, and helicase loading protein (see Introduction). To investigate which region of 32 protein was responsible for the observed polarity, we compared the binding of full-length wild type 32 protein, 32-protein without the A-domain (32-A), and the N-terminal deletion (32-B) to each flap DNA. As expected, because the B-domain has been shown to be essential for cooperative DNA binding (22Lonberg N. Kowalczykowski S.C. Paul L.S. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), 32-B bound very poorly to both flaps (data not shown). Like full-length 32 protein, the truncated 32-A protein bound more tightly to the flap with the single-stranded lagging strand (Fig. 2, top) than to the flap with the single-stranded leading strand (Fig. 2, bottom). Although the binding polarity of 32-A was the same as that of full-length 32 protein, 32-A bound both flaps more tightly than the intact protein (Figs. 2 and 3A), in agreement with the increased affinity of 32-A for linear ssDNA (19Williams K.R.

The increased affinity of 32-A may be relevant to the function of 32 protein at the replication fork, because interaction of the A-domain with other proteins may move it away from the central core.Fig. 3Quantitation of the binding of 32 and 32-A proteins to DNA flaps and linear partial duplexes.

https://openalex.org/W2052204373,"Growth factors and cell anchorage are both required for cell cycle G1-phase progression, but it is unclear whether their function is mediated through the same set of cell cycle components and whether they are both required during the same periods of time. We separately analyzed the requirements of serum and anchorage during G1-phase progression and found that human dermal fibroblasts as well as wild type, pRb-/-, and p107-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts needed serum (growth factors) until mid-G1-phase but required cell anchorage until late G1-phase to be competent for S-phase entry. Importantly, however, pRb/p107 double-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacked serum requirement in mid-G1-phase but still required cell anchorage until late G1-phase to enter S-phase. Our results indicate that pRb and p107 do not constitute the last control point for extracellular factors during G1-phase progression, and they functionally separate the requirements for serum and cell anchorage in terms of involved cell cycle components."

Initial rate and transient kinetics of DA uptake and conversion were determined under a variety of conditions. The uptake kinetics of DA, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine demonstrate that DA is a better substrate than NE and epinephrine under optimal uptake conditions. The transient kinetics of DA accumulation and NE production under both optimal uptake and uptake and conversion conditions were zero-order with no detectable lag or burst periods. The mathematical analyses of the data show that a normal sequential uptake followed by the conversion process could not explain the observed kinetics, under any condition.

The slow accumulation of DA under optimal conversion conditions appears to be caused by the slow leakage of DA from the channeling pathway to the ghost interior. Because DβM activity in intact granules is equally distributed between soluble and membranous forms of DβM, if an efficient channeling mechanism is operative in vivo, soluble DβM may not have access to the substrate, making the catalytic activity of soluble DβM physiologically insignificant, which is consistent with the increasing experimental evidence that membranous DβM may be the physiologically functional form.

Despite these efforts, some critical aspects of the transport-coupled DβM hydroxylation of DA are not fully understood. For example, numerous studies have shown that DβM activity in granule ghosts, even under optimal conditions, is orders of magnitude less than the total enzyme activity released following the lyses and solubilization (16Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12259-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Menniti F.S. Knoth J. Peterson D.S. Diliberto Jr., E.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 482: 55-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that DA transport may be rate-limiting in granule ghosts. However, isotope effects and other studies appear to indicate that the DβM reaction is rate-limiting in ghosts regardless of the experimental conditions, whereas kinetic studies suggest that the rate of NE production could be much slower than the net uptake of DA, especially under non-optimal conversion conditions (16Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12259-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the DβM activity in granules is distributed between the soluble and membranous forms (23Terland O. Flatmark T. Adv. Exp. Med.

To resolve some of these inconsistencies, we examined the nature of the coupling between VMAT-mediated DA transport and the DβM hydroxylation reaction in chromaffin granule ghosts. Initial rate and transient kinetic studies of DA uptake and conversion have been carried out under a variety of conditions, and the experimental data were analyzed and mathematically modeled by assuming a sequential uptake followed by a conversion process. These analyses clearly demonstrate that a sequential uptake and conversion process could not explain the kinetics of DA uptake and conversion under any condition. On the other hand, all the experimental data are in excellent agreement with a channeling mechanism (for recent reviews on substrate channeling in enzymes, see Refs. 27Huang X. Holden H.M.

Ascorbic acid (Asc) and sodium fumarate were from Aldrich. Ficoll was from Amersham Biosciences, and catalase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin were from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of the highest grade obtainable. Membrane pellets were homogenized using glass-Teflon Potter-Elvehjem homogenizers. Centrifugations were performed using Beckman Coulter J2MC and Optima LE-80K refrigerated centrifuges. HPLC-EC analyses were performed using an ESA model 582 solvent delivery module and a Coulochem-II electrochemical detector with ESA 501 chromatographic software. HPLC-EC Analyses—NE, E, and DA contents of granule ghosts under various incubation conditions were quantified using HPLC-EC. Acidic extracts of ghosts were applied to a C18 reversed phase column (ESA, HR-80) equilibrated with a mobile phase composed of 90 mm NaH2PO4, 50 mm citric acid, 0.05 mm Na2EDTA, 1.7 mm octanesulfonic acid sodium salt, pH 3.0, with 10% CH3CN at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as described previously (15Wimalasena K.

Sample peak areas were quantified by comparison to standard curves that were linear over the range of sample sizes encountered. Preparation of Chromaffin Granule Ghosts—Chromaffin granules were prepared from fresh bovine adrenal medullae using the original methods of Kirshner (33Kirshner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2311-2317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Njus and Radda (34Njus D. Radda G.K. Biochem. J. 1979; 180: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that the granules were further purified by a discontinuous sucrose density gradient (35Smith A.D. Winkler H. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 480-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) as described previously (14Wimalasena K. Herman H.H. May S.W. J. Biol.

The granules were homogenized in 0.2 m Tris phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 100 μg/ml catalase and lysed by the addition of 0.14 volume of a glycerol solution (glycerol, 0.2 m Tris phosphate, pH 7.0 (3:7, v/v)). The lysate was stored in 1.5 ml aliquots at -78 °C. Granule membranes were isolated from the stores on the day of the experiment by diluting with water containing 20 mm Asc and 100 μg/ml catalase, incubating for 10 min at 4 °C, and centrifuging at 36,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was homogenized and resuspended in 2 ml of a solution containing 20 mm Tris phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 150 mm sucrose, 10 mm sodium fumarate, 4.0 μm Cu2+, 100 μg/ml catalase, and 20 mm Asc (optimal uptake and conversion conditions) or 7.5 units/ml ascorbate oxidase (optimal uptake conditions) adjusted to pH 7.0. The ghost membranes were allowed to reseal by incubation for 20 min at room temperature, diluted to 3.75 ml with the same solution as that placed inside (but without Asc, ascorbate oxidase, or catalase), and layered over 1.5 ml of 15% Ficoll, 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 2.25 ml of 0.4 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and centrifuged for 30 min at 90,000 × g at 4 °C. The resealed ghosts, which separated as a band at the 0.4 m sucrose-HEPES/Ficoll interface, were drawn out, diluted with 5 ml of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and homogenized and centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was gently washed with the same buffer and homogenized and resuspended in 1.0 or 2.0 ml of 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, depending on the experiment, and stored at 0 °C. Protein content of ghosts was determined by the Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. DA Uptake Experiments—To aliquots of ghosts prepared under optimal uptake conditions as described above were added 5 mm MgATP, 5 mm MgSO4, 100 μg/ml catalase, 7.5 units/ml ascorbate oxidase. The aliquots were then diluted with 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, to a final volume of 0.5 ml for initial rate kinetic experiments or 5.0 ml for transient kinetic experiments. This mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and the reactions were initiated by adding the desired concentration of DA (see corresponding figure legends) and incubated further at 30 °C. At the desired time intervals, 400-μl aliquots of the incubate were withdrawn and diluted into 5.0 ml of ice-cold 0.4 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and stored at 0 °C until the incubation was completed. These samples were then centrifuged at 36,000× g for 25 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were removed, the pellets were gently washed three times with 0.4 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and the tubes were swabbed dry. The pellets were homogenized in 500 μl of 0.1 m HClO4 and allowed to extract for 20 min at room temperature. After low speed centrifugation, 20 μl of the acidic extracts was analyzed for catecholamines by HPLC-EC as described above. The raw data were corrected for the loss of internal content of the ghosts by standardizing the DA and NE levels to the average indigenous E levels as reported previously (14Wimalasena K. Herman H.H. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Resealed ghost preparations contained an average of 8–10, 6–9, and 0 nmol/mg of protein of NE, E, and DA, respectively, depending on the preparation. DA Uptake and Conversion Experiments—These experiments were carried out using identical protocols as described above for uptake experiments, except that the ghosts were prepared under optimal uptake and conversion conditions as described above, and ascorbate oxidase in the external incubation medium was replaced with 20 mm Asc. The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate that chromaffin granule ghosts prepared according to the above procedures actively accumulated DA, E, and NE in a concentration-dependent manner. The uptake kinetics of all three catecholamines followed simple Michaelis-Menten behavior in a wide concentration range (5–300 μm). The kinetic parameters determined by fitting the initial rate data to the hyperbolic form of the Michaelis-Menten equation show that DA is kinetically a better substrate for the transporter than E and NE (Table I). The depletion of the external substrate during the incubations was estimated to be less than 10% for all the concentrations tested. Therefore, the change in external substrate concentration during the incubation period (6 min) should not have significantly affected the initial rate kinetic parameters determined. In agreement, the control experiments revealed that the corrected uptake rates for all three catecholamines were linear at least up to 6–8 min of incubation in the entire concentration range of 2–300 μm. Although the uptake kinetic parameters varied slightly from one membrane preparation to another, they were highly reproducible within a single preparation; therefore, the most critical experiments were carried out using the same preparation for comparison purposes.Table ISteady state initial rate kinetic parameters of uptake of DA, NE, and E into resealed chromaffin granule ghosts under optimal uptake conditions Calculated by direct fit of the data in Fig. 1 to the hyperbolic form of the Michaelis-Menten equation.SubstrateVmaxKmVmax/Kmnmol/mg·minμmnmol/mg·min/μmDA1.60 ± 0.0323.8 ± 1.56.7 × 10-2E1.13 ± 0.0368.4 ± 4.71.7 × 10-2NE0.95 ± 0.0591.5 ± 10.51.0 × 10-2 Open table in a new tab The uptake and conversion of DA inside the granule ghosts as a function of the external DA concentration (DAout) under optimal uptake and conversion conditions is shown in Fig. 2. These data show that the maximum rate of NE production was about 60% of the net DA uptake (i.e. internal DA + NE). As expected, net DA uptake displayed saturable Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km of 33.2 ± 2.4 μm and a Vmax of 1.30 ± 0.03 nmol/mg·min with respect to DAout. Interestingly, the initial rates of DA accumulation as well as NE production also showed saturable Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to DAout with Km values of 33.9 ± 3.7 and 32.7 ± 2.0 μm and Vmax values of 0.51 ± 0.02 and 0.79 ± 0.02 nmol/mg·min, respectively (see below). To determine the effect of intragranular DA concentration (DAin) on the rate of NE production, the DAin for each DAout was estimated based on the average of net DA uptake between 0 and 6 min from the data in Fig. 2. These estimates gave 1.0–3.8 nmol/mg at 10–300 μm DAout. However, the rate of NE production was non-saturable and linearly increased with increasing DAin in the above concentration range (Fig. 3). Although accurate kinetic parameters could not be obtained, estimates showed that if the enzyme is saturable with respect to DAin, Km must be >30 nmol/mg (∼15–10 mm, assuming an internal volume of 2–3 μl/mg for granule ghosts (36Scherman D. Henry J.P Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 1883-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) and Vmax should be > 6.5 nmol/mg·min (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4A, transient kinetics of DA accumulation and NE production under optimal uptake and conversion conditions were linear in the presence of saturating DAout (200 μm). The net rate of DA uptake was 1.3 nmol/mg·min, which is in good agreement with the initial rate kinetics under similar conditions (Fig. 2; Vmax = 1.3 nmol/mg·min), and the rates of DA accumulation and NE production were 0.40 and 0.88 nmol/mg·min, respectively. The data in Fig. 4B show the time courses of net DA uptake and accumulation and NE production under optimal uptake conditions. Again, whereas net uptake and accumulation of DA and NE production were linear, the rate of NE production was significantly reduced, and the rate of DA accumulation was significantly increased, as expected. Under these conditions, the rates of net DA uptake, NE production, and DA accumulation were 1.5, 0.3, and 1.2 nmol/mg·min, respectively, again in agreement with the initial rate kinetics under similar conditions (Table I). The transient kinetic data presented in Fig. 5A for longer incubation times demonstrate that NE production was linear even up to ∼40 min under optimal uptake and conversion conditions in the presence of saturating DAout (200 μm). Whereas the rate of DA accumulation was linear only up to about 6–8 min, under these conditions DAin reached an apparent steady state with ∼7 nmol/mg. However, no lag or burst periods in either DA accumulation or NE production were observed. As shown in Fig. 5B, under optimal uptake conditions, DA accumulation increased by ∼50–60% in comparison to the levels determined under optimal uptake and conversion conditions above, whereas the rate of NE production decreased by ∼50–60%. Again the DA accumulation reached a plateau (∼18 nmol/mg), whereas NE production was linear with no lag or burst periods (Fig 5B). In the presence of limiting DAout (25 μm ∼ Km; data not shown), both DA accumulation and NE productions were significantly decreased in comparison to the saturating DAout experiments under uptake and conversion conditions, as expected. Whereas DA accumulation reached an apparent steady state at ∼2 nmol/mg in ∼15 min, NE production increased throughout the incubation period, but significantly deviated from the linearity at longer incubation times (likely because of the depletion of DAout). Under uptake conditions, the NE production was linear throughout the time course, whereas DA accumulation exceeded the NE production and reached an apparent steady state at ∼6 nmol/mg. No lag or burst periods were observed for DA accumulation or NE production under both sets of conditions, similar to that observed under saturating DAout conditions (data not shown). The procedures that we developed earlier and used in the present study to determine the DA uptake and conversion in granule ghosts give highly reproducible results (15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A key step in this procedure was the use of cold dilution to separate cleanly the internal contents of the ghost incubates from the external medium and to minimize the back transport of the internal contents. The control experiments have shown that granule ghosts prepared and processed according to these procedures contained relatively constant levels of internal E (6–9 nmol/mg), which slowly declined during longer incubation times, probably because of slow lyses, back transport, nonspecific leakage, etc. Therefore, similar losses of DA and NE in ghost incubates could accurately be corrected by standardizing the DA and NE levels to the average indigenous E levels as reported previously (15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), because NE is not converted to E within granule ghosts. We have also shown that ghosts resealed to contain 10–20 mm Asc could be used to examine the DA uptake and conversion in the presence of 10–20 mm extragranular Asc (under optimal uptake and conversion conditions). Ghosts prepared to contain excess ascorbate oxidase with no added Asc could be used to examine essentially the DA uptake in the absence of extragranular Asc (optimal uptake conditions) because intragranular DA to NE conversion is significantly slower under these conditions (15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The uptake kinetics of DA, NE, and E demonstrate that they all are good substrates for bovine adrenal VMAT and obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics in a wide concentration range under optimal uptake conditions (Fig. 1). The kinetic data in Table I show that DA is a better substrate than NE and E under the same experimental conditions. The Vmax and Km parameters determined for DA and E uptake were in good agreement with the previously reported values under similar conditions (14Wimalasena K. Herman H.H. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Herman H.H. Wimalasena K. Fowler L.C. Beard C.A. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 666-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Knoth J. Isaacs J.M. Njus D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6541-6543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Phillips J.H. Biochem. J. 1974; 144: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although recent studies suggest that bovine adrenal VMAT contains a mixture of VMAT2 (∼85%) and VMAT1 (∼15%) (40Henry J.-P. Botton D. Sagne C. Isambert M.-F. Desnos C. Blanchard V. Raisman-Vozari R. Krejci E. Massoulie J. Gasner B. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 251-262PubMed Google Scholar), our studies could not identify two kinetically distinguishable transport processes for any of the three catecholamines. This may be for two reasons: either the two transporters may be kinetically indistinguishable under the experimental conditions, or the ghost preparation procedures may have enriched a specific population of ghosts with predominantly one of the transporters. The net DA uptake (DA + NE) into ghosts under optimal uptake and conversion conditions displayed saturable initial rate kinetics with respect to DAout (Fig. 2), and the kinetic parameters determined were similar to previously reported values under comparable experimental conditions (14Wimalasena K. Herman H.H. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 24Belpaire F. Laduron P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1968; 17: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The uptake kinetics with respect to estimated DAin (see “Results”) showed that the rate of NE production was apparently non-saturable within the experimental concentration range and linearly increased with increasing DAin (Fig. 3). In addition, kinetic parameters estimated for DAin to NE conversion, assuming saturating kinetics with respect to DAin, are highly inconsistent with the kinetic parameters of the purified m-DβM (15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the other hand, both NE production and DA accumulation displayed saturable initial rate kinetics with respect to DAout (Fig. 2) with similar Km parameters that were very comparable with that of net DA uptake, suggesting that DAout could be the kinetically relevant substrate for all three processes (see below). The transient kinetics of DA uptake, NE production, and DA accumulation were zero-order under optimal uptake and conversion conditions in the presence of saturating DAout (Fig. 4A), and the corresponding rate constants were in good agreement with the initial rate kinetics under similar experimental conditions (see Fig. 2). The apparent zero-order kinetics for DA accumulation and NE production indicate that the rates of back transport of DAin or NE (if any) are insignificant. Therefore, the kinetics of DA uptake followed by m-DβM-catalyzed sequential conversion to NE could be analyzed by a simplified kinetic scheme (Scheme 1) with the following assumptions. (a) DA uptake and conversion are sequential processes. (b) The rate of DA uptake is zero-order (kin) and irreversible. Because DAout is saturating (∼7 × Km) and the maximum depletion of DAout because of uptake was estimated to be less than 1–2% under these conditions, the rate of DA uptake should not be dependent on DAout. As mentioned above, the rate of back transport of DAin is insignificant, and DA uptake could be considered irreversible under these conditions. (c) The conversion of DAin to NE is DAin-dependent and first-order (kNE) with respect to DAin (i.e. all the substrates are saturating or should remain constant) and irreversible. These assumptions are also reasonable, because the extra- and intragranular reductant, Asc, is saturating (20 mm), and the m-DβM reaction is macroscopically irreversible. The above assumption also requires that DAin<< Km for DAin, which is also reasonable, because the estimates above indicate Km for DAin > 30 nmol/mg and the maximum DAin is less than 2 nmol/mg under the same experimental conditions. The above system could be described by the following equations. d[DAin]/dt=kin-kNE[DAin](Eq. 1) d[NE]/dt=kNE[DAin](Eq. 2) [DAin]=kin/kNE[1-exp(-kNE·t)](Eq. 3) [NE]=kint-kin/kNE[1-exp(-kNE·t)](Eq. 4) Although the experimental data in Fig. 4A could not be fitted to equations 3 and 4, the temporal behavior of [DAin], [NE], and [DAin] + [NE] in the above defined system could be visualized assuming the zero-order rate constants determined from Fig. 4A data. As shown in Fig. 6, DA accumulation should reach an apparent steady state in ∼3 min, and NE production should lag behind with a non-zero transient time in the above system (27Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 28Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Ovadi J. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 152: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 30Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 41McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 2782-2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These analyses demonstrate that a sequential process of uptake followed by conversion is inconsistent with the experimental data. Although DA accumulation is zero-order at short incubation times (Fig. 4, A and B), it reached an apparent steady state at longer times under both optimum uptake and uptake and conversion conditions in the presence of saturating DAout (Fig. 5, A and B). However, NE productions were again zero-order, suggesting that the rate of DAin to NE conversion could not be dependent on DAin. The approach of DAin to an apparent steady state could be due to the competing re-entry of DAin into the transport-coupled conversion process from the interior of the granule (k2 in Scheme 2), which may be significant under longer incubation conditions. Thus, assuming the rate of DAin to NE conversion (kNE) is DAin-independent, and rate of re-entry of DA to the conversion process (k2) is DAin-dependent and significant, the kinetics of the system could be analyzed by a simplified scheme (Scheme 2) with the following assumptions. (a) As argued above, the net rates of DA uptake (kin) and leakage (k1) are zero-order (maximum depletion of DAout due to uptake is ∼5–6% under these conditions), and re-entry of DAin to the kinetic scheme is first order with respect to DAin. (b) The rate of conversion of DAin to NE is zero-order (kNE) and independent on DAin under both sets of conditions. 2D. S. Wimalasena and K. Wimalasena, unpublished observations. (c) The rate of back transport of NE is not significant under the experimental conditions because NE production was linear throughout the time course of the incubation. This system could be described by the following equations: d(DAin)/dt=k1-k2[DAin](Eq. 5) [DAin]=k1/k2[1-exp(-k2·t)](Eq. 6) [NE]=kNEt(Eq. 7) The fit of the data in Fig. 5A to equation 6 gave k1 = 0.52 ± 0.01 nmol/mg·min and k2 = 0.072 ± 0.001 min-1 under optimal uptake and conversion conditions. Similar fits under optimal uptake conditions (Fig. 5B) gave k1 = 1.00 ± 0.05 nmol/mg·min and k2 = 0.06 ± 0.01 min-1. The fit of NE production data to equation 7 resulted in zero-order rate constants (kNE) of 0.55 and 0.21 nmol/mg·min, yielding rates of net DA uptake (kin) of 1.1 and 1.2 nmol/mg·min under optimal uptake and conversion and uptake conditions (because k2 is small kin ∼ (kNE + k1) at low DAin conditions), respectively. These results are in excellent agreement with the initial rate kinetic data of net DA uptake (see Fig. 2). The steady state concentrations of DAin (DAss = (k1)/k2)) were determined to be 7.2 and 16.7 nmol/mg·min under optimal uptake and conversion and uptake conditions, respectively, and are also in excellent agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, the similar and relatively small magnitudes of k2 determined under both sets of conditions (kin >> k2) are consistent with the apparent linear transient kinetics observed for net DA uptake and DA accumulation at short incubation times (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, all the experimental results are fully consistent with the above model (Scheme 2). A previous study (16Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12259-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that transient DA accumulation displays an initial burst followed by a sharp decline, whereas NE production displays saturating (or exponential growth) kinetics, using granule ghosts under similar experimental conditions. The authors have used a complex kinetic simulation to explain the results assuming a sequential model. Although we could not reproduce these results, the lack of initial burst or lag periods in either DA accumulation or NE production observed in the present study is consistent with all our previous studies (14Wimalasena K. Herman H.H. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 124-130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Herman H.H. Wimalasena K. Fowler L.C. Beard C.A. May S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 666-672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to explain the observed apparent zero-order transient kinetics of DA uptake and NE production, we propose a novel channeling model (27Huang X. Holden H.M. Raushel F.M. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 149-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 28Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Ovadi J. J. Theor. Biol. 1991; 152: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 30Srere P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 89-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar) in which DA is efficiently channeled from bovine adrenal VMAT to m-DβM for hydroxylation prior to the release into the bulk medium of the ghost interior (Schemes 2 and 3). The slow accumulation of DA, depending on the experimental conditions, must be caused by the leakage of DA from the transporter (or m-DβM) into the interior of the ghosts, and the approach of an apparent steady state of DAin at longer incubation conditions could be caused by the slow concentration-dependent re-entry of DAin into the transport-coupled hydroxylation process from the interior of the granule (Schemes 2 and 3). The rate of NE production is independent of DAin but dependent on DAout, and DAout is the kinetically relevant substrate for DA uptake and accumulation and NE production, which is consistent with the similar Km parameters determined under initial rate conditions for these three processes with respect to DAout. The transport-coupled m-DβM activity is usually orders of magnitude less than the total enzyme activity released following the lyses and solubilization of ghosts (16Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12259-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Menniti F.S. Knoth J. Peterson D.S. Diliberto Jr., E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7651-7657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Terland O. Flatmark T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 482: 55-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because VMAT-mediated transport is directly coupled with the m-DβM activity in ghosts according to the proposed channeling model, m-DβM may not express its optimal activity but efficiently catalyzes the DA to NE conversion at low DAout concentrations. The kinetic isotope effect of the m-DβM reaction in granule ghosts has been determined to be ∼2 (similar to the purified enzyme under steady state conditions), suggesting that the m-DβM reaction is rate-limiting relative to the transport under optimal uptake and conversion conditions (16Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12259-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the exclusion of external Asc was expected to reduce the isotope effect caused by the decreased rate of hydroxylation relative to the transport (normally by about 50–60%), the isotope effect was not affected (16Ahn N.G. Klinman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12259-12265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These inconsistencies have been attributed to the non-steady state conditions of the ghost interior. According to the proposed model, removal of external Asc significantly decreases the channeling efficiency because the oxidized enzyme does not interact with the amine substrate efficiently, leading to the increase of DA accumulation through the leakage pathway without affecting the isotope effect. Under both conditions the net uptake of DA remains relatively constant (within 10–20%) regardless of the magnitude of the partition ratio between the DA accumulation and hydroxylation pathways. Therefore, the channeling model provides satisfactory explanations for some of the critical questions regarding the dynamics of DA uptake and conversion in chromaffin granule ghosts. The concentration of VMAT in chromaffin granule membrane was estimated to be 40–50 pmol/mg (42Isambert M.F. Henry J P Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3660-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and m-DβM was about 7% of the total membrane proteins (37Winkler H. Westhead E. Neuroscience. 1980; 5: 1803-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Assuming a subunit molecular weight of 76,000 for m-DβM(1–3), the molar ratio of m-DβM to VMAT in the membrane is in the range of 1 to 5. Therefore, VMAT molecules in the membrane could theoretically be effectively coupled to m-DβM, providing an efficient channeling probability in vivo (Scheme 3). Because DβM activity in intact granules is equally distributed between s-DβM and m-DβM (23Terland O. Flatmark T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 482: 55-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Belpaire F. Laduron P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1968; 17: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Winkler H. Hortnagl H. Smith A.D. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 26Sabban E.L. Green L.A. Goldstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7812-7818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), operation of a tightly coupled channeling mechanism in vivo may not give s-DβM access to the substrate, making the catalytic activity of s-DβM to be physiologically insignificant. Interestingly, increasing experimental evidence suggests (15Wimalasena K. Wimalasena D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27516-27524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Terland O. Flatmark T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2000; 482: 55-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that m-DβM may be the only functional form and that s-DβM is not functional under physiological conditions and is designated for disposal through exocytosis. We note, however, that the above results do not provide any information about s-DβM in intact granules because s-DβM is lost during the preparation of ghosts. Therefore, a better understanding of the topological arrangements of VMAT and m-DβM and the physiological role of s-DβM in intact granules is of prime importance for further confirmation of the proposed channeling mechanism for the transport-coupled hydroxylation of DA in catecholamine storage vesicles."
