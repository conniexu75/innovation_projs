https://openalex.org/W2144464830,"Multiple factors drive the progression from healthy mucosa towards sporadic colorectal carcinomas and accumulating evidence associates intestinal bacteria with disease initiation and progression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide a first high-resolution map of colonic dysbiosis that is associated with human colorectal cancer (CRC). To this purpose, the microbiomes colonizing colon tumor tissue and adjacent non-malignant mucosa were compared by deep rRNA sequencing. The results revealed striking differences in microbial colonization patterns between these two sites. Although inter-individual colonization in CRC patients was variable, tumors consistently formed a niche for Coriobacteria and other proposed probiotic bacterial species, while potentially pathogenic Enterobacteria were underrepresented in tumor tissue. As the intestinal microbiota is generally stable during adult life, these findings suggest that CRC-associated physiological and metabolic changes recruit tumor-foraging commensal-like bacteria. These microbes thus have an apparent competitive advantage in the tumor microenvironment and thereby seem to replace pathogenic bacteria that may be implicated in CRC etiology. This first glimpse of the CRC microbiome provides an important step towards full understanding of the dynamic interplay between intestinal microbial ecology and sporadic CRC, which may provide important leads towards novel microbiome-related diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions."

Although the activity of orexin neurons is thought to be influenced by various neuronal input as well as humoral factors, the direct consequences of changes in the activity of these neurons in an intact animal are largely unknown. We therefore examined the effects of orexin neuron-specific pharmacogenetic modulation in vivo by a new method called the Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs approach (DREADD). Using this system, we successfully activated and suppressed orexin neurons as measured by Fos staining. EEG and EMG recordings suggested that excitation of orexin neurons significantly increased the amount of time spent in wakefulness and decreased both non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep times. Inhibition of orexin neurons decreased wakefulness time and increased NREM sleep time. These findings clearly show that changes in the activity of orexin neurons can alter the behavioral state of animals and also validate this novel approach for manipulating neuronal activity in awake, freely-moving animals."
https://openalex.org/W1991034124,"The principal problem arising from prostate cancer (PCa) is its propensity to metastasize to bone. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in many tumor metastases. The importance of miRNAs in bone metastasis of PCa has not been elucidated to date. We investigated whether the expression of certain miRNAs was associated with bone metastasis of PCa. We examined the miRNA expression profiles of 6 primary and 7 bone metastatic PCa samples by miRNA microarray analysis. The expression of 5 miRNAs significantly decreased in bone metastasis compared with primary PCa, including miRs-508-5p, -145, -143, -33a and -100. We further examined other samples of 16 primary PCa and 13 bone metastases using real-time PCR analysis. The expressions of miRs-143 and -145 were verified to down-regulate significantly in metastasis samples. By investigating relationship of the levels of miRs-143 and -145 with clinicopathological features of PCa patients, we found down-regulations of miRs-143 and -145 were negatively correlated to bone metastasis, the Gleason score and level of free PSA in primary PCa. Over-expression miR-143 and -145 by retrovirus transfection reduced the ability of migration and invasion in vitro, and tumor development and bone invasion in vivo of PC-3 cells, a human PCa cell line originated from a bone metastatic PCa specimen. Their upregulation also increased E-cadherin expression and reduced fibronectin expression of PC-3 cells which revealed a less invasive morphologic phenotype. These findings indicate that miRs-143 and -145 are associated with bone metastasis of PCa and suggest that they may play important roles in the bone metastasis and be involved in the regulation of EMT Both of them may also be clinically used as novel biomarkers in discriminating different stages of human PCa and predicting bone metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2023766860,"Background Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulation of the immune system is involved in the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The aim of the study was to explore immunological markers in peripheral plasma samples from non-medicated subjects with high-functioning ASD. Methodology/Principal Findings A multiplex assay for cytokines and chemokines was applied to plasma samples from male subjects with high-functioning ASD (n = 28) and matched controls (n = 28). Among a total of 48 analytes examined, the plasma concentrations of IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-5, IL-8, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-17 and GRO-α were significantly higher in subjects with ASD compared with the corresponding values of matched controls after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusion/Significance The results suggest that abnormal immune responses as assessed by multiplex analysis of cytokines may serve as one of the biological trait markers for ASD."
https://openalex.org/W1971246481,"The production and use of nanoparticles (NP) has steadily increased within the last decade; however, knowledge about risks of NP to human health and ecosystems is still scarce. Common knowledge concerning NP effects on freshwater organisms is largely limited to standard short-term (≤48 h) toxicity tests, which lack both NP fate characterization and an understanding of the mechanisms underlying toxicity. Employing slightly longer exposure times (72 to 96 h), we found that suspensions of nanosized (∼100 nm initial mean diameter) titanium dioxide (nTiO(2)) led to toxicity in Daphnia magna at nominal concentrations of 3.8 (72-h EC(50)) and 0.73 mg/L (96-h EC(50)). However, nTiO(2) disappeared quickly from the ISO-medium water phase, resulting in toxicity levels as low as 0.24 mg/L (96-h EC(50)) based on measured concentrations. Moreover, we showed that nTiO(2) (∼100 nm) is significantly more toxic than non-nanosized TiO(2) (∼200 nm) prepared from the same stock suspension. Most importantly, we hypothesized a mechanistic chain of events for nTiO(2) toxicity in D. magna that involves the coating of the organism surface with nTiO(2) combined with a molting disruption. Neonate D. magna (≤6 h) exposed to 2 mg/L nTiO(2) exhibited a ""biological surface coating"" that disappeared within 36 h, during which the first molting was successfully managed by 100% of the exposed organisms. Continued exposure up to 96 h led to a renewed formation of the surface coating and significantly reduced the molting rate to 10%, resulting in 90% mortality. Because coating of aquatic organisms by manmade NP might be ubiquitous in nature, this form of physical NP toxicity might result in widespread negative impacts on environmental health."
https://openalex.org/W2141888996,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by airspace enlargement and peribronchial lymphoid follicles; however, the immunological mechanisms leading to these pathologic changes remain undefined. Here we show that cigarette smoke is a selective adjuvant that augments in vitro and in vivo Th17, but not Th1, cell differentiation via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. Smoke exposed IL-17RA(-/-) mice failed to induce CCL2 and MMP12 compared to WT mice. Remarkably, in contrast to WT mice, IL-17RA(-/-) mice failed to develop emphysema after 6 months of cigarette smoke exposure. Taken together, these data demonstrate that cigarette smoke is a potent Th17 adjuvant and that IL-17RA signaling is required for chemokine expression necessary for MMP12 induction and tissue emphysema."
https://openalex.org/W2073559066,"Background Mosquitoes are insects that vector many serious pathogens to humans and other vertebrates. Most mosquitoes must feed on the blood of a vertebrate host to produce eggs. In turn, multiple cycles of blood feeding promote frequent contacts with hosts and make mosquitoes ideal disease vectors. Both hormonal and nutritional factors are involved in regulating egg development in the mosquito, Aedes aegypti. However, the processes that regulate digestion of the blood meal remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report that insulin peptide 3 (ILP3) directly stimulated late phase trypsin-like gene expression in blood fed females. In vivo knockdown of the mosquito insulin receptor (MIR) by RNA interference (RNAi) delayed but did not fully inhibit trypsin-like gene expression in the midgut, ecdysteroid (ECD) production by ovaries, and vitellogenin (Vg) expression by the fat body. In contrast, in vivo treatment with double-stranded MIR RNA and rapamycin completely blocked egg production. In vitro experiments showed that amino acids did not simulate late phase trypsin-like gene expression in the midgut or ECD production by the ovaries. However, amino acids did enhance ILP3-mediated stimulation of trypsin-like gene expression and ECD production. Conclusions/Significance Overall, our results indicate that ILPs from the brain synchronize blood meal digestion and amino acid availability with ovarian ECD production to maximize Vg expression by the fat body. The activation of digestion by ILPs may also underlie the growth promoting effects of insulin and TOR signaling in other species."
https://openalex.org/W1733314917,"There has been widespread interest in the potential of combination cardiovascular medications containing aspirin and agents to lower blood pressure and cholesterol ('polypills') to reduce cardiovascular disease. However, no reliable placebo-controlled data are available on both efficacy and tolerability.We conducted a randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trial of a polypill (containing aspirin 75 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg and simvastatin 20 mg) in 378 individuals without an indication for any component of the polypill, but who had an estimated 5-year cardiovascular disease risk over 7.5%. The primary outcomes were systolic blood pressure (SBP), LDL-cholesterol and tolerability (proportion discontinued randomised therapy) at 12 weeks follow-up.At baseline, mean BP was 134/81 mmHg and mean LDL-cholesterol was 3.7 mmol/L. Over 12 weeks, polypill treatment reduced SBP by 9.9 (95% CI: 7.7 to 12.1) mmHg and LDL-cholesterol by 0.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 0.9) mmol/L. The discontinuation rates in the polypill group compared to placebo were 23% vs 18% (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.00, p = 0.2). There was an excess of side effects known to the component medicines (58% vs 42%, p = 0.001), which was mostly apparent within a few weeks, and usually did not warrant cessation of trial treatment.This polypill achieved sizeable reductions in SBP and LDL-cholesterol but caused side effects in about 1 in 6 people. The halving in predicted cardiovascular risk is moderately lower than previous estimates and the side effect rate is moderately higher. Nonetheless, substantial net benefits would be expected among patients at high risk.Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12607000099426."
https://openalex.org/W2090168827,"Mitochondria in mammals are organized into tubular networks that undergo frequent shape change. Mitochondrial fission and fusion are the main components mediating the mitochondrial shape change. Perturbation of the fission/fusion balance is associated with many disease conditions. However, underlying mechanisms of the fission/fusion balance are not well understood. Mitochondrial fission in mammals requires the dynamin-like protein DLP1/Drp1 that is recruited to the mitochondrial surface, possibly through the membrane-anchored protein Fis1 or Mff. Additional dynamin-related GTPases, mitofusin (Mfn) and OPA1, are associated with the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes, respectively, and mediate fusion of the respective membranes. In this study, we found that two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) of Mfn2 interact with each other, and that Mfn2 also interacts with the fission protein DLP1. The association of the two heptad-repeats of Mfn2 is fusion inhibitory whereas a positive role of the Mfn2/DLP1 interaction in mitochondrial fusion is suggested. Our results imply that the differential binding of Mfn2-HR1 to HR2 and DLP1 regulates mitochondrial fusion and that DLP1 may act as a regulatory factor for efficient execution of both fusion and fission of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2142829127,"Mitochondrial superoxide flashes (mSOFs) are stochastic events of quantal mitochondrial superoxide generation. Here, we used flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibers from transgenic mice with muscle-specific expression of a novel mitochondrial-targeted superoxide biosensor (mt-cpYFP) to characterize mSOF activity in skeletal muscle at rest, following intense activity, and under pathological conditions. Results demonstrate that mSOF activity in muscle depended on electron transport chain and adenine nucleotide translocase functionality, but it was independent of cyclophilin-D-mediated mitochondrial permeability transition pore activity. The diverse spatial dimensions of individual mSOF events were found to reflect a complex underlying morphology of the mitochondrial network, as examined by electron microscopy. Muscle activity regulated mSOF activity in a biphasic manner. Specifically, mSOF frequency was significantly increased following brief tetanic stimulation (18.1 ± 1.6 to 22.3 ± 2.0 flashes/1000 μm²·100 s before and after 5 tetani) and markedly decreased (to 7.7 ± 1.6 flashes/1000 μm²·100 s) following prolonged tetanic stimulation (40 tetani). A significant temperature-dependent increase in mSOF frequency (11.9 ± 0.8 and 19.8 ± 2.6 flashes/1000 μm²·100 s at 23°C and 37°C) was observed in fibers from RYR1(Y522S/WT) mice, a mouse model of malignant hyperthermia and heat-induced hypermetabolism. Together, these results demonstrate that mSOF activity is a highly sensitive biomarker of mitochondrial respiration and the cellular metabolic state of muscle during physiological activity and pathological oxidative stress"
https://openalex.org/W2095841436,"Dopamine (DA) release in the CNS is critical for motor control and motivated behaviors. Dysfunction of its regulation is thought to be implicated in drug abuse and in diseases such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's. Although various potassium channels located in the somatodendritic compartment of DA neurons such as G-protein-gated inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRK) have been shown to regulate cell firing and DA release, little is presently known about the role of potassium channels localized in the axon terminals of these neurons. Here we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to study electrically-evoked DA release in rat dorsal striatal brain slices. We find that although G-protein-gated inward rectifying (GIRK) and ATP-gated (KATP) potassium channels play only a minor role, voltage-gated potassium channels of the Kv1 family play a major role in regulating DA release. The use of Kv subtype-selective blockers confirmed a role for Kv1.2, 1.3 and 1.6, but not Kv1.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.4 and 4.2. Interestingly, Kv1 blockers also reduced the ability of quinpirole, a D2 receptor agonist, to inhibit evoked DA overflow, thus suggesting that Kv1 channels also regulate presynaptic D2 receptor function. Our work identifies Kv1 potassium channels as key regulators of DA release in the striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2068021881,"Stress and increased glucocorticoid levels are associated with many neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression. Recently, the role of vascular endothelial factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2/Flk1) signaling has been implicated in stress-mediated neuroplasticity. However, the mechanism of regulation of VEGF/Flk1 signaling under long-term continuous glucocorticoid exposure has not been elucidated.We examined the possible effects of long-term continuous glucocorticoid exposure on VEGF/Flk1 signaling in cultured cortical neurons in vitro, mouse frontal cortex in vivo, and in post mortem human prefrontal cortex of both control and schizophrenia subjects.We found that long-term continuous exposure to corticosterone (CORT, a natural glucocorticoid) reduced Flk1 protein levels both in vitro and in vivo. CORT treatment resulted in alterations in signaling molecules downstream to Flk1 such as PTEN, Akt and mTOR. We demonstrated that CORT-induced changes in Flk1 levels are mediated through glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and calcium. A significant reduction in Flk1-GR interaction was observed following CORT exposure. Interestingly, VEGF levels were increased in cortex, but decreased in serum following CORT treatment. Moreover, significant reductions in Flk1 and GR protein levels were found in postmortem prefrontal cortex samples from schizophrenia subjects.The alterations in VEGF/Flk1 signaling following long-term continuous CORT exposure represents a molecular mechanism of the neurobiological effects of chronic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2005852578,"Nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) is the fundamental process by which plants exposed to high light intensities dissipate the potentially harmful excess energy as heat. Recently, it has been shown that efficient energy dissipation can be induced in the major light-harvesting complexes of photosystem II (LHCII) in the absence of protein-protein interactions. Spectroscopic measurements on these samples (LHCII gels) in the quenched state revealed specific alterations in the absorption and circular dichroism bands assigned to neoxanthin and lutein 1 molecules. In this work, we investigate the changes in conformation of the pigments involved in NPQ using resonance Raman spectroscopy. By selective excitation we show that, as well as the twisting of neoxanthin that has been reported previously, the lutein 1 pigment also undergoes a significant change in conformation when LHCII switches to the energy dissipative state. Selective two-photon excitation of carotenoid (Car) dark states (Car S(1)) performed on LHCII gels shows that the extent of electronic interactions between Car S(1) and chlorophyll states correlates linearly with chlorophyll fluorescence quenching, as observed previously for isolated LHCII (aggregated versus trimeric) and whole plants (with versus without NPQ)."
https://openalex.org/W2043146668,"Understanding the signals that control migration of neural progenitor cells in the adult brain may provide new therapeutic opportunities. Reelin is best known for its role in regulating cell migration during brain development, but we now demonstrate a novel function for reelin in the injured adult brain. First, we show that Reelin is upregulated around lesions. Second, experimentally increasing Reelin expression levels in healthy mouse brain leads to a change in the migratory behavior of subventricular zone-derived progenitors, triggering them to leave the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to which they are normally restricted during their migration to the olfactory bulb. Third, we reveal that Reelin increases endogenous progenitor cell dispersal in periventricular structures independently of any chemoattraction but via cell detachment and chemokinetic action, and thereby potentiates spontaneous cell recruitment to demyelination lesions in the corpus callosum. Conversely, animals lacking Reelin signaling exhibit reduced endogenous progenitor recruitment at the lesion site. Altogether, these results demonstrate that beyond its known role during brain development, Reelin is a key player in post-lesional cell migration in the adult brain. Finally our findings provide proof of concept that allowing progenitors to escape from the RMS is a potential therapeutic approach to promote myelin repair."
https://openalex.org/W2074794225,"We attempt to quantify how significant the polar archipelago of South Georgia is as a source of regional and global marine biodiversity. We evaluate numbers of rare, endemic and range-edge species and how the faunal structure of South Georgia may respond to some of the fastest warming waters on the planet. Biodiversity data was collated from a comprehensive review of reports, papers and databases, collectively representing over 125 years of polar exploration. Classification of each specimen was recorded to species level and fully geo-referenced by depth, latitude and longitude. This information was integrated with physical data layers (e.g. temperature, salinity and flow) providing a visualisation of South Georgia's biogeography across spatial, temporal and taxonomic scales, placing it in the wider context of the Southern Hemisphere. This study marks the first attempt to map the biogeography of an archipelago south of the Polar Front. Through it we identify the South Georgian shelf as the most speciose region of the Southern Ocean recorded to date. Marine biodiversity was recorded as rich across taxonomic levels with 17,732 records yielding 1,445 species from 436 families, 51 classes and 22 phyla. Most species recorded were rare, with 35% recorded only once and 86% recorded <10 times. Its marine fauna is marked by the cumulative dominance of endemic and range-edge species, potentially at their thermal tolerance limits. Consequently, our data suggests the ecological implications of environmental change to the South Georgian marine ecosystem could be severe. If sea temperatures continue to rise, we suggest that changes will include depth profile shifts of some fauna towards cooler Antarctic Winter Water (90-150 m), the loss of some range-edge species from regional waters, and the wholesale extinction at a global scale of some of South Georgia's endemic species."
https://openalex.org/W2029903626,"Spermine synthase (SMS) is a key enzyme controlling the concentration of spermidine and spermine in the cell. The importance of SMS is manifested by the fact that single missense mutations were found to cause Snyder-Robinson Syndrome (SRS). At the same time, currently there are no non-synonymous single nucleoside polymorphisms, nsSNPs (harmless mutations), found in SMS, which may imply that the SMS does not tolerate amino acid substitutions, i.e. is not mutable.To investigate the mutability of the SMS, we carried out in silico analysis and in vitro experiments of the effects of amino acid substitutions at the missense mutation sites (G56, V132 and I150) that have been shown to cause SRS. Our investigation showed that the mutation sites have different degree of mutability depending on their structural micro-environment and involvement in the function and structural integrity of the SMS. It was found that the I150 site does not tolerate any mutation, while V132, despite its key position at the interface of SMS dimer, is quite mutable. The G56 site is in the middle of the spectra, but still quite sensitive to charge residue replacement.The performed analysis showed that mutability depends on the detail of the structural and functional factors and cannot be predicted based on conservation of wild type properties alone. Also, harmless nsSNPs can be expected to occur even at sites at which missense mutations were found to cause diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1988515290,"Mice have been employed as models of cancer for over a century, providing significant advances in our understanding of this multifaceted family of diseases. In particular, orthotopic tumor xenograft mouse models are emerging as the preference for cancer research due to increased clinical relevance over subcutaneous mouse models. In the current study, we developed orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenograft models in mice by a minimally invasive method, ultrasound guided injection (USGI) comparable to highly invasive surgical orthotopic injection (SOI) methods. This optimized method prevented injection complications such as recoil of cells through the injection canal or leakage of cells out of the pancreas into the peritoneal cavity. Tumor growth was monitored in vivo and quantified by ultrasound imaging weekly, tumors were also detected by in vivo fluorescence imaging using a tumor targeted molecular probe. The mean tumor volumes for the USGI and SOI models after 2 weeks of tumor growth were 205 mm(3) and 178 mm(3) respectively. By USGI of human pancreatic cancer cell lines, human orthotopic pancreatic cancer xenografts were established. Based on ultrasound imaging, the orthotopic human pancreatic cancer xenograft take rate was 100% for both human pancreatic cancer cell lines used, MiaPaCa-2 and Su86.86, with mean tumor volumes of 28 mm(3)and 30 mm(3). We demonstrated that this USGI method is feasible, reproducible, facile, minimally invasive and improved compared to the highly-invasive SOI method for establishing orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenograft models suitable for molecular imaging."

The mitotic spindle guides the cell through mitosis as it mediates the segregation of chromosomes, the orientation of the cleavage furrow, and the progression of cell division. Birth defects and tissue-specific cancers often result from abnormalities in mitotic events. Here, we report a proteomic study of the mitotic spindle from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Four different isolations of metaphase spindles were subjected to Multi-dimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) analysis and tandem mass spectrometry. We identified 1155 proteins and used Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to categorize proteins into cellular component groups. We then compared our data to the previously published CHO midbody proteome and identified proteins that are unique to the CHO spindle. Our data represent the first mitotic spindle proteome in CHO cells, which augments the list of mitotic spindle components from mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2014612507,"The prophylactic capacity of the RUTI® vaccine, based on fragmented cells of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, has been evaluated in respect to aerosol challenge with virulent bacilli. Subcutaneous vaccination significantly reduced viable bacterial counts in both lungs and spleens of C57Bl mice, when challenged 4 weeks after vaccination. RUTI® protected the spleen less than BCG. Following a 9 month vaccination-challenge interval, protection was observed for the lungs, but not for the spleen. Survival of infected guinea pigs was prolonged by vaccination given 5 weeks before challenge. Inoculations of RUTI® shortly after infection significantly reduced the viable bacterial counts in the lungs, when compared with infected control mice. Thus, vaccination by RUTI® has potential for both the prophylaxis and immunotherapy of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2004053312,"Prions are pathogens with an unusually high tolerance to inactivation and constitute a complex challenge to the re-processing of surgical instruments. On the other hand, however, they provide an informative paradigm which has been exploited successfully for the development of novel broad-range disinfectants simultaneously active also against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Here we report on the development of a methodological platform that further facilitates the use of scrapie prions as model pathogens for disinfection. We used specifically adapted serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) for the quantitative detection, on steel wires providing model carriers for decontamination, of 263K scrapie seeding activity converting normal protease-sensitive into abnormal protease-resistant prion protein. Reference steel wires carrying defined amounts of scrapie infectivity were used for assay calibration, while scrapie-contaminated test steel wires were subjected to fifteen different procedures for disinfection that yielded scrapie titre reductions of ≤10(1)- to ≥10(5.5)-fold. As confirmed by titration in hamsters the residual scrapie infectivity on test wires could be reliably deduced for all examined disinfection procedures, from our quantitative seeding activity assay. Furthermore, we found that scrapie seeding activity present in 263K hamster brain homogenate or multiplied by PMCA of scrapie-contaminated steel wires both triggered accumulation of protease-resistant prion protein and was further propagated in a novel cell assay for 263K scrapie prions, i.e., cerebral glial cell cultures from hamsters. The findings from our PMCA- and glial cell culture assays revealed scrapie seeding activity as a biochemically and biologically replicative principle in vitro, with the former being quantitatively linked to prion infectivity detected on steel wires in vivo. When combined, our in vitro assays provide an alternative to titrations of biological scrapie infectivity in animals that substantially facilitates the use of prions as potentially highly indicative test agents in the search for novel broad-range disinfectants."
https://openalex.org/W2170454904,"Significant progress has been achieved toward elucidating the molecular mechanisms that underlie breast cancer progression; yet, much less is known about the associated cellular biophysical traits. To this end, we use time-lapsed confocal microscopy to investigate the interplay among cell motility, three-dimensional (3D) matrix stiffness, matrix architecture, and transforming potential in a mammary epithelial cell (MEC) cancer progression series. We use a well characterized breast cancer progression model where human-derived MCF10A MECs overexpress either ErbB2, 14-3-3ζ, or both ErbB2 and 14-3-3ζ, with empty vector as a control. Cell motility assays showed that MECs overexpressing ErbB2 alone exhibited notably high migration speeds when cultured atop two-dimensional (2D) matrices, while overexpression of 14-3-3ζ alone most suppressed migration atop 2D matrices (as compared to non-transformed MECs). Our results also suggest that co-overexpression of the 14-3-3ζ and ErbB2 proteins facilitates cell migratory capacity in 3D matrices, as reflected in cell migration speed. Additionally, 3D matrices of sufficient stiffness can significantly hinder the migratory ability of partially transformed cells, but increased 3D matrix stiffness has a lesser effect on the aggressive migratory behavior exhibited by fully transformed cells that co-overexpress both ErbB2 and 14-3-3ζ. Finally, this study shows that for MECs possessing partial or full transforming potential, those overexpressing ErbB2 alone show the greatest sensitivity of cell migration speed to matrix architecture, while those overexpressing 14-3-3ζ alone exhibit the least sensitivity to matrix architecture. Given the current knowledge of breast cancer mechanobiology, these findings overall suggest that cell motility is governed by a complex interplay between matrix mechanics and transforming potential."
https://openalex.org/W2048162192,Genetic circuits in bacteria are intimately coupled to the cellular growth rate as many parameters of gene expression are growth-rate dependent. Growth-rate dependence can be particularly pronounced for genes on plasmids; therefore the native regulatory systems of a plasmid such as its replication control system are characterized by growth-rate dependent parameters and regulator concentrations. This natural growth-rate dependent variation of regulator concentrations can be used for a quantitative analysis of the design of such regulatory systems. Here we analyze the growth-rate dependence of parameters of the copy number control system of ColE1-type plasmids in E. coli. This analysis allows us to infer the form of the control function and suggests that the Rom protein increases the sensitivity of control.
https://openalex.org/W1974249706,"Background Taxol is a microtubule stabilizing agent that arrests cells in mitosis leading to cell death. Taxol is widely used to treat breast cancer, but resistance occurs in 25–69% of patients and it is vital to understand how Taxol resistance develops to improve chemotherapy. The effects of chemotherapeutic agents are overcome by survival signals that cancer cells receive. We focused our studies on autotaxin, which is a secreted protein that increases tumor growth, aggressiveness, angiogenesis and metastasis. We discovered that autotaxin strongly antagonizes the Taxol-induced killing of breast cancer and melanoma cells by converting the abundant extra-cellular lipid, lysophosphatidylcholine, into lysophosphatidate. This lipid stimulates specific G-protein coupled receptors that activate survival signals. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we determined the basis of these antagonistic actions of lysophosphatidate towards Taxol-induced G2/M arrest and cell death using cultured breast cancer cells. Lysophosphatidate does not antagonize Taxol action in MCF-7 cells by increasing Taxol metabolism or its expulsion through multi-drug resistance transporters. Lysophosphatidate does not lower the percentage of cells accumulating in G2/M by decreasing exit from S-phase or selective stimulation of cell death in G2/M. Instead, LPA had an unexpected and remarkable action in enabling MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, which had been arrested in G2/M by Taxol, to normalize spindle structure and divide, thus avoiding cell death. This action involves displacement of Taxol from the tubulin polymer fraction, which based on inhibitor studies, depends on activation of LPA receptors and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Conclusions/Significance This work demonstrates a previously unknown consequence of lysophosphatidate action that explains why autotaxin and lysophosphatidate protect against Taxol-induced cell death and promote resistance to the action of this important therapeutic agent."
https://openalex.org/W2038092667,"Background Conventional scientometric predictors of research performance such as the number of papers, citations, and papers in the top 1% of highly cited papers cannot be validated in terms of the number of Nobel Prize achievements across countries and institutions. The purpose of this paper is to find a bibliometric indicator that correlates with the number of Nobel Prize achievements. Methodology/Principal Findings This study assumes that the high-citation tail of citation distribution holds most of the information about high scientific performance. Here I propose the x-index, which is calculated from the number of national articles in the top 1% and 0.1% of highly cited papers and has a subtractive term to discount highly cited papers that are not scientific breakthroughs. The x-index, the number of Nobel Prize achievements, and the number of national articles in Nature or Science are highly correlated. The high correlations among these independent parameters demonstrate that they are good measures of high scientific performance because scientific excellence is their only common characteristic. However, the x-index has superior features as compared to the other two parameters. Nobel Prize achievements are low frequency events and their number is an imprecise indicator, which in addition is zero in most institutions; the evaluation of research making use of the number of publications in prestigious journals is not advised. Conclusion The x-index is a simple and precise indicator for high research performance."
https://openalex.org/W1969107765,"Background The wound healing properties of the human omentum are well known and have extensively been exploited clinically. However, the underlying mechanisms of these effects are not well understood. We hypothesize that the omentum tissue promotes wound healing via modulation of anti-inflammatory pathways, and because the omentum is rich in adipocytes, the adipocytes may modulate the anti-inflammatory response. Factors released by human omentum may affect healing, inflammation and immune defense. Methodology Six human omentum tissues (non obese, free from malignancy, and any other systemic disorder) were obtained during diagnostic laparoscopies having a negative outcome. Healthy oral mucosa (obtained from routine oral biopsies) was used as control. Cultured adipocytes derived from human omentum were exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1–50 ng/mL) for 12–72 hours to identify the non-cytotoxic doses. Levels of expression (mRNA and protein) were carried out for genes associated with pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses and antibacterial/antimicrobial activity using qRT-PCR, western blotting, and cell-based ELISA assays. Results The study shows significant higher levels of expression (mRNA and protein) of several specific cytokines, and antibacterial peptides in the omentum tissues when compared to oral sub-mucosal tissues. In the validation studies, primary cultures of adipocytes, derived from human omentum were exposed to LPS (5 and 10 ng/mL) for 24 and 48 h. The altered expressions were more pronounced in cultured adipocytes cells when exposed to LPS as compared to the omentum tissue. Conclusions/Significance Perhaps, this is the first report that provides evidence of expressional changes in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and antibacterial peptides in the normal human omentum tissue as well as adipocytes cultured from this tissue. The study provides new insights on the molecular and cellular mechanisms of healing and defense by the omentum, and suggests the potential applicability of cultured adipocytes derived from the omentum for future therapeutic applications."
https://openalex.org/W1969984696,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or proteins with disordered regions (IDRs) do not have a well-defined tertiary structure, but perform a multitude of functions, often relying on their native disorder to achieve the binding flexibility through changing to alternative conformations. Intrinsic disorder is frequently found in all three kingdoms of life, and may occur in short stretches or span whole proteins. To date most studies contrasting the differences between ordered and disordered proteins focused on simple summary statistics. Here, we propose an evolutionary approach to study IDPs, and contrast patterns specific to ordered protein regions and the corresponding IDRs.Two empirical Markov models of amino acid substitutions were estimated, based on a large set of multiple sequence alignments with experimentally verified annotations of disordered regions from the DisProt database of IDPs. We applied new methods to detect differences in Markovian evolution and evolutionary rates between IDRs and the corresponding ordered protein regions. Further, we investigated the distribution of IDPs among functional categories, biochemical pathways and their preponderance to contain tandem repeats.We find significant differences in the evolution between ordered and disordered regions of proteins. Most importantly we find that disorder promoting amino acids are more conserved in IDRs, indicating that in some cases not only amino acid composition but the specific sequence is important for function. This conjecture is also reinforced by the observation that for of our data set IDRs evolve more slowly than the ordered parts of the proteins, while we still support the common view that IDRs in general evolve more quickly. The improvement in model fit indicates a possible improvement for various types of analyses e.g. de novo disorder prediction using a phylogenetic Hidden Markov Model based on our matrices showed a performance similar to other disorder predictors."
https://openalex.org/W2132097489,"To monitor changes in Bordetella pertussis populations, mainly two typing methods are used; Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multiple-Locus Variable-Number Tandem Repeat Analysis (MLVA). In this study, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing method, based on 87 SNPs, was developed and compared with PFGE and MLVA. The discriminatory indices of SNP typing, PFGE and MLVA were found to be 0.85, 0.95 and 0.83, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis, using SNP typing as Gold Standard, revealed false homoplasies in the PFGE and MLVA trees. Further, in contrast to the SNP-based tree, the PFGE- and MLVA-based trees did not reveal a positive correlation between root-to-tip distance and the isolation year of strains. Thus PFGE and MLVA do not allow an estimation of the relative age of the selected strains. In conclusion, SNP typing was found to be phylogenetically more informative than PFGE and more discriminative than MLVA. Further, in contrast to PFGE, it is readily standardized allowing interlaboratory comparisons. We applied SNP typing to study strains with a novel allele for the pertussis toxin promoter, ptxP3, which have a worldwide distribution and which have replaced the resident ptxP1 strains in the last 20 years. Previously, we showed that ptxP3 strains showed increased pertussis toxin expression and that their emergence was associated with increased notification in the Netherlands. SNP typing showed that the ptxP3 strains isolated in the Americas, Asia, Australia and Europe formed a monophyletic branch which recently diverged from ptxP1 strains. Two predominant ptxP3 SNP types were identified which spread worldwide. The widespread use of SNP typing will enhance our understanding of the evolution and global epidemiology of B. pertussis."
https://openalex.org/W2051043258,"The disease processes underlying inherited retinal disease are complex and are not completely understood. Many of the corrective gene therapies designed to treat diseases linked to mutations in genes specifically expressed in photoreceptor cells restore function to these cells but fail to stop progression of the disease. There is growing consensus that effective treatments for these diseases will require delivery of multiple therapeutic proteins that will be selected to treat specific aspects of the disease process. The purpose of this study was to design a lentiviral transgene that reliably expresses all of the proteins it encodes and does so in a consistent manner among infected cells. We show, using both in vitro and in vivo analyses, that bicistronic lentiviral transgenes encoding two fluorescent proteins fused to a viral 2A-like cleavage peptide meet these expression criteria. To determine if this transgene design is suitable for therapeutic applications, we replaced one of the fluorescent protein genes with the gene encoding guanylate cyclase-1 (GC1) and delivered lentivirus carrying this transgene to the retinas of the GUCY1*B avian model of Leber congenital amaurosis-1 (LCA1). GUCY1*B chickens carry a null mutation in the GC1 gene that disrupts photoreceptor function and causes blindness at hatching, a phenotype that closely matches that observed in humans with LCA1. We found that treatment of these animals with the 2A lentivector encoding GC1 restored vision to these animals as evidenced by the presence of optokinetic reflexes. We conclude that 2A-like peptides, with proper optimization, can be successfully incorporated into therapeutic vectors designed to deliver multiple proteins to neural retinal. These results highlight the potential of this vector design to serve as a platform for the development of combination therapies designed to enhance or prolong the benefits of corrective gene therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2090029549,"Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis in the adult bone marrow (BM) is regulated by both intrinsic gene expression products and interactions with extrinsic factors in the HSC niche. GRP94, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, has been reported to be essential for the expression of specific integrins and to selectively regulate early T and B lymphopoiesis. In GRP94 deficient BM chimeras, multipotent hematopoietic progenitors persisted and even increased, however, the mechanism is not well understood. Here we employed a conditional knockout (KO) strategy to acutely eliminate GRP94 in the hematopoietic system. We observed an increase in HSCs and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors in the Grp94 KO BM, correlating with an increased number of colony forming units. Cell cycle analysis revealed that a loss of quiescence and an increase in proliferation led to an increase in Grp94 KO HSCs. This expansion of the HSC pool can be attributed to the impaired interaction of HSCs with the niche, evidenced by enhanced HSC mobilization and severely compromised homing and lodging ability of primitive hematopoietic cells. Transplanting wild-type (WT) hematopoietic cells into a GRP94 null microenvironment yielded a normal hematology profile and comparable numbers of HSCs as compared to WT control, suggesting that GRP94 in HSCs, but not niche cells, is required for maintaining HSC homeostasis. Investigating this, we further determined that there was a near complete loss of integrin α4 expression on the cell surface of Grp94 KO HSCs, which showed impaired binding with fibronectin, an extracellular matrix molecule known to play a role in mediating HSC-niche interactions. Furthermore, the Grp94 KO mice displayed altered myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. Collectively, our studies establish GRP94 as a novel cell intrinsic factor required to maintain the interaction of HSCs with their niche, and thus regulate their physiology."

Here we describe a systematic exploration of permutation sites for mCherry and mKate using a tandem fusion template approach. Circular permutants retaining more than 60% (mCherry) and 90% (mKate) brightness of the parent molecules are reported, as well as a quantitative evaluation of the fluorescence from neighboring mutations. Truncations of circular permutants indicated essential N- and C-terminal segments and substantial flexibility in the use of these molecules. Structural evaluation of two cp-mKate variants indicated no major conformational changes from the previously reported wild-type structure, and cis conformation of the chromophores. Four cp-mKates were identified with over 80% of native fluorescence, providing important new building blocks for sensor and complementation experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2113002103,"Hypoxia causes left ventricular dysfunction in the human heart, but the biochemical mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we tested whether short-term normobaric hypoxia leads to changes in cardiac energetics and early cardiac dysfunction. Healthy male volunteers (n=12, age 24 ± 2 yr) were exposed to normobaric hypoxia in a purpose-built hypoxic chamber. The partial pressure of oxygen during end-tidal expiration (P(ET)o₂) was kept between 50 and 60 mmHg, and peripheral oxygen saturation (Sao₂) was kept above 80%. Cardiac morphology and function were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography, both before and after 20 h of hypoxic exposure, and high-energy phosphate metabolism [measured as the phosphocreatine (PCr)/ATP ratio] was measured using ³¹P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. During hypoxia, P(ET)o₂ and Sao₂ averaged 55 ± 1 mmHg and 83.6 ± 0.4%, respectively. Hypoxia caused a 15% reduction in cardiac PCr/ATP (from 2.0 ± 0.1 to 1.7 ± 0.1, P<0.01) and reduced diastolic function (measured as E/E', rising from 6.1 ± 0.4 to 7.5 ± 0.7, P<0.01). Normobaric hypoxia causes a rapid decrease in high-energy phosphate metabolism in the human cardiac left ventricle, which may lead to a decline in diastolic function. These findings are important in understanding the response of normal individuals to environmental hypoxia, and to situations in which disease reduces cardiac oxygen delivery."
https://openalex.org/W1982683136,"Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of connective tissue with prominent skeletal, ocular, and cardiovascular manifestations. Aortic aneurysm and dissection are the major determinants of premature death in untreated patients. In previous work, we showed that extracts of aortic tissues from the mgR mouse model of Marfan syndrome showed increased chemotactic stimulatory activity related to the elastin-binding protein. Aortic samples were collected from 6 patients with Marfan syndrome and 8 with isolated aneurysms of the ascending aorta. Control samples were obtained from 11 organ donors without known vascular or connective tissue diseases. Soluble proteins extracted from the aortic samples of the two patient groups were compared against buffer controls and against the aortic samples from controls with respect to the ability to induce macrophage chemotaxis as measured using a modified Boyden chamber, as well as the reactivity to a monoclonal antibody BA4 against bioactive elastin peptides using ELISA. Samples from Marfan patients displayed a statistically significant increase in chemotactic inductive activity compared to control samples. Additionally, reactivity to BA4 was significantly increased. Similar statistically significant increases were identified for the samples from patients with idiopathic thoracic aortic aneurysm. There was a significant correlation between the chemotactic index and BA4 reactivity, and the increases in chemotactic activity of extracts from Marfan patients could be inhibited by pretreatment with lactose, VGVAPG peptides, or BA4, which indicates the involvement of EBP in mediating the effects. Our results demonstrate that aortic extracts of patients with Marfan syndrome can elicit macrophage chemotaxis, similar to our previous study on aortic extracts of the mgR mouse model of Marfan syndrome (Guo et al., Circulation 2006; 114:1855-62)."
https://openalex.org/W2016832910,"By combining binocular suppression technique and a probe detection paradigm, we investigated attentional bias to invisible stimuli and its gender difference in both high trait anxiety (HTA) and low trait anxiety (LTA) individuals. As an attentional cue, happy or fearful face pictures were presented to HTAs and LTAs for 800 ms either consciously or unconsciously (through binocular suppression). Participants were asked to judge the orientation of a gabor patch following the face pictures. Their performance was used to measure attentional effect induced by the cue. We found gender differences of attentional effect only in the unconscious condition with HTAs. Female HTAs exhibited difficulty in disengaging attention from the location where fearful faces were presented, while male HTAs showed attentional avoidance of it. Our results suggested that the failure to find attentional avoidance of threatening stimuli in many previous studies might be attributed to consciously presented stimuli and data analysis regardless of participants' gender. These findings also contributed to our understanding of gender difference in anxiety disorder."
https://openalex.org/W1974446377,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a set of intracellular pathways in eukaryotes that controls both exogenous and endogenous gene expression. The power of RNAi to knock down (silence) any gene of interest by the introduction of synthetic small-interfering (si)RNAs has afforded powerful insight into biological function through reverse genetic approaches and has borne a new field of gene therapeutics. A number of questions are outstanding concerning the potency of siRNAs, necessitating an understanding of how short double-stranded RNAs are processed by the cell. Recent work suggests unmodified siRNAs are protected in the intracellular environment, although the mechanism of protection still remains unclear. We have developed a set of doubly-fluorophore labeled RNAs (more precisely, RNA/DNA chimeras) to probe in real-time the stability of siRNAs and related molecules by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We find that these RNA probes are substrates for relevant cellular degradative processes, including the RNase H1 mediated degradation of an DNA/RNA hybrid and Dicer-mediated cleavage of a 24-nucleotide (per strand) double-stranded RNA. In addition, we find that 21- and 24-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs are relatively protected in human cytosolic cell extract, but less so in blood serum, whereas an 18-nucleotide double-stranded RNA is less protected in both fluids. These results suggest that RNAi effector RNAs are specifically protected in the cellular environment and may provide an explanation for recent results showing that unmodified siRNAs in cells persist intact for extended periods of time."

While T lymphocytes play an important role in the host response to tumor growth, the mechanism of their trafficking to the tumor remains poorly understood. We show here that T lymphocytes consistently infiltrate the primary brain cancer, medulloblastoma. We demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, that these T lymphocytes are attracted to tumor deposits only after the tumor cells have interacted with tumor vascular endothelium. Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF)” is the key chemokine molecule secreted by tumor cells which induces the tumor vascular endothelial cells to secrete the potent T lymphocyte attractant “Regulated upon Activation, Normal T-cell Expressed, and Secreted (RANTES).” This in turn creates a chemotactic gradient for RANTES-receptor bearing T lymphocytes. Manipulation of this pathway could have important therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W2102854930,"Aquatic species of Utricularia are carnivorous plants living in environments poor in nutrients. Their trapping mechanism has fascinated generations of scientists and is still debated today. It was reported recently that Utricularia traps can fire spontaneously. We show here that these spontaneous firings follow an unexpected diversity of temporal patterns, from ""metronomic"" traps which fire at fixed time intervals to ""random"" patterns, displaying more scattered firing times. Some ""bursting"" traps even combine both aspects, with groups of fast regular firings separated by a variable amount of time. We propose a physical model to understand these very particular behaviors, showing that a trap of Utricularia accomplishes mechanical oscillations, based on continuous pumping and sudden opening of the trap door (buckling). We isolate the key parameters governing these oscillations and discuss the effect of their fluctuations."
https://openalex.org/W2133303802,"Reduced expression of CCR5 on target CD4(+) cells lowers their susceptibility to infection by R5-tropic HIV-1, potentially preventing transmission of infection and delaying disease progression. Binding of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein gp120 with CCR5 is essential for the entry of R5 viruses into target cells. The threshold surface density of gp120-CCR5 complexes that enables HIV-1 entry remains poorly estimated. We constructed a mathematical model that mimics Env-mediated cell-cell fusion assays, where target CD4(+)CCR5(+) cells are exposed to effector cells expressing Env in the presence of a coreceptor antagonist and the fraction of target cells fused with effector cells is measured. Our model employs a reaction network-based approach to describe protein interactions that precede viral entry coupled with the ternary complex model to quantify the allosteric interactions of the coreceptor antagonist and predicts the fraction of target cells fused. By fitting model predictions to published data of cell-cell fusion in the presence of the CCR5 antagonist vicriviroc, we estimated the threshold surface density of gp120-CCR5 complexes for cell-cell fusion as ∼20 µm(-2). Model predictions with this threshold captured data from independent cell-cell fusion assays in the presence of vicriviroc and rapamycin, a drug that modulates CCR5 expression, as well as assays in the presence of maraviroc, another CCR5 antagonist, using sixteen different Env clones derived from transmitted or early founder viruses. Our estimate of the threshold surface density of gp120-CCR5 complexes necessary for HIV-1 entry thus appears robust and may have implications for optimizing treatment with coreceptor antagonists, understanding the non-pathogenic infection of non-human primates, and designing vaccines that suppress the availability of target CD4(+)CCR5(+) cells."
https://openalex.org/W2091492197,"The classic female estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2), has been repeatedly shown to affect the perceptual processing of visual cues. Although gonadal E2 has often been thought to influence these processes, the possibility that central visual processing may be modulated by brain-generated hormone has not been explored. Here we show that estrogen-associated circuits are highly prevalent in the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). Specifically, we cloned aromatase, a marker for estrogen-producing neurons, and the classic estrogen receptors (ERs) ERα and ERβ, as markers for estrogen-responsive neurons, and conducted a detailed expression analysis via in-situ hybridization. We found that both monocular and binocular V1 are highly enriched in aromatase- and ER-positive neurons, indicating that V1 is a site of production and sensitivity to estrogens. Using double-fluorescence in-situ hybridization, we reveal the neurochemical identity of estrogen-producing and -sensitive cells in V1, and demonstrate that they constitute a heterogeneous neuronal population. We further show that visual experience engages a large population of aromatase-positive neurons and, to a lesser extent, ER-expressing neurons, suggesting that E2 levels may be locally regulated by visual input in V1. Interestingly, acute episodes of visual experience do not affect the density or distribution of estrogen-associated circuits. Finally, we show that adult mice dark-reared from birth also exhibit normal distribution of aromatase and ERs throughout V1, suggesting that the implementation and maintenance of estrogen-associated circuits is independent of visual experience. Our findings demonstrate that the adult V1 is a site of production and sensitivity to estrogens, and suggest that locally-produced E2 may shape visual cortical processing."
https://openalex.org/W2156406749,"The Wnt pathway is a pivotal signaling cascade in colorectal carcinogenesis. The purpose of this work is to determine whether depletion of folate and other metabolically related B vitamins induces in vivo activation of intestinal Wnt signaling and whether this occurs in parallel with increased tumorigenesis. A hybrid mouse was created by crossing a Wnt-reporter animal (BAT-LacZ) with a model of colorectal cancer (Apc1638N). A mild depletion of folate and vitamins B₂, B₆, and B₁₂ was induced over 16 wk, and the control animals in each instance were pair fed a diet containing the basal requirement of these nutrients. The multiplicity of macroscopic tumors and aberrant crypt foci both increased by ~50% in the hybrid mice fed the depletion diet (P<0.05). A 4-fold elevation in Wnt signaling was produced by the depletion diet (P<0.05) and was accompanied by significant changes in the expression of a number of Wnt-related genes in a pattern consistent with its activation. Proliferation and apoptosis of the colonic mucosa both changed in a protransformational direction (P<0.05). In summary, mild depletion of multiple B vitamins produces in vivo activation of colonic Wnt signaling, implicating it as a key pathway by which B-vitamin inadequacies enhance intestinal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2030951903,"After infection, extralymphoid tissues are enriched with effector and memory T cells of a highly activated phenotype. The capacity for rapid effector cytokine response from extralymphoid tissue-memory T cells suggests these cells may perform a 'sentinel' function in the tissue. While it has been demonstrated that extralymphoid CD4+ T cells can directly respond to secondary infection, little is known about how rapidly this response is initiated, and how early activation of T cells in the tissue may affect the innate response to infection. Here we use a mouse model of secondary heterosubtypic influenza infection to show that CD4(+) T cells in the lung airways are reactivated within 24 hours of secondary challenge. Airway CD4(+) T cells initiate an inflammatory cytokine and chemokine program that both alters the composition of the early innate response and contributes to the reduction of viral titers in the lung. These results show that, unlike a primary infection, extralymphoid tissue-memory CD4(+) T cells respond alongside the innate response during secondary infection, thereby shaping the overall immune profile in the airways. These data provide new insights into the role of extralymphoid CD4(+) T cells during secondary immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1989845752,"The human apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (hASBT, SLC10A2) plays a critical role in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, as well as in cholesterol homeostasis. ASBT reclaims bile acids from the distal ileum via active sodium co-transport, in a multistep process, orchestrated by key residues in exofacial loop regions, as well as in membrane-spanning helices. Here, we unravel the functional contribution of highly conserved transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) on the hASBT transport cycle. Consecutive cysteine substitution of individual residues along the TM1 helix (Ile(29)-Gly(50)), as well as exofacial Asn(27) and Asn(28), resulted in functional impairment of ∼70% of mutants, despite appreciable cell surface expression for all but G50C. Cell surface expression of G50C and G50A was rescued upon MG132 treatment as well as cyclosporine A, but not by FK506 or bile acids, suggesting that Gly(50) is involved in hASBT folding. TM1 accessibility to membrane-impermeant MTSET remains confined to the exofacial half of the helix along a single, discrete face. Substrate protection from MTSET labeling was temperature-dependent for L34C, T36C, and L38C, consistent with conformational changes playing a role in solvent accessibility for these mutants. Residue Leu(30) was shown to be critical for both bile acid and sodium affinity, while Asn(27), Leu(38), Thr(39), and Met(46) participate in sodium co-transport. Combined, our data demonstrate that TM1 plays a pivotal role in ASBT function and stability, thereby providing further insight in its dynamic transport mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2060482717,"Receptor down-regulation is the most prominent regulatory system of EGF receptor (EGFR) signal attenuation and a critical target for therapy against colon cancer, which is highly dependent on the function of the EGFR. In this study, we investigated the effect of ultraviolet-C (UV-C) on down-regulation of EGFR in human colon cancer cells (SW480, HT29, and DLD-1). UV-C caused inhibition of cell survival and proliferation, concurrently inducing the decrease in cell surface EGFR and subsequently its degradation. UV-C, as well as EGFR kinase inhibitors, decreased the expression level of cyclin D1 and the phosphorylated level of retinoblastoma, indicating that EGFR down-regulation is correlated to cell cycle arrest. Although UV-C caused a marked phosphorylation of EGFR at Ser-1046/1047, UV-C also induced activation of p38 MAPK, a stress-inducible kinase believed to negatively regulate tumorigenesis, and the inhibition of p38 MAPK canceled EGFR phosphorylation at Ser-1046/1047, as well as subsequent internalization and degradation, suggesting that p38 MAPK mediates EGFR down-regulation by UV-C. In addition, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by UV-C was mediated through transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1. Moreover, pretreatment of the cells with UV-C suppressed EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine residues in addition to cell survival signal, Akt. Together, these results suggest that UV-C irradiation induces the removal of EGFRs from the cell surface that can protect colon cancer cells from oncogenic stimulation of EGF, resulting in cell cycle arrest.

There are several mechanisms by which EGFR becomes oncogenic including: 1) increased EGFR expression levels, 2) autocrine and/or paracrine growth factor loops, 3) heterodimerization with other EGFR family members and cross-talk with heterologous receptor systems, 4) defective receptor down-regulation, and 5) activating mutations (12Arteaga C.L.

Thus, some receptors can be recycled back to the cell surface via early endosomes, and others are targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes for proteolytic degradation.

By contrast, it has previously been reported that the other factors or agents, such as oxidative stress (19Khan E.M. Heidinger J.M. Levy M. Lisanti M.P. Ravid T. Goldkorn T. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7381-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), can induce internalization of the EGFR but not degradation. They differ in their effects on the fate of the receptors, downstream signaling, and cell proliferation.Receptor down-regulation is the most prominent regulatory system of EGFR signal attenuation and involves the internalization and subsequent degradation of the activated receptor in the lysosomes. With the current knowledge of the mechanism underlying EGFR down-regulation, this molecular event involves several important phosphorylation sites in EGFR. One is the phosphorylation at Tyr-1045, which provides a docking site for the ubiquitin ligase c-Cbl resulting in ubiquitination of the EGFR (10Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

The others are the phosphorylation at serine or threonine residues that is thought to represent a mechanism for attenuation of the receptor tyrosine kinase activity (21Countaway J.L. McQuilkin P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 16620-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the major sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation of the EGFR, it has previously been shown that the Ser-1046/7 phosphorylation site is required for EGFR desensitization in EGF-treated cells (23Theroux S.J. Latour D.A. Stanley K. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16620-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant EGFR at Ser-1046/7 reportedly causes the inhibition of the EGF-induced endocytosis and down-regulation of cell surface receptors (22Countaway J.L. Nairn A.C. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have recently reported that phosphorylation of EGFR at serine 1046/7 via activation of p38 MAPK plays a pivotal role in down-regulation of EGFR induced by (−)-epigallocatechin gallate (24Adachi S. Shimizu M. Shirakami Y. Yamauchi J. Natsume H. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. To S. Weinstein I.B. Moriwaki H. Kozawa O. Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), anisomycin (25Adachi S. Natsume H. Yamauchi J. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Joe A.K. Moriwaki H. Kozawa O. Cancer Lett. 2009; 277: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and HSP90 inhibitor (26Adachi S. Yasuda I. Nakashima M. Yamauchi T. Yamauchi J. Natsume H. Moriwaki H. Kozawa O. Oncol. Rep. 2010; 23: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is an evidence that cisplatin also induces EGFR internalization, which is mediated by p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of the receptor at threonine 669 (20Winograd-Katz S.E. Levitzki A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7381-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Also, it has been shown that gemcitabine induces EGFR internalization and subsequent degradation, which may be a novel mechanism for gemcitabine-mediated cell death (5Feng F.Y. Varambally S. Tomlins S.A. Chun P.Y. Lopez C.A. Li X. Davis M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Lawrence T.S. Nyati M.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3431-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of p38 MAPK is necessary for gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity (27Habiro A. Tanno S. Koizumi K. Izawa T. Nakano Y. Osanai M. Mizukami Y. Okumura T. Kohgo Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Koizumi K. Tanno S. Nakano Y. Habiro A. Izawa T. Mizukami Y. Okumura T. Kohgo Y. Anticancer Res. 2005; 25: 3347-3353PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, serine phosphorylation of EGFR via p38 MAPK might be considered a new therapeutic target especially to counter cancer cells of the colon, lung, pancreas, and breast that highly express EGFR.UV radiation from sunlight is sorted by wavelength regions: long wavelength UV-A (320–400 nm), medium wavelength UV-B (280–320 nm), and short wavelength UV-C (200–280 nm). In general, UV-A and UV-B are recognized the major carcinogenic components of sunlight (29Latonen L. Laiho M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1755: 71-89PubMed Google Scholar). As for UV-C, it is used for studying DNA damage and cellular DNA repair process, although it does not actually exist in earth's surface because they are filtered out by the atmosphere. Although UV-C has been commonly applied for equipment such as water sterilization, recent studies show the possible application of UV-C against human cancer (30Zwang Y. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4195-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, its exact mechanism has not been fully clarified.We have recently reported that the blockade of EGF stimulation significantly suppressed SW480 cell growth, suggesting that EGFR pathway plays an important role in proliferation of colon cancer cells (31Nakashima M. Adachi S. Yasuda I. Yamauchi T. Kozawa O. Moriwaki H. Int. J. Oncol. 2010; 36: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we herein investigated the effect of UV-C on the down-regulation of EGFR in these cells and found that this induces the internalization and degradation of EGFR that indicates the removal of EGFR from cell membrane, and this action of UV-C can protect colon cancer cells from oncogenic stimulation such as EGF, resulting in cell cycle arrest.DISCUSSIONWhereas UV irradiation reportedly has many effects on skin, including inflammation, immunosuppression, and alterations in the extracellular matrix, in addition to accelerated skin aging (51Norval M. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. 2001; 63: 28-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), in the present study we demonstrated that UV-C has a potent anti-cancer effect by decreasing EGFR protein level in colon cancer cells. First, we showed that UV-C caused anti-survival and proliferative effects on SW480, HT29, and DLD-1 cells (Fig. 1). Because EGFR activation has been shown to be oncogenic (9Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), and we here showed that colon cancer cell proliferation depended on EGFR signaling (Fig. 1, C–E), we examined the effect of UV-C on the EGFR signaling and found that UV-C induced internalization and subsequent down-regulation of the EGFR and also decreased the protein level of cyclin D1 and phospho-Rb (Fig. 2), suggesting that the anti-cancer effect of UV-C could be due to cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells.In addition, we showed in Fig. 3 that UV-C caused a marked phosphorylation of EGFR at Ser-1046/7; however, UV-C failed to induce phosphorylation at Tyr-1045, the major c-Cbl binding site, as well as Tyr-1068, the Grb2 adaptor protein-binding site (8Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnik E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar), in contrast to the prominent phosphorylation induced by EGF as we have previously shown (25Adachi S. Natsume H. Yamauchi J. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. Joe A.K. Moriwaki H. Kozawa O. Cancer Lett. 2009; 277: 108-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, although UV-C caused activation of p44/p42 MAPK, p38 MAPK, or SAPK/JNK (Fig. 4A), we observed that the inhibition of p38 MAPK suppressed EGFR internalization (Fig. 4, B and C). In addition, p38 MAPK was involved in phosphorylation at Ser-1046/7 (Fig. 4, D–F) and subsequent degradation (Fig. 6) of the EGFR induced by UV-C. Moreover, UV-C-induced activation of p38 MAPK was mediated through TAK-1 (Fig. 5). We also examined the effect of UV-C on apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, a MAPK kinase kinase, because apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 is activated in response to a variety of stress-related stimuli and activates MKK3, which in turn activate p38 MAPK (52Matsuzawa A. Ichijo H. J. Biochem. 2001; 130: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, UV-C had no appreciable effect on phosphorylation of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 at Ser-967 and Thr-845 (data not shown). Furthermore, we found in colon cancer cells that pretreatment with UV-C before EGF stimulation significantly suppressed the phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine residues and Akt (Fig. 7), indicating that UV-C can evade cells from oncogenic stimulation of EGF. In addition, as shown in Fig. 8, it seems unlikely that DNA damage is involved in UV-C-induced EGFR down-regulation via p38 MAPK. However, our present findings do not evaluate and cannot completely eliminate the possibility that DNA damage plays a role in UV-C-induced cell cycle arrest.Whereas we have recently reported that the blockade of EGF stimulation significantly suppressed cell growth (31Nakashima M. Adachi S. Yasuda I. Yamauchi T. Kozawa O. Moriwaki H. Int. J. Oncol. 2010; 36: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar), we herein demonstrated that proliferation of colon cancer cells depended on the EGFR kinase activity, thus suggesting that the desensitization of EGFR signaling is a promising target against human colon cancer. In addition, an early work showed that exposure to UV light induced clustering and internalization of cell surface EGFR, and inhibition of clustering or receptor down-regulation attenuates UV responses (53Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), which is consistent with our present findings that internalization and subsequent degradation of EGFR induced by UV-C leads to cell cycle arrest of colon cancer cells by causing its phosphorylation at serine residues via p38 MAPK. Because it is generally understood that tyrosine phosphorylation results in cancer cell proliferation (9Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), these results also suggest the potential availability of UV-C for human colon cancer therapy because UV-C can cause EGFR down-regulation without oncogenic activation (Fig. 3). Moreover, Zwang and Yarden (30Zwang Y. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4195-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) previously reported that abrogating EGFR internalization reduces the efficacy of chemotherapy-induced cell death and EGFR internalization enhances the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin by preventing EGFR-mediated survival signaling, which may underlie interactions between chemotherapy and EGFR-targeting drugs. Therefore, our findings also provide the possibility of a new combination of conventional chemotherapy and UV-C for human colon cancer.Our present study combined with previous findings is summarized in Fig. 9 as follows; when the cells are exposed to EGF stimulation, EGFR undergoes dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation that directs the cells into cell proliferation (9Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Subsequently, c-Cbl, a ubiquitin ligase, can bind to EGFR and cause ubiquitination and degradation of the EGFR (10Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar, 54Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). By contrast, UV-C has little effect on EGFR phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, indicating that adequate dose of UV-C fails to exert the cell growth signals. However, UV-C induced serial phosphorylation of TAK1, MKK3/6, and p38 MAPK and subsequent phosphorylation of EGFR at Ser-1046/7. With time, EGFR molecules are internalized and eventually degraded. Therefore, pretreatment of the cells with UV-C can protect colon cancer cells from oncogenic stimulation such as EGF.We have previously reported that (−)-epigallocatechin gallate, as well as HSP90 inhibitors, causes down-regulation of the EGFR via phosphorylation at Ser-1046/7 through p38 MAPK in human cancer cells (24Adachi S. Shimizu M. Shirakami Y. Yamauchi J. Natsume H. Matsushima-Nishiwaki R. To S. Weinstein I.B. Moriwaki H. Kozawa O.

Rep. 2010; 23: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Additionally, accumulating evidence shows that activation of p38 MAPK has an inhibitory effect on tumorigenesis (55Lavoie J.N. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Müller R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20608-20616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 56Kennedy N.J. Cellurale C. Davis R.J. Cancer Cell. 2007; 11: 101-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that a variety of agents, such as gemcitabine (5Feng F.Y. Varambally S. Tomlins S.A. Chun P.Y. Lopez C.A. Li X. Davis M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Lawrence T.S. Nyati M.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3431-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and cisplatin (20Winograd-Katz S.E. Levitzki A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 7381-7390Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), can also induce activation of p38 MAPK and internalization of EGFR into endosomal vesicles. Moreover, it has previously been reported that the Ser-1046/7 phosphorylation sites act to suppress the oncogenic signal transduction by the wild-type EGFR (21Countaway J.L. McQuilkin P. Gironès N. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3407-3416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Theroux S.J. Latour D.A. Stanley K. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16620-16626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, our present findings might provide a new therapeutic strategy for human colon cancer, although further investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanism underlying EGFR down-regulation via its phosphorylation at serine residues.Regarding our concern of how these findings would be translated into the clinic, the current limitation of the present study is the lack of practical tools to deliver UV-C irradiation onto the colon cancer tissue in the human body. Our hypothetical approaches would include a combination of extracorporeal generator and fiberscopic transmission of UV-C through colon endoscope or possible expansion of light emitting diode technique to exert shorter wavelength UV-C than with the currently available UV-A light emitting diode. However, substantial technical advances and some related time would be essentially required before practical application of UV-C for colon cancer management. Moreover, further studies are required to determine whether these effects of UV-C safely occur in vivo.In summary, we found that UV-C induces EGFR down-regulation via p38 MAPK-mediated EGFR phosphorylation at Ser-1046/7. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that UV-C irradiation induces the removal of EGFR from cell surfaces that can evade colon cancer cells from oncogenic stimulation of EGF, resulting in cell cycle arrest in colon cancer cells.

It is well known that exposure of cells to EGF results in rapid autophosphorylation of EGFR molecules at the cell surface (7Meisenhelder J. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. Hunter T.

Andersen P. Stockhausen M.T. Poulsen H.S. Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 2013-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). There are several mechanisms by which EGFR becomes oncogenic including: 1) increased EGFR expression levels, 2) autocrine and/or paracrine growth factor loops, 3) heterodimerization with other EGFR family members and cross-talk with heterologous receptor systems, 4) defective receptor down-regulation, and 5) activating mutations (12Arteaga C.L. Oncologist. 2002; 7: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In clinical trials, increasing evidence shows the efficacy of EGFR-targeted agents, including monoclonal antibodies on the one hand and tyrosine kinase inhibitors on the other (13Milano G. Spano J.P. Leyland-Jones B. Br. J. Cancer. 2008; 99: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Following activation, the ligand-receptor complexes are internalized and then enter endosomes, where the receptors and their ligands are sorted to various intracellular destinations (14Massie C. Mills I.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, some receptors can be recycled back to the cell surface via early endosomes, and others are targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes for proteolytic degradation. There is increasing evidence that not only does receptor internalization act to terminate signaling, but that internalized endosome-associated receptors are also able to stimulate specific signal transduction pathways (15Wiley H.S. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Di Fiore P.P. De Camilli P.

Some agents that induce ligand-independent internalization and degradation of EGFR, such as the 225 mouse antibody (18Jaramillo M.L. Leon Z. Grothe S. Paul-Roc B. Abulrob A. O'Connor McCourt M. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and gemcitabine (5Feng F.Y. Varambally S. Tomlins S.A. Chun P.Y. Lopez C.A. Li X. Davis M.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Lawrence T.S. Nyati M.K. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 3431-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), could have promising potential for cancer therapies. By contrast, it has previously been reported that the other factors or agents, such as oxidative stress (19Khan E.M. Heidinger J.M. Levy M. Lisanti M.P. Ravid T. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 14486-14493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and cisplatin (20Winograd-Katz S.E. Levitzki A.

The LC4 region in CCR5 is required for HIV-1 entry into the cells. In this study, the solution structure of LC4 in SDS micelles was elucidated by using standard 1H two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and fluorescence quenching. The LC4 structure adopts two helical structures, whereas the C-terminal part remains unstructured. The positions in which LC4 binds to the HIV-1 inhibitory peptide LC5 were determined by docking calculations in addition to NMR data. The poses showed the importance of the hydrophobic interface of the assembled structures. The solution structure of LC4 elucidated in the present work provides a structural basis for further studies on the HIV-1 inhibitory function of the LC4 region."
https://openalex.org/W2019061927,"Ionisation equilibria in proteins are influenced by conformational flexibility, which can in principle be accounted for by molecular dynamics simulation. One problem in this method is the bias arising from the fixed protonation state during the simulation. Its effect is mostly exhibited when the ionisation behaviour of the titratable groups is extrapolated to pH regions where the predetermined protonation state of the protein may not be statistically relevant, leading to conformational sampling that is not representative of the true state. In this work we consider a simple approach which can essentially reduce this problem. Three molecular dynamics structure sets are generated, each with a different protonation state of the protein molecule expected to be relevant at three pH regions, and pK calculations from the three sets are combined to predict pK over the entire pH range of interest. This multiple pH molecular dynamics approach was tested on the GCN4 leucine zipper, a protein for which a full data set of experimental data is available. The pK values were predicted with a mean deviation from the experimental data of 0.29 pH units, and with a precision of 0.13 pH units, evaluated on the basis of equivalent sites in the dimeric GCN4 leucine zipper."
https://openalex.org/W2035764740,"The assembly of four pore-forming α-subunits into tetramers is a prerequisite for the formation of functional K(+) channels. A short carboxyl assembly domain (CAD) in the distal end of the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus has been implicated in the assembly of Eag α-subunits, a subfamily of the ether-à-go-go K(+) channel family. The precise role of CAD in the formation of Eag tetrameric channels, however, remains unclear. Moreover, it has not been determined whether other protein regions also contribute to the assembly of Eag subunits. We addressed these questions by studying the biophysical properties of a series of different rat Eag1 (rEag1) truncation mutants. Two truncation mutants without CAD (K848X and W823X) yielded functional phenotypes similar to those for wild-type (WT) rEag1 channels. Furthermore, nonfunctional rEag1 truncation mutants lacking the distal region of the carboxyl terminus displayed substantial dominant-negative effects on the functional expression of WT as well as K848X and W823X channels. Our co-immunoprecipitation studies further revealed that truncation mutants containing no CAD indeed displayed significant association with rEag1-WT subunits. Finally, surface biotinylation and protein glycosylation analyses demonstrated that progressive truncations of the carboxyl terminus resulted in aggravating disruptions of membrane trafficking and glycosylation of rEag1 proteins. Overall, our data suggest that the distal carboxyl terminus, including CAD, is dispensable for the assembly of rEag1 K(+) channels but may instead be essential for ensuring proper protein biosynthesis. We propose that the S6 segment and the proximal carboxyl terminus may constitute the principal subunit recognition site for the assembly of rEag1 channels."
https://openalex.org/W1981641765,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiovascular and renal activities of a newly designed natriuretic peptide (NP). Here, we engineered a novel 28-amino acid chimeric peptide, termed AC-NP that combined the 17-amino acid ring of C type natriuretic peptide (CNP) with the 6-amino acid N-terminus and 5-amino acid C-terminus of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to determine the actions of AC-NP. In normal rats, AC-NP proved to be more potentially diuretic, natriuretic and hypotensive compared with other NPs, such as ANP, CNP and vasonatrin peptide (VNP), which is another man-made NP. In relaxation of isolated abdominal aorta from rat, AC-NP was equally effective to ANP, CNP and VNP. Elevated levels of 3',5'-guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in plasma and urine cGMP excretion indicated the participation of cGMP in the functions of AC-NP.

The effects of maternal asthma during pregnancy on the adrenal medulla of offspring remain unknown.This study aims to explore the influence of maternal asthma during pregnancy on the development and function of adrenal medulla in offspring from postnatal day 3 (P3) to postnatal day 60 (P60). Asthmatic pregnant rats (AP), nerve growth factor (NGF)-treated pregnant rats (NP) and NGF antibody-treated pregnant rats (ANP) were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA); NP and ANP were treated with NGF and NGF antibody respectively. Offspring rats from the maternal group were divided into four groups: offspring from control pregnant rats (OCP), offspring from AP (OAP), offspring from NP (ONP), and offspring from ANP (OANP). The expressions of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) protein in adrenal medulla were analyzed. The concentrations of epinephrine (EPI), corticosterone and NGF in serum were measured. Adrenal medulla chromaffin cells (AMCC) were prone to differentiate into sympathetic nerve cells in OAP and ONP. Both EPI and PNMT were decreased in OAP from P3 to P14, and then reached normal level gradually from P30 to P60, which were lower from birth to adulthood in ONP. Corticosterone concentration increased significantly in OAP and ONP.Asthma pregnancy may promote AMCC to differentiate into sympathetic neurons in offspring rats and inhibit the synthesis of EPI, resulting in dysfunction of bronchial relaxation."

This signaling cascade is characterized by a sequence of two currents: a cation current through cyclic nucleotide-gated channels followed by a chloride current through calcium-activated chloride channels. To date, it is not possible to interfere with these generator channels under physiological conditions with potent and specific blockers. In this study we identified the styryl dye FM1-43 as a potent blocker of native olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. Furthermore, we characterized this substance to stain olfactory receptor neurons that are endowed with cAMP-dependent transduction. This allows optical differentiation and pharmacological interference with olfactory receptor neurons at the level of the signal transduction.

https://openalex.org/W2028128652,"Background Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) constitute an essential enzyme super-family, providing fidelity of the translation process of mRNA to proteins in living cells. They are common to all kingdoms and are of utmost importance to all organisms. It is thus of great interest to understand the evolutionary relationships among them and underline signature motifs defining their common domains. Results We utilized the Common Peptides (CPs) framework, based on extracted deterministic motifs from all aaRSs, to study family-specific properties. We identified novel aaRS–class related signatures that may supplement the current classification methods and provide a basis for identifying functional regions specific to each aaRS class. We exploited the space spanned by the CPs in order to identify similarities between aaRS families that are not observed using sequence alignment methods, identifying different inter-aaRS associations across different kingdom of life. We explored the evolutionary history of the aaRS families and evolutionary origins of the mitochondrial aaRSs. Lastly, we showed that prevalent CPs significantly overlap known catalytic and binding sites, suggesting that they have meaningful functional roles, as well as identifying a motif shared between aaRSs and a the Biotin-[acetyl-CoA carboxylase] synthetase (birA) enzyme overlapping binding sites in both families. Conclusions The study presents the multitude of ways to exploit the CP framework in order to extract meaningful patterns from the aaRS super-family. Specific CPs, discovered in this study, may play important roles in the functionality of these enzymes. We explored the evolutionary patterns in each aaRS family and tracked remote evolutionary links between these families."
