https://openalex.org/W1615699600,"A mechanism exists whereby global greenhouse warning could, by intensifying the alongshore wind stress on the ocean surface, lead to acceleration of coastal upwelling. Evidence from several different regions suggests that the major coastal upwelling systems of the world have been growing in upwelling intensity as greenhouse gases have accumulated in the earth's atmosphere. Thus the cool foggy summer conditions that typify the coastlands of northern California and other similar upwelling regions might, under global warming, become even more pronounced. Effects of enhanced upwelling on the marine ecosystem are uncertain but potentially dramatic."
https://openalex.org/W1974945967,"Simulations from a global climate model with and without orography have been used to investigate the role of mountains in maintaining extensive arid climates in middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Dry climates similar to those observed were simulated over central Asia and western interior North America in the experiment with mountains, whereas relatively moist climates were simulated in these areas in the absence of orography. The experiments suggest that these interior regions are dry because general subsidence and relatively infrequent storm development occur upstream of orographically induced stationary wave troughs. Downstream of these troughs, precipitation-bearing storms develop frequently in association with strong jet streams. In contrast, both atmospheric circulation and precipitation were more zonally symmetric in the experiment without mountains. In addition, orography reduces the moisture transport into the continental interiors from nearby oceanic sources. The relative soil wetness of these regions in the experiment without mountains is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence of less aridity during the late Tertiary, before substantial uplift of the Rocky Mountains and Tibetan Plateau is believed to have occurred."

https://openalex.org/W2033402457,"Measurements of the complete angular distribution of Auger electrons emitted from well-defined platinum[111] single-crystal surfaces have led to the discovery that the distributions are composed of ""silhouettes"" of surface atoms ""back lit"" by emission from atoms deeper in the solid. Theoretical simulations of Auger electron angular distributions based upon atomic point emitters and spherical atomic scatterers of uniform cross section are in close agreement with these experimental results, but opposite to previous theoretical predictions. In view of the definitive results obtained and the straightforward agreement between theory and experiment, angular distribution Auger microscopy (ADAM) is useful for direct imaging of interfacial structure and investigation of electron-solid interactions in the physical and biological sciences and engineering. Applicability of ADAM is illustrated by images obtained for monolayers of silver and iodine on platinum[111]."
https://openalex.org/W2037364246,"Archaeopteryx is almost universally considered a primitive bird. Debate persists, however, about the taxonomic assignment of the six skeletal fossils. Allometric scaling of osteological data shows that all specimens are consistent with a single growth series. The absence of certain bone fusions suggests that no specimen is full-grown. Allometric patterns, as compared to growth gradients of other dinosaurs, extant ectotherms, and extant endotherms, suggest that Archaeopteryx was likely a homeothermic endotherm with rapid growth and precocial abilities for running and flying. Multivariate allometric models offer a significant potential for interpreting ontogenetic patterns and phylogenetic trends in the fossil record."
https://openalex.org/W2044988174,"Coesite has been identified by x-ray diffraction and electron microprobe chemical analysis as a constituent of inclusions in Muong Nong type tektites from Phaeng Dang, Thailand. The fine coesite grains are mixed with coarse quartz in the core of the inclusions, and the core is surrounded by frothy lechatelierite. The mixture of SiO(2) phases indicates that these tektites have been quenched from high temperatures and that modifications in texture and chemical composition from the original parent material have been minimal."
https://openalex.org/W2036828455,"All magnetites are oxidized topotactically with formation of solid solution at temperatures below 400 degrees C. The oxidation of hematite-free magnetites proceeds to gammaFe(2)O(3), whereas in the presence of hematite epitaxial growth of alphaFe(2)O(3) takes place, with excess iron ions being returned to the solid solution. A method for synthesizing maghemite from natural magnetites is indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2064206372,"Methanol fuel use in motor vehicles and stationary combustion has the potential to improve air quality. A modeling study of methanol fuel use in Los Angeles, California, shows that the low chemical reactivity of methanol vapor slows ozone formation and would lead to lower ozone concentrations. Predicted peak ozone levels decreased up to 16 percent, and exposure to levels above the federal standard dropped by up to 22 percent, when pure (M100) methanol fuel use was simulated for the year 2000. Similar results were obtained for 2010. Use of a gasoline-methanol blend (M85) resulted in smaller reductions. Predicted formaldehyde levels and exposure were not increased severely, and in some cases declined, in the simulations of methanol use."
https://openalex.org/W2035742835,"Ideas about quantized energy levels originated in atomic physics, but research in superconductivity has led to unparalleled precision in the measurement of energy levels. A comparison of levels produced by two Josephson junctions shows that they differ by no more than 3 parts in 10(19) at an energy of 0.0003 electron volt. The fact that the myriad of interactions of 10(12) particles in a macroscopic body, a Josephson junction, can produce sharply defined energy levels suggests a dynamical state effectively divorced from the complexities of its environment. The existence of this state, the macroscopic quantum state of superconductors, is well established, but its isolation from intrinsic perturbations has recently been shown to be extraordinary. These new results, with an improved precision of about ten orders of magnitude, are discussed in the context of highly accurate results from quantum electrodynamics, atomic spectroscopy, and the standards of metrology. Further refinements in precision may be achievable at higher energy levels, about 12 electron volts, as they become available from a new series array of 18,992 Josephson junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2094473411,Data on vegetation types in six 900-m(2) plots in the Midwest reveal that the species-area curves are not logarithmic but more nearly approach an exponential equation of the form y = kx(2) for areas less than 100 m(2). For larger areas the curve appears to be sigmoid.

https://openalex.org/W1992586620,"A convenient means of producing hydrogen gas for anaerobe jars or other situations where 2 liters of hydrogen will suffice is described. Hydrogen gas is produced by the chemical action of magnesium metal, zinc chloride, sodium chloride, and water within a unique plastic and aluminum foil envelope. That there is no excessive buildup of hydrogen greatly reduces the hazard of explosion. The gas-producing units are simple to activate and may be discarded after use."

https://openalex.org/W2018040089,"The brief period between the conception of the interplanetary magnetic field and conclusive proof of its existence has been an exciting one. Imaginative theoretical developments and careful experimental verification have both been essential to rapid progress. From the various lines of evidence described here it is clear that an interplanetary magnetic field is always present, drawn out from the sun by the radially streaming solar wind. The field is stretched into a spiral pattern by the sun's rotation. The field appears to consist of relatively narrow filaments, the fields of adjacent filaments having opposite directions. At the earth's orbit the field points slightly below the ecliptic plane. The magnitude of the field is steady and near 5 gammas in quiet times, but it may rise to higher values at times of higher solar activity. A collision-free shock front is formed in the plasma flow around the earth. In the transition region between the shock front and the magnetopause the magnitude of the field is somewhat higher than it is in the interplanetary region, and large fluctuations in magnitude and direction are common. A shock front has also been observed in space between a slowly moving body of plasma and a faster, overtaking plasma stream."
https://openalex.org/W2083995350,"A Pacific bottlenose porpoise, Tursiops gilli, was trained for a period of 10 weeks to swim at high speed on command and return to an underwater speaker when a specific sound cue was played. This animal was released in the open sea off Oahu, Hawaii, and worked each day for 7 days. At night it was held in an anchored floating pen. The trainer's control over the animal was probably associated with the controlled feeding of the porpoise, the development of social ties between the porpoise and trainer, and the animal's fear of unknown situations."
https://openalex.org/W2057530230,"A reversible inhibition of phototaxis by acetic acid is demonstrated in Chlamydomonas snowiae. The inhibition is dependent on the pH of the medium and on the concentration of the inhibitor and does not act by affecting motility. Some substances closely related to fatty acids are also shown to be inhibitors of phototaxis, while certain metabolites have no effect. The possible mechanism by which the phototactic response is prevented is discussed."
