https://openalex.org/W2013088572,"Three days of training consisting of trials of light paired with rotation produces a long-term modification of photopositive behavior in Hermissenda crassicornis. The behavioral modification depends on the temporal association of light and rotation. For animals that received light paired with rotation, significant increases in the spontaneous activity of type B photoreceptors were correlated with changes in photopositive behavior after training. A persistent tonic depolarization of type B photoreceptors can explain the cellular changes correlated with the long-term behavioral modification produced by the temporal association of light and rotation."

These substances stimulate feeding by Acalymma vittata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and inhibit feeding by Epilacha tredecimnotata (Coleoptera: Coccinelidae). Under natural conditions, Epilachna cuts a circular trench in the leaf before feeding on the encircled leaf material, thus preventing mobilization of the deterrent substances to the feeding area."
https://openalex.org/W2092005716,"Chemical evidence is presented with previously reported morphological features for banded-tube cell types in the earliest known plant fossils associated with stream-deposited sediments. Phenolic aldehydes (p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillin) and aromatic compounds from pyrolysis (2-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, methylsyringaldehyde) derived from cellular remains are interpreted as evidence for lignin or lignin-like degradation products. The presence of parallel-aligned banded tubes, with annular to spiral thickenings and occasional end walls, in conjunction with lignin-like constituents fulfill most of the morphological and chemical criteria for cell types that could have functioned as water-conducting cells."
https://openalex.org/W2029988835,"Floral biology, pollen germination, and scanning electron microscopy studies have indicated different types of pollen within the same flower in at least two species of New World Lecythidaceae, subfamily Lecythidoideae. Two types of pollen are produced in different parts of the androecium and serve different functions. One type attracts pollinators by providing a reward, and the other functions in fertilization. The former type has lost its ability to germinate, at least under in vitro conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2014810061,"Distribution patterns of isopentane and normal pentane in marine sediments show a reversal in slope at a subsurface temperature of about 90 degrees C. The data indicate that three types of reactions are involved in pentane formation: (i) biological origin at the sediment surface, (ii) low-temperature (< 90 degrees C) chemical reactions yielding predominately secondary carbon structures, and (iii) high-temperature (> 90 degrees C) cracking reactions at great depth yielding predominately straight carbon chains."

Continued advances in the development of graphics algorithms are improving the quality and usefulness of this interface. Decreasing hardware costs have enabled an expansion of graphics into more diverse applications."

https://openalex.org/W2041559634,"Enormous progress in electronic technology is accelerating the use of computers in everyday life. In this article trends in hardware, input-output technology, computer architecture, software, communications, and artificial intelligence are examined and complexity is identified as a limitation to further progress. Promising directions of research, which may extend the range of computer applications, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W4242612885,"Two principal themes are observed in software development, both aimed at improving the productivity of developing and maintaining new applications. The first is to provide increasingly rich system programming function in order to handle the details of managing hardware resources. The second is to provide application development facilities with logical structures and building blocks more closely aligned with the logic of the application itself. An additional challenge is to provide these in a way that will allow continued enhancement of existing software."

In supporting 849 projects in 100 countries, it has earned an enviable international reputation and has been used as a model for other aid agencies. Now entering its tenth year, IDRC is reaffirming its policies of responsiveness to the stated needs of developing countries and of strengthening their scientific and technological capabilities. It also seeks to encourage the application of Canadian R & D expertise to the solution of Third World problems."

https://openalex.org/W2073113418,"Independent computer models by A. Rasmussen of the U.S. Geological Survey and R. Bindschadler (N.A.S.A.) indicate that the Columbia Glacier, which fronts a fjord adjoining the Valdez shipping channel, will undergo a rapid retreat in 1982-85, which will result in calving of icebergs at rates up to 8-11 cubic km/year. The snout of the glacier is now on a shoal at 75 meter depth and backing slowly into deeper water; the models, which are based on field studies of the Columbia Glacier since 1977 and of calving glaciers in general, show that the rate of calving is proportional to the depth of water at the snout. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, it may be necessary to prohibit tanker traffic into Valdez during periods of maxmium calving. Storage facilities at Valdez can hold eight days worth of oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline at the current rate of 1.6 million bbl/day, and the pipeline could be shut down for two days without causing problems on the North Slope."
